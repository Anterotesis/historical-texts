            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Secretary of the Treaſury, in obedience to the reſolution of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, of the twenty-firſt day of September laſt, has, during the receſs of Congreſs, applied himſelf to the conſideration of a proper plan for the ſupport of the Public Credit, with all the attention which was due to the authority of the Houſe, and to the magnitude of the object.</p>
            <p>In the diſcharge of this duty, he has felt, in no ſmall degree, the anxieties which naturally flow from a juſt eſtimate of the difficulty of the taſk, from a well-founded diffidence of his own qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for executing it with ſucceſs, and from a deep and ſolemn conviction of the momentous nature of the truth contained in the reſolution under which his inveſtigations have been conducted, "That an <hi>adequate</hi> proviſion for the ſupport of the Public Credit, is a matter of high importance to the honor and proſperity of the United States."</p>
            <p>With an ardent deſire that his well-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ant endeavors may be conducive to the real advantage of the nation, and with the utmoſt deference to the ſuperior judgment of the Houſe, he now reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmits the reſult of his enquiries and reflections, to their indulgent conſtruction.</p>
            <p>In the opinion of the Secretary, the wiſdom of the Houſe, in giving their explicit ſanction to the propoſition which has been ſtated, cannot but be applauded by all, who will ſeriouſly conſider, and trace through their obvious conſequences, theſe plain and undeniable truths.—</p>
            <p>That exigencies are to be expected to occur, in the affairs of nations, in which there will be a neceſſity for borrowing.—</p>
            <p>That loans in times of public danger, eſpecially from foreign war, are found an indiſpenſable reſource, even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the wealthieſt of them.—</p>
            <p>And that in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>untry, which, like this, is poſſeſſed of little active wealth, or in other words, little monied capit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the neceſſity for that reſource, muſt, in ſuch emergencies, be proportionably urgent.</p>
            <p>And as on the one hand, the neceſſity for borrowing in particular emergencies cannot be doubted, ſo on the other, it is equally evident, that to be able to borrow upon <hi>good terms,</hi> it is eſſential that the credit of a nation ſhould be well eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>For when the credit of a country is in any degree queſtionable, it never fails to give an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant premium, in one ſhape or another, upon all the loans it has occaſion to make. Nor does the evil end here; the ſame diſadvantage muſt be ſuſtained upon whatever is to be bought on terms of future payment.</p>
            <p>From this conſtant neceſſity of <hi>borrowing</hi> and <hi>buying dear,</hi> it is eaſy to conceive how immenſely the expences of a nation, in a courſe of time, will be augmented by an unſound ſtate of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic credit.</p>
            <p>To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of miſchiefs in the whole ſyſtem of the ſocial oeconomy, which proceed from a neglect of the maxims that uphold public credit, and juſtify the ſolicitude manifeſted by the Houſe on this point, would be an improper intruſion on their time and patience.</p>
            <p>In ſo ſtrong a light nevertheleſs do they appear to the Secretary, that on their due obſervance at the preſent critical juncture, materially depends, in his judgment, the individual and aggregate proſperity of the citizens of the United States; their relief from the embarraſſments they now expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; their character as a People; the cauſe of good government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:022998_0003_0FBAD37EAD381C60"/>If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly ſo important, the next enquiry which ſuggeſts itſelf is, by what means it is to be effected?—The ready anſwer to which queſtion is, by good faith, by a punctual performance of contracts. States, like individuals, who obſerve their engagements, are reſpected and truſted: while the reverſe is the fate of thoſe, who purſue an oppoſite conduct.</p>
            <p>Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or neceſſity, is in differ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees hurtful to public credit. When ſuch a neceſſity does truly exiſt, the evils of it are only to be palliated by a ſcrupulous attention, on the part of the government, to carry the violation no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the neceſſity abſolutely requires, and to manifeſt, if the nature of the caſe admits of it, a ſincere diſpoſition to make reparation, whenever circumſtances ſhall permit. But with every poſſible mitigation, credit muſt ſuffer, and numerous miſchiefs enſue. It is therefore highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, when an appearance of neceſſity ſeems to preſs upon the public councils, that they ſhould examine well its reality, and be perfectly aſſured, that there is no method of eſcaping from it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they yield to its ſuggeſtions. For though it cannot ſafely be affirmed, that occaſions have never exiſted, or may not exiſt, in which violations of the public faith, in this reſpect, are inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet there is great reaſon to believe, that they exiſt far leſs frequently than precedents indicate; and are ofteneſt either pretended through levity, or want of firmneſs, or ſuppoſed through want of knowledge. Expedients might often have been deviſed to effect, conſiſtently with good faith, what has been done in contravention of it. Thoſe who are moſt commonly creditors of a nation, are, generally ſpeaking, enlightened men; and there are ſignal examples to warrant a concluſion, that when a candid and fair appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is made to them, they will underſtand their true intereſt too well to refuſe their concurrence in ſuch modifications of their claims, as any real neceſſity may demand.</p>
            <p>While the obſervance of that good faith, which is the baſis of public credit, is recommended by the ſtrongeſt inducements of political expediency, it is enforced by conſiderations of ſtill greater authority. There are arguments for it, which reſt on the immutable principles of moral obligation. And in proportion as the mind is diſpoſed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate connection between public virtue and public happineſs, will be its repugnancy to a violation of thoſe principles.</p>
            <p>This reflection derives additional ſtrength from the nature of the debt of the United States. It was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, that give peculiar force to the obligation. There is indeed reaſon to regret that it has not hitherto been kept; that the neceſſities of the war, conſpiring with inexperience in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of finance, produced direct infractions; and that the ſubſequent period has been a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcene of negative violation, or non-compliance. But a dimunition of this regret ariſes from the reflection, that the laſt ſeven years have exhibited an earneſt and uniform effort, on the part of the government of the union, to retrieve the national credit, by doing juſtice to the creditors of the nation; and that the embarraſſments of a defective conſtitution, which defeated this laudable effort, have ceaſed.</p>
            <p>From this evidence of a favorable diſpoſition, given by the former government, the inſtitution of a new one, cloathed with powers competent to calling forth the reſources of the community, has excited correſpondent expectations. A general belief, accordingly, prevails, that the credit of the United States will quickly be eſtabliſhed on the firm foundation of an effectual proviſion for the exiſting debt. The influence, which this has had at home, is witneſſed by the rapid increaſe, that has taken place in the market value of the public ſecurities. From January to November, they roſe thirty-three and a third per cent, and from that period to this time, they have riſen fifty per cent more. And the intelligence from abroad announces effects proportionably favourable to our national credit and conſequence.</p>
            <p>It cannot but merit particular attention, that among ourſelves the moſt enlightened friends of good government are thoſe, whoſe expectations are the higheſt.</p>
            <p>To juſtify and preſerve their confidence; to promote the encreaſing reſpectability of the American name; to anſwer the calls of juſtice; to reſtore landed property to its due value; to furniſh new reſources both to agriculture and commerce; to cement more cloſely the union of the ſtates; to add to their ſecurity againſt foreign attack; to eſtabliſh public order on the baſis of an upright and liberal policy.—Theſe are the great and invaluable ends to be ſecured, by a proper and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate proviſion, at the preſent period, for the ſupport of public credit.</p>
            <p>To this proviſion we are invited, not only by the general conſiderations, which have been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, but by others of a more particular nature. It will procure to every claſs of the community ſome important advantages, and remove ſome no leſs important diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>The advantage to the public creditors from the increaſed value of that part of their property which conſtitutes the public debt, needs no explanation.</p>
            <p>But there is a conſequence of this, leſs obvious, though not leſs true, in which every other ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen is intereſted. It is a well known fact, that in countries in which the national debt is properly funded, and an object of eſtabliſhed confidence, it anſwers moſt of the purpoſes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022998_0004_0FBAD3803293C100"/>
Transfers of ſtock or public debt are there equivalent to payments in ſpecie; or in other words, ſtock, in the principal tranſactions of buſineſs, paſſes current as ſpecie.—The ſame thing would, in all probability happen here, under the like circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The benefits of this are various and obvious.—</p>
            <p>Firſt. Trade is extended by it; becauſe there is a larger capital to carry it on, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant can at the ſame time, afford to trade for ſmaller profits; as his ſtock, which, when unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, brings him in an intereſt from the government, ſerves him alſo as money, when he has a call for it in his commercial operations.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Agriculture and manufactures are alſo promoted by it: For the like reaſon, that more capital can be commanded to be employed in both; and becauſe the merchant, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize in foreign trade, gives to them activity and extenſion, has greater means for enterprize.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. The intereſt of money will be lowered by it; for this is always in a ratio, to the quantity of money, and to the quickneſs of circulation. This circumſtance will enable both the public and individuals to borrow on eaſier and cheaper terms.</p>
            <p>And from the combination of theſe effects, additional aids will be furniſhed to labour, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and to arts of every kind.</p>
            <p>But theſe good effects of a public debt are only to be looked for, when, by being well funded, it has acquired an <hi>adequate</hi> and <hi>ſtable</hi> value. Till then, it has rather a contrary tendency. The fluctuation and inſecurity incident to it in an unfunded ſtate, render it a mere commodity, and a precarious one. As ſuch, being only an object of occaſional and particular ſpeculation, all the money applied to it is ſo much diverted from the more uſeful channels of circulation, for which the thing itſelf affords no ſubſtitute: So that, in fact, one ſerious inconvenience of an unfunded debt is, that it contributes to the ſcarcity of money.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction which has been little if at all attended to, is of the greateſt moment. It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a queſtion immediately intereſting to every part of the community; which is no other than this—Whether the public debt, by a proviſion for it on true principles, ſhall be rendered a <hi>ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> for money; or whether, by being left as it is, or by being provided for in ſuch a manner as will wound thoſe principles, and deſtroy confidence, it ſhall be ſuffered to continue, as it is, a pernicious drain of our caſh from the channels of productive induſtry.</p>
            <p>The effect, which the funding of the public debt, on right principles, would have upon landed property, is one of the circumſtances attending ſuch an arrangement, which has been leaſt advert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, though it deſerves the moſt particular attention. The preſent depreciated ſtate of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of property is a ſerious calamity. The value of cultivated lands, in moſt of the ſtates, has fallen ſince the revolution from 25 to 50 per cent. In thoſe fartheſt ſouth, the decreaſe is ſtill more conſiderable. Indeed, if the repreſentations, continually received from that quarter, may be credited, lands there will command no price, which may not be deemed an almoſt total ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>This decreaſe, in the value of lands, ought, in a great meaſure, to be attributed to the ſcarcity of money.—Conſequently whatever produces an augmentation of the monied capital of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, muſt have a proportional effect in raiſing that value. The beneficial tendency of a funded debt, in this reſpect, has been manifeſted by the moſt deciſive experience in Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>The proprietors of lands would not only feel the benefit of this increaſe in the value of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and of a more prompt and better ſale, when they had occaſion to ſell; but the neceſſity of ſelling would be, itſelf, greatly diminiſhed. As the ſame cauſe would contribute to the facility of loans, there is reaſon to believe, that ſuch of them as are indebted, would be able through that reſource, to ſatisfy their more urgent creditors.</p>
            <p>It ought not however to be expected, that the advantages, deſcribed as likely to reſult from funding the public debt, would be inſtantaneous. It might require ſome time to bring the value of ſtock to its natural level, and to attach to it that fixed confidence, which is neceſſary to its quality as money. Yet the late rapid riſe of the public ſecurities encourages an expectation, that the progreſs of ſtock to the deſireable point, will be much more expeditious than could have been foreſeen. And as in the mean time it will be increaſing in value, there is room to conclude, that it will, from the outſet, anſwer many of the purpoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in contemplation. Particularly it ſeems to be probable, that from creditors, who are not themſelves neceſſitous, it will early meet with a ready reception in payment of debts, at its current price.</p>
            <p>Having now taken a conciſe view of the inducements to a proper proviſion for the public debt, the next enquiry which preſents itſelf is, what ought to be the nature of ſuch a proviſion? This requires ſome preliminary diſcuſſions.</p>
            <p>It is agreed on all hands, that that part of the debt which has been contracted abroad, and is denominated the foreign debt, ought to be provided for, according to the preciſe terms of the contracts relating to it. The diſcuſſions, which can ariſe, therefore, will have reference eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the domeſtic part of it, or to that which has been contracted at home, It is to be regretted, that there is not the ſame unanimity of ſentiment on this part, as on the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:022998_0005_0FBAD381AF4AC408"/>The Secretary has too much deference for the opinions of every part of the community, not to have obſerved one, which has, more than once, made its appearance in the public prints, and which is occaſionally to be met with in converſation. It involves this queſtion, whether a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination ought not to be made between original holders of the public ſecurities, and preſent poſſeſſors, by purchaſe. Thoſe who advocate a diſcrimination are for making a full proviſion for the ſecurities of the former, at their nominal value; but contend, that the latter ought to receive no more than the coſt to them, and the intereſt: And the idea is ſometimes ſuggeſted of making good the difference to the primitive poſſeſſor.</p>
            <p>In favor of this ſcheme, it is alledged, that it would be unreaſonable to pay twenty ſhillings in the pound, to one who had not given more for it than three or four. And it is added, that it would be hard to aggravate the misfortune of the firſt owner, who, probably through neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, parted with his property at ſo great a loſs, by obliging him to contribute to the profit of the perſon, who had ſpeculated on his diſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>The Secretary, after the moſt mature reflection on the force of this argument, is induced to reject the doctrine it contains, as equally unjuſt and impolitic, as highly injurious, even to the original holders of public ſecurities;—as ruinous to public credit.</p>
            <p>It is inconſiſtent with juſtice, becauſe in the firſt place, it is a breach of contract; in violation of the rights of a fair purchaſer.</p>
            <p>The nature of the contract in its origin, is, that the public will pay the ſum expreſſed in the ſecurity, to the firſt holder, or his <hi>aſſignee.</hi> The <hi>intent,</hi> in making the ſecurity aſſignable, is, that the proprietor may be able to make uſe of his property, by ſelling it for as much as it <hi>may be worth in the market,</hi> and that the buyer may be <hi>ſafe</hi> in the purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Every buyer therefore ſtands exactly in the place of the ſeller—has the ſame right with him to the identical ſum expreſſed in the ſecurity, and having acquired that right, by fair purchaſe, and in conformity to the original <hi>agreement</hi> and <hi>intention</hi> of the government, his claim cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, without manifeſt injuſtice.</p>
            <p>That he is to be conſidered as a fair purchaſer, reſults from this: Whatever neceſſity the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may have been under, was occaſioned by the government, in not making a proper proviſion for its debts. The buyer had no agency in it, and therefore ought not to ſuffer. He is not even chargeable with having taken an undue advantage. He paid what the commodity was worth in the market, and took the riſks of reimburſement upon himſelf. He of courſe gave a fair equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ought to reap the benefit of his hazard; a hazard which was far from inconſiderable, and which, perhaps, turned on little leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a revolution in government.</p>
            <p>That the caſe of thoſe, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with their ſecurities from neceſſity, is a hard one, cannot be denied. But whatever complaint of injury, or claim of redreſs, they may have, reſpects the government ſolely. They have not only nothing to object to the perſons who relieved their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, by giving them the current price of their property, but they are even under an implied condition to contribute to the reimburſement of thoſe perſons. They knew, that by the terms of the contract with themſelves, the public were bound to pay to thoſe, to whom they ſhould convey their title, the ſums ſtipulated to be paid to them; and, that as citizens of the United States, they were to bear their proportion of the contribution for that purpoſe. This, by the act of aſſignment, they tacitly engage to do; and if they had an option, they could not, with integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or good faith, refuſe to do it, without the conſent of thoſe to whom they ſold.</p>
            <p>But though many of the original holders ſold from neceſſity, it does not follow, that this was the caſe with all of them. It may well be ſuppoſed, that ſome of them did it either through want of confidence in an eventual proviſion, or from the allurements of ſome profitable ſpeculation. How ſhall theſe different claſſes be diſcriminated from each other? How ſhall it be aſcertained, in any caſe, that the money, which the original holder obtained for his ſecurity, was not more beneficial to him, than if he had held it to the preſent time, to avail himſelf of the proviſion which ſhall be made? How ſhall it be known, whether if the purchaſer had employed his money in ſome other way, he would not be in a better ſituation, than by having applied it in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of ſecurities, though he ſhould now receive their full amount? And if neither of theſe things can be known, how ſhall it be determined whether a diſcrimination, independent of the breach of contract, would not do a real injury to purchaſers; and if it included a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to the primitive proprietors, would not give them an advantage, to which they had no equitable pretenſion.</p>
            <p>It may well be imagined, alſo, that there are not wanting inſtances, in which individuals, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a preſent neceſſity, parted with the ſecurities received by them from the public, and ſhortly after replaced them with others, as an indemnity for their firſt loſs. Shall they be deprived of the indemnity which they have endeavoured to ſecure by ſo provident an arrangement?</p>
            <p>Queſtions of this ſort, on a cloſe inſpection, multiply themſelves without end, and demonſtrate the injuſtice of a diſcrimination, even on the moſt ſubtile calculations of equity, abſtracted from the obligation of contract.</p>

               </gap> meaſure.</p>
            <p>As a ſpecimen of its capricious operation, it will be ſufficient to notice the effect it would have upon two perſons, who may be ſuppoſed two years ago to have purchaſed, each, ſecurities at three ſhillings in the pound, and one of them to retain thoſe bought by him, till the diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould take place; the other to have parted with thoſe bought by him, within a month paſt, at nine ſhillings. The former, who had had moſt confidence in the government, would in this caſe only receive at the rate of three ſhillings and the intereſt; while the latter, who had had leſs confidence would receive <hi>for what coſt him the ſame money</hi> at the rate of nine ſhillings, and his repreſentative, <hi>ſtanding in his place,</hi> would be entitled to a like rate.</p>
            <p>The impolicy of a diſcrimination reſults from two conſiderations; one, that it proceeds upon a principle deſtructive of that <hi>quality</hi> of the public debt, or the ſtock of the nation, which is eſſential to its capacity for anſwering the purpoſes of money—that is the <hi>ſecurity</hi> of <hi>transfer;</hi> the other, that as well on this account, as becauſe it includes a breach of faith, it renders property in the funds leſs valuable; conſequently induces lenders to demand a higher premium for what they lend, and produces every other inconvenience of a bad ſtate of public credit.</p>
            <p>It will be perceived at firſt ſight, that the transferable quality of ſtock is eſſential to its operation as money, and that this depends on the idea of complete ſecurity to the transferree, and a firm perſuaſion, that no diſtinction can in any circumſtances be made between him and the original proprietor.</p>
            <p>The precedent of an invaſion of this fundamental principle, would of courſe tend to deprive the community of an advantage, with which no temporary ſaving could bear the leaſt compariſon.</p>
            <p>And it will as readily be perceived, that the ſame cauſe would operate a diminution of the value of ſtock in the hands of the firſt, as well as of every other holder. The price, which any man, who ſhould incline to purchaſe, would be willing to give for it, would be in a compound ratio to the immediate profit it afforded, and to the chance of the continuance of his profit. If there was ſuppoſed to be any hazard of the latter, the riſk would be taken into the calculation, and either there would be no purchaſe at all, or it would be at a proportionably leſs price.</p>
            <p>For this diminution of the value of ſtock, every perſon, who ſhould be about to lend to the government, would demand a compenſation; and would add to the actual difference, between the nominal and the market value, an equivalent for the chance of greater decreaſe; which, in a precarious ſtate of public credit, is always to be taken into the account.</p>
            <p>Every compenſation of this ſort, it is evident, would be an abſolute loſs to the government.</p>
            <p>In the preceding diſcuſſion of the impolicy of a diſcrimination, the injurious tendency of it to thoſe, who continue to be the holders of the ſecurities, they received from the government, has been explained. Nothing need be added, on this head, except that this is an additional and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting light, in which the injuſtice of the meaſure may be ſeen. It would not only diveſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proprietors by purchaſe, of the rights they had acquired under the ſanction of public faith, but it would depreciate the property of the remaining original holders.</p>
            <p>It is equally unneceſſary to add any thing to what has been already ſaid to demonſtrate the fatal influence, which the principle of diſcrimination would have on the public credit.</p>
            <p>But there is ſtill a point in view in which it will appear perhaps even more exceptionable, than in either of the former. It would be repugnant to an expreſs proviſion of the Conſtitution of the United States. This proviſion is, that "all debts con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>racted and engagements entered into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the adoption of that Conſtitution ſhall be as valid againſt the United States under it, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the confederation," which amounts to a conſtitutional ratification of the contracts reſpecting the debt, in the ſtate in which they exiſted under the confederation. And reſorting to that ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, there can be no doubt, that the rights of aſſignees and original holders, muſt be conſidered as equal.</p>
            <p>In exploding thus fully the principle of diſcrimination, the Secretary is happy in reflecting, that he is the only advocate of what has been already ſanctioned by the formal and expreſs autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the government of the Union, in theſe emphatic terms—"The remaining claſs of credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors (ſay Congreſs in their circular addreſs to the ſtates, of the 26th of April 1783) is compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly of ſuch of our fellow-citizens as originally lent to the public the uſe of their funds, or have ſince manifeſted <hi>moſt confidence</hi> in their country, by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of thoſe, whoſe property has been either advanced or aſſumed for the public ſervice. To <hi>diſcriminate</hi> the merits of theſe ſeveral deſcriptions of creditors, would be a taſk equally unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favor of ſome than of others, the voice of policy, no leſs than of juſtice, pleads in favor of all. A WISE NATION will never permit thoſe who relieve the wants of their country, or who <hi>rely moſt</hi> on its <hi>faith,</hi> its <hi>firmneſs,</hi> and its <hi>reſources,</hi> when either of them is diſtruſted, to ſuffer by the event."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:022998_0007_0FBAD384B225B138"/>The Secretary concluding, that a diſcrimination, between the different claſſes of creditors of the United States, cannot with propriety be <hi>made,</hi> proceeds to examine whether a difference ought to be permitted to <hi>remain</hi> between them, and another deſcription of public creditors—Thoſe of the ſtates individually.</p>
            <p>The Secretary, after mature reflection on this point, entertains a full convicton, that an aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the debts of the particular ſtates by the union, and a like proviſion for them, as for thoſe of the union, will be a meaſure of ſound policy and ſubſtantial juſtice.</p>
            <p>It would, in the opinion of the Secretary, contribute, in an eminent degree, to an orderly, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſatisfactory arrangement of the national finances.</p>
            <p>Admitting, as ought to be the caſe, that a proviſion muſt be made in ſome way or other, for the entire debt; it will follow, that no greater revenues will be required, whether that proviſion be made wholly by the United States, or partly by them, and partly by the ſtates ſeparately.</p>
            <p>The principal queſtion then muſt be, whether ſuch a proviſion c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnot be more conveniently and effectually made, by one general plan iſſuing from one authority, than by different plans originating in different authorities.</p>
            <p>In the firſt caſe there can be no competition for reſources; in the laſt, there muſt be ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition. The conſequences of this, without the greateſt caution on both ſides, might be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering regulations, and thence colliſion and confuſion. Particular branches of induſtry might alſo be oppreſſed by it. The moſt productive objects of revenue are not numerous. Either theſe muſt be wholly engroſſed by one ſide, which might leſſen the efficacy of the proviſions by the other; or both muſt have recourſe to the ſame objects in different modes, which might occaſion an accumulation upon them, beyond what they could properly bear. If this ſhould not happen, the caution requiſite to avoiding it, would prevent the revenue's deriving the full benefit of each object. The danger of interference and of exceſs would be apt to impoſe reſtraints very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the complete command of thoſe reſources, which are the moſt convenient; and to compel the having recourſe to others, leſs eligible in themſelves, and leſs agreeable to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of an effectual command of the public reſources, in caſe of ſeparate proviſions for the debt, may be ſeen in another and perhaps more ſtriking light. It would naturally happen that different ſtates, from local conſiderations, would in ſome inſtances have recourſe to different objects, in others, to the ſame objects, in different degrees, for procuring the funds of which they ſtood in need. It is eaſy to conceive how this diverſity would affect the aggregate revenue of the country. By the ſuppoſition, articles which yielded a full ſupply in ſome ſtates, would yield nothing, or an inſufficient product, in others. And hence the public revenue would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the full benefit of thoſe articles, from ſtate regulations. Neither could the deficiencies be made good by thoſe of the union. It is a proviſion of the national conſtitution, that "all duties, impoſts and exciſes, ſhall be uniform throughout the United States." And as the general go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would be under a neceſſity from motives of policy, of paying regard to the duty, which may have been previouſly impoſed upon any article, though but in a ſingle ſtate, it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, either to refrain wholly from any further impoſition, upon ſuch article, where it had been already rated as high as was proper, or to confine itſelf to the difference between the exiſting rate, and what the article would reaſonably bear. Thus the pre-occupancy of an article by a ſingle ſtate, would tend to arreſt or abridge the impoſition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the union on that article. And as it is ſuppoſeable, that a great variety of articles might be placed in this ſituation, by diſſimilar arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the particular ſtates, it is evident, that the aggregate revenue of the country would be likely to be very materially contracted by the plan of ſeparate proviſions.</p>
            <p>If all the public creditors receive their dues from one ſource, diſtributed with an equal hand, their intereſt will be the ſame. And having the ſame intereſts, they will unite in the ſupport of the fiſcal arrangements of the government: As theſe, too, can be made with more convenience, where there is no competition: Theſe circumſtances combined will inſure to the revenue laws a more ready and more ſatisfactory execution.</p>
            <p>If on the contrary there are diſtinct proviſions, there will be diſtinct intereſts, drawing different ways. That union and concert of views, among the creditors, which in every government is of great importance to their ſecurity, and to that of public credit, will not only not exiſt, but will be likely to give place to mutual jealouſy and oppoſition. And from this cauſe, the operation of the ſyſtems which may be adopted, both by the particular ſtates, and by the union, with relation to their reſpective debts, will be in danger of being counteracted.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral reaſons, which render it probable, that the ſituation of the ſtate creditors would be worſe, than that of the creditors of the union, if there be not a national aſſumption of the ſtate debts. Of theſe it will be ſufficient to mention two; one, that a principal branch of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue is excluſively veſted in the union; the other, that a ſtate muſt always be checked in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of taxes on articles of conſumption, from the want of power to extend the ſame regulation to the other ſtates, and from the tendency of partial duties to injure its induſtry and commerce. Should the ſtate creditors ſtand upon a leſs eligible footing than the others, it is unnatural to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022998_0008_0FBAD3862F4CC3C0"/>
they would ſee with pleaſure a proviſion for them. The influence which their diſſatisfaction might have, could not but operate injuriouſly, both for the creditors, and the credit, of the United States.</p>
            <p>Hence it is even the intereſt of the creditors of the union, that thoſe of the individual ſtates ſhould be comprehended in a general proviſion. Any attempt to ſecure to the former either excluſive or peculiar advantages, would materially hazard their intereſts.</p>
            <p>Neither would it be juſt, that one claſs of the public creditors ſhould be more favoured than the other. The objects for which both deſcriptions of the debt were contracted, are in the main the ſame. Indeed a great part of the particular debts of the States has ariſen from aſſumptions by them on account of the union. And it is moſt equitable, that there ſhould be the ſame meaſure of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for all.</p>
            <p>There is an objection, however, to an aſſumption of the ſtate debts, which deſerves particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It may be ſuppoſed, that it would increaſe the difficulty of an equitable ſettlement between them and the United States.</p>
            <p>The principles of that ſettlement, whenever they ſhall be diſcuſſed, will require all the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wiſdom of the government. In the opinion of the Secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ry, that diſcuſſion, till further lights are obtained, would be premature.</p>
            <p>All therefore which he would now think adviſeable on the point in queſtion, would be, that the amount of the debts aſſumed and provided for, ſhould be charged to the reſpective ſtates, to abide an eventual arrangement. This, the United States, as aſſignees to the creditors, would have an indiſputable right to do.</p>
            <p>But as it might be a ſatisfaction to the Houſe to have before them ſome plan for the liquidation of accounts between the union and its members, which, including the aſſumption of the ſtate debts, would conſiſt with equity: The Secretary will ſubmit in this place ſuch thoughts on the ſubject, as have occurred to his own mind, or been ſuggeſted to him, moſt compatible, in his judgment, with the end propoſed.</p>
            <p>Let each ſtate be charged with all the money advanced to it out of the treaſury of the United States, liquidated according to the ſpecie value, at the time of each advance, with intereſt at ſix per cent.</p>
            <p>Let it alſo be charged with the amount, in ſpecie value, of all its ſecurities which ſhall be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with the intereſt upon them to the time, when intereſt ſhall become payable by the United States.</p>
            <p>Let it be credited for all monies paid and articles furniſhed to the United States, and for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expenditures during the war, either towards general or particular defence, whether authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed or unauthorized by the United States; the whole liquidated to ſpecie value, and bearing an intereſt of ſix per cent. from the ſeveral times at which the ſeveral payments, advances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures accrued.</p>
            <p>And let all ſums of continental money now in the treaſuries of the reſpective ſtates, which ſhall be paid into the treaſury of the United States, be credited at ſpecie value.</p>
            <p>Upon a ſtatement of the accounts according to theſe principles, there can be little doubt, that balances would appear in favor of all the ſtates, againſt the United States.</p>
            <p>To equalize the contributions of the ſtates, let each be then charged with its proportion of the aggregate of thoſe balances, according to ſome equitable ratio, to be deviſed for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>If the contributions ſhould be found diſproportionate, the reſult of this adjuſtment would be, that ſome ſtates would be creditors, ſome debtors to the union.</p>
            <p>Should this be the caſe, at it will be attended with leſs inconvenience for the United States, to have to pay balances to, than to receive them from the particular ſtates, it may perhaps, be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable to effect the former by a ſecond proceſs, in the nature of a transfer of the amount of the debts of debtor ſtates, to the credit of creditor ſtates, obſerving the ratio by which the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionment ſhall have been made. This, whilſt it would deſtroy the balances due from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, would increaſe thoſe due to the latter. Theſe to be provided for by the United States, at a reaſonable intereſt, but not to be transferable.</p>
            <p>The expediency of this ſecond proceſs muſt depend on a knowledge of the reſult of the firſt. If the inequalities ſhould be too great, the arrangement may be impracticable, without unduly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the debt of the United States. But it is not likely, that this would be the caſe. It is alſo to be remarked, that though this ſecond proceſs might not, upon the principle of apportionment, bring the thing to the point aimed at, yet it may approach ſo nearly to it, as to avoid eſſentially the embarraſſment, of having conſiderable balances to collect from any of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>The whole of this arrangement to be under the ſuperintendence of commiſſioners, veſted with equitable diſcretion, and final authority.</p>
            <p>The operation of the plan is exemplified in the ſchedule A.</p>
            <p>The general principle of it ſeems to be equitable, for it appears difficult to conceive a good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the expences for the particular defence of a part in a common war, ſhould not be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022998_0009_0FBAD387AB96FB38"/>
charge, as well as thoſe incurred profeſſedly for the general defence. The defence of each part is that of the whole; and unleſs all the expenditures are brought into a common maſs, the tendency muſt be, to add, to the calamities ſuffered, by being the moſt expoſed to the ravages of war, an increaſe of burthens.</p>
            <p>This plan ſeems to be ſuſceptible of no objection, which does not belong to every other, that proceeds on the idea of a final adjuſtment of accounts. The difficulty of ſettling a ratio, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all. This muſt, probably, either be ſought for in the proportions of the requiſitions, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the war, or in the deciſion of commiſſioners appointed with plenary power. The rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Conſtitution, with regard to repreſentation and direct taxes, would evidently not be applicable to the ſituation of parties, during the period in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The exiſting debt of the United States is excluded from the computation, as it ought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be provided for out of a general fund.</p>
            <p>The only diſcuſſion of a preliminary kind, which remains, relates to the diſtinctions of the debt into principal and intereſt. It is well known, that the arrears of the latter bear a large proportion to the amount of the former. The immediate payment of theſe arrears is evidently impracticable, and a queſtion ariſes, what ought to be done with them?</p>
            <p>There is good reaſon to conclude, that the impreſſions of many are more favorable to the claim of the principal than to that of the intereſt; at leaſt ſo far, as to produce an opinion, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior proviſion might ſuffice for the latter.</p>
            <p>But to the Secretary, this opinion does not appear to be well founded. His inveſtigations of the ſubject, have led him to a concluſion, that the arrears of intereſt have pretenſions, at leaſt equal to the principal.</p>
            <p>The liquidated debt, traced to its origin, falls under two principal diſcriminations. One, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to loans; the other to ſervices performed and articles ſupplied.</p>
            <p>The part ariſing from loans, was at firſt made payable at fixed periods, which have long ſince elapſed, with an early option to lenders, either to receive back their money at the expiration of thoſe periods, or to continue it at intereſt, 'till the whole amount of continental bills circulating ſhould not exceed the ſum in circulation at the time of each loan. This contingency, in the ſenſe of the contract, never happened; and the preſumption is, that the creditors preferred continuing their money indefinitely at intereſt, to receiving it in a depreciated and depreciating ſtate.</p>
            <p>The other parts of it were chiefly for objects, which ought to have been paid for at the time, that is, when the ſervices were performed or the ſupplies furniſhed; and were not accompanied with any contract for intereſt.</p>
            <p>But by different acts of government and adminiſtration, concurred in by the creditors, theſe parts of the debt have been converted into a capital, bearing an intereſt of ſix per cent. per annum, but without any definite period of redemption. A portion of the loan-office debt has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for new ſecurities of that import. And the whole of it ſeems to have acquired that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, after the expiration of the periods prefixed for re-payment.</p>
            <p>If this view of the ſubject be a juſt one, the capital of the debt of the United States, may be conſidered in the light of an annuity at the rate of ſix per cent. per annum, redeemable at the pleaſure of the government, by payment of the principal. For it ſeems to be a clear poſition, that when a public contracts a debt payable with intereſt, without any preciſe time being ſtipulated or underſtood for payment of the capital, that time is a matter of pure diſcretion with the government, which is at liberty to conſult its own convenience reſpecting it, taking care to pay the intereſt with punctuality.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as long as the United States ſhould pay the intereſt of their debt, as it accrued, their creditors would have no right to demand the principal.</p>
            <p>But with regard to the arrear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of intereſt, the caſe is different. Theſe are now due, and thoſe to whom they are due, have a right to claim immediate payment. To ſay, that it would be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to comply, would not vary the nature of the right. Nor can this idea of impracticability be honor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ably carried further, than to juſtify the propoſition of a new contract upon the baſis of a commutation of that right for an equivalent. This equivalent too ought to be a real and fair one. And what other fair equivalent can be imagined for the detention of money, but a reaſonable intereſt? Or what can be the ſtandard of that intereſt, but the market rate, or the rate which the government pays in ordinary caſes?</p>
            <p>From this view of the matter, which appears to be the accurate and true one, it will follow, that the arrears of intereſt are entitled to an equal proviſion with the principal of the debt.</p>
            <p>The reſult of the foregoing diſcuſſions is this—That there ought to be no diſcrimination between the original holders of the debt, and preſent poſſeſſors by purchaſe—That it is expedient, there ſhould be an aſſumption of the ſtate debts by the Union, and that the arrears of intereſt ſhould be provided for on an equal footing with the principal.</p>

            <p>The intereſting problem now occurs. Is it in the power of the United States, conſiſtently with thoſe prudential conſiderations, which ought not to be overlooked, to make a proviſion equal to the purpoſe of funding the whole debt, at the rates of intereſt which it now bears, in addition to the ſum which will be neceſſary for the current ſervice of the government?</p>
            <p>The Secretary will not ſay that ſuch a proviſion would exceed the abilities of the country; but he is clearly of opinion, that to make it, would require the extenſion of taxation to a degree, and to objects, which the true intereſt of the public creditors forbids. It is therefore to be hoped, and even to be expected, that they will chearfully concur in ſuch modifications of their claims, on fair and equitable principles, as will facilitate to the government an arrangement ſubſtantial, durable and ſatisfactory to the community. The importance of the laſt characteriſtic will ſtrike every diſcerning mind. No plan, however flattering in appearance, to which it did not belong, could be truly entitled to confidence.</p>
            <p>It will not be forgotten, that exigencies may, ere long, ariſe, which would call for reſources greatly beyond what is now deemed ſufficient for the current ſervice; and that, ſhould the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the country be exhauſted or even <hi>ſtrained</hi> to provide for the public debt, there could be leſs reliance on the ſacredneſs of the proviſion.</p>
            <p>But while the Secretary yields to the force of theſe conſiderations, he does not loſe ſight of thoſe fundamental principles of good faith, which dictate, that every practicable exertion ought to be made, ſcrupulouſly to fulfil the engagements of the government; that no change in the rights of its creditors ought to be attempted without their voluntary conſent; and that this conſent ought to be voluntary in fact, as well as in name. Conſequently, that every propoſal of a change ought to be in the ſhape of an appeal to their reaſon and to their intereſt; not to their neceſſities. To this end it is requiſite, that a fair equivalent ſhould be offered for what may be aſked to be given up, and unqueſtionable ſecurity for the remainder. Without this, an alteration, conſiſtently with the credit and honor of the nation, would be impracticable.</p>
            <p>It remains to ſee, what can be propoſed in conformity to theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>It has been remarked, that the capital of the debt of the union is to be viewed in the light of an annuity at the rate of ſix per cent. per annum, redeemable at the pleaſure of the government, by payment of the principal. And it will not be required, that the arrears of intereſt ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in a more favourable light. The ſame character, in general, may be applied to the debts of the individual ſtates.</p>
            <p>This view of the ſubject <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dmits, that the United States would have it in their power to avail themſelves of any fall in the market rate of intereſt, for reducing that of the debt.</p>
            <p>This property of the debt is favourable to the public; unfavourable to the creditor. And may facilitate an arrangement for the reduction of intereſt, upon the baſis of a fair equivalent.</p>
            <p>Probabilities are always a rational ground of contract. The Secretary conceives, that there is good reaſon to believe, if effectual meaſures are taken to eſtabliſh public credit, that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rate of intereſt in the United States, will, in a very ſhort time, fall at leaſt as low as five per cent. and that in a period not exceeding twenty years, it will ſink ſtill lower, probably to four.</p>
            <p>There are two principal cauſes which will be likely to produce this effect; one, the low rate of intereſt in Europe; the other, the increaſe of the monied capital of the nation, by the funding of the public debt.</p>
            <p>From three to four per cent. is deemed good intereſt in ſeveral parts of Europe. Even leſs is deemed ſo, in ſome places. And it is on the decline; the increaſing plenty of money continually tending to lower it. It is preſumable, that no country will be able to borrow of foreigners upon better terms, than the United States, becauſe none can, perhaps, afford ſo good ſecurity. Our ſituation expoſes us leſs, than that of any other nation, to thoſe caſualties, which are the chief cauſes of expence; our incumbrances, in proportion to our real means, are leſs, though theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not immediately be brought ſo readily into action, and our progreſs in reſources from the early ſtate of the country, and the immenſe tracts of unſettled territory, muſt neceſſarily exceed that of any other. The advantages of this ſituation have already engaged the attention of the European money-lenders, particularly among the Dutch. And as they become better underſtood, they will have the greater influence. Hence as large a proportion of the caſh of Europe as may be wanted, will be, in a certain ſenſe, in our market, for the uſe of government. And this will naturally have the effect of a reduction of the rate of intereſt, not indeed to the level of the places, which ſend their money to market, but to ſomething much nearer to it, than our preſent rate.</p>
            <p>The influence, which the funding of the debt is calculated to have, in lowering intereſt, has been already remarked and explained. It is hardly poſſible, that it ſhould not be materially affected by ſuch an increaſe of the monied capital of the nation, as would reſult from the proper funding of ſeventy millions of dollars. But the probability of a decreaſe in the rate of intereſt, acquires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation from facts, which exiſted prior to the revolution. It is well known, that in ſome of the ſtates, money might with facility be borrowed, on good ſecurity, at five per cent. and, not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, even at leſs.</p>
            <p>The moſt enlightened of the public creditors will be moſt ſenſible of the juſtneſs of this view of the ſubject, and of the propriety of the uſe which will be made of it.</p>
            <p>The Secretary, in purſuance of it, will aſſume, as a probability, ſufficiently great to be a ground of calculation, both on the part of the government and of its creditors—That the intereſt of money in the United States will, in five years, fall to five per cent. and, in twenty, to four. The probability, in the mind of the Secretary, is rather that the fall may be more rapid and more conſiderable; but he prefers a mean, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> moſt likely to engage the aſſent of the creditors, and more equitable in itſelf; becauſe it is predicated on probabilities, which may err on one ſide, as well as on the other.</p>
            <p>Premiſing theſe things, the Secretary ſubmits to the Houſe, the expediency of propoſing a loan to the full amount of the debt, as well of the particular ſtates, as of the union, upon the following terms.</p>
            <p>Firſt—That for every hundred dollars ſubſcribed, payable in the debt (as well intereſt as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal) the ſubſcriber be entitled, at his option, either</p>
            <p>To have two thirds funded at an annuity, or yearly intereſt of ſix per cent, redeemable at the pleaſure of the government, by payment of the principal; and to receive the other third in lands in the Weſtern Territory, at the rate of twenty cents per acre. Or,</p>
            <p>To have the whole ſum funded at an annuity or yearly intereſt of four per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding five dollars per annum on account both of principal and intereſt; and to receive, as a compenſation for the reduction of intereſt, fifteen dollars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding caſe. Or</p>
            <p>To have ſixty-ſix dollars and two thirds of a dollar funded immediately at an annuity or yearly intereſt of ſix per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding four dollars and two thirds of a dollar per annum, on account both of principal and intereſt; and to have, at the end of ten years, twenty-ſix dollars and eighty-eight cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In addition to the foregoing loan, payable wholly in the debt, the Secretary would propoſe, that one ſhould be opened for ten millions of dollars, on the following plan.</p>
            <p>That for every hundred dollars ſubſcribed, payable one half in ſpecie, and the other half in debt (as well principal as intereſt) the ſubſcriber be entitled to an annuity or yearly intereſt of five per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding ſix dollars per annum, on account both of principal and intereſt.</p>
            <p>The principles and operation of theſe different plans may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>w require explanation.</p>
            <p>The firſt is ſimply a propoſition for paying one third of the debt in land, and funding the other two thirds, at the exiſting rate of intereſt, and upon the ſame terms of redemption, to which it is at preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>Here is no conjecture, no calculation of probabilities. The creditor is offered the advantage of making his intereſt principal, and he is aſked to facilitate to the government an effectual proviſion for his demands; by accepting a third part of them in land, at a fair valuation.</p>
            <p>The general price, at which the weſtern lands have been, heretofore, ſold, has been a dollar per acre in public ſecurities; but at the time the principal purchaſes were made, theſe ſecurities were worth, in the market, leſs than three ſhillings in the pound. The nominal price, therefore, would not be the proper ſtandard, under preſent circumſtances, nor would the preciſe ſpecie value then given, be a juſt rule. Becauſe, as the payments were to be made by inſtalments, and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities were, at the times of the purchaſes, extremely low, the probability of a moderate riſe muſt be preſumed to have been taken into the account. Twenty cents, therefore, ſeem to bear an equitable proportion to the two conſiderations of value at the time, and likelihood of increaſe.</p>
            <p>It will be underſtood, that upon this plan, the public retains the advantage of availing itſelf of any fall in the market rate of intereſt, for reducing that upon the debt, which is perfectly juſt, as no preſent ſacrifice, either in the quantum of the principal, or in the rate of intereſt, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the creditor.</p>
            <p>The inducement to the meaſure is, the payment of one third of the debt in land.</p>
            <p>The ſecond plan is grounded upon the ſuppoſition, that intereſt, in five years, will fall to five per cent. in fifteen more, to four. As the capital remains entire, but bearing an intereſt of four per cent. only, compenſation is to be made to the creditor, for the intereſt of two per cent. per annum for five years, and of one per cent. per annum, for fifteen years, to commence at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of five years. The preſent value of theſe two ſums or annuities, computed according to the terms of the ſuppoſition, is, by ſtrict calculation, fifteen dollars and ſeven hundred and ninety-two thouſandth parts of a dollar; a fraction leſs than the ſum propoſed.</p>
            <p>The inducement to the meaſure here is, the reduction of intereſt to a rate, more within the compaſs of a convenient proviſion; and the payment of the compenſation in lands.</p>
            <p>The inducements to the individual are—the accommodation afforded to the public—the high probability of a complete equivalent—the chance even of gain, ſhould the rate of intereſt fall, either more ſpeedily or in a greater degree, than the calculation ſuppoſes. Should it fall to five per cent. ſooner than five years; ſhould it fall lower than five before the additional fifteen were expired; or ſhould it fall below four, previous to the payment of the debt, there would be, in each caſe, an abſolute profit to the creditor. As his capital will remain entire, the value of it will increaſe, with every decreaſe of the rate of intereſt.</p>
            <p>The third plan proceeds upon the like ſuppoſition of a ſucceſſive fall in the rate of intereſt. And upon that ſuppoſition offers an equivalent to the creditor. One hundred dollars, bearing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of ſix per cent. for five years; of five per cent. for fifteen years, and thenceforth of four per cent. (theſe being the ſucceſſive rates of intereſt in the market) is equal to a capital of 122 dollars, 510725 parts, bearing an intereſt of four per cent. which, converted into a capital, bearing a fixed rate of intereſt of ſix per cent, is equal to 81 dollars, 6738166 parts.</p>
            <p>The difference between ſixty-ſix dollars and two thirds of a dollar (the ſum to be funded imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately) and this laſt ſum is 15 dollars, 0172 parts, which at ſix per cent per annum, amounts at the end of ten years, to 26 dollars, 8755 parts, the ſum to be funded at the expiration of that period.</p>
            <p>It ought, however, to be acknowledged, that this calculation does not make allowance for the principle of redemption, which the plan itſelf includes; upon which principle the equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a capital of ſix per cent. would be by ſtrict calculation, 87 dollars, 50766 parts.</p>
            <p>But there are two conſiderations which induce the Secretary to think, that the one propoſed would operate more equitably than this: One is, that it may not be very early in the power of the United States to avail themſelves of the right of redemption reſerved in the plan: The other is, that with regard to the part to be funded at the end of ten years, the principle of redemption is ſuſpended during that time, and the full intereſt at ſix per cent. goes on <hi>improving</hi> at the <hi>ſam
<pb n="14"
                      facs="unknown:022998_0013_0FBAD38F57310300"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
rate;</hi> which for the <hi>laſt five years</hi> will exceed the market rate of intereſt, according to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>The equivalent is regulated in this plan, by the circumſtance of fixing the rate of intereſt higher, than it is ſuppoſed it will continue to be in the market; permitting only a gradual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the debt, in an eſtabliſhed proportion, and conſequently preventing advantage being taken of any decreaſe of intereſt below the ſtipulated rate.</p>
            <p>Thus the true value of eighty-one dollars and ſixty-ſeven cents, the capital propoſed, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a perpetuity, and bearing ſix per cent. intereſt, when the market rate of intereſt was five per cent. would be a ſmall fraction more than ninety-eight dollars, when it was four per cent. would be one hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifty-one cents. But the propoſed capital being ſubject to gradual redemption, it is evident, that its value, in each caſe, would be ſomewhat leſs. Yet from this may be perceived, the manner in which a leſs capital at a fixed rate of intereſt, becomes an equivalent for a greater capital, at a rate liable to variation and diminution.</p>
            <p>It is preſumable, that thoſe creditors, who do not entertain a favorable opinion of property in weſtern lands, will give a preference to this laſt mode of modelling the debt. The Secretary is ſincere in affirming, that, in his opinion, it will be likely to prove, <hi>to the full</hi> as beneficial to the creditors, as a proviſion for his debt upon its preſent terms.</p>
            <p>It is not intended, in either caſe to oblige the government to redeem, in the proportion ſpecified, but to ſecure to it, the right of doing ſo, to avoid the inconvenience of a perpetuity.</p>
            <p>The fourth and fifth plans abandon the ſuppoſition which is the baſis of the two preceding ones, and offer only four per cent. throughout.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is, that the payment being deferred, there will be an accumulation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound intereſt, in the intermediate period againſt the public, which, without a very provident adminiſtration, would turn to its detriment. And the ſuſpenſion of the burthen would be too apt to beget a relaxation of efforts in the mean time. The meaſure therefore, its object being temporary accommodation, could only be adviſeable upon a moderate rate of intereſt.</p>
            <p>With regard to individuals, the inducement will be ſufficient at four per cent. There is no diſpoſition of money, in private loans, making allowance for the uſual delays and caſualties, which would be equally beneficial as a future proviſion.</p>

            <p>The annuities of thoſe who die, to be equally divided among the ſurvivors, until four-fifths ſhall be dead, when the principle of ſurvivorſhip ſhall ceaſe, and each annuitant thenceforth enjoy his dividend as a ſeveral annuity during the life, upon which it ſhall depend.</p>
            <p>Theſe annuities are calculated on the beſt life in each claſs, and at a rate of intereſt of four per cent. with ſome deductions in favor of the public. To the advantages which theſe circumſtances preſent, the ceſſation of the right of ſurvivorſhip on the death of four-fifths of the annuitants, will be no inconſiderable addition.</p>
            <p>The inducements to individuals are, a competent intereſt for their money from the outſet, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for life, and the proſpect of continual encreaſe, and even of large profit to thoſe, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune it is, to ſurvive their aſſociates.</p>
            <p>It will have appeared, that in all the propoſed loans, the Secretary has contemplated the putting the intereſt upon the ſame footing with the principal: <hi>That</hi> on the debt of the United States, he would have computed to the laſt of the preſent year: <hi>That</hi> on the debt of the particular ſtates, to the laſt of the year 1791; the reaſon for which diſtinction will be ſeen hereafter.</p>
            <p>In order to keep up a due circulation of money, it will be expedient, that the intereſt of the debt ſhould be paid quarter-yearly. This regulation will, at the ſame time, conduce to the advantage of the public creditors, giving them, in fact, by the anticipation of payment, a higher rate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; which may, with propriety, be taken into the eſtimate of the compenſation to be made to them. Six per cent. per annum, paid in this mode, will truly be worth ſix dollars, and one hundred and thirty-five thouſandth parts of a dollar, computing the market intereſt at the ſame rate.</p>
            <p>The Secretary thinks it adviſable, to hold out various propoſitions, all of them compatible with the public intereſt, becauſe it is, in his opinion, of the greateſt conſequence, that the debt ſhould, with the conſent of the creditors, be remoulded into ſuch a ſhape, as will bring the expenditure of the nation to a level with its income. 'Till this ſhall be accompliſhed, the finances of the United States will never wear a proper countenance. Arrears of intereſt, continually accruing, will be as continual a monument, either of inability, or of ill faith; and will not ceaſe to have an evil influence on public credit. In nothing are appearances of greater moment, than in whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards credit. Opinion is the ſoul of it, and this is affected by appearances, as well as realities. By offering an option to the creditors, between a number of plans, the change medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated will be more likely to be accompliſhed. Different tempers will be governed by different views of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But while the Secretary would endeavour to effect a change in the form of the debt, by new loans, in order to render it more ſuſceptible of an adequate proviſion; he would not think it proper to aim at procuring the concurrence of the creditors by operating upon their neceſſities.</p>
            <p>Hence whatever ſurplus of revenue might remain, after ſatisfying the intereſt of the new loans, and the demand for the current ſervice, ought to be divided among thoſe creditors, if any, who may not think fit to ſubſcribe to them. But for this purpoſe, under the circumſtance of depending propoſitions, a temporary appropriation will be moſt adviſeable, and the ſum muſt be limited to four per cent. as the revenues will only be calculated to produce, in that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the entire debt.</p>
            <p>The Secretary confides for the ſucceſs of the propoſitions, to be made, on the goodneſs of the reaſons upon which they reſt; on the fairneſs of the equivalent to be offered in each caſe; on the diſcernment of the creditors of their true intereſt; and on their diſpoſition to facilitate the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements of the government, and to render them ſatisfactory to the community.</p>
            <p>The remaining part of the taſk to be performed is, to take a view of the means of providing for the debt, according to the modification of it, which is propoſed.</p>
            <p>On this point the Secretary premiſes, that, in his opinion, the funds to be eſtabliſhed, ought, for the preſent, to be confined to the exiſting debt of the United States; as well, becauſe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive augmentation of the revenue will be moſt convenient, as becauſe the conſent of the ſtate creditors is neceſſary, to the aſſumption contemplated; and though the obtaining of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent may be inferred with great aſſurance, from their obvious intereſt to give it; yet 'till it ſhall be obtained, an actual proviſion for the debt, would be premature. Taxes could not, with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, be laid for an object, which depended on ſuch a contingency.</p>

For which purpoſe, the Secretary will, in the courſe of this report, ſubmit ſuch propoſitions, as appear to him adviſeable.</p>
            <p>The Secretary now proceeds to a conſideration of the neceſſary funds.</p>

            <p>For, though the rate of intereſt, propoſed by the third plan, exceeds four per cent. on the whole debt, and the annuities on the tontine will alſo exceed four per cent. on the ſums which may be ſubſcribed; yet, as the actual proviſion for a part is, in the former caſe, ſuſpended; as meaſures for reducing the debt, by purchaſes, may be advantageouſly purſued, and as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the deferred annuities will of courſe be poſtponed, four per cent. on the whole, will be a ſufficient proviſion.</p>
            <p>With regard to the inſtalments of the foreign debt, theſe, in the opinion of the Secretary, ought to be paid by new loans abroad. Could funds be conveniently ſpared, from other exigencies, for paying them, the United States could ill bear the drain of caſh, at the preſent juncture, which the meaſure would be likely to occaſion.</p>
            <p>But to the ſum which has been ſtated for payment of the intereſt, muſt be added a proviſion for the current ſervice. This the Secretary eſtimates at ſix hundred thouſand dollars; <note n="*" place="bottom">See Schedule <hi>I.</hi>
               </note> making, with the amount of the intereſt, two millions, eight hundred and thirty-nine thouſand, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty-three dollars, and nine cents.</p>
            <p>This ſum may, in the opinion of the Secretary, be obtained from the preſent duties on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and tonnage, with the additions, which, without any poſſible diſadvantage either to trade, or agriculture, may be made on wines, ſpirits, including thoſe diſtilled within the United States, teas and coffee.</p>
            <p>The Secretary conceives, that it will be ſound policy, to carry the duties upon articles of this kind, as high as will be conſiſtent with the practicability of a ſafe collection. This will leſſen the neceſſity, both of having recourſe to direct taxation, and of accumulating duties where they would be more inconvenient to trade, and upon objects, which are more to be regarded as neceſſaries of life.</p>
            <p>That the articles which have been enumerated, will, better than moſt others, bear high duties, can hardly be a queſtion. They are all of them, in reality—luxuries—the greateſt part of them foreign luxuries; ſome of them, in the exceſs in which they are uſed, pernicious luxuries. And there is, perhaps, none of them, which is not conſumed in ſo great abundance, as may, juſtly, denominate it, a ſource of national extravagance and impoveriſhment. The conſumption of ardent ſpirits particularly, no doubt very much on account of their cheapneſs, is carried to an extreme, which is truly to be regretted, as well in regard to the health and the morals, as to the oeconomy of the community.</p>
            <p>Should the increaſe of duties tend to a decreaſe of the conſumption of thoſe articles, the effect would be, in every reſpect deſireable. The ſaving which it would occaſion, would leave indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals more at their eaſe, and promote a more favourable balance of trade. As far as this decreaſe might be applicable to diſtilled ſpirits, it would encourage the ſubſtitution of cyder and malt liquors, benefit agriculture, and open a new and productive ſource of revenue.</p>
            <p>It is not however, probable, that this decreaſe would be in a degree, which would fruſtrate the expected benefit to the revenue from raiſing the duties. Experience has ſhewn, that luxuries of every kind, lay the ſtrongeſt hold on the attachments of mankind, which, eſpecially when confirmed by habit, are not eaſily alienated from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:022998_0016_0FBAD3952DBD9070"/>The ſame fact affords a ſecurity to the merchant, that he is not likely to be prejudiced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable duties on ſuch articles. They will uſually command a proportional price. The chief things in this view to be attended to, are, that the terms of payment be ſo regulated, as not to require inconvenient advances, and that the mode of collection be ſecure.</p>
            <p>To other reaſons, which plead for carrying the duties upon the articles which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to as great an extent as they will well bear, may be added theſe; that they are of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from their extenſive conſumption, to be very productive, and are amongſt the moſt difficult objects of illicit introduction.</p>
            <p>Invited by ſo many motives to make the beſt uſe of the reſource, which theſe articles afford, the eſſential enquiry is—in what mode can the duties upon them be moſt effectually collected?</p>
            <p>With regard to ſuch of them, as will be brought from abroad, a duty on importation recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends itſelf by two leading conſiderations; one is, that meeting the object at its firſt entrance into the country, the collection is drawn to a point, and ſo far ſimplified; the other is, that it avoids the poſſibility of interference between the regulations of the United States, and thoſe of the particular ſtates.</p>
            <p>But a duty, the precautions for the collection of which ſhould terminate with the landing of the goods, as is eſſentially the caſe in the exiſting ſyſtem, could not, with ſafety, be carried to the extent, which is contemplated.</p>
            <p>In that ſyſtem, the evaſion of the duties, depends as it were, on a ſingle riſk. To land the goods in defiance of the vigilance of the officers of the cuſtoms, is almoſt, the ſole difficulty. No future purſuit, is materially, to be apprehended. And where the inducement is equivalent to the riſk, there will be found too many, who are willing to run it. Conſequently there will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive frauds of the revenue, againſt which the utmoſt rigor of penal laws, has proved, as often as it has been tried, an ineffectual guard.</p>
            <p>The only expedient which has been diſcovered, for conciliating high duties with a ſafe collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>ſecond</hi>; or interior ſcrunity.</p>
            <p>By purſuing the article, from its importation, into the hands of the dealers in it, the riſk of detection is ſo greatly inhanced, that few, in compariſon, will venture to incur it. Indeed every dealer, who is not himſelf the fraudulent importer, then becomes, in ſome ſort, a centinel upon him.</p>
            <p>The introduction of a ſyſtem, founded on this principle, in ſome ſhape or other, is, in the opinion of the Secretary, eſſential to the efficacy of every attempt, to render the revenues of the United States equal to their exigencies, their ſafety, their proſperity, their honor.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs eſſential to the intereſt of the honeſt and fair trader. It might even be added, that every individual citizen, beſides his ſhare in the general weal, has a particular intereſt in it. The practice of ſmuggling never fails to have one of two effects, and ſometimes unites them both. Either the ſmuggler underſells the fair trader, as, by ſaving the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> he can afford to do, and makes <hi>it</hi> a charge upon him; or he ſells at the increaſed price occaſioned by the duty, and defrauds every man, who buys of him, of his ſhare of what the public ought to receive. For it is evident, that the loſs falls ultimately upon the citizens, who muſt be charged with other taxes to make good the deficiency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſupply the wants of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The Secretary will not preſume, that the plan; which he ſhall ſubmit to the conſideration of the houſe, is the beſt that could be deviſed. But it is the one, which has appeared to him freeſt from objections of any, that has occurred of equal efficacy. He acknowledges too, that it is ſuſceptible of improvement, by other precautions in favor of the revenue, which he did not think it expedient to add. The chief outlines of the plan are not original, but it is no ill recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it, that it has been tried with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The Secretary accordingly propoſes,</p>
            <p>That the duties heretofore laid upon wines, diſtilled ſpirits, teas and coffee, ſhould, after the laſt day of May next, ceaſe, and that inſtead of them, the following duties be laid.—</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of Madeira Wine, of the quality of London particular, thirty-five cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of other Madeirs Wine, thirty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of Sherry, twenty-five cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of other Wine, twenty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of diſtilled Spirits, more than ten per cent. below proof, according to Dicas's hydrometer, twenty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits under five, and not more than ten per cent. below proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, twenty-one cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits of proof, and not more than five per cent. below proof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame hydrometer, twenty-two cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. according to the ſame hydrometer, twenty-five cents.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:022998_0017_0FBAD396CA717A28"/>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, thirty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, forty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every pound of Hyſon Tea, forty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every pound of other Green Tea, twenty-four cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every pound of Souchong and other black Teas, except Bohea, twenty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every pound of Bohea Tea, twelve cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every pound of Coffee, five cents.</p>
            <p>That upon Spirits diſtilled within the United States, from Molaſſes, Sugar, or other foreign ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, there be paid—</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits, more than ten per cent below proof, according to Dicas's hydrometer, eleven cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits under five, and not more than ten per cent. below proof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame hydrometer, twelve cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits of proof, and not more than five per cent. below proof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame hydrometer, thirteen cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits, above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame hydrometer, fifteen cents,</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits, more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, twenty cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, thirty cents.</p>
            <p>That upon Spirits diſtilled within the United States, in any city, town or village, from materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the growth or production of the United States, there be paid—</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits more than ten per cent. below proof, according to Dicas's hydrometer, nine cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits under five, and not more than ten per cent. below proof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame hydrometer, ten cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits of proof, and not more than five per cent. below proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, eleven cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. according to the ſame hydrometer, thirteen cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, ſeventeen cents.</p>
            <p>Upon every gallon of thoſe Spirits, more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the ſame hydrometer, twenty-five cents.</p>
            <p>That upon all Stills employed in diſtilling Spirits from materials of the growth or production of the United States, in any other place, than a city, town or village, there be paid the yearly ſum of ſixty cents, for every gallon, Engliſh wine meaſure, of the capacity of each Still, including its head.</p>
            <p>The Secretary does not diſtribute the duties on Teas into different claſſes, as has been done in the impoſt act of the laſt ſeſſion; becauſe this diſtribution depends on conſiderations of commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial policy, not of revenue. It is ſufficient, therefore, for him to remark, that the rates, above ſpecified, are propoſed with reference to the loweſt claſs.</p>
            <p>The Secretary conceiving, that he could not convey an accurate idea of the plan contemplated by him, for the collection of theſe duties, in any mode ſo effectual as by the draft of a bill for the purpoſe, begs leave reſpectfully to refer the Houſe to that, which will be found annexed to this report, relatively to the article of diſtilled ſpirits; and which, for the better explanation of ſome of its parts, is accompanied with marginal remarks.</p>
            <p>It would be the intention of the Secretary, that the duty on wines ſhould be collected upon preciſely the ſame plan with that on imported ſpirits.</p>
            <p>But with regard to teas and coffee, the Secretary is inclined to think, that it will be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, till experience ſhall evince the propriety of going further, to exclude the <hi>ordinary</hi> right of the officers to viſit and inſpect the places in which thoſe articles may be kept. The other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, without this, will afford, though not complete, conſiderable ſecurity.</p>
            <p>It will not eſcape the obſervation of the Houſe, that the Secretary, in the plan ſubmitted, has taken the moſt ſcrupulous care, that thoſe citizens upon whom it is immediately to operate, be ſecured from every ſpecies of injury by the miſconduct of the officers to be employed. There are not only ſtrong guards againſt their being guilty of abuſes of authority; they are not only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable, criminally, for any they may commit, and made anſwerable in damages, to individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, for whatever prejudice theſe may ſuſtain by their acts or neglects: But even where ſeizures
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022998_0018_0FBAD3982EB40E00"/>
are made with probable cauſe, if there be an acquittal of the article ſeized, a compenſation to the proprietors for the injury their property may ſuffer, and even for its detention, is to be made out of the public treaſury.</p>
            <p>So ſolicitous indeed has the Secretary been, to obviate every appearance of hardſhip, that he has even included a compenſation to the dealers, for their agency in aid of the revenue.</p>
            <p>With all theſe precautions to manifeſt a ſpirit of moderation and juſtice on the part of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: And when it is conſidered, that the object of the propoſed ſyſtem is the firm eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of public credit; that on this depends the character, ſecurity and proſperity of the nation; that advantages in every light important, may be expected to reſult from it; that the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate operation of it will be upon an enlightened claſs of citizens, zealouſly devoted to good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to a liberal and enlarged policy, and that it is peculiarly the intereſt of the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of them to co-operate in whatever will reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rain the ſpirit of illicit traffic; there will be perceived to exiſt, the juſteſt ground of confidence, that the plan, if eligible in itſelf, will expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the chearful and prompt acquieſcence of the community.</p>
            <p>The Secretary computes the nett product of the duties propoſed in this report at about one mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſeven hundred and three thouſand four hundred dollars, according to the eſtimate in the ſchedule K, which if near the truth, will, together with the probable product of the duties on imports and tonnage, complete the ſum required. But it will readily occur, that in ſo unexplored a field there muſt be a conſiderable degree of uncertainty in the data. And that, on this account, it will be prudent to have an auxiliary reſource for the firſt year, in which the intereſt will become payable, that there may be no poſſibility of diſappointment to the public creditors, ere there may be an opportunity of providing for any deficiency, which the experiment may diſcover. This will accordingly be attended to.</p>
            <p>The proper appropriation of the funds provided, and to be provided, ſeems next to offer itſelf to conſideration.</p>
            <p>On this head, the Secretary would propoſe, that the duties on diſtilled ſpirits, ſhould be applied in the firſt inſtance, to the payment of the intereſt of the foreign debt.</p>
            <p>That reſerving out of the reſidue of thoſe duties an annual ſum of ſix hundred thouſand dollars, for the current ſervice of the United States; the ſurplus, together with the product of the other duties, be applied to the payment of the intereſt on the new loan, by an appopriation, co-extenſive with the duration of the debt.</p>
            <p>And that if any part of the debt ſhould remain unſubſcribed, the exceſs of the revenue be divided among the creditors of the unſubſcribed part, by a temporary diſpoſition; with a limitation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to four per cent.</p>
            <p>It will hardly have been unnoticed, that the Secretary has been thus far ſilent on the ſubject of the poſt-office. The reaſon is, that he has had in view the application of the revenue ariſing from that ſource, to the purpoſes of a ſinking fund. The poſt-maſter-general gives it as his opinion, that the immediate product of it, upon a proper arrangement, would probably be, not leſs than one hundred thouſand dollars. And from its nature, with good management, it muſt be a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will be likely to become a conſiderable fund. The poſt-maſter-general is now engaged in preparing a plan,<note n="*" place="bottom">This plan, ſince the framing of this report, has been received, and will be, ſhortly, ſubmitted.</note> which will be the foundation of a propoſition for a new arrangement of the eſtabliſhment. This, and ſome other points relative to the ſubject referred to the Secretary, he begs leave to reſerve for a future report.</p>
            <p>Perſuaded as the Secretary is, that the proper funding of the preſent debt, will render it a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional bleſſing: Yet he is ſo far from acceding to the poſition, in the latitude in which it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times laid down, that "public debts are public benefits," a poſition inviting to prodigality, and liable to dangerous abuſe,—that he ardently wiſhes to ſee it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim, in the ſyſtem of public credit of the United States, that the creation of debt ſhould always be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the means of extinguiſhment. This he regards as the true ſecret for rendering public credit immortal. And he preſumes, that it is difficult to conceive a ſituation, in which there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At leaſt he feels an unfeigned ſolicitude, that this may be attempted by the United States, and that they may commence their meaſures for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of credit, with the obſervance of it.</p>
            <p>Under this impreſſion, the Secretary propoſes, that the nett product of the poſt-office, to a ſum not exceeding one million of dollars, be veſted in commiſſioners, to conſiſt of the Vice-Preſident of the United States or Preſident of the Senate, the Speaker of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, the Chief Juſtice, Secretary of the Treaſury and Attorney-General of the United States, for the time being, in truſt, to be applied, by them, or any three of them, to the diſcharge of the exiſting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt, either by purchaſes of ſtock in the market, or by payments on account of the principal,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022998_0019_0FBAD399AF62A168"/>
as ſhall appear to them moſt adviſeable, in conformity to the public engagements; to continue ſo veſted, until the whole of the debt ſhall be diſcharged.</p>
            <p>As an additional expedient for effecting a reduction of the debt, and for other purpoſes which will be mentioned, the Secretary would further propoſe that the ſame commiſſioners be authoriſed, with the approbation of the Preſident of the United States, to borrow, on their credit, a ſum, not exceeding twelve millions of dollars, to be applied,</p>
            <p>Firſt. To the payment of the intereſt and inſtalments of the foreign debt, to the end of the preſent year, which will require 3,491,923 dollars, and 46 cents.</p>
            <p>Secondly. To the payment of any deficiency which may happen in the product of the funds provided for paying the intereſt of the domeſtic debt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. To the effecting a change in the form of ſuch part of the foreign debt, as bears an intereſt of five per cent. It is conceived, that, for this purpoſe, a new loan, at a lower intereſt, may be combined with other expedients. The remainder of this part of the debt, after paying the inſtalments, which will accrue in the courſe of 1790, will be 3,888,888 dollars, and 81 cents.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. To the purchaſe of the public debt at the price it ſhall bear in the market, while it continues below its true value. This meaſure, which would be, in the opinion of the Secretary, highly diſhonorable to the government, if it were to precede a proviſion for funding the debt, would become altogether unexceptionable, after that had been made. Its effect would be in favor of the public creditors, as it would tend to raiſe the value of ſtock. And all the difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its true value, and the actual price, would be ſo much clear gain to the public. The pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foreign intereſt on the capital to be borrowed for this purpoſe, ſhould that be a neceſſary conſequence, would not, in the judgment of the Secretary, be a good objection to the meaſure. The ſaving by the operation would be itſelf, a ſufficient indemnity; and the employment of that capital, in a country ſituated like this, would much more than compenſate for it. Beſides, if the government does not undertake this operation, the ſame inconvenience, which the objection in queſtion ſuppoſes, would happen in another way, with a circumſtance of aggravation. As long, at leaſt, as the debt ſhall continue below its proper value, it will be an object of ſpeculation to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, who will not only receive the intereſt, upon what they purchaſe, and remit it abroad, as in the caſe of the loan, but will reap the additional profit of the difference in value. By the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's entering into competition with them, it will not only reap a part of this profit itſelf, but will contract the extent, and leſſen the extra profit of foreign purchaſes. That competition will accelerate the riſe of ſtock; and whatever greater rate this obliges foreigners to pay, for what they purchaſe, is ſo much clear ſaving to the nation. In the opinion of the Secretary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an idea which is not without patrons, it ought to be the policy of the government, to raiſe the value of ſtock to its true ſtandard as faſt as poſſible. When it arrives to that point, foreign ſpeculations (which, till then, muſt be deemed pernicious, further than as they ſerve to bring it to that point) will become beneficial. Their money laid out in this country, upon our agriculture, commerce and manufactures, will produce much more to us, than the income they will receive from it.</p>
            <p>The Secretary contemplates the application of this money, through the medium of a national bank, for which, with the permiſſion of the Houſe, he will ſubmit a plan in the courſe of the ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Secretary now proceeds, in the laſt place, to offer to the conſideration of the Houſe, his ideas, of the ſteps, which ought at the preſent ſeſſion, to be taken, towards the aſſumption of the ſtate debts.</p>
            <p>Theſe are briefly, that concurrent reſolutions of the two Houſes, with the approbation of the Preſident, be entered into, declaring in ſubſtance,</p>
            <p>That the United States do aſſume, and will at the firſt ſeſſion in the year 1791, provide, on the ſame terms with the preſent debt of the United States, for all ſuch part of the debts of the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtates, or any of them, as ſhall, prior to the firſt day of January in the ſaid year 1791, be ſubſcribed towards a loan to the United States, upon the principles of either of the plans, which ſhall have been adopted by them, for obtaining a re-loan of their preſent debt.</p>
            <p>Provided that the proviſion to be made as aforeſaid, ſhall be ſuſpended, with reſpect to the debt, of any ſtate, which may have exchanged the ſecurities of the United States for others iſſued by itſelf, until the whole of the ſaid ſecurities ſhall, either be re-exchanged, or ſurrendered to the United States.</p>
            <p>And provided alſo, that the intereſt upon the debt aſſumed, be computed to the end of the year 1791; and that the intereſt to be paid by the United States, commence on the firſt day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>That the amount of the debt of each ſtate ſo aſſumed and provided for, be charged to ſuch ſtate

in account with the United States, upon the ſame principles, upon which it ſhall be lent to the United States.</p>
            <p>That ſubſcriptions be opened for receiving loans of the ſaid debts at the ſame times and places, and under the like regulations, as ſhall have been preſcribed in relation to the debt of the United States.</p>
            <p>The Secretary has now completed the objects, which he propoſed to himſelf, to compriſe in the preſent report. He has, for the moſt part, omitted details, as well to avoid fatiguing the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Houſe, as becauſe more time would have been deſirable even to digeſt the general principles of the plan. If theſe ſhould be found right, the particular modifications will readily ſuggeſt themſelves in the progreſs of the work.</p>
            <p>The Secretary, in the views which have directed his purſuit of the ſubject, has been influenced, in the firſt place, by the conſideration, that his duty from the very terms of the reſolution of the Houſe, obliged him to propoſe what appeared to him an adequate proviſion for the ſupport of the public credit, adapted at the ſame time to the real circumſtances of the United States; and in the next, by the reflection, that meaſures which will not bear the teſt of future unbiaſſed examination, can neither be productive of individual reputation, nor (which is of much greater conſequence) public honor, or advantage.</p>
            <p>Deeply impreſſed, as the Secretary is, with a full and deliberate conviction, that the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of public credit, upon the baſis of a ſatisfactory proviſion, for the public debt, is, under the preſent circumſtances of this country, the true deſideratum towards relief from individual and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional embarraſſments; that without it, theſe embarraſſments will be likely to preſs ſtill more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely upon the community—He cannot but indulge an anxious wiſh, that an effectual plan for that purpoſe may, during the preſent ſeſſion, be the reſult of the united wiſdom of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>He is fully convinced, that it is of the greateſt importance, that no further delay ſhould attend the making of the requiſite proviſion; not only, becauſe it will give a better impreſſion of the good faith of the country, and will bring earlier relief to the creditors; both which circumſtances are of great moment to public credit: but, becauſe the advantages to the community, from raiſing ſtock, as ſpeedily as poſſible, to its natural value, will be incomparably greater, than any that can reſult from its continuance below that ſtandard. No profit, which could be derived from purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the market, on account of the government, to any practicable extent, would be an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for the loſs, which would be ſuſtained by the purchaſes of foreigners, at a low value. Not to repeat, that governmental purchaſes, to be honorable, ought to be preceded by a proviſion. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, by diſſeminating doubt, would ſink the price of ſtock; and as the temptation to foreign ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, from the lowneſs of the price, would be too great to be neglected, millions would probably be loſt to the United States.</p>

               <p n="1">I. BE it enacted by the Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States of America in Congreſs aſſembled,<note n="*" place="bottom">The four firſt of theſe claſſes of proof correſpond with the different kinds of ſpirits now uſually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: The firſt with gin; the ſecond with St. Croix rum; the third with Antigua rum; the fourth with Jamaica ſpirits; the fifth correſponds with the uſual proof of high wines; the laſt with that of Alcohol.

               <p n="1">1ſt. For every gallon of thoſe ſpirits more than ten per cent. below proof, according to Dicas's hydrometer, twenty cents.</p>

And be it further enacted,<note n="†" place="bottom">The extenſion of the time is for the accommodation of the merchants in conſideration of the encreaſed rate.—It is propoſed to reduce the diſcount, becauſe ten per cent. is more than either the intereſt of money, or the riſk of non-payment ſeems to warrant. Generally ſpeaking, tranſient perſons are thoſe who avail themſelves of the advantage; and they, without it, would commonly pay down, from the inconvenience of procuring and leaving ſureties.</note> that the ſaid duties at the option of the proprietor, importer or conſignee, may either be paid immediately, or ſecured by bond, with one or more ſureties, to the ſatisfaction of the collector, or perſon acting as ſuch, with condition for the payment of one moiety in four months, and the other moiety in eight months: Provided that where the ſaid duties ſhall not exceed fifty dollars, the ſame ſhall be immediately paid; and that where the ſame ſhall exceed fifty dollars, if the ſaid proprietor, importer or conſignee ſhall think fit to make preſent payment thereof, there ſhall be an abatement to him or her, at the rate of ſeven per cent per annum, only for ſuch preſent payment, the allowance of ten per cent. in the ſaid former act notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And as not only a due regard to the exigencies of the public, and to the intereſt and eaſe of the community, but juſtice to thoſe virtuous citizens, who, content with the emoluments of fair and honorable trade, diſdain to violate the laws of their country, and the principles of probity, requires that every poſſible impediment ſhould be oppoſed to the fraudulent views of thoſe who wiſh to profit at the expence both of the fair trader and of the community—</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Be it further enacted,<note n="‡" place="bottom">This appears to be the only practicable method of compaſſing the details of ſo complicated a buſineſs.</note> that the Preſident of the United States of America, be authoriſed to appoint, with the advice and conſent of the Senate, ſuch number of officers as ſhall appear to him neceſſary, to be denominated Inſpectors of the revenue; and to aſſign to them reſpectively ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts or limits for the exerciſe of their reſpective offices, as he ſhall judge beſt adapted to the due execution thereof; dividing the diſtricts, if he ſhall think it adviſeable, into general and particular, and placing the Inſpectors of the latter under the ſuperintendance of the former, within the limits whereof they ſhall be reſpectively comprehended; and alſo to make ſuch allowances to the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors, and to the Deputies and officers by them appointed and employed for their reſpective ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the execution of this act, to be paid out of the product of the ſaid duties, as ſhall be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

               <p n="5">V. And be it further enacted, that the Inſpector or Inſpectors of the revenue for each diſtrict, ſhall eſtabliſh one or more offices within the ſame, and that there ſhall be one at leaſt at each port of delivery; and in order that the ſaid offices may be publicly known, there ſhall be painted or written, in large legible characters, upon ſome conſpicuous part outſide and in front of each houſe building or place in which any ſuch office ſhall be kept, theſe words, "Office of Inſpection;" and if any perſon ſhall paint or write, or cauſe to be painted or written, the ſaid words, upon any other than ſuch houſe or building, he or ſhe ſhall forfeit and pay for ſo doing, one hundred dollars.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. And be it further enacted, that within forty-eight hours after any ſhip or veſſel, having on board and diſtilled Spirits brought in ſuch ſhip or veſſel from any foreign port or place, ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive within any port of the United States, whether the ſame be the firſt port of arrival of ſuch ſhip or veſſel or not; the maſter or perſon having the command or charge thereof, ſhall report to the Inſpector or other chief officer of Inſpection of the port at which ſhe ſhall ſo arrive, the place from which ſhe laſt ſailed with her name and burthen and the quantity and kinds of the ſaid ſpirits on board of her, and the caſks or caſes containing them, with their marks and numbers on pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting five hundred dollars.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. And be it further enacted, that the Collector or other officer, or perſon acting as Collector of any port, with whom entry ſhall have been made of any of the ſaid ſpirits, purſuant to the ſaid act laying a duty on goods, wares and merchandizes imported into the United States, ſhall forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with after ſuch entry certify and tranſmit the ſame, as particularly as it ſhall have been made with him, to the Inſpector of the revenue, or other proper officer of inſpection, of the port where it ſhall be intended to commence the delivery of the ſpirits ſo entered, or any part thereof; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, every proprietor, importer or conſignee, making ſuch entry, ſhall deliver two manifeſts or contents (upon one of which the ſaid certificate ſhall be given) and ſhall at the time thereof declare the port at which the ſaid delivery ſhall be ſo intended to be commenced, to the Collector or officer with whom the ſame ſhall be made. And every permit granted by ſuch Collector for the landing of any of the ſaid ſpirits, ſhall previous to ſuch landing be produced to the ſaid officer of inſpection, who ſhall make a minute in ſome proper book, of the contents thereof, and ſhall indorſe thereupon the word "Inſpected," the time when, and his own name, after which he ſhall return it to the perſon by whom it ſhall have been produced; and then, and not otherwiſe, it ſhall be lawful to land the ſpirits therein ſpecified; and if the ſaid ſpirits ſhall be landed without ſuch indorſement upon the permit for that purpoſe granted, the maſter or perſon having charge of the ſhip or veſſel, from which the ſame ſhall have been ſo landed, ſhall for every ſuch offence forfeit the ſum of five hundred dollars.</p>

And the maſter or perſon having the command or charge of ſuch ſhip or veſſel, ſhall, within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four hours after her arrival at the port to which ſhe ſhall be bound, deliver the ſaid certificate to the proper officer of inſpection of ſuch laſt mentioned port. And if ſuch ſhip or veſſel ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one port to another within the United States, with the whole or any part of the ſpirits brought in her as aforeſaid, without having firſt obtained ſuch certificate; or if within twenty-four hours after her arrival at ſuch other port, the ſaid certificate ſhall not be delivered to the proper offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of inſpection there, the maſter or perſon having the command or charge of the ſaid ſhip or veſſel, ſhall in either caſe forfeit five hundred dollars; and the ſpirits on board of her at her ſaid arrival, ſhall be forfeited, and may be ſeized by any officer of inſpection.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. And be it further enacted, That all ſpirits which ſhall be imported as aforeſaid, ſhall be landed under the inſpection of the officer or officers of inſpection for the place where the ſame ſhall be landed, and not otherwiſe, on pain of forfeiture thereof, for which purpoſe the ſaid officer or officers ſhall at all reaſonable times attend: Provided that this ſhall not be conſtrued to exclude the inſpection of the officers of the cuſtoms as now eſtabliſhed and practiſed.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And be it further enacted, That the officers of inſpection, under whoſe ſurvey any of the ſaid ſpirits ſhall be landed, ſhall, upon landing thereof, and as ſoon as the caſks and caſes contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſhall be guaged or meaſured, brand or otherwiſe mark in durable characters, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

               <p n="11">XI.
