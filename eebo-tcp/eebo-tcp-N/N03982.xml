            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS is one of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms of Praiſe, and it begins magnificently; "<hi>I will praiſe Thee with my whole Heart, before the Gods will I ſing Praiſe unto Thee.</hi> Whether we <hi>pray</hi> to GOD or <hi>praiſe</hi> Him, it ſhould be with our <hi>whole Heart;</hi> with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Devotion of our Souls, all the Faculties and Powers of them being exerted.

            </p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>David</hi> wrote to <hi>Hiram</hi> of the Greatneſs of the <hi>GOD of Iſrael,</hi> and when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhew'd the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> how he went up to the Houſe of GOD; then was this Scripture alſo fulfilled in the very Letter; "<hi>before the Gods will I praiſe Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> goes on, "I will worſhip toward thy holy <hi>Temple,</hi> and praiſe thy Name for thy <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> and for thy <hi>Truth.</hi>" The <hi>Temple</hi> was yet to be built, but the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> or Sanctuary was the ſame Thing to GOD and his Worſhippers; and thither they went at the appointed <hi>Times</hi> with the Voice of Praiſe; or if they were at a Diſtance, they worſhipped <hi>toward</hi> the Place, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did even when it lay in Ruins. <q>
                  <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Holy-place where GOD dwells, and thither we direct our Prayers and look <hi>up;</hi> and CHRIST is our Temple there, and to HIM at the FATHER's <hi>right Hand</hi> we lift up our Souls, and <hi>look</hi> by an Eye of Faith, and our ſpiritual <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> are acceptable.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Praiſe follows, "<hi>for thy Loving-kindneſs and Truth.</hi> Theſe are a ſpecial Part of his <hi>Glory</hi> paſſing before us; "<hi>abundant in Goodneſs and in Truth.</hi> — By <hi>Truth</hi> is meant the <hi>Promiſes</hi> that GOD had made and fulfilled to <hi>David;</hi> in the making and performing of which the <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> of GOD was glorious; <hi>freely</hi> made, and all made <hi>good;</hi> all of Grace, Mercy and Truth, which <hi>David</hi> reſolves never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, but ever to give GOD the <hi>Praiſe</hi> of. GOD had promiſed him the <hi>Throne,</hi> and had <hi>ſet</hi> him on it, and now ſays he — "<hi>Before</hi> the Princes <hi>will I ſing Praiſe to Thee, for thy Loving-kindneſs and for thy Truth.</hi>

MY <hi>Text</hi> follows, "<hi>For thou haſt magnified thy WORD above all thy Name.</hi> — GOD's NAME is <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent</hi> in every glorious <hi>Attribute</hi> and Perfection. He <hi>has</hi> magnified it, and <hi>will</hi> magnify it again. It is <hi>Great</hi> above all the Praiſes of Men and Angels.</p>
            <p>IN a particular Manner GOD has magnified his <hi>Truth,</hi> that bleſſed and Divine <hi>Perfection;</hi> and it is <hi>exalted</hi> infinitely above all that Men can ſay or think of it: The <hi>Name</hi> of GOD is <hi>in it;</hi> it is revealed and magnified to us in his <hi>Word:</hi> There eſpecially is the Exhibition of his <hi>Loving-kindneſs</hi> to the Children of Men. <q>The <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD to Mankind, <hi>hid in Him</hi> from before the Foundation of the World is his <hi>Loving-kindneſs;</hi> the <hi>Mercy revealed</hi> to us in his <hi>Word</hi> is his <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IN magnificent Manner GOD has made his <hi>Name,</hi> Himſelf, known to us <q>in the <hi>Works of Creation and Providence;</hi> but moſt of all in his <hi>Word:</hi> The Wonders of <hi>Grace</hi> exceed thoſe of <hi>Nature;</hi> the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries by <hi>Revelation</hi> are much greater than thoſe by Reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL ſpeak of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of GOD in <hi>general;</hi> taking in the Doctrines, Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings, Prophecies and Hiſtory of <hi>Scripture;</hi> all which is written for our <hi>Learning,</hi> and to make us <hi>wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> In <hi>all</hi> of them together the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is <hi>magnified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>magnify</hi> a Thing is to make it <hi>great, famous, illuſtrious,</hi> and to put <hi>high Honour</hi> on it. So GOD <hi>has magnified the Law and made it honourable.</hi> Iſai. 42.21. — I ſhall here ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is <hi>magnificent in it ſelf.</hi> As GOD is excellent, ſo muſt his <hi>Word</hi> be.

III. GOD has <hi>magnified</hi> his Word by the <hi>Miracles</hi> with which He has teſtified unto it. A <hi>Miracle</hi> is ſome manifeſt ſupernatural Effect above the Power of known natural Cauſes, and beſide their known Courſe and Laws; which therefore muſt be the Doing of the GOD of Nature, upon ſome great and ſpecial End or Reaſon. Now it has pleaſed the <hi>ſovereign</hi> and moſt wiſe GOD in this Manner often to atteſt unto the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> of his Mind and Will unto us, and to the <hi>Miſſion</hi> of inſpired Perſons with his Meſſages in their Mouths. This is properly a <hi>Divine Teſtimony;</hi> and doubtleſs if GOD has given a <hi>Revelation</hi> to Mankind, it has been attended with ſuch his Teſtimony. And if the great GOD has <hi>teſtified</hi> to his Word by <hi>Signs and Wonders,</hi> and Works truly <hi>divine,</hi> we muſt needs own that he has herein <hi>magnified</hi> and put great Honour on it. It is as a <hi>Sign-manual,</hi> the <hi>Finger</hi> of GOD, his Stamp or <hi>Seal</hi> put to his Word.</p>
            <p>THUS the five <hi>Books of Moſes</hi> are magnified to the <hi>Church</hi> for ever, <q>in all the <hi>Signs</hi> which GOD ſent him to do in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Servants and in all his Land; and in all that <hi>mighty Hand and great Terror</hi> alſo, which he ſhewed in the Sight of all <hi>Iſrael;</hi> who when they <hi>ſaw</hi> the <hi>Miracles</hi> they feared the LORD and believed his Servant. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.31.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>magnify</hi> his <hi>Word</hi> it was that GOD divided <q>the <hi>Sea</hi> before his People, and made the <hi>Waters</hi> to ſtand as an Heap, while they paſſed thro' as on dry Land: He alſo clave the <hi>Rocks</hi> in the Deſart, and gave them <hi>Drink</hi> as out of the great Depths: He rained <hi>Fleſh</hi> upon them as Duſt, and feather'd <hi>Fowl</hi> as the Sand of the Sea.</q> The <hi>Record</hi> of theſe Things is magnificent to the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD through all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78 and 105.</p>
            <p>How was the <hi>Word</hi> of the LORD again magnified, when <hi>Jordan</hi> divided before the <hi>Ark</hi> wherein the <hi>Tables
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004916_0011_100E2DAEAF85C198"/>of the Law</hi> were depoſited? And how again when the <hi>Walls of Jericho fell,</hi> blown down by the <hi>Breath of the</hi> LORD<hi>'s Prieſts,</hi> bearing his Ark before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? — GOD magnified his Word when he thunder'd on the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> at the Prayer of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſhut up Heaven and open'd it at the Prayer of <hi>Elijah:</hi> In what Grandeur did that famous <hi>Prophet</hi> ſay to <hi>Ahab,</hi> "There ſhall be <hi>no Rain</hi> for three Years to come, but by the <hi>Word of the Lord</hi> in my Mouth? And again in what Grandeur ſat he on the <hi>Hill</hi> and ſaid, "If I be a <hi>Man of GOD</hi> let <hi>Fire</hi> come down and conſume <hi>thee and thy Fifty!</hi> And yet again, how did the LORD magnify his Word in the Day when he anſwered <hi>Elijah</hi> by <hi>Fire,</hi> and it conſumed not only the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and the Wood, but even the very <hi>Stones</hi> of the Altar, and lick'd up the <hi>Water</hi> that was in the <hi>Trench;</hi> and the People fell on their <hi>Faces</hi> and ſaid, "The LORD He is GOD, the LORD He is GOD.</p>
            <p>GOD had once <hi>magnified</hi> his Word in the Mouth of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> before the Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and thoſe alſo of the <hi>Aliens,</hi> and the <hi>Sun ſtood ſtill</hi> in the midſt of Heaven, and there was no Day like it: Again he magnified it in like Manner to the Sight and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the Day when the <hi>Sun went back,</hi> and the <hi>Idol of Babylon</hi> was made to do <hi>Homage</hi> at the Prayer of the reforming King; and the <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſent with Reverence to <hi>enquire</hi> after the <hi>Sign.</hi> — And when <hi>Judah</hi> was ſent into <hi>Babylon</hi> for violating the holy <hi>Word</hi> of their GOD, GOD magnified it <hi>there</hi> by many aſtoniſhing Signs and Miracles; as <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Preſervation in the Den of <hi>Lions,</hi> and his <hi>Brethren</hi>'s in the fiery <hi>Furnace;</hi> "Of a Truth, ſaid the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> your GOD is the GOD <hi>of gods,</hi> and the KING <hi>of Kings.</hi> Such is <hi>His Word</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> above <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when we look into the <hi>holy Goſpels,</hi> we find the numerous excelling <hi>Miracles</hi> of our LORD JESUS and the Power which he gave to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to work

            <p>Indeed the <hi>two grand Miracles</hi> of the Goſpel Day, whereby GOD magnified his <hi>Word,</hi> were the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of CHRIST from the Dead, and the <hi>cloven Tongues</hi> of Light which ſat over the <hi>Diſciples</hi> on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> and they ſpake all <hi>Languages,</hi> and Men of every <hi>Nation</hi> heard them ſpeak the wondrous Works of GOD in their <hi>own</hi> Tongue.

            <p>BUT if the <hi>Law</hi> be thus magnified by the <hi>active</hi> Obedience of CHRIST, is it not yet more ſo, <hi>Secondly,</hi> in and by his <hi>paſſive</hi> Obedience; <hi>his Obedience unto Death, the Death of the Croſs;</hi> the <hi>accurſed Death!</hi> He bore <hi>our Sins,</hi> he bore the <hi>Curſe</hi> in his <hi>own Body</hi> on the <hi>Tree!</hi> — He redeemed us from the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law, by being made a <hi>Curſe</hi> for us; as it is written, "<hi>He that is hanged is accurſed of GOD.</hi>

O ſacred <hi>Law</hi> and glorious <hi>Juſtice!</hi> Here is Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Righteouſneſs, the <hi>Habitation</hi> of GOD's Throne.

            <p>To <hi>magnify</hi> the holy Law, the HOLY ONE OF GOD was <hi>number'd with Tranſgreſſors;</hi> was made a <hi>Sin-Offering!</hi> The Day and Hour of our LORD's <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion</hi> was that of the <hi>Law's Triumph:</hi> It was <hi>ſeen</hi> ſo by <hi>Angels,</hi> the ſame <hi>Holy Ones</hi> who were at <hi>Sinai,</hi> on the <hi>holy Mount,</hi> at the Law's Delivery in <hi>Fire;</hi> and now they ſaw a <hi>fiercer Flame</hi> than any that had ever <hi>burnt up the Wicked.</hi> Now, to the <hi>Principalities and Powers</hi> in the heavenly Places was ſhown more of the <hi>tremendous Holineſs</hi> than they had ever ſeen before. — They had <hi>ſeen a World of Angels</hi> caſt down from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for their Sin, and now they ſaw <hi>a World of Sinners</hi> delivered from <hi>Hell</hi> by Faith in the <hi>Blood</hi> of a great <hi>Propitiation</hi> held forth from <hi>Heaven!</hi> This, with great Reverence, they <hi>deſire to look into,</hi> with <hi>cover'd Faces;</hi> and cry, "<hi>Holy, holy, holy is the</hi> LORD OF HOSTS, <hi>the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>natural World</hi> has been dreadfully <hi>judged</hi> for <hi>Man</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion of the <hi>Law</hi> of GOD, and ſhall at laſt be <hi>burnt up</hi> in Honour to it.</p>
            <p>GOD magnified his <hi>Word</hi> when he <hi>curs'd the Ground</hi> for Man's Sin. The whole <hi>Creation</hi> groans to this Day and <hi>travails in Pain</hi> under it.

            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>intellectual moral World</hi> are govern'd and <hi>judg'd</hi> by the <hi>glorious Word</hi> of GOD. Both the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are adminiſtred according to it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Kingdom of <hi>Providence:</hi> 
               <q>GOD reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over the <hi>Heathen,</hi> ſitting on the <hi>Throne</hi> of his Holineſs; his <hi>Eyes</hi> behold, his Eye-lids try the Children of Men; from the Place of his Habitation he looketh upon all the Children of Men; He faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth their Hearts alike, he conſidereth all their Works; He <hi>judges</hi> the World with Righteouſneſs and the People with his Truth.</q> (See <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33 and 96.)

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, According to his <hi>Word</hi> is the preſent Kingdom and <hi>Empire of his Grace</hi> in and over the Souls of his <hi>Elect.</hi> This is the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Glory of the Word; little <hi>obſerved</hi> but moſt obſervably <hi>magnified</hi> to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs World.</p>
            <p>ON the one Hand, it is <hi>dreadful</hi> to think how the Word of GOD is magnified in the <hi>Obduration</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sinners, according to that amazing <hi>Meſſage</hi> which CHRIST put into his Prophet's Mouth <hi>when he ſaw his Glory,</hi> Iſa. 6.9. <q>Go tell this People, <hi>hear</hi> ye indeed but <hi>underſtand not,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> ye indeed but <hi>perceive not!</hi> make the Heart of this People <hi>fat,</hi> and make their Ears heavy, and <hi>ſhut</hi> their Eyes; leſt they <hi>ſee</hi> with their Eyes, and <hi>hear</hi> with their Ears, and <hi>underſtand</hi> with their Heart, and <hi>convert</hi> and be healed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT on the other Hand, how <hi>glorious</hi> is it to the divine <hi>Word,</hi> that it has a Power and Efficacy given it for the <hi>Converſion</hi> and Salvation of as many as GOD has <hi>ordained</hi> to Life everlaſting! How great is its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their effectual Calling and Sanctification? — So the <hi>Rod of Moſes</hi> was at the ſame time <hi>magnified</hi> in the Sight of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his People, and in the Eyes of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD; in the Deſtruction of the one and Salvation of the other.</p>

For the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD is <hi>quick</hi> and powerful, <hi>ſharper</hi> than any two edged Sword, <hi>peircing</hi> even to the dividing aſunder the Soul and Spirit, and is a <hi>Diſcerner</hi> of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart; neither is there any Creature that is not <hi>manifeſt</hi> in his Sight, but all Things are <hi>naked</hi> and open unto the Eyes of HIM with whom we have to do. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. For the <hi>Weapons of our Warfare</hi> are not carnal, but <hi>mighty</hi> through GOD to the pulling down <hi>ſtrong-holds;</hi> caſting down Imaginations and every <hi>high Thing</hi> that exalteth it ſelf againſt the Knowledge of GOD, and bringing into <hi>Captivity</hi> every <hi>Thought</hi> to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of CHRIST.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, <hi>this</hi> is GOD's <hi>magnifying his Word</hi> to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eye, to the beſt and greateſt Purpoſes, when <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> are convinc'd and <hi>pricked</hi> to the Heart by it! When the <hi>Commandment comes</hi> with a divine <hi>Light</hi> and Power on their Conſciences; when <hi>Sin</hi> by it becomes <hi>exceeding</hi> ſinful; and <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf <hi>quakes,</hi> and the hardy <hi>Taylor trembles</hi> and cries out, "<hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> — But then the <hi>mild Reign</hi> and Rule of Grace in the Souls of the <hi>Regenerate</hi> is yet <hi>more</hi> magnificent; GOD having <hi>put</hi> his Law in their Heart, and <hi>written</hi> it in them, and <hi>ſhed abroad his Love!</hi> and they become his <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Palace,</hi> incomparably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond thoſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> or <hi>Herod!</hi> O how does the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Soul <hi>magnify the Word,</hi> whoſe Power it has felt, whoſe Glory it has ſeen, and calls it <hi>honourable?</hi> It reverences and delights in it, fears and <hi>ſtands in Awe</hi> of it, <hi>eſteems</hi> it concerning all things to be right, and <hi>hates</hi> every falſe Way! Becauſe it is very <hi>pure,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul <hi>loves</hi> it, takes it for its <hi>Heritage</hi> for ever,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004916_0021_100E26A284158070"/>and makes it its <hi>exceeding Joy;</hi> is quickned daily and comforted by it, and eſteems it as its neceſſary <hi>Food, taſtes</hi> that it is good. O how the holy Soul magnifies GOD for his Word and gives Him <hi>Glory</hi> on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it! <q>I will <hi>never forget</hi> thy Precepts, for by them Thou haſt <hi>quickned me;</hi> I have <hi>choſen the Way of Truth,</hi> thy Judgments have laid before me; and I will walk at <hi>Liberty</hi> and ſeek thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</q> — This is the Glory that <hi>excelleth!</hi> for what are <hi>Prophecies</hi> or <hi>Miracles</hi> themſelves, in Compariſon herewith? as the LORD has ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22. <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſay to me, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> have we not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied</hi> in thy Name, and in thy Name have caſt out <hi>Devils,</hi> and in thy Name done many <hi>wondrous</hi> Works; and then will I profeſs unto them, I <hi>never</hi> knew you, <hi>depart</hi> from me ye that work Iniquity.</q>—The <hi>End</hi> of the holy <hi>Word</hi> is the ſaving Illumination and Conqueſt of <hi>Souls,</hi> and in this it is <hi>magnified,</hi> has its <hi>Courſe and is glorified,</hi> and GOD is <hi>admired</hi> in it for ever and ever. It remains only to ſay,</p>
            <p n="3">3.

By it the <hi>Eternal</hi> State of Men will be decided? How awful and reverend ſhould this make it? according to it will our final Judgment be.</p>
            <p>IN humane <hi>Courts</hi> of Judicature the <hi>Law</hi> is the Thing magnified; the <hi>Judges</hi> reverence and determine by the <hi>Law;</hi> the <hi>Jurors</hi> are ſworn to go according to it; the <hi>People</hi> ſubmit their Eſtate, Liberty and Life to it. What is more venerable, and what more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable than the righteous <hi>Law,</hi> and the impartial Adminiſtration of Judgment by it? But if the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004916_0022_100E2DCEEAA89FB0"/>of Men's <hi>temperal</hi> Intereſts, by the Judgment of <hi>humane</hi> Laws, be ſo awful and venerable to Men, how much more muſt the Deciſion of Men's <hi>eternal</hi> State, by the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> magnify <hi>that</hi> and make it dreadful?</p>
            <p>READ how the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of it, Rom. 2.16: <hi>In the Day when</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>according to my Goſpel; for as many as have ſinned in the Law ſhall be judged by the Law.</hi> So CHRIST hath clothed the written <hi>Word</hi> with his own <hi>Majeſty</hi> and Glory, that it may be <hi>fearful</hi> to us: As the FATHER has committed all Judgment to <hi>Him,</hi> that all Men ſhould honour the SON even as they honour the FATHER. — "<hi>Have I not Power to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify thee? and Power to releaſe thee?</hi> ſaid the <hi>Judge</hi> of old, when he would <hi>magnify himſelf above the Law:</hi> But the ſupream <hi>Law-giver</hi> muſt of <hi>Right</hi> and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity inveſt the <hi>Law</hi> with this Glory, that it has Power to juſtify and condemn: This Power is given it from <hi>on high,</hi> and it is herein greatly magnified; as in the <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the laſt Judgment, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.11, 12. <q>And I ſaw a <hi>great white Throne</hi> and <hi>Him</hi> that ſat on it, from whoſe <hi>Face</hi> the Earth and Heaven fled away!

            </p>
            <p>THUS our <hi>Bible,</hi> that now neglected and ſlighted <hi>Book</hi> by many, will be <hi>open'd</hi> by the inthron'd JESUS at the laſt Day; when he will magnify it by judging the World according to it. This is his final <hi>aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing</hi> it; Pſal. 76.7, 8. <hi>The Earth feared and was ſtill, when GOD aroſe to Judgment, to ſave all the Meek of the Earth; ſurely the Wrath of Man ſhall praiſe thee.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>BUT this for the <hi>Proof</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> "that the Great GOD <hi>has magnified his Word</hi> to us, and will magnify it in the higheſt Manner. — I come now to the <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET <hi>us</hi> then ſee to it that <hi>we magnify</hi> GOD the LORD and his <hi>holy Word</hi> in our <hi>Hearts and Lives,</hi> and with our <hi>Lips.</hi>—We magnify it by <hi>believing</hi> it, and O could we be ſtrong in <hi>Faith,</hi> giving <hi>Glory</hi> to GOD!

            </p>
            <p>GOD has <hi>magnified</hi> his Word that we ſhould <hi>fear</hi> it, <hi>tremble and quake</hi> at it; and to <hi>this Man</hi> will the <hi>High and loſty One</hi> look, even to him that is <hi>poor</hi> and of a <hi>contrite Spirit,</hi> and that <hi>trembleth</hi> at his Word.</p>
            <p>GOD has magnified his <hi>Word</hi> to us to magnify <hi>our Sins</hi> to us, that by the <hi>Commandment</hi> they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>ſinful;</hi> for how have they vilified that great holy <hi>Law</hi> which GOD has magnified in the <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them?—We therefore magnify his <hi>Word</hi> by our <hi>repenting</hi> in Duſt and Aſhes; <hi>turning</hi> from all Sin with holy mourning, godly ſorrowing, ſelf-loathing: "<hi>O my</hi> GOD, <hi>I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my Fyes unto thee, my</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>WE magnify GOD's <hi>Word</hi> by <hi>hoping</hi> in it, and by <hi>looking for the Mercy of our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST <hi>unto eternal Life</hi> according to it; for whoſe <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> ſake GOD is well <hi>pleaſed,</hi> will <hi>magnify the Law</hi> and make it honourable: <q>

Finally, WE magnify the holy ſovereign <hi>Word</hi> by our <hi>Obedience</hi> to it, and our religious <hi>Obſervance</hi> of all its <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and Ordinances: <q>

            <p>To conclude, We magnify the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD by magnifying his <hi>Worſhip,</hi> private, ſecret and public; in a conſtant reverend Obſervation thereof, in the moſt ſerious and ſolemn Manner; in our <hi>Cloſets,</hi> with our <hi>Families,</hi> and in the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> from <hi>Sabbath</hi> to Sabbath, and on <hi>Lectures.</hi>—In a particular Manner we muſt magnify the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> the <hi>Holy of the</hi> LORD <hi>and honourable,</hi> if we would magnify his <hi>Word:</hi> for with <hi>this</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> begins and ends, our <hi>being in the Spirit</hi> on the <hi>weekly Sabbath;</hi> it is the <hi>firſt</hi> Thing in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> in the <hi>New.</hi> And the whole inſpired <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> is full of a holy <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> the Word Sacraments and Prayer.</p>
            <p>WE magnify the LORD JESUS our <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> and our <hi>Judge,</hi> while we aſſemble to <hi>pray</hi> in his <hi>Name,</hi> to ſit at his Feet and <hi>hear</hi> his Word, bring our <hi>Seed</hi> to his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and ſhew forth his <hi>Death</hi> at his <hi>Table.</hi>—He has ſaid to us, <q>Bleſſed is the Man that <hi>heareth me,</hi> watching daily at my <hi>Gates,</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Poſts of my <hi>Doors!</hi>
               </q> And again, <q>I will declare <hi>thy Name</hi> unto my <hi>Brethren,</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Congregation</hi> will I praiſe thee: And again, <hi>Behold I and the Children whom thou haſt given me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, <hi>my dear People,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> (my <hi>own</hi> and <hi>yours</hi>) calls upon me to <hi>ſeize</hi> the preſent Opportunity, to leave my <hi>dying</hi> Counſel and <hi>Charge</hi> with you, both <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND firſt to <hi>Miniſters,</hi> — let us (my dear <hi>Brethren</hi>) <hi>magnify our Office,</hi> and the <hi>Word</hi> which we are called to <hi>preach,</hi> by a due Care as to the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of our Preaching. "<hi>If any Man ſpeak</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1ſt Epiſt. 4th Chap. ver. 11.) <hi>let him
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004916_0026_100E2DDD08D79878"/>ſpeak</hi> AS THE ORACLES OF GOD; in a Manner worthy of theſe <hi>ſacred Oracles;</hi> beſeeming the Dignity, Majeſty, Sanctity, Authority, Importance of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Oracles. — We are Labourers together with GOD, ye are God's Huſbandry and Building; as a wiſe Maſter-builder, I</hi> (ſaid the bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>have laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and another buildeth thereon; but let every Man take heed how be build;</hi> that it be <hi>Gold, Silver, precious Stones; not Wood, Hay, Stubble,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. — My <hi>Brethren,</hi> we have <hi>precious Materials</hi> provided for us, and great ſhould be our Care that they be <hi>well laid</hi> together and <hi>cemented;</hi> remembring that we are build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>for</hi> GOD and <hi>with</hi> Him; that by his Power and Help we may both build up our <hi>own</hi> and our People's Souls <hi>on our moſt holy Faith;</hi> a <hi>ſpiritual Houſe</hi> to offer up ſpiritual <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> acceptable to GOD through our LORD JESUS CHRIST. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p>WELL <hi>Brethren,</hi> Did we ſerve out our <hi>Time</hi> well in preparatory <hi>Studies</hi> and Prayers for our <hi>entring</hi> on this high and holy working with GOD and for Him? And did we accordingly enter on it with a due <hi>Solemnity</hi> of Soul? with ſomething of <hi>Iſaiah's Viſion</hi> of the Divine MAJESTY on his <hi>Throne</hi> high and lifted up, and his <hi>Train</hi> filling his Temples; the <hi>Seraphims</hi> covering their Faces before Him! <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 6th Chap.</p>
            <p>AH how <hi>wanting</hi> may we have been in this <hi>awful</hi> Conſideration of GOD and his <hi>Word,</hi> when we <hi>gave our ſelves to Him,</hi> and to <hi>his People by his Will,</hi> to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto their <hi>Souls,</hi> as thoſe that muſt give <hi>an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</hi> And how have we <hi>ſerv'd</hi> thoſe <hi>for whom</hi> CHRIST <hi>died,</hi> in the Courſe of our <hi>Miniſtry?</hi> Have we preach'd, <hi>not our ſelves,</hi> but CHRIST JESUS THE LORD; <hi>and our ſelves their Servants for</hi> JESUS <hi>ſake?</hi> — Has CHRIST, his Doctrine, his holy Law and Life, his perfect Example and glorious Works, his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Meekneſs and Charity, his Zeal for Truth and Holineſs, his ſervent Devotions and abſolute Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004916_0027_100E2DE108639540"/>to the Will and Glory of GOD; his ineffable Love to Souls, and Demands from us of a like Love to <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs?</hi> — Has <hi>his</hi> Obedience unto Death, the Death of the Croſs; the Atonement made thereby for the Sins of his Elect, and Satisfaction to the Juſtice of GOD for the Violation of his ſacred Law; and the everlaſting Righteouſneſs thereby bro't in for the Redemption, Juſtification and eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believing repenting Sinners; — Have (I ſay) theſe <hi>peculiar Glories of the Goſpel been magnified by us in our Sermons and Adminiſtrations in the Houſe of GOD,</hi> and in our more private <hi>Applications</hi> to the Souls of our <hi>Flocks?</hi> Have we thus behav'd <hi>in the Church of the living GOD,</hi> which is the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> regarding <hi>theſe</hi> Truths as the <hi>Pillars,</hi> Strength and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the ſacred, ſpiritual <hi>Edifice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, my dear and honour'd <hi>Hearers,</hi> I muſt give in my humble <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and a <hi>noble</hi> one, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD the Great HEAD <hi>of the Church,</hi> and of his <hi>Grace</hi> to you, in the MINI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRY which in my Times <hi>He</hi> has ſet over you, in <hi>this</hi> and many <hi>other</hi> Places of our happy and diſtinguiſh'd <hi>Land;</hi> — "that a <hi>great Number of them</hi> have been ſuch as in their Doctrine and Converſation have been enabled to <hi>magnify the Name and Word</hi> of our LORD JESUS to you, in their <hi>Preparations</hi> for the Pulpit, and in their Manner of <hi>Addreſs</hi> to GOD and you from it; and the preſent <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Churches (in a great Number of 'em) if I am able to judge, do not come ſhort of their worthy Predeceſſors, but are building fair and ſtrong on their Foundation, as <hi>wiſe and faithful Servants;</hi> and GOD is <hi>owning</hi> them greatly before you and <hi>bleſſing</hi> their Labours: The Bleſſing of <hi>Levi</hi> is with them, the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> in a happy Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Light, Zeal</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> thro' free and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Grace;</hi> and they do not ſerve GOD and you with <hi>unbeaten Oil,</hi> with what coſts 'em nothing, but the

               <hi>Lamps</hi> burn <hi>clear</hi> and bright before you. In my <hi>Age</hi> I ſit, <hi>hear</hi> and admire the labour'd, digeſted, methodical, enlightning, ſervent <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> they bring you; ſuch as they might bring before <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Univerſities,</hi> and not be aſhamed; and yet all adapted to the <hi>poor of the Flock</hi> and to the <hi>loweſt</hi> Underſtandings among you; even to the very <hi>Negroes</hi> of your Families, many of whom are become intelligent and <hi>ſerious</hi> among us. And I humbly truſt, that after my <hi>Deceaſe</hi> CHRIST will be <hi>ſtill magnified</hi> in his preached Goſpel among you; — I mean by the <hi>riſing Miniſtry,</hi> many of whom appear to me to be coming forth into the Service of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> as with a ſuperior <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Honour of CHRIST, and to <hi>ſave themſelves and thoſe that bear them;</hi> ſo with a Care for proper <hi>Furniture</hi> by diligent <hi>Study,</hi> to give <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> together, in their well compoſed and deliver'd <hi>Sermons,</hi> which are acceptable and profitable to our <hi>Flocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND I earneſtly exhort theſe my <hi>younger Brethren,</hi> together with the very promiſing, ſtudious and ſerious <hi>Candidates</hi> for the Miniſtry now in our <hi>College,</hi> that they <hi>emulate the Learning</hi> and <hi>Labours</hi> of the preſent <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> round about them; and yet more thoſe of the FIRST FATHERS of our <hi>Country;</hi> who with equal Care and <hi>Speed</hi> founded our Churches, <hi>Schools</hi> and Colleges together, and never ſeparated their <hi>Bibles</hi> and <hi>Literature</hi> in their Preparations for public Serviceableneſs, but kept the <hi>one</hi> in reverend <hi>Subjection</hi> to the other. — So my SONS, do you ſtudy your <hi>Bibles</hi> firſt and moſt, and then <hi>uſe</hi> all your Acquiſitions of <hi>humane</hi> Knowledge, and your peculiar <hi>natural</hi> Gifts and Powers, whether of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> or <hi>Oratory,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend and inforce the <hi>lively Oracles</hi> of GOD to the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and on the <hi>Affections</hi> of thoſe to whom you may be called to miniſter. — For if you go off from <hi>ſtudied Sermons,</hi> you will I fear <hi>loſe</hi> all that the <hi>Fathers</hi> of theſe Churches have wrought for us; and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004916_0029_100E2DE6D0DCE500"/>will come (unlike <hi>them</hi>) to this People, with empty Noiſe of Addreſs to their <hi>Paſſions only,</hi> which is not the Way of your <hi>Bible,</hi> nor of the HOLY SPIRIT who inſpir'd it, who by the Underſtanding enters the <hi>Heart,</hi> convincing Men of <hi>Sin,</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judgment,</hi> their loſt and periſhing State, and Need of a SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>LET me recommend to <hi>you</hi> Dr. WATTS his <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Attempt for the Revival of Religion;</hi> a <hi>Book</hi> worthy to be read and deeply conſider'd by <hi>Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and in a particular Manner by the <hi>Candidates</hi> for the Evangelical Miniſtry, before they enter on the Work of Preaching; that in their Compoſures they may <hi>equally</hi> remember how much they have to do with the <hi>Mind</hi> and Underſtanding, and alſo with the <hi>Hearts</hi> and Conſciences of their Hearers; and with HIM that <hi>made</hi> Man's Heart and <hi>ſearches</hi> it, and only can reach and <hi>change</hi> it: Accordingly "<hi>methodize,</hi> explain, illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, prove, infer upon and <hi>apply</hi> the Subjects which you undertake, as in the Fear of GOD you truly judge will <hi>moſt magnify the Word</hi> you preach, and <hi>benefit</hi> the Souls of Men. — To which <hi>End</hi> alſo I do with like Earneſtneſs recommend to <hi>Students</hi> and younger <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> (and alſo to private <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) a like admirable Book of Dr. WATTS's, of the "<hi>Uſe and Abuſe of the Paſſions in Matters of Religion;</hi> as ſurpriſingly calculated for our <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Admonition</hi> at this Day.</p>
            <p>AND ſuffer me, my <hi>dear People,</hi> now I am it may be taking Leave of this <hi>Deſk,</hi> in a particular Manner to intimate to you my Apprehenſion and <hi>Fear</hi> of great <hi>Diſhonour to the Word of GOD,</hi> and of <hi>Danger</hi> to your <hi>Souls</hi> and thoſe of your <hi>Families,</hi> and therefore of <hi>Ruin</hi> to the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> if we give Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Encouragement to <hi>illiterate</hi> and <hi>half-learnt</hi> Perſons to go about <hi>exhorting</hi> and drawing <hi>Hearers</hi> by their <hi>Shew of Affection</hi> to Souls for their ſpiritual Profit and ſaving Good, or from their <hi>ſincere Deſire</hi> thereof; for it certainly <hi>tends</hi> in Time to run the Churches into

               <hi>Confuſion,</hi> and to bring the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Word into <hi>Contempt.</hi> — I muſt needs therefore <hi>repeat</hi> my <hi>public Caution</hi> to you ſome <hi>Months</hi> ago, <q>that you would no more <hi>run</hi> from your own <hi>Paſtors</hi> with ſuch open Diſreſpect after every <hi>new</hi> Face or fervent Voice, with far leſs Furniture for your real ſpiritual Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> We may well bluſh for ſome who have ſat ſo long, and profited ſo well, under our Miniſtry, and yet have no more attained to a true Taſte and Judgment. Your <hi>Miniſters</hi> have been and are, from Time to Time, earneſtly and powerfully addreſſing to your <hi>Affections</hi> and Paſſions as well as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> with a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Sound and <hi>ſuperiour</hi> Light, ſuch as no <hi>uncertain</hi> Flaſhes out of Clouds and Darkneſs may at all compare with.</p>
            <p>I <hi>cloſe</hi> with giving <hi>Glory</hi> to GOD for the <hi>Great and good Work of his Grace,</hi> which He has ſo <hi>viſibly begun, ſpread</hi> and is <hi>carrying on,</hi> in every <hi>Part</hi> almoſt of our <hi>Provinces;</hi> which that <hi>we may all</hi> in our reſpective Places <hi>ſubſerve,</hi> under the <hi>ſpecial Direction,</hi> Reſtraint, Influence and Enlargement of the BLESSED SPIRIT <hi>of Truth, Holineſs and Love;</hi> (WHOM I ſincerely and moſt thankfully deſire to <hi>adore</hi> as "<hi>magnifying</hi> therein <hi>his Word above all his Name</hi>) is I hope my <hi>ſingle Aim</hi> in what I have now ſaid; — and may all the <hi>Churches</hi> ſay, AMEN, <hi>praiſe ye the</hi> LORD.</p>
