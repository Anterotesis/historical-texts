            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE BY THE United Miniſters OF <hi>BOSTON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE enſuing Sermon was preach'd upon as lamentable an occaſion, (of a private nature) as has been known among us, That any of the ſons of <hi>New-England,</hi> who have been born and educated in this land of light, ſhould be ſo forſaken of GOD, and given up to their luſts and paſſions, as
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003102_0004_0FEFA646312B3820"/>to engage in a bloody and fatal DUEL, deſerves to be bewailed with tears of blood. Hitherto our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by the good hand of GOD upon them, have been reſtrain'd from this <hi>great tranſgreſſion.</hi> But now that an inſtance of it among <hi>them,</hi> has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the holy and ſpotleſs providence of GOD, it certainly becomes <hi>the Lord's Miniſters,</hi> not only to lament it in their prayers, and to cry (as they of old were directed to do, when a man was found ſlain in the field, and it was not known who did it, Deut. 21.8.) <hi>Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people's charge!</hi> But alſo loudly to teſtifie againſt it from the word of GOD, that this <hi>Sin, by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> explain'd and inforc'd upon the minds and conſciences of men, may appear to them to be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful,</hi> and <hi>others may fear, and do no more ſo wickedly:</hi> Without this we can't diſcharge the duty we owe to GOD and to our people; nor ſhall we be able to ſay, if the like ſhould be again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, (which GOD prevent!) that we are <hi>pure from the blood of all men,</hi> the blood of their bodies and of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>FROM conſcience of duty in this regard (we believe) the following ſermon was preach'd at the publick lecture in <hi>Boſton,</hi> in which the <hi>caſe of Duelling</hi> is ſolidly and judiciouſly (tho' conciſely and briefly) handled, and the ſins which lead to it faithfully warn'd againſt.</p>
            <p>AND we would all of us <hi>unite</hi> in a <hi>loud cry</hi> againſt a ſin, the cry of which we are ſure reacheth up to Heaven.</p>
            <p>MURDER is a ſin of the firſt magnitude; it is in its own nature the moſt execrable fact that can be committed; and hath been always ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe who have had even any humanity, not to ſay religion: The light of nature condemns it,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003102_0005_0FEFA611E24B6F28"/>and the conſciences of all men ſtartle at it. How vehemently it is forbidden, and how ſeverely puniſh'd by the word &amp; law of GOD, we need not ſay to thoſe who are acquainted with their BIBLES. In ſhort, the moſt barbarous people have a quick ſenſe of the heinouſneſs of this ſin, and of the vengeance due to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4.</p>
            <p>BUT as there is no ſin, no the vileſt &amp; blackeſt, but thro' the ſubtilty of the old ſerpent, may be varniſh'd over with gay colours, ſo as to make a ſpecious appearance to the ſimple and unwary; thus it has been with <hi>that</hi> we are now teſtifying againſt and condemning. And there are thoſe to be met with, who will not allow one man's killing another, in what we call a <hi>Duel,</hi> i. e. <hi>a fight with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death, upon a challenge given and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> to be a murder in the nature of the fact. But ſurely theſe men <hi>underſtand not what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm:</hi> They err, not knowing the Scriptures; not diſcerning how <hi>exceeding broad</hi> the commandment and law of GOD is; even that law which the Apoſtle tells us was not <hi>made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly, and for ſinners, for unholy and profane,</hi> FOR MAN-SLAYERS, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9.</p>
            <p>How comes this not to be a <hi>Murder?</hi> It is indeed an <hi>aggravated</hi> and <hi>complicated Murder.</hi> "Both kinds of murder are united in it; the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a man's ſelf, and the murder of his nei'bour alſo". The man's voluntarily expoſing his own life to this hazard, and opening his body (as it were) to the ſword of him that ſlays him, does not make it otherwiſe. This is plain and evident, becauſe no man has this power over his own life to lay it down of himſelf, at his own pleaſure, and therefore cannot give power to another to take
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003102_0006_0FEFA64944DC85A8"/>it away. For GOD is the abſolute LORD of life, and has reſerv'd the diſpoſal of it intirely to himſelf.</p>
            <p>THAT this is a heinous breach of the <hi>ſixth commandment,</hi> is made evident in the following Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beyond ſober contradiction: And it is our deſign not to <hi>add</hi> to it, but to <hi>concurr</hi> with it. Enough alſo is ſaid in it, to ſhew how weak and falſe, how vain and abſurd that plea and pretence is, with which ſome of the <hi>Hectors</hi> of the world would excuſe and juſtifie the horrid practice, namely, <hi>That it is brave and heroic, gallant and honourable in this way to revenge affronts, and decide diſputes.</hi> Were men's minds poſſeſs'd with a juſt notion of things, they would on the contrary pronounce it baſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſcandalous &amp; diſhonourable, to give or accept a challenge; for they who do ſo appear to be deſtitute of thoſe vertues and graces which adorn and ennoble the humane ſoul, and which are always requiſite to make a <hi>great man:</hi> And it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for an action to be truly valorous or honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which proceeds from ſuch baſe and vile principles as pride, hatred, covetouſneſs, revenge, and the like, the common incentives to Duels. No; let it never be call'd manly courage, but brutal rage, or deviliſh fury.</p>
            <p>THE thing ſhould not be nam'd among us, but with the utmoſt indignation and deteſtation, as becometh chriſtians And we can't but joyn, <hi>all of us,</hi> in that humble motion to our civil Rulers, that a ſeverer <hi>Edict</hi> may be made againſt it, and ſome farther brand of infamy put upon it by <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND, Oh! that all our <hi>young people</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a <hi>horror</hi> at the tho't of this crime! And may be effectually warn'd to ſhun every thing that leads to, or may be an occaſion of it; to flee thoſe
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:003102_0007_0FEFA6159E346430"/>
               <hi>luſts</hi> from <hi>whence comes wars and fightings,</hi> duels and blood-ſhed; and eſpecially EVIL COMPANIONS, which it is the buſineſs of the enſuing diſcourſe to diſſwade from, and to whom many a hopeful and promiſing a youth has fallen a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>OUR hearts even bleed when we think of the danger the children of our people are in at this day, of being led into <hi>all licentiouſneſs,</hi> by the ſinners which entice and enchant them, till they are <hi>drowned in deſtruction and perdition. As our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſons</hi> and brethren, with all compaſſion and earneſtneſs, <hi>we warn you.</hi> Such of you as are not yet entangled in the fatal ſnare, <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and keep your ſouls diligently.</hi> Such of you as are already taken, break out of it immediately and with reſolution: <hi>Do this now, my ſon, deliver thy ſelf as a roe from the hand of the hunter.</hi> Let others harms be your warnings. As one
<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore.</hi>
               </note> thus gives the reaſon of <hi>Job</hi>'s pious care concerning his Sons,</p>
            <l>"For he with mournſul eyes had often ſpy'd,</l>
            <l>"Scatter'd on pleaſures ſmooth but treach'rous tide,</l>
            <l>"The ſpoils of virtue overpower'd by ſenſe,</l>
            <l>"And floating wreeks of ruin'd innocence.</l>
            <p>BUT, <hi>O our GOD! we cry to Thee to ſave the children of thy people? We have, in ſome meaſure, warn'd them in thy Name, and called after them, Thou knoweſt! But, Oh! do Thou lay hold of their hearts by thy omnipotent grace, and keep them from going aſtray from Thee! Such as are at this time wandring upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of deſolation, let the hand of mercy turn them back! And let us not ſee the enemy of mankind, the roaring lion of hell, driving away the hopes
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003102_0008_0FEF966FC5605BA8"/>of our flocks before our eyes! And let the late providence,</hi> (wherein Thou art ſpeaking to them by terrible things in righteouſneſs) <hi>have a reſtraining, and</hi> (If it may be thy will) <hi>a converting influence upon them!</hi>

               <p>NOW there are no Sins ſo vile, but ungodly Men will tempt others to commit. I ſhall rank them under two Heads agreable to the two great and comprehenſive Commands of GOD's Law mention'd by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22 37-40</p>

It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wives, <hi>That they turned away his heart after other gods,</hi> 1 King 11.4.

Again, They tempt others to ſet their Mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heaven, in profane <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing:</hi> A Horrible Crime! Theſe abandon'd Wretches do not fear this <hi>Glorious &amp; Fearful Name,</hi> THE LORD OUR GOD; they make a light matter of Blaſpheming it, and provoke others to take it in Vain; tho' GOD aſſureth us, that he <hi>will not hold ſuch guiltleſs.</hi> Furthermore, Evil doers Entice others many times to <hi>Profane the Day of the LORD,</hi> which GOD requireth us to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to keep it holy; to neglect the Aſſembling themſelves with GOD's People, to pay Homage to Him our Creator and Redeemer: A great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion indeed! And then to ſpend this precious time which ſhou'd, the whole of it, be ſacred to the LORD, in Idleneſs, vain Diſcourſes, or more hainous Practices.

2. <hi>EVIL doers endeavour to draw others into the commiſſion of thoſe Sins which are contrary to the Duties which relate to our Neighbour, and our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BOTH theſe come under that great Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I put them together. Here,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>EVIL doers tempt Men to coſt off all due Regard to the Authority GOD hath appointed among Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY are Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> which ſhake off the yoke, and they endeavour that others may do ſo to. Thus they prevail upon unwary People ſometimes to deny their Parents that Honour which is their due, tho' this is the firſt Command with an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial particular Promiſe annexed to it, <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>e. c.</hi> they tempt them to ſet light by Father and Mother; yea, to reſemble the <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son,</hi> as repreſented in the <hi>Parable,</hi> Luk, 15. Who leſt his Father's houſe, and <hi>waſted his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with riotous living.</hi> But I ſhall not it ſiſt here.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>EVIL doers tempt others to Contentions; yea, ſometimes to the bainous Sin of Murder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſixth Commandment is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> Exod. 20.13. which forbids raſh anger, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the out-breakings of ſuch Luſts. But now, the wicked are like the troubled Sea which cannot reſt: They will quarrel even with their neareſt friends upon light affronts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when Contentions are riſen among others, they ſeek rather to blow up than quench this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural fire, being inſtigated by the <hi>Evil One, who was a murderer from the beginning,</hi> Joh. 8.44. And here, there is a Sin which hath ſlain it's thouſands, that I wou'd endeavour to ſhow the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003102_0014_0FEFA64EEB006858"/>Evil of, and that is the <hi>bloody Crime</hi> of <hi>Duelling,</hi> which Men have often been drawn into by the Sollicitations or Provocations of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, under a pretence of doing right to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of vindicating their Honour, and the like. It ought to be for a lamentation, that any among profeſſed <hi>Protestants</hi> ſhou'd make light of this Sin; and the late <hi>tragical Inſtance</hi> of it among our ſelves, ſhou'd be deeply bewail'd. O that our Eyes were a fountain of tears, that we cou'd weep for this, that ſuch unjuſtice ſhou'd be done in this Land of Uprightneſs! In this Land which is under ſuch peculiar Obligations &amp; Advantages to be an Habitation of Righteouſneſs. The LORD grant it may not again be named as Committed among us. And now, that all, and particularly our Young People may have a juſt ſenſe of this deadly evil, and keep clear from this great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, I would offer a few things to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT Duelling is an hainous breach of the Sixth Commandment; And he that deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Neighbour's life this way, is guilty of the crying Sin of Murder.</p>
               <p n="2">2 THAT it is a vile Sin, and deſerveth to have the greateſt contempt pour'd upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Duelling is an hainous Breach of the Sixth Commandment; And he that deſtroyeth his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's life this way, is guilty of the Crying Sin of Murder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS will appear if we conſider what this ſin is. Now, <hi>They are guilty of this Evil who Fight with each other upon a private Quarrel pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to a Challenge voluntarily given, and accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003102_0015_0FEFA61D4E108660"/>
THUS Men are guilty who meet by conſent, and ſmite each other with the <hi>Fist of Wickedneſs,</hi> which is a breach of the Peace, an iniquity to be puniſh'd by the Judge. And who can tell what ſuch a quarrel may proceed to when Men's paſſions are inflam'd? But then, <hi>Duelling</hi> in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of the word, intends the Meeting of two Perſons
<note n="†" place="bottom">Agreable to the Notation of the word, it is a fight between two. <hi>Bellum quod duabus partibus dimicatur.</hi> Dict. Duorum Bellum.</note> by agreement, and <hi>their Fighting with Mortal Weapons, in which there is an apparent hazard of life.</hi> In this caſe therefore neceſſary <hi>Self-Defence</hi> is excepted. If one Man violently aſſaults another ſo that he can have no other way of eſcape, but by repelling force with force, he may and ought to endeavour the preſervation of his own Life, tho' this ſhou'd be by the Death of the Aggreſſor. And thus, <hi>David's</hi> Fighting with and ſlaying <hi>Goliah,</hi> was not a Duel in the ſenſe we are ſpeaking of; becauſe it was in an open and lawful War, with the Approbation of the Civil Authority, and no doubt from the eſpecial impulſe of the Spirit of GOD, ſtirring him up to this heroick Action. Whereas in a <hi>Duel</hi> Men fight in a private quarrel, and to avenge themſelves, without any call from GOD, or the Authority he hath appointed; yea, in oppoſition to Both. They preſume to hazard, if not ſacrifice their Lives to gratify the vile Luſt of Pride, Wrath, Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, thus to take away our brother's Life, as well as hazard our own, is a moſt unjuſt thing, and ſtands condemn'd in the Sixth Commandment, <q>which forbids the taking away of our own Life, or the Life of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour unjuſtly, &amp; whatſoever tendeth thereunto.</q>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003102_0016_0FEFA6512A4D48E0"/>This is in deſiance of GOD's Law, to go about to wreſt the Sword out of the Magiſtrate's Hand, who is <hi>the Miniſter of</hi> GOD, <hi>a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth evil,</hi> Rom. 13.4. This is for Men to deſtroy Men as the fiſhes of the Sea devour one another, having no ruler over them
<note n="†" place="bottom">Hab. 1.13, 14.</note>. This is for a Man to be judge and executioner in his own Cauſe, a moſt unrighteous thing. This is without any Warrant from GOD, or the Powers ordain'd of Him, voluntarily to ſlay our Neighbour. Now ſuch are guilty of Blood. Yea, it is to come boldly and preſumptuouſly upon him, in which caſe a Man was to be <hi>taken from GOD's Aliar, that be might die,</hi> Exod. 21.14. And the word of GOD declareth, that he who thus <hi>Smiteth his Neighbour with an inſtrument of iron,</hi> i. e. a mortal Weapon, <hi>is a Murderer,</hi> Numb. 35.16. Furthermore, ſuch do in a ſenſe enter into Covenant to ſeek each other's Life, then they often times let the Sun go down upon their wrath, and after time for Conſideration come to this <hi>foul Play,</hi> with premeditated Malice; in which reſpect this Sin is more aggravated, than when one Man kills another in a ſudden tranſport of Paſſion. Such an one upon a point of honour, falſely ſo call'd, or the like, bereaveth his brother of that which is moſt precious, his Life, which none can reſtore when once taken away; yea deſtroys a Creature that was made in the Image of GOD the Creator, and yet retains ſome remains of this in his Make and Couſtitution, as he is a Spirit in fleſh, tho' he hath leſt his Moral Rectitude; which is the reaſon given why Murder muſt be puniſh'd with Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. Add to this, he dreadfully
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003102_0017_0FEFA61F8C4A7430"/>hazards the loſs of his Soul for ever, which is more worth than a World. Now, how vile and unreaſonable is this upon comparatively a ſmall injury, an affront, or the like, to ſhed our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's blood, and ſo bereave him at once of all temporal good, and of the means he enjoy'd of preparing for his eternal Well-being in the life to come. O unſpeakable irreparable injury! Can he ever make him Reſtitution? No! His blood and life are pour'd out, as water ſpilt upon the ground which can't be gathered up. And then, which hath been already hinted, <hi>Duellers</hi> wickedly <hi>Endanger their own Lives,</hi> while they ſtrike at their Neighbour's; Tho' GOD gives to every Man his own life as a ſacred Depoſitum to be kept and improv'd by him for high and noble Ends, His own glory, and the Receivers everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs. Notwithſtanding this ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons break the <hi>great law of ſelf preſervation,</hi> hazarding their own lives, yea, vilely caſting their own away many times, that they may be aveng'd of their Neighbours. How often have both fallen down ſlain together, or afterwards died of their wounds! They are cruel to their own flaſh, and tempt GOD to deſtroy them Body and Soul in Hell for ever, while they lay themſelves open to temporal death, in and by the very act of Sinning. And alaſs! How unſit is the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Wretch that falls in ſuch an Encounter to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before GOD His Judge, when diſtemper'd with Rage, and in the act of Rebellion againſt His holy Law! In a word, This is <hi>to go contrary to the Precepts of the great GOD our Saviour,</hi> who was manifeſt in flaſh, and took our Nature upon him that He might reconcile us to GOD by the Blood of His Croſs, having ſlain the Enmity;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003102_0018_0FEFA652C6B24B60"/>and hath ſet before us a perfect Pattern of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Lowlineſs of Mind, of a forgiving and forbearing Spirit; And Commands us to <hi>Love our Enemies,</hi> Mat. 5.44. Yea, to ſuffer further wrong rather than avenge our ſelves, Mat. 5.39 <hi>But I ſay unto you, that ye reſist not evil: but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other alſo.</hi> He forbids us to <hi>Avenge our ſelves.</hi> Rom 12.19. — <hi>Avenge not your ſelves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> To <hi>render evil for evil, &amp;c.</hi> And the evil diſpoſitions of Mind which leads to this great Sin, are alſo forbidden in the Goſpel. Col 3.8. <hi>Put off all theſe anger, wrath, malice,</hi> —. Upon the whole, we may draw this <hi>Concluſion,</hi> That <hi>Duelling</hi> is an <hi>hainous and bloody crime.</hi> It ſtands condemn'd by the <hi>Law of GOD,</hi> the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> and by the <hi>Voice of the People,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their juſt abhorrence of this deadly evil. This Sin is very d ſhonourable to GOD, and bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to humane Society. What Peace or Safety can there be, if Men may be allow'd thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another? And if ſo, it muſt needs be a vile thing, and moſt reproachful to the Authors and Abetters of it. Which brings me to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Duelling is a vile Sin, and deſerveth to have the greateſt Contempt pour'd upon it.</hi> GOD is the fountain of all true Honour. Man's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive glory conſiſted chiefly in his bearing the Image of his Maker, and in being conformed to his Law. When he tranſgreſs'd, the crown fell from his head, and his honour was laid in the duſt. He became <hi>like the beaſts that periſh,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003102_0019_0FEFA62217E1D0B8"/>49.12. He corrupted himſelf by Sin, and became vile in GOD's ſight, whoſe judgment muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth. Sin is every where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt in the Oracles of GOD, as an odious and filthy thing. Such as live in the allow'd commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it are called <hi>fools,</hi> Prov. 14.9. <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin.</hi> Pſal. 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God: they are corrupt, they have done abominable works,</hi> —. And it is ſaid that <hi>Shame ſhall be their promotion,</hi> Prov. 3.35. Sin is a <hi>Reproach</hi> to any People, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. And provokes GOD to pour contempt on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons. 1 Sam. 2.30 — <hi>They that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemd.</hi> Such as live in it, make themſelves vile, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. They that glory in it glory in their ſhame, and ſuch as die under the guilt of it muſt, as the abhorred of the LORD, be doom'd to blackneſs of darkneſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And to ſpeak more directly to the point, This hainous Sin of <hi>Duelling</hi> deſerveth to be branded with the greateſt diſgrace and ignominy. Indeed the Men of the World, who are kept in bondage to Sin by falſe notions of honour, may imagine it the part of a Magnanimous Spirit thus to reſent and revenge an injury offer'd them; but unleſs we wou'd be condemn'd with the World, in the terrible day of the LORD, we muſt not now be conform'd to it in ſuch corrupt Principles and Practices. The word of GOD according to which we muſt be judg'd, declareth the contrary. Prov. 14.29 <hi>He that is ſlow to wrath is of great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: but be that is haſly of ſpirit exalteth folly.</hi> and 19.11. <hi>The diſcretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to paſs over a granſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi> A meek and quiet Spirit is an ornament of great price in the fight of GOD. For Men by
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003102_0020_0FEFA65568F0D5C0"/>the Grace of GOD to overcome their Paſſions, and keep them under due regulation when provok'd, is the part of a truly gallant and generous Spirit. Prov. 16.32. <hi>He that is ſlow to anger, is better than the mighty and be that ruleth his ſpirit, than be that taketh a city.</hi> Here's a victory which ſuch as obtain, ſhall inherit glory. e. c How haked and expoſed is that Man, how mean and vile doth he appear, whoſe Reaſon and Conſcience are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlav'd to his paſſion! He is like a <hi>City broken down, and without walls,</hi> Prov. 25.28. The Devil and his own luſts tyranize over him. How weak is his heart that can't bear an injury without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf on the point of another's Sword, or deſerving an ignominious death by the abuſe of his own! When as if he hath been injur'd there are ways in which he may honourably ſeek his Right, and have the blame laid upon the guilty Perſon. But is it not a brave and couragious thing for Men when provok'd in this way to ſhew that they are not afraid of their fleſh? No! No! True Valour is a vertue, and the Exerciſe of it ſuppoſeth a juſt cauſe; whereas in this Sin Men lay aſide all proper regard to right Reaſon &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which are their glory, and with a worſe than bruitiſh fury, fly in the face of GOD Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. As they, Job 15.25, 26. <hi>He stretcheth out his hand againſt God, and ſtrengthneth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Almighty. He runneth upon him, even on his neck upon the thick boſſes of his bucklers.</hi> And ſuppoſe ſuch fall in the Encounter, Do they die in the bed of honour? No ſurely, they die as fools and mad-men overcome of vile luſts, and are in the utmoſt hazard of ariſing to everlaſting ſhame and contempt, at the laſt day; when <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003102_0021_0FEFA623A0E543C0"/>
                  <hi>mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taken vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Alaſs! This Sin often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaves Men ſcarce any ſpace for Repentance. But ſuppoſe they come off Victors: Have they any joy or glory in ſuch a Victory? No! They muſt now ſay ſomething, as wicked <hi>Lamech, I have ſlain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 4.23.</note> While their brother's blood cries from the ground for vengeance againſt them. Now they muſt ingloriouſly fly and hide, be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by Authority, as Murderers; and if they are apprehended and the Fact is prov'd, muſt ſuffer a ſhameful death, which hath peculiar Marks of the Curſe of GOD upon it
<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 21.23.</note>. And tho' ſuch ſhou'd eſcape this puniſhment from Men, yet unleſs their Conſciences be ſear'd, they will carry the ſentence of Condemnation in their own boſorns where-ever they fly, and be a terror to themſelves, fearing leſt the Vengeance of GOD ſhou'd overtake them. But can't the Sin of wilful Murder be pardon'd, and ſo the ſhame &amp; puniſhment be taken away? No! not by Man.

But then, ſuch Sinners muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd and confounded under the moſt afflictive ſenſe of the diſhonour done to GOD by their Sins, and of their own vileneſs upon the account of them; they muſt abhor themſelves in his ſight, and condemning themſelves, plead the Merits of CHRIST, for Pardon, Relving upon Him by Faith, who is the Propitiation for the Sins of His People. If they go on impenitently, they muſt be led forth with the workers of iniquity in the Day of Judgment, be openly condemn'd, and puniſh'd with everlaſting Deſtruction from the preſence of the LORD, and the glory of His Power. But it may be ſome of theſe things will be thought a digreſſion from the Head laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd. I hope all may ſerve to ſhew us, what an hainous and vile Sin this is. However, I ſpeak not theſe things as preſuming to ſit in judgment, and paſs ſentence upon any particular Perſons charg'd with this Crime.</p>
               <p>MAY our honoured Rulers be directed and ſpirited at all times, to be a Terror to ſuch evil works and workers, that the guilt of blood may not lie on the Land. May they be humbly

               </p>
               <p>THIS is a vile Sin, and ſuch as live &amp; allow themſelves in it can't inherit the Kingdom of GOD, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.9, 10. There is a Wo denounc'd againſt ſuch Sinners.

THIS Sin is ſtrictly forbidden in GOD's Law, Eph. 5.3. <hi>But Fornication, and all Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let it not be once named among you, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh ſaints.</hi> It dreadfully defiles both the Body, and Soul.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>EVIL doers tempt Others to the Sin of Gaming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is a great Breach of the Eighth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Men to uſe Gaming as a trade to get Money. And yet ſome practiſe it, and tempt others to it for filthy lucre. Games in themſelves innocent become unlawful, when Men play for Sums of Money, or ſpend much precious time at them, making a buſineſs of that which is deſign'd for Recreation. This is wickedly to pervert the end and uſe of them. And then, the Games fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd to get gain, are by worthy Divines judg'd unlawful in themſelves; ſuch are <hi>Dice</hi> and <hi>Cards.</hi> Thus the judicious Dr. <hi>Ames,</hi> "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns ſuch Games as depend upon a Lot wholly or principally, and that becauſe in Lots there's no exerciſe or trial of skill; becauſe a Lot contains a ſpecial appeal to that Providence whereby it is govern'd, Prov. 16.33. <hi>The Lot is caſt into the lap; but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord,</hi> Becauſe ſuch Plays do from their own Nature offer a ſingular occaſion to various Sins, as Curſing, and Blaſpheming upon the account of their bad fortune and ill luck, as they call it, (and what is this, but to blaſpheme the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD;) alſo to obſtinate Contention,
<pb facs="unknown:003102_0026_0FEFA65D79C32F88"/>while they are expecting what they account a more equal Lot."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Ames Caſ. Conſc. p. 158, 9.</note>. And from the nature of theſe Games it may further be ſaid, that they have a pernicious tendency to bewitch Men. For when there is chiefly a trial of skill, and a Man finds his Antagoniſt is more than his match, by being beaten ſeveral times, he is diſcourag'd and willing to give over: But in Games of Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery a Man thinks he is overcome not ſo much by his Neighbour's skill as by ſome good luck or chance, as they ſpeak, which he hath in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and ſo he is tempted to try again &amp; again, hoping to gain this on his own ſide, till he hath prodigally thrown away much of his Eſtate. And when Men are finally diſappointed, how apt are they to curſe GOD and quarrel with Men! I might add, That GOD ſeems in his Providence to have ſet an eſpecial Mark of his diſpleaſure on theſe Games in the Evils conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon them; and then, they are of ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the moſt ſober, judicious Chriſtians. Let all then avoid ſuch Games, and the Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sinners to them. If any have got their Neighbour's Money in ſuch unlawful ways, let them Repent and make Reſtitution, leſt the Curſe of GOD enter into their Souls, and into their Houſes, and conſume them. Jer. 17.11. <hi>As the partridge ſitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not: ſo be that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his days, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> If any Young People, or others have addicted themſelves to this vile Sin, let them now take warning by the Providence of GOD, and reform, leſt it lead to others that ſhall Prove their Ruin.</p>

II. <hi>WE may conſider ſome of the vile Methods wicked Men uſe to draw Others into Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can't pretend to unfold all the myſteries of iniquity, nor diſcover all the ſtratagems us'd by them to compaſs their evil deſigns. I ſhall hint at ſome more obvious, that we may reſiſt theſe inſtruments of the Devil, not being ignorant of their devices. Now ſometimes they attempt this by <hi>Profeſſing Friendſhip,</hi> they infinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by pretending Eſteem, they ſpeak them fair and ſeek to beguile them with enticing words. Prov. 7.21, 22. <hi>With her much fair ſpeech ſhe cauſed him to yield, with the flattering of her lips ſhe forced him. He goeth after her ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as an ox goeth to the ſlaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the ſtocks.</hi> Thus they flatter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary Creatures to their Ruin. As <hi>Joah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Amaſa,</hi> art thou in health my brother, and took him by the beard to <hi>kiſs him;</hi> but <hi>ſmote him,</hi> and ſhed out his bowels to the ground, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.9, 10. At other times they tempt by their <hi>Countenance and Geſtures.</hi> Prov. 6.13. <hi>He winketh with his eyes, he ſpeaketh with his feel, be teacheth with his fingers.</hi> There's a wanton Eye, impure Glances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes they uſe <hi>fair Promiſes.</hi> Prov. 1.11, 13. Come with us, <hi>let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cauſe: Let us ſwallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as thoſe that go down into the pit. We ſhall ſind all precious ſubſtance.</hi> Thus the Adulterous Woman promis'd the fooliſh Young Man pleaſure, that they ſhou'd not be detected in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c. Prov.</hi> 7.18, 20. Thus they hide the hook with a gilded bate, and cover the ſnare, that they may catch unwary People, and draw them into miſchief, as <hi>the fiſhes of the ſea are taken
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003102_0028_0FEFA6604D649AA8"/>in an evil net, and as the birds are caught in the ſnare.</hi> At other times <hi>they Threaten them,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus if Men ſeem to depend upon them for their buſineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will put them in fear leſt they fail them, unleſs they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them in ſuch or ſuch evil Practices; they muſt follow them to the Tavern, it may be, or other Places of temptation; they muſt <hi>keep open their Shops,</hi> and work on the Evening before the Sabbath day-light, or theſe evil Men will deny them their Cuſtom. Yea, ſuch evil doers have ſometimes endeavoured to offer violence to Men's Conſciences by <hi>breathing out threatnings</hi> and ſlaughter againſt the followers of JESUS CHRIST. Thus did <hi>Saul</hi> before his Converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.1. <hi>He compelled</hi> the profeſſors of the Name of CHRIST, <hi>to blaſpheme</hi> the Son of GOD, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.11. Not as if Men cou'd in a ſtrict ſenſe be laid under a neceſſity of Sinning; they ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer the moſt grievous torments, yea, death it ſelf. But then, ſuch Sinners ſeek in this way to teſtify, and as much as in them lies to force them to act contrary to the light and convictions of their own Conſciences. An impious thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Again, ſometimes they tempt to Sin <hi>under a colour of zeal for Religion.</hi> As the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> taught, That if Children devoted what they cou'd ſpare to the Treaſury of the Temple, they were free from their obligation to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their poor Parents, and ſo ſought to render the fifth Commandment of no effect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.5—7.</p>
               <p>At other times they lay aſide the mask, and impudently <hi>Banter Men out of their Religion,</hi> ſeeking to repreſent this moſt excellent thing as unbecoming Men of faſhion and breeding. Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable impiety!</p>

Deſtruction &amp; miſery are in their paths, and the End is death, Pſal. 37.6. <hi>Evil doers ſhall be cut off.</hi> And will you give your Years, the flower of your days, to ſuch cruel ones that hunt for the precious life? Ah fooliſh and unwiſe! Turn ye, Turn ye, why will you die! O take heed! leſt you become <hi>over much wicked, and die before your time</hi>

Job 31.3. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the wicked? and a ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the workers of iniquity?</hi> Yes ſurely. GOD ſometimes inflicts amazing Judgments on them in this life; but ſuppoſe, as to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, there ſhou'd now be one Event to the Righteous and the wicked; yet the Judge of all Earth will do right.
