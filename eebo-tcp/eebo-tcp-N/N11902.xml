            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the following Obſervations. I have taken that liberty of examining public meaſures, which, happily for this kingdom, every perſon in it enjoys.

            <p>After all that has been written on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with <hi>America,</hi> no reader can expect to be informed, in this publication, of much that he has not before known.

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OUR Colonies in NORTH America appear to be now determined to do and ſuffer every thing, under the perſuaſion, that GREAT BRITAIN is attempting to rob them of that Liberty to which every member of ſociety, and all civil communities, have a natural and unalienable right. The queſtion, therefore, whether this is a reaſonable perſuaſion, is highly intereſting, and deſerves the moſt careful attention of every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> who values Liberty, and wiſhes to avoid ſtaining himſelf with the guilt of invading it. But it is impoſſible to judge properly of this queſtion without correct ideas of Liberty <hi>in general</hi>; and of the nature, limits, and principles of Civil Liberty <hi>in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>—The following obſervations on this ſubject appear to me important, as well as juſt; and I cannot make myſelf eaſy without offering them to the public at the preſent period, big with events of the laſt conſequence to this kingdom. I do this with reluctance and pain, urged by ſtrong feelings, but at the ſame time checked by the conſciouſneſs that I am likely to deliver ſentiments not favourable to the preſent meaſures of that government, under which I live, and to which I am a conſtant and zealous well-wiſher. Such, however, are my preſent ſentiments and views, that this is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inferior moment with me; and, as I hope never to go beyond the bounds of decent diſcuſſion and expoſtulation, I flatter myſelf, that I ſhall be able to avoid giving any perſon juſt cauſe of offence.</p>
            <p>The obſervations with which I ſhall begin, are of a more general and abſtracted nature; but being, in my opinion, of particular conſequence; and neceſſary to introduce what I have principally in view, I hope they will be patiently read and conſidered.</p>

               <head>SECTION I. Of the Nature of Liberty in General.</head>
               <p>IN order to obtain a more diſtinct and accurate view of the nature of Liberty as ſuch, it will be uſeful to conſider it under the four following general diviſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Phyſical</hi> Liberty.—Secondly, <hi>Moral</hi> Liberty.— Thirdly, <hi>Religious</hi> Liberty.—And Fourthly, <hi>Civil</hi> Liberty. —Theſe heads comprehend under them all the different kinds of Liberty. And I have placed <hi>Civil</hi> Liberty laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I mean to apply to it all I ſhall ſay of the other kinds of Liberty.</p>
               <p>By PHYSICAL LIBERTY I mean that principle of <hi>Sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neity,</hi> or <hi>Self-determination,</hi> which conſtitutes us <hi>Agents</hi>; or which gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly <hi>ours,</hi> and not effects of the operation of any foreign cauſe.—MORAL LIBERTY is the power of following, in all circumſtances, our ſenſe of right and wrong; or of acting in conformity to our reflecting and moral principles, without being controuled by any contrary principles.—RELIGIOUS LIBERTY ſignifies the power of exerciſing, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, that mode of religion which we think beſt; or of making the deciſions of our own conſciences, reſpecting religious truth, the rule of our conduct, and not any of the deciſions of others.—In like manner, CIVIL LIBERTY is the power of a <hi>Civil Society</hi> or <hi>State</hi> to govern itſelf by its own diſcretion; or by laws of its own making, without being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any foreign diſcretion, or to the impoſitions of any extraneous will or power.</p>
               <p>It ſhould be obſerved, that, according to theſe definitions of the different kinds of liberty, there is one general idea, that runs through them all; I mean, the idea of <hi>Self-direction,</hi> or <hi>Self government.</hi>—Did our volitions originate not with <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> but with ſome cauſe over which we have no power; or were we under a neceſſity of always following ſome will diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from our own, we ſhould want PHYSICAL LIBERTY.</p>
               <p>In like manner; he whoſe perceptions of moral obligation are controuled by his paſſions has loſt his <hi>Moral Liberty</hi>; and the moſt common language applied to him is, that he wants <hi>Self-government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:015032_0005_0F95506836FEB858"/>He likewiſe who, in religion, cannot govern himſelf by his convictions of religious duty, but is obliged to receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularies of faith, and to practiſe modes of worſhip impoſed upon him by others, wants <hi>Religious Liberty.</hi>—And the Community alſo that is governed, not by itſelf, but by ſome will independent of it, and over which it has no controul, wants <hi>Civil Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all theſe caſes there is a force which ſtands oppoſed to the agent's <hi>own</hi> will; and which, as far as it operates, produces <hi>Servitude.</hi>—In the firſt caſe, this force is incompatible with the very idea of voluntary motion; and the ſubject of it is a mere paſſive inſtrument which never <hi>acts,</hi> but is always <hi>acted upon.</hi>—In the <hi>ſecond</hi> caſe; this force is the influence of paſſion getting the better of reaſon; or the <hi>brute</hi> overpowering and conquering the will of the <hi>man.</hi>—In the <hi>third</hi> caſe; it is <hi>Human Authority</hi> in religion requiring conformity to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular modes of faith and worſhip, and ſuperſeding <hi>private judgment.</hi>—And in the laſt caſe, it is any will diſtinct from that of the Majority of a Community, which claims a power of making laws for it, and diſpoſing of its property.</p>
               <p>This it is, I think, that marks the limit, or that lays the line between <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Slavery.</hi> As far as, in any inſtance, the operation of any cauſe comes in to reſtrain the power of Self-government, ſo far Slavery is introduced: Nor do I think that a preciſer idea than this of Liberty and Slavery can be formed.</p>
               <p>I cannot help wiſhing I could here fix my reader's attention, and engage him to conſider carefully the dignity of that bleſſing to which we give the name of LIBERTY, according to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation now made of it. There is not a word in the whole compaſs of language which expreſſes ſo much of what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and excellent. It is, in every view of it, a bleſſing truly ſacred and invaluable.—Without <hi>Phyſical Liberty,</hi> man would be a machine acted upon by mechanical ſprings, having no principle of motion in himſelf or command over events; and, therefore incapable of all merit and demerit.—With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Moral Liberty</hi> he is a wicked and deteſtable being, ſubject to the tyranny of baſe luſts, and the ſport of every vile appetite. —And without <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Civil Liberty</hi> he is a poor and abject animal, without rights, without property, and without a conſcience, bending his neck to the yoke, and crouching to the will of every ſilly creature who has the inſolence to pretend to authority over him.—Nothing, therefore, can be of ſo much
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015032_0006_0F95507500E3A558"/>
conſequence to us as <hi>Liberty.</hi> It is the foundation of all honour, and the chief privilege and glory of our natures.</p>
               <p>In fixing our ideas on the ſubject of Liberty it is of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular uſe to take ſuch an enlarged view of it as I have now given. But the immediate object of the preſent enquiry being <hi>Civil Liberty,</hi> I will confine to it all the ſubſequent obſervations.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>SECTION II. Of Civil Liberty and the Principles of Government.</head>
               <p>FROM what has been ſaid, it is obvious, that all civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as far as it can be denominated <hi>free,</hi> is the creature of the people. It originates with them. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted under their direction; and has in view nothing but their happineſs. All its different forms are no more than ſo many different modes in which they chuſe to direct their affairs, and to ſecure the quiet enjoyment of their rights.— In every free ſtate every man is his own legiſlator.—All <hi>taxes</hi> are free gifts for public ſervices.—All <hi>laws</hi> are particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions or regulations eſtabliſhed by COMMON CONSENT for gaining protection and ſafety.—And all <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are Truſtees or Deputies for carrying theſe regulations into execution.</p>
               <p>Liberty, therefore, is too imperfectly defined when it is ſaid to be "a Government by LAWS, and not by MEN." If the laws are made by one man, or a junto of men in a ſtate, and not by COMMON CONSENT, a government by them does not differ from Slavery. In this caſe it would be a contradiction in terms to ſay that the ſtate governs itſelf.</p>
               <p>From hence it is obvious that <hi>Civil Liberty,</hi> in its moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree, can be enjoyed only in ſmall ſtates, where every member is capable of giving his ſuffrage in perſon, and of being choſen into public offices. When a ſtate becomes ſo numerous, or when the different parts of it are removed to ſuch diſtances from one another, as to render this impracticable, a diminution of Liberty neceſſarily ariſes. There are, however, in theſe circumſtances, methods by which ſuch near approaches may be made to perfect Liberty as ſhall anſwer all the purpoſes of government, and at the ſame time ſecure every right of human nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015032_0007_0F9550690142FB98"/>Tho' all the members of a ſtate ſhould not be capable of giving their ſuffrages on public meaſures, <hi>individually</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally,</hi> they may do this by the appointment of <hi>Subſtitutes</hi> or <hi>Repreſentatives.</hi> They may entruſt the powers of legiſlation, ſubject to ſuch reſtrictions as they ſhall think neceſſary, with any number of <hi>Delegates</hi>; and whatever can be done by ſuch delegates, within the limits of their truſt, may be conſidered as done by the united voice and counſel of the community.— In this method a free government may be eſtabliſhed in a large ſtate; and it is conceiveable that by regulations of this kind, any number of ſtates might be ſubjected to a ſcheme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that would exclude the deſolations of war, and produce univerſal peace and order.</p>
               <p>Let us think here of what may be practicable in this way with reſpect to <hi>Europe</hi> in particular.— While it continues divided, as it is at preſent, into a great number of independent kingdoms, whoſe intereſts are continually claſhing, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that diſputes will often ariſe which muſt end in war and carnage. It would be no remedy to this evil to make one of theſe ſtates ſupreme over the reſt; and to give it an abſolute plenitude of power to ſuperintend and controul them. This would be to ſubject all the ſtates to the arbitrary diſcretion of one, and to eſtabliſh an ignominious ſlavery not poſſible to be long endured. It would, therefore, be a remedy worſe than the diſeaſe; nor is it poſſible it ſhould be approved by any mind that has not loſt every idea of Civil Liberty. On the contrary.—Let every ſtate, with reſpect to all its internal concerns, be continued independent of all the reſt; and let a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral confederacy be formed by the appointment of a SENATE conſiſting of Repreſentatives from all the different ſtates. Let this SENATE poſſeſs the power of managing all the <hi>common</hi> concerns of the united ſtates, and of judging and deciding between them, as a common <hi>Arbiter</hi> or <hi>Umpire,</hi> in all diſputes; having, at the ſame time, under its direction, the common force of the ſtates to ſupport its deciſions.—In theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, each ſeparate ſtate would be ſecure againſt the interference of foreign power in its private concerns, and, therefore, would poſſeſs <hi>Liberty</hi>; and at the ſame time it would be ſecure againſt all oppreſſion and inſult from every neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate.—Thus might the ſcattered force and abilities of a whole continent be gathered into one point; all litigations ſettled as they roſe; univerſal peace preſerved; and nation prevented <hi>from any more lifting up a ſword againſt nation.</hi>

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:015032_0008_0F955075C4471F90"/>I have obſerved, that though, in a great ſtate, all the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals that compoſe it cannot be admitted to an immediate participation in the powers of legiſlation and government, yet they may participate in theſe powers by a delegation of them to a body of repreſentatives.—In this caſe it is evident that the ſtate will be ſtill <hi>free</hi> or <hi>ſelf-governed</hi>; and that it will be more or leſs ſo in proportion as it is more or leſs fairly and adequately repreſented. If the perſons to whom the truſt of government is committed hold their places for ſhort terms; if they are choſen by the unbiaſſed voices of a majority of the ſtate, and ſubject to their inſtructions; Liberty will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in its higheſt degree. But if they are choſen for long terms by a part only of the ſtate; and if during that term they are ſubject to no controul from their conſtituents; the very idea of Liberty will be loſt, and the power of chuſing conſtituents becomes nothing but a power, lodged in a <hi>few,</hi> to chuſe, at certain periods, a body of <hi>Maſters</hi> for themſelves and for the reſt of the Community. And if a ſtate is ſo ſunk that the body of its repreſentatives are elected by a handful of the <note n="*" place="bottom">In <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> conſiſting of near ſix <hi>millions</hi> of inhabitants, 5723 perſons, moſt of them the loweſt of the people, elect one half of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi>; and 364 votes chuſe a ninth part. This may be ſeen diſtinctly made out in the <hi>Political Diſquiſitions,</hi> Vol. I. Book 2. C. 4. a work full of important and uſeful inſtruction.</note> meaneſt perſons in it, whoſe votes are always paid for; and if alſo, there is a higher will on which even theſe mock repreſentatives themſelves depend, and that directs their voices: In theſe circumſtances, it will be an abuſe of language to ſay that the ſtate poſſeſſes Liberty. Private men, indeed, might be allowed the exerciſe of Liberty; as they might alſo under the moſt deſpotic government; but it would be an <hi>indulgence</hi> or <hi>connivance</hi> derived from the ſpirit of the times, or from an accidental mildneſs in the adminiſtration. And, rather than be governed in ſuch a manner, it would perhaps be better to be governed by the will of one man without any repreſentation: For a repreſentation ſo degenerated could anſwer no other end than to miſlead and deceive, by diſguiſing ſlavery, and keeping up a <hi>form</hi> of Liberty when the <hi>reality</hi> was loſt.</p>
               <p>Within the limits now mentioned, Liberty may be enjoyed in every poſſible degree; from that which is complete and perfect, to that whch is merely nominal; according as the people have more or leſs of a ſhare in government, and of a controuling power over the perſons by whom it is adminiſtered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015032_0009_0F955069CEB6E438"/>In general, to be <hi>free</hi> is to be guided by one's own will; and to be guided by the will of another is the characteriſtic of <hi>Servitude.</hi> This is particularly applicable to Political Liberty. That ſtate, I have obſerved, is <hi>free,</hi> which is guided by its own will; or, (which comes to the ſame) by the will of an aſſembly of repreſentatives appointed by itſelf and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to itſelf. And every ſtate that is not ſo governed; or in which a body of men repreſenting the people make not an eſſential part of the Legiſlature, is in <hi>ſlavery.</hi>—In order to form the moſt perfect conſtitution of government, there may be the beſt reaſons for joining to ſuch a body of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, an <hi>Hereditary Council,</hi> conſiſting of men of the firſt rank in the ſtate, with a <hi>Supreme executive Magiſtrate</hi> at the head of all. This will form uſeful checks in a legiſlature; and contribute to give it vigour, union, and diſpatch, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infringing liberty: for, as long as that part of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which repreſents the people is a <hi>fair repreſentation</hi>; and alſo has a negative on all public meaſures, together with the ſole power of impoſing taxes and originating ſupplies; the eſſentials of liberty will be preſerved.—We make it our boaſt in this country, that this is our own conſtitution. I will not ſay with how much reaſon.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch Liberty as I have now deſcribed, it is impoſſible that there ſhould be an exceſs. Government is an inſtitution for the benefit of the people governed, which they have power to model as they pleaſe; and to ſay, that they can have too much of this power is to ſay, that there ought to be a power in the ſtate ſuperior to that which gives it being, and from which all juriſdiction in it is derived.—Licentiouſneſs, which has been commonly mentioned, as an extreme of liberty, is indeed its oppoſite. It is government by the will of rapacious individuals, in oppoſition to the will of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, made known and declared in the laws. A free ſtate, at the ſame time that it is free itſelf, makes all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers free by excluding licentiouſneſs, and guarding their perſons and property and good name againſt inſult. It is the end of all juſt government, at the ſame time that it ſecures the liberty of the public againſt <hi>foreign</hi> injury, to ſecure the liberty of the individual againſt <hi>private</hi> injury. I do not, therefore, think it ſtrictly juſt to ſay, that it belongs to the nature of government to entrench on private liberty. It ought never to do this, except as far as the exerciſe of private liberty
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015032_0010_0F9550768E4949A0"/>
encroaches on the liberties of others. That is, it is licentiouſneſs it reſtrains, and liberty itſelf only when uſed to deſtroy liberty.</p>
               <p>It appears from hence, that licentiouſneſs and deſpotiſm are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike inconſiſtent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that the one is the licentiouſneſs of <hi>great</hi> men, and the other the licentiouſneſs of <hi>little</hi> men; or that, by the one, the perſons and property of a people are ſubject to outrage and invaſion from a King, or a lawleſs body of <hi>Grandees</hi>; and that, by the other, they are ſubject to the like outrage from a <hi>lawleſs mob.</hi>—In avoiding one of theſe evils, mankind have often run into the other. But all well-conſtituted governments guard equally againſt both. Indeed of the two, the laſt is, on ſeveral accounts, the leaſt to be dreaded, and has done the leaſt miſchief. It may be truly ſaid, that if licentiouſneſs has deſtroyed its thouſands, deſpotiſm has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed its millions. The former, having little power, and no ſyſtem to ſupport it, neceſſarily finds its own remedy; and a people ſoon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it. But a deſpotiſm, wearing the form of government, and being armed with its force, is an evil not to be conquered without dreadful ſtruggles. It goes on from age to age, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing the human faculties, levelling all diſtinctions, and preying on the rights and bleſſings of ſociety.—It deſerves to be added, that in a ſtate diſturbed by licentiouſneſs, there is an animation which is favourable to the human mind, and which puts it upon exerting its powers. But in a ſtate habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to a deſpotiſm, all is ſtill and torpid. A dark and ſavage tyranny ſtifles every effort of genius; and the mind loſes all its ſpirit and dignity.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to what I have farther in view, I will obſerve, that the account now given of the principles of public Liberty, and the nature of an equal and free government, ſhews what judgment we ſhould form of that OMNIPOTENCE, which, it has been ſaid, muſt belong to every government as ſuch. Great ſtreſs has been laid on this, but moſt unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. —Government, as has been before obſerved is, in the very nature of it, a TRUST; and all its powers a DELEGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION for gaining particular ends. This <hi>truſt</hi> may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied and abuſed. It may be employed to defeat the very ends for which it was inſtituted; and to ſubvert the very
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015032_0011_0F95506AF79C82E0"/>
rights which it ought to protect.—A PARLIAMENT, for inſtance, conſiſting of a body of repreſentatives choſen for a limited period, to make laws, and to grant money for public ſervices, would forfeit its authority by making itſelf perpetual, or even prolonging its own duration; by nominating its own members; by accepting bribes; or ſubjecting itſelf to any kind of foreign influence. This would convert a <hi>Parliament</hi> into a <hi>conclave</hi> or <hi>junto</hi> of ſelf-created tools; and a ſtate that has loſt its regard to its own rights, ſo far as to ſubmit to ſuch a breach of truſt in its rulers, is enſlaved.—Nothing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can be more abſurd than the doctrine which ſome have taught, with reſpect to the omnipotence of parliaments. They poſſeſs no power beyond the limits of the truſt for the execution of which they were formed. If they contradict this truſt, they betray their conſtituents, and diſſolve themſelves. All delegated power muſt be ſubordinate and limited.—If omnipotence can, with any ſenſe, be aſcribed to a legiſlature, it muſt be lodged where all legiſlative authority originates; that is, in the PEOPLE. For <hi>their</hi> ſakes government is inſtituted; and their's is the only real omnipotence.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible, that all I have been ſaying would be very abſurd, were the opinions juſt which ſome have maintained concerning the origin of government. According to theſe opinions, government is not the creature of the people, or the reſult of a convention between them and their rulers: But there are certain men who poſſeſs in themſelves, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the will of the people, a right of governing them, which they derive from the Deity. This doctrine has been abundantly refuted by many <note n="*" place="bottom">See among others Mr. Locke on Government, and Mr. Prieſtley's Eſſay on the firſt Principles of Government.</note> excellent writers. It is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which avowedly ſubverts Civil Liberty; and which repreſents mankind as a body of vaſſals, formed to deſcend like cattle from one ſet of owners to another, who have an abſolute dominion over them. It is a wonder, that thoſe who view their ſpecies in a light ſo humiliating, ſhould ever be able to think of themſelves without regret and ſhame. The inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe obſervations is not to oppoſe ſuch ſentiments; but, taking for granted the reaſonableneſs of Civil Liberty, to ſhew wherein it conſiſts, and what diſtinguiſhes it from its contrary.—And in conſidering this ſubject, as it has been now treated, it is unavoidable to reflect on the excellency of a free government, and its tendency to exalt the nature of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015032_0012_0F9550774DAD86A0"/>
man.—Every member of a free ſtate, having his property ſecure, and knowing himſelf his own governor, poſſeſſes a conſciouſneſs of dignity in himſelf, and feels incitements to emulation and improvement, to which the miſerable ſlaves of arbitrary power muſt be utter ſtrangers. In ſuch a ſtate all the ſprings of action have room to operate, and the mind is ſtimulated to the nobleſt exertions.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. Prieſtley on Government, page 68, 69, &amp;c.</note>—But to be obliged, from our birth, to look up to a creature no better than our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the maſter of our fortunes; and to receive his will as our law—What can be more humiliating? What elevated ideas can enter a mind in ſuch a ſituation?—Agreeably to this remark; the ſubjects of free ſtates have, in all ages, been moſt diſtinguiſhed for genius and knowledge. Liberty is the ſoil where the arts and ſciences have flouriſhed; and the more free a ſtate has been, the more have the powers of the human mind been drawn forth into action, and the greater number of brave men has it produced. With what luſtre do the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient free ſtates of <hi>Greece</hi> ſhine in the annals of the world? How different is that country now, under the Great <hi>Turk?</hi> The difference between a country inhabited by men, and by brutes, is not greater.</p>
               <p>Theſe are reflections which ſhould be conſtantly preſent to every mind in this country.—As <hi>Moral</hi> Liberty is the prime bleſſing of man in his <hi>private</hi> capacity, ſo is <hi>Civil</hi> Liberty in his <hi>public</hi> capacity. There is nothing that requires more to be <hi>watched</hi> than power. There is nothing that ought to be oppoſed with a more determined reſolution than its encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Sleep in a State, as <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> ſays, is always followed by ſlavery.</p>
               <p>The people of this kingdom were once warmed by ſuch ſentiments as thoſe. Many a ſycophant of power have they ſacrificed. Often have they fought and bled in the cauſe of Liberty. But that time ſeems to be going. The fair inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Liberty left us by our anceſtors many of us are not unwilling to reſign. And abandoned venality, the inſeperable companion of diſſipation and extravagance, has poiſoned the ſprings of public virtue among us: And ſhould any events ever ariſe that ſhould render the oppoſition neceſſary that took place in the times of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>James</hi> the Second, I am afraid all that is valuable to us would be loſt. The terror of the ſtanding army, the danger of the public funds, and the all-corrupting influence of the treaſury, would deaden all zeal, and produce general acquieſcence and ſervility.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. Of the Authority of one Country over another.</head>
               <p>FROM the nature and principles of Civil Liberty, as they have been now explained, it is an immediate and neceſſary inference that no one community can have any power over the property or legiſlation of another community, that is not incorporated with it by a juſt and adequate repreſentation.— Then only, it has been ſhewn, is a State <hi>free,</hi> when it is governed by its own will. But a country that is ſubject to the legiſlature of another country, in which it has no voice, and over which it has no controul, cannot be ſaid to be governed by its own will. Such a country therefore, is in a ſtate of ſlavery. And it deſerves to be particularly conſidered, that ſuch a ſlavery is worſe, on ſeveral accounts, than any ſlavery of private men to one another, or of kingdoms to deſpots within themſelves.—Between one ſtate and another, there is none of that fellow-feeling that takes place between perſons in private life. Being detached bodies that never ſee one another, and reſiding perhaps in different quarters of the globe, the ſtate that governs cannot be a witneſs to the ſufferings occaſioned by its oppreſſions; or a competent judge of the circumſtances and abilities of the people who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. They muſt alſo have in a great degree ſeparate intereſts; and the more the one is loaded, the more the other may be eaſed. The infamy likewiſe of oppreſſion, being in ſuch circumſtances ſhared among a multitude, is not likely to be much felt or regarded. — On all theſe accounts there is, in the caſe of one country ſubjugated to another, little or nothing to check rapacity; and the moſt flagrant injuſtice and cruelty may be practiſed without remorſe or pity.—I will add, that it is particularly difficult to ſhake off a tyranny of this kind. A ſingle deſpot, if the people are unanimous and reſolute, may be ſoon ſubdued. But a deſpotic ſtate is not eaſily ſubdued; and a people ſubject to it cannot emancipate themſelves without entering into a dreadful, and, perhaps, very unequal conteſt.</p>
               <p>I cannot help obſerving farther, that the ſlavery of a people to internal deſpots may be qualified and limited; but I don't ſee what can limit the authority of one ſtate over another. The exerciſe of power in this caſe can have no other meaſure than diſcretion; and, therefore, muſt be indefinite and abſolute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015032_0014_0F95507806CFDDB0"/>Once more. It ſhould be conſidered that the government of one country by another, can only be ſupported by a military force; and, without ſuch a ſupport, muſt be deſtitute of all weight and efficacy.</p>
               <p>This will be beſt explained by putting the following caſe. —There is, let us ſuppoſe, in a province ſubject to the ſovereignty of a diſtant ſtate, a ſubordinate legiſlature, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Aſſembly choſen by the people; a Council choſen by that Aſſembly; and a Governor <hi>appointed</hi> by the Sovereign State, and paid by the Province. There are, likewiſe, judges and other officers, appointed and paid in the ſame manner, for adminiſtering <hi>juſtice</hi> agreeably to the laws, by the verdicts of juries fairly and indiſcriminately choſen.—This forms a conſtitution ſeemingly free, by giving the people a ſhare in their own government, and ſome check on their rulers. But, while there is a higher legiſlative power, to the controul of which ſuch a conſtitution is ſubject, it does not itſelf poſſeſs Liberty, and therefore, cannot be of any uſe as a ſecurity to Liberty; nor is it poſſible that it ſhould be of long duration. Laws offenſive to the Province will be enacted by the Sovereign State. The legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of the Province will remonſtrate againſt them. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates will not execute them. Juries will not convict upon them; and conſequently, like the Pope's Bulls which once go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>Europe,</hi> they will become nothing but forms and empty ſounds, to which no regard will be ſhewn.—In order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this evil, and to give efficiency to its government, the ſupreme ſtate will naturally be led to withdraw the <hi>Governor,</hi> the <hi>Council,</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The independency of the Judges we eſteem in this country one of our greateſt privileges.—Before the revolution they generally, I believe, held their places <hi>during pleaſure.</hi> King William gave them their places <hi>during good behaviour.</hi> At the acceſſion of the preſent Royal Family their places were given them <hi>during good behaviour,</hi> in conſequence of the Act of Settlement, 12 and 13 W. III. c. 2. But an opinion having been entertained by ſome, that though their commiſſions were made under the Act of Settlement to continue, during good behaviour, yet that they determined on the demiſe of the Crown; it was enacted by a ſtatute made in the firſt year of his preſent Majeſty, Chap. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>3.
<q>That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of Judges for the time being ſhall be, continue, and remain in full force, during their good behaviour, notwithſtanding the demiſe of his Majeſty, or of any of his Heirs and Succeſſors;</q>
with a proviſo,
<q>that it may be lawful for his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, to remove any Judge upon the addreſs of both Houſes of Parliament.</q>
And by the ſame Statute their ſalaries are ſecured to them during the continuance of their commiſſions: His Majeſty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preamble of the Statute, having been pleaſed to declare from the Throne to both Houſes of Parliament,
<q>That he looked upon the Independency and uprightouſneſs of Judges, as eſſential to the impartial adminiſtration of Juſtice, as one of the beſt ſecurities to the Rights and Liberties of his loving Subjects, and as moſt conducive to the honour of his Crown.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A worthy friend and able Lawyer has ſupplied me with this note. It affords, when contraſted with that <hi>dependence</hi> of the Judges which has been thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in <hi>America,</hi> a ſad ſpecimen of the different manner in which a kingdom may think proper to govern itſelf, and the provinces ſubject to it.</p>
                  </note> from the controul of the Province,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015032_0015_0F95506C01024530"/>
by making them entirely dependent on itſelf for their <hi>pay</hi> and <hi>continuance in office,</hi> as well as for their appointment. It will alſo alter the mode of chuſing Juries on purpoſe to bring them more under its influence: And in ſome caſes, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the impoſſibility of gaining an impartial trial where government is reſiſted, it will perhaps ordain, that offenders ſhall be removed from the Province to be tried within its own territories: And it may even go ſo far in this kind of policy, as to endeavour to prevent the effects of diſcontents, by forbidding all meetings and aſſociations of the people, except at ſuch times, and for ſuch particular purpoſes, as ſhall be permitted them.</p>
               <p>Thus will ſuch a Province be exactly in the ſame ſtate that <hi>Britain</hi> would be in, were our firſt executive Magiſtrate, our Houſe of Lords, and our Judges, nothing but the inſtruments of a foreign democratical power; were our Juries nominated by that power; or were we liable to be tranſported to a diſtant country to be tried for offences committed here; and reſtrained from calling any meetings, conſulting about any grievances, or aſſociating for any purpoſes, except when leave ſhould be given us by a <hi>Lord Lieutenant</hi> or <hi>Viceroy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain that this is a ſtate of oppreſſion which no country could endure, and to which it would be vain to expect that any people ſhould ſubmit an hour without an armed force to compel them.</p>
               <p>The late tranſactions in <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay</hi> are a perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification of what I have now ſaid. The government of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in that Province has gone on exactly in the train I have deſcribed; till at laſt it became neceſſary to ſtation troops there, not amenable to the civil power; and all termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in a government by the SWORD. And ſuch, if a people are not ſunk below the character of men, will be the iſſue of all governments in ſimilar circumſtances.</p>
               <p>It may be aſked—
<q>Are there not cauſes by which one ſtate may acquire a <hi>rightful</hi> authority over another, though not conſolidated by an adequate Repreſentation?</q>
— I anſwer that there are no ſuch cauſes.—All the cauſes to which ſuch an effect <hi>can</hi> be aſcribed are CONQUEST, COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PACT, or OBLIGATIONS CONFERRED.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:015032_0016_0F955078B79D80C8"/>Much has been ſaid of the right of <hi>conqueſt</hi>; and hiſtory contains little more than accounts of kingdoms reduced by it under the dominion of other kingdoms, and of the havock it has made among mankind. But the authority derived from hence, being founded on violence, is never <hi>rightful.</hi> The <hi>Roman Republic</hi> was nothing but a faction againſt the general liberties of the world; and had no more right to give law to the Provinces ſubject to it, than thieves have to the property they ſeize, or to the houſes into which they break.—Even in the caſe of a juſt war undertaken by one people to defend itſelf againſt the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of another people, conqueſt gives only a right to an indemnification for the injury which occaſioned the war, and a reaſonable ſecurity againſt future injury.</p>
               <p>Neither can any ſtate acquire ſuch an authority over other ſtates in virtue of any <hi>compacts</hi> or <hi>ceſſions.</hi> This is a caſe in which compacts are not binding. <hi>Civil</hi> Liberty is, in this reſpect, on the ſame footing with <hi>Religious</hi> Liberty. As no people can lawfully ſurrender their <hi>Religious</hi> Liberty, by giving up their right of judging for themſelves in religion, or by allowing any human beings to preſcribe to them what faith they ſhall embrace, or what mode of worſhip they ſhall practiſe; ſo neither can any civil ſocieties lawfully ſurrender their <hi>Civil</hi> Liberty, by giving up to any extraneous juriſdiction their power of legiſlating for themſelves and diſpoſing of their property. Such a ceſſion, being inconſiſtent with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable rights of human nature, would either not bind at all; or bind only the individuals who made it. This is a bleſſing which no one generation of men can give up for another; and which, when loſt, a people have always a right to reſume.—Had our anceſtors in this country been ſo mad as to have ſubjected themſelves to any foreign Community, we could not have been under any obligation to continue in ſuch a ſtate. And all the nations now in the world who, in conſequence of the tameneſs and folly of their predeceſſors, are ſubject to arbitrary power, have a right to emancipate themſelves as ſoon as they can.</p>
               <p>If neither <hi>conqueſt</hi> nor <hi>compact</hi> can give ſuch an authority, much leſs can any favours received, or any ſervices performed by one ſtate for another.—Let the favour received be what it will, Liberty is too dear a price for it. A ſtate that has been <hi>obliged</hi> is not, therefore, bound to be <hi>enſlaved.</hi> It

ought, if poſſible, to make an adequate return for the ſervices done to it; but to ſuppoſe that it ought to give up the power of governing itſelf, and the diſpoſal of its property, would be to ſuppoſe, that, in order to ſhew its gratitude, it ought to part with the power of ever afterwards exerciſing gratitude.— How much has been done by this kingdom for <hi>Hanover?</hi> But no one will ſay that on this account, we have a right to make the laws of <hi>Hanover</hi>; or even to draw a ſingle penny from it without its own conſent.</p>
               <p>After what has been ſaid it will, I am afraid, be trifling to apply the preceding arguments to the caſe of different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, which are conſidered a different parts of the ſame <hi>Empire.</hi> But there are reaſons which render it neceſſary for me to be explicit in making this application.</p>
               <p>What I mean here is juſt to point out the difference of ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation between communities forming and <hi>Empire</hi>; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bodies or claſſes of men forming different parts of a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Different communities forming an <hi>Empire</hi> have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, which produce a neceſſary reciprocation of intereſts between them. They inhabit different diſtricts, and are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by different legiſlatures.—On the contrary. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent claſſes of men <hi>within a kingdom</hi> are all placed on the ſame ground. Their concerns and intereſts are the ſame; and what is done to one part muſt affect all—Theſe are ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions totally different; and a conſtitution of government that may be conſiſtent with Liberty in one of them, may be entirely inconſiſtent with it in the other. It is, however, certain that, even in the laſt of theſe ſituations, no one part ought to govern the reſt. In order to a fair and equal government, there ought to be a fair and equal repreſentation of all that are governed; and as far as this is wanting in any government, it deviates from the principles of Liberty, and becomes unjuſt and oppreſſive.—But in the circumſtances of different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, all this holds with unſpeakably more force. The government of a part in this caſe becomes complete tyranny, and ſubjection to it becomes complete ſlavery.</p>
               <p>But ought there not, it is aſked, to exiſt ſomewhere in an <hi>Empire</hi> a ſupreme legiſlative authority over the whole; or a power to controul and bind all the different ſtates of which it conſiſts.—This enquiry has been already anſwered. The truth is, that ſuch a ſupreme controuling power ought to exiſt no where except in ſuch a SENATE or body of delegates as that deſcribed in page 7; and that the authority or ſupremacy
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015032_0018_0F955079753E2850"/>
of even this Senate ought to be limited to the common concerns of the <hi>Empire.</hi>—I think I have proved that the fundamental principles of Liberty neceſſarily require this.</p>
               <p>In a word. An <hi>Empire</hi> is a collection of ſtates or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities united by ſome common bond or tye. If theſe ſtates have each of them free conſtitutions of government, and, with reſpect to taxation and internal legiſlation, are independent of the other ſtates, but united by compacts or alliances, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to a Great <hi>Council,</hi> repreſenting the whole, or to one monarch entruſted with the ſupreme executive power: In theſe circumſtances, the Empire will be an Empire of Freemen. —If, on the contrary, like the different provinces ſubject to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> none of the ſtates poſſeſs any independent legiſlative authority; but are all ſubject to an abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, whoſe will is their law; then is the Empire an Empire of Slaves.—If one of the ſtates is free, but governs by its will all the other ſtates; then is the Empire, like that of the Romans in the times of the republic, an Empire conſiſting of one ſtate free, and the reſt in ſlavery: Nor does it make any more difference in this caſe, that the governing ſtate is itſelf free, than it does in the caſe of a kingdom ſubject to a <hi>deſpot,</hi> that this deſpot is himſelf free. I have before obſerved, that this only makes the ſlavery worſe. There is, in the one caſe, a chance, that in the quick ſucceſſion of deſpots, a good one will ſometimes ariſe. But bodies of men continue the ſame; and have generally proved the moſt unrelenting of all tyrants.</p>
               <p>A great writer, before <note n="*" place="bottom">Monteſquieu's Spirit of Laws, Vol. 1, Book 11. C. xix.</note> quoted, obſerves of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that while Liberty was at the center, tyranny pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the diſtant provinces; that ſuch as were free under it were extremely ſo, while thoſe who were ſlaves groaned under the extremity of ſlavery; and that the ſame events that <hi>deſtroyed</hi> the liberty of the former, <hi>gave</hi> liberty to the latter.</p>
               <p>The liberty of the <hi>Romans,</hi> therefore, was only an additional calamity to the provinces governed by them; and though it might have been ſaid of the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were the "freeſt members of any civil ſociety in the known world;" yet of the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> it muſt have been ſaid, that they were the completeſt ſlaves in the known world.—How remarkable is it, that this very people, once the freeſt of mankind, but at the ſame time the moſt proud and tyrannical, ſhould become at laſt the moſt contemptible and abject ſlaves that ever exiſted?</p>

            <p>IN the foregoing diſquiſitions, I have, from one leading prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, deduced a number of conſequences, that ſeem to me incapable of being diſputed. I have meant that they ſhould be applied to the great queſtion between this kingdom and the Colonies which has occaſioned the preſent war with them.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible, but my readers muſt have been all along making this application; and if they ſtill think, that the claims of this kingdom are reconcileable to the principles of true liberty and legitimate government, I am afraid, that nothing I ſhall farther ſay will have any effect on their judgments. I wiſh, however, they would have the patience and candour to go with me, and grant me a hearing ſome time longer.</p>
            <p>Though clearly decided in my own judgment on this ſubject, I am inclined to make great allowances for the different judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others. We have been ſo uſed to ſpeak of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies as <hi>our</hi> Colonies, and to think of them as in a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to us, and as holding their exiſtence in <hi>America</hi> only for our uſe, that it is no wonder the prejudices of many are alarmed, when they find a different doctrine maintained. The meaneſt perſon among us is diſpoſed to look upon himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as having a body of ſubjects in <hi>America</hi>; and to be offended at the denial of his right to make laws for them, though perhaps he does not know what colour they are of, or what language they talk.—Such are the natural prejudices of this country.— But the time is coming, I hope, when the unreaſonableneſs of them will be ſeen; and more juſt ſentiments prevail.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed, I beg it may be attended to, that I have choſen to try this queſtion by the general principle of Civil Liberty; and not by the practice of former times; or by the <hi>Charters</hi> granted the Colonies.—The arguments <hi>for</hi> them, drawn from theſe laſt topics, appear to me greatly to outweigh the arguments <hi>againſt</hi> them. But I wiſh to have this queſtion brought to a higher teſt, and ſurer iſſue. The queſtion with all liberal enquirers ought to be, not what juriſdiction over them <hi>Precedents, Statutes,</hi> and <hi>Charters</hi> give, but that reaſon and equity, and the rights of humanity give.—This is, in truth, a queſtion which no kingdom has ever before had occaſion to agitate. The caſe of a free country branching itſelf out in the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015032_0020_0F95507BB68FD1B8"/>
manner <hi>Britain</hi> has done, and ſending to a diſtant world colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which have there, from ſmall beginnings, and under free legiſlatures of their own, increaſed, and formed a body of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſtates, likely ſoon to become ſuperior to the parent ſtate. —This is a caſe which is new in the hiſtory of mankind; and it is extremely improper to judge of it by the rules of any nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and partial policy; or to conſider it on any other ground than the general one of reaſon and juſtice.—Thoſe who will be candid enough to judge on this ground, and who can diveſt themſelves of national prejudices, will not, I fancy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long unſatisfied.—But alas! Matters are gone too far. The diſpute probably muſt be ſettled another way; and the ſword alone, I am afraid, is now to determine what the rights of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America</hi> are.—Shocking ſituation!—Deteſted be the meaſures which have brought us into it: And, if we are endeavouring to enforce injuſtice, curſed will be the war. —A retreat, however, is not yet impracticable. The duty we owe our gracious ſovereign obliges us to rely on his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſtay the ſword, and to promote the happineſs of all the different parts of the Empire at the head of which he is placed. With ſome hopes, therefore, that it may not be too late to reaſon on this ſubject, I will, in the following Sections, enquire what the war with <hi>America</hi> is in the following reſpects.</p>

               <head>SECTION I. Of the Juſtice of the War with America.</head>
               <p>THE enquiry, whether the war with the Colonies is a <hi>juſt</hi> war, will be be beſt determined by ſtating the power over them, which it is the end of the war to maintain: And this connot be better done, than in the words of an act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made on purpoſe to define it. That act, it is well known, declares,
<q>That this kingdom has power, and of right ought to have power to make laws and ſtatutes to bind the Colonies, and people of <hi>America,</hi> in all caſes whatever.</q>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:015032_0021_0F95507C78C3AD60"/>
—Dreadful power indeed! I defy any one to expreſs ſlavery in ſtronger language. It is the ſame as declaring "that we have a right to do with them what we pleaſe."—I will not waſte my time by applying to ſuch a claim any of the preceeding arguments. If my reader does not feel more in this caſe, than words can expreſs, all reaſoning muſt be vain.</p>
               <p>But, probably, moſt perſons will be for uſing milder lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and for ſaying no more than, that the united legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> have of right power to tax the Colonies, and a ſupremacy of legiſlation over <hi>America.</hi>— But this comes to the ſame. If it means any thing, it means, that the property, and the legiſlations of the Colonies, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the abſolute diſcretion of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and ought of right to be ſo. The nature of the thing admits of no limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Colonies can never be admitted to be judges, how far the authority over them in theſe caſes ſhall extend. This would be to deſtroy it entirely,—If <hi>any</hi> part of their property is ſubject to our diſcretion, the <hi>whole</hi> muſt be ſo. If we have a right to interfere at all in their internal legiſlations, we have a right to interfere as far as we think proper.—It is ſelf-evident, that this leaves them nothing they can call <hi>their own.</hi>—And what is it that can give to any people ſuch a ſupremacy over another people?—I have already examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the principal anſwers which have been given to this enquiry. But it will not be amiſs in this place to go over ſome of them again.</p>
               <p>It has been urged, that ſuch a right muſt be lodged ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, "in order to preſerve the UNITY of the Britiſh Empire."</p>
               <p>Pleas of this ſort have, in all ages, been uſed to juſtify tyranny.—They have in RELIGION given riſe to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs oppreſſive claims, and ſlaviſh Hierarchies. And in the <hi>Romiſh Communion</hi> particularly, it is well known, that the POPE claims the title and powers of the ſupreme head on earth of the Chriſtian church, in order to preſerve its UNITY. —With reſpect to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, nothing can be more prepoſterous than to endeavour to maintain its unity, by ſetting up ſuch a method of eſtabliſhing unity, which, like the ſimilar method in religion, can produce nothing but miſchief. —The truth is, that a common relation to one ſupreme executive head; an exchange of kind offices; tyes of intereſt and affection, and <hi>compacts,</hi> are ſufficient to give the Britiſh
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015032_0022_0F95507D356FFA38"/>
Empire all the unity that is neceſſary. But if not—If, in order to preſerve its <hi>Unity,</hi> one half of it muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the other half, let it, in the name of God, want Unity.</p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid of "the <hi>Superiority</hi> of the Britiſh State." But what gives us our ſuperiority?—Is it our <hi>Wealth?</hi>—This never confers real dignity. On the contrary: Its effect is always to debaſe, intoxicate, and corrupt.—Is it the <hi>numbers of our people?</hi> The Colonies will ſoon be equal to us in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.—Is it our <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Virtue?</hi> They are probably <hi>equally</hi> knowing, and <hi>more</hi> virtuous. There are names among them that will not ſtoop to any names among the philoſophers and politicians of this iſland.</p>
               <p>"But we are the PARENT STATE."—Theſe are the magic words which have fascinated and miſled us.—The Engliſh came from <hi>Germany.</hi> Does that give the <hi>German</hi> ſtates a right to tax us?—Children, having no property, and being incapable of guiding themſelves, the author of nature has committed the care of them to their parents, and ſubjected them to their abſolute authority. But there is a period when, having acquired property, and a capacity of judging for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they become independent agents; and when, for this reaſon, the authority of their parents ceaſes, and becomes nothing but the reſpect and influence due to benefactors. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, therefore, that the order of nature in eſtabliſhing the relation between parents and children, ought to have been the rule of our conduct to the Colonies, we ſhould have been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually relaxing our authority as they grew up. But like mad parents, we have done the contrary; and, at the very time when our authority ſhould have been moſt relaxed, we have carried it to the greateſt extent, and exerciſed it with the greateſt rigour. No wonder then, that they have turned upon us; and obliged us to remember that they are not children.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But we have, it is ſaid, protected them, and run deeply in debt on their account.</q> —The full anſwer to this has been already given (p. 16, 17.) Will any one ſay, that all we have done for them has not been more on our <hi>own</hi> account,<note n="*" place="bottom">This is particularly true of the <hi>bounties</hi> granted on ſome American commodities (as pitch, tar, indigo, &amp;c.) when imported into <hi>Britain</hi>; for it is well known, that the end of granting them was, to get thoſe commodities cheaper from the Colonies and in return for our manufactures, which we uſed to get from <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and other foreign countries. And this is expreſſed in the preambles of the laws which grant theſe bounties. See the Appeal to the Juſtice, &amp;c. page 21, third edition. It is, therefore, ſtrange that Doctor TUCKER and others, ſhould have inſiſted ſo much upon theſe bounties as favours and indulgences to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,—But it is ſtill more ſtrange, that the ſame repreſentation ſhould have been made of the compenſations granted them for doing more during the laſt war in aſſiſting us than could have been reaſonably expected; and alſo of the ſums we have ſpent in maintaining troops among them <hi>without</hi> their conſent; and in oppoſition to their wiſhes.—See a Pamphlet, entitled "The rightt of Great Britain aſſerted againſt the claims of America."</note> than on
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015032_0023_0F95507DF62C1290"/>
                  <hi>theirs?</hi>—But ſuppoſe the contrary. Have they done nothing for us? Have they made no compenſation for the protection they have received? Have they not helped us to pay our <hi>taxes,</hi> to ſupport our poor, and to bear the burden of our debts, by taking from us, at our own price, all the commodities with which we can ſupply them?—Have they not, for our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, ſubmitted to many reſtraints in acquiring property? Muſt they likewiſe reſign to us the diſpoſal of that property?— Has not their excluſive trade with us been for many years one of the chief ſources of our national wealth and power?— In all our wars have they not fought by our ſide, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to our ſucceſs? In the laſt war particularly, it is well known, that they ran themſelves deeply in debt; and that the parliament thought it neceſſary to grant them conſiderable ſums annually as compenſations for going beyond their abilities in aſſiſting us. And in this courſe would they have continued for many future years; perhaps, for ever.—In ſhort, were an accurate account ſtated, it is by no means certain which ſide would appear to be moſt indebted. When aſked as <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> they have hitherto ſeldom diſcovered any reluctance in giving. But, in obedience to a demand, and with the bayonet at their breaſts, they will give us nothing but blood.</p>
               <p>It is farther ſaid, "that the land on which they ſettled was ours."—But how came it to be ours? If ſailing along a coaſt can give a right to a country, then might the people of <hi>Japan</hi> become, as ſoon as they pleaſe, the proprietors of <hi>Britain.</hi> Nothing can be more chimerical than property founded on ſuch a reaſon. If the land on which the Colonies firſt ſettled had any proprietors, they were the natives. The greateſt part of it they bought of the natives. They have ſince cleared and cultivated it; and, without any help from us, converted a wilderneſs into fruitful and pleaſent fields. It is, therefore, now on a double account their property; and no power on earth can have any right to diſturb them in the poſſeſſion of it, or to take from them without their conſent, any part of its produce.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015032_0024_0F95507EB64EB1D8"/>But let it be granted, that, the land was ours. Did they not ſettle upon it under the faith of charters which promiſed them the enjoyment of all the rights of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>; and allowed them to tax themſelves, and to be governed by legiſlatures of their own, ſimilar to ours? Theſe charters were given them by an authority, which at the time was thought competent; and they have been rendered ſacred by an acquieſcence on our part for more than a century. Can it be wondered at, that the Colonies ſhould revolt, when they found their Charters violated; and an attempt made to force INNOVATIONS upon them by famine and the ſword?—But I lay no ſtreſs on charters. They derive their rights from a higher ſource. It is inconſiſtent with common ſenſe to imagine, that any people would ever think of ſettling in a diſtant country, on any ſuch condition, as that the people from whom they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, ſhould forever be maſters of their property, and have power to ſubject them to any modes of government they pleaſed. And had there been expreſs ſtipulations to this purpoſe in all the charters of the colonies, they would, in my opinion, be no more bound by them, than if it had been ſtipulated with them, that they ſhould go naked, or expoſe themſelves to the incurſion of wolves and tigers.</p>
               <p>The defective ſtate of the repreſentation of this kingdom has been farther pleaded to prove our right to tax <hi>America.</hi> We ſubmit to a parliament that does not repreſent us, and therefore they ought.—How ſtrange an argument is this? It is ſaying we want liberty; and therefore, they ought to want it.—Suppoſe it true, that they are indeed contending for a better conſtitution of government, and more liberty than we enjoy. Ought this to make us angry?—Who is there that does not ſee the danger to which this country is expoſed?—Is it generous, becauſe we are in a ſink, to endeavour to draw them into it? Ought we not rather to wiſh earneſtly, that there may at leaſt be ONE FREE COUNTRY left upon earth, to which we may fly, when venality, luxury, and vice have completed the ruin of liberty here?</p>
               <p>It is, however, by no means true, that <hi>America</hi> has no more right to be exempted from taxation by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, than <hi>Britain</hi> itſelf.—<hi>Here,</hi> all freeholders, and burgeſſes in boroughs, are repreſented. <hi>There,</hi> not one <hi>Freeholder,</hi> or any other perſon, is repreſented.—<hi>Here,</hi> the <hi>aids</hi> granted by the repreſented part of the kingdom muſt be proportionably
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015032_0025_0F95507F7881BA90"/>
                  <hi>paid</hi> by themſelves; and the laws they make for <hi>others,</hi> they at the ſame time make for <hi>themſelves. There,</hi> the aids they would grant would not be <hi>paid,</hi> but <hi>received,</hi> by themſelves; and the laws they made would be made for <hi>others only.</hi>—In ſhort, the relation of one country to another country, whoſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives have the power of taxing it (and of appropriating the money raiſed by the taxes) is much the ſame with the relation of a country to a ſingle deſpot, or a body of deſpots, within itſelf, inveſted with the like power. In both caſes, the people taxed and thoſe who tax have ſeparate intereſts; nor can there be any thing to check oppreſſion, beſides either the abilities of the people taxed, or the humanity of the <hi>taxers.</hi>— But indeed I can never hope to convince that perſon of any thing, who does not ſee an eſſential difference <note n="*" place="bottom">It gives me pleaſure to find, that the author of the <hi>Remarks on the Principal Acts of the</hi> 13<hi>th Parliament of Great Britain,</hi> &amp;c. acknowledges this difference. —It has, however, been at the ſame time mortifying to me to find ſo able a writer adopting ſuch principles of government, as are contained in this work. According to him, a people have no property or rights, except ſuch as their <hi>Civil governors</hi> are pleaſed not to take from them. Taxes, therefore, he aſſerts, are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>But enough has been ſaid by others on this point; nor is it poſſible for me to throw any new light upon it. To finiſh, therefore, what I meant to offer under this head, I muſt beg that the following conſiderations may be particularly attended to.</p>
               <p>The queſtion now between us and the Colonies is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in reſpect of taxation and internal legiſlation, they are bound to be ſubject to the juriſdiction of this kingdom: Or, in other words, Whether the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament has or has not of right, a power to diſpoſe of their property, and to model as it pleaſes their governments?—To this ſupremacy over them, we ſay, we are entitled; and in order to maintain it, we have begun the preſent war.—Let me here enquire,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> Whether, if we have now this ſupremacy, we ſhall not be equally entitled to it in any future time?—They are now but little ſhort of half our number. To this number they have grown, from a ſmall body of original ſettlers, by a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015032_0026_0F95508038817C10"/>
very rapid increaſe. The probability is, that they will go on to increaſe; and that, in 50 or 60 years, they will be <hi>double</hi> our number;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Obſervations on Reverſionary Payments, page 207, &amp;c.</note> and form a mighty Empire, conſiſting of a variety of ſtates, all equal or ſuperior to ourſelves in all the arts and accompliſhments, which give dignity and happineſs to human life. In that period, will they be ſtill bound to acknowledge that ſupremacy over them which we now claim? Can there be any perſon who will aſſert this; or whoſe mind does not revolt at the idea of a vaſt continent, holding all that is valuable to it, at the diſcretion of a handful of people on the other ſide the <hi>Atlantic?</hi>—But if, at that period, this would be unreaſonable; what makes it otherwiſe <hi>now?</hi>—Draw the line, if you can.—But there is ſtill a greater difficulty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Britain</hi> is now, I will ſuppoſe, the ſeat of Liberty and virtue, and its legiſlature conſiſts of a body of able and independent men, who govern with wiſdom and juſtice. The time may come when all will be reverſed: When its excellent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of government will be ſubverted: When preſſed by debts and taxes, it will be greedy to draw to itſelf an increaſe of revenue from every diſtant Province, in order to eaſe its own burthens: When the influence of the Crown, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by luxury and an univerſal profligacy of manners, will have tainted every heart, broken down every fence of Liberty, and rendered us a nation of tame and contented vaſſals: When a general <hi>Election</hi> will be nothing but a general <hi>Auction</hi> of <hi>Boroughs</hi>: And when the PARLIAMENT, the Grand Council of the nation, and once the faithful guardian of the ſtate, and a terror to evil miniſters, will be degenerated into a body of <hi>Sycophants,</hi> dependent and venal, always ready to confirm <hi>any</hi> meaſures; and little more than a public court for regiſtering royal edicts.—Such, it is poſſible, may, ſome time or other, be the ſtate of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>—What will, at that period, be the duty of the Colonies? Will they be ſtill bound to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional ſubmiſſion? Muſt they always continue an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to our government! and follow it implicitly through every change that can happen to it?—Wretched condition, indeed, of millions of freemen as good as ourſelves — Will you ſay that we now govern equitably; and that there is no danger of any ſuch revolution?—Would to God this were true.—But will you not always ſay the ſame? Who ſhall
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015032_0027_0F955080F87074B0"/>
judge whether we govern equitably or not?—Can you give the Colonies any <hi>ſecurity</hi> that ſuch a period will never come? —Once more.</p>
               <p>If we have indeed that power which we claim over the legiſlations and internal rights of the Colonies, may we not, whenever we pleaſe, ſubject them to the arbitrary power of the crown?—I do not mean that this would be a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous change: For I have before obſerved, that if a people are to be ſubject to an external power over which they have no command, it is better that power ſhould be lodged in the hands of one man than of a multitude. But many perſons think otherwiſe; and ſuch ought to conſider that, if this would be a calamity, the condition of the Colonies muſt be deplorable.—"A government by King, Lords, and Commons, (it has been ſaid) is the perfection of government;" and ſo it is, when the Commons are a juſt repreſentation of the people; and when alſo, it is not extended to any diſtant people, or communities, not repreſented. But if this is the <hi>beſt,</hi> a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by a king only muſt be the <hi>worſt</hi>; and every claim implying a right to eſtabliſh ſuch a government among any people muſt be unjuſt and cruel.—It is ſelf-evident, that by claiming a right to alter the conſtitution of the Colonies, according to our diſcretion, we claim this power: And it is a power that we have thought fit to exerciſe in <hi>one</hi> of our Colonies; and that we have attempted to exerciſe in <hi>another. —Canada,</hi> according to the late extenſion of its limits, is a country almoſt as large as half <hi>Europe</hi>; and it may poſſibly come in time to be filled with Britiſh ſubjects. The <hi>Quebec</hi> act makes the king of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> a deſpot over all that country.—In the Province of <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay</hi> the ſame thing has been attempted and begun.</p>
               <p>The act for BETTER <hi>regulating their government,</hi> paſſed at the ſame time with the <hi>Quebec</hi> act, gives the king the right of appointing and removing at his pleaſure, the members of one part of the legiſlature; alters the mode of chuſing juries, on purpoſe to bring it more under the influence of the king; and takes away from the province the power of calling any meetings of the people without the king's conſent.<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 15.</note>—The judges, likewiſe, have been made dependent on the king, for their nomination and pay, and continuance in office.—If all this is no more than we have a right to do; may we not go on
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015032_0028_0F955081B4E9FD70"/>
to aboliſh the houſe of repreſentatives, to deſtroy all trials by juries, and to give up the province abſolutely and totally to the will of the king?—May we not even eſtabliſh popery in the province, as has been lately done in <hi>Canada,</hi> leaving the ſupport of proteſtantiſm to the king's diſcretion?—Can there be any Engliſhman who, were it his own caſe, would not ſooner loſe his heart's blood than yield to claims ſo pregnant with evils, and deſtructive to every thing that can diſtinguiſh a <hi>Freeman</hi> from a <hi>Slave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will take this opportunity to add, that what I have now ſaid, ſuggeſts a conſideration that demonſtrates, on how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent a footing the Colonies are with reſpect to our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from particular bodies of men <hi>within</hi> the kingdom, who happen not to be repreſented. Here, it is impoſſible that the repreſented part ſhould ſubject the unrepreſented part to arbitrary power, without including themſelves. But in the Colonies it is <hi>not</hi> impoſſible. We know that it <hi>has</hi> been done.</p>

               <head>SECT. II. Whether the War with <hi>America</hi> is juſtified by the Principles of the Conſtitution.</head>
               <p>I HAVE propoſed, in the next place, to examine the war with the Colonies by the principles of the conſtitution.— I know, that it is common to ſay that we are now maintaining the conſtitution in <hi>America.</hi> If this means that we are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to eſtabliſh our own conſtitution of government there; it is by no means true; nor, were it true, would it be right. They have chartered governments of their own with which they are pleaſed; and which, if any power on earth may change without their conſent, that power may likewiſe, if it thinks proper, deliver them over to the <hi>Grand Seignior.</hi>— Suppoſe the Colonies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had, by compacts, enjoyed for near a century and a half, free governments open to all the world, and under which they had grown and flouriſhed; what ſhould we think of thoſe kingdoms, were they to attempt to deſtroy their governments, and to force upon them their own mode of government? Should we not
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015032_0029_0F955083992F4400"/>
applaud any zeal they diſcovered in repelling ſuch an injury? —But the truth is, in the preſent inſtance, that we are not maintaining but violating our own conſtitution in <hi>America.</hi> The eſſence of our conſtitution conſiſts in its independency. There is in this caſe no difference between <hi>ſubjection</hi> and <hi>annihilation.</hi> Did, therefore, the Colonies poſſeſs governments perfectly the ſame with ours, the attempt to ſubject them to ours would be an attempt to ruin them. A free government loſes its nature from the moment it becomes liable to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or altered by any ſuperior power.</p>
               <p>But I intended here principally to make the following ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The fundamental principle of our government is, "The right of a people to give and grant their own money." —It is of no conſequence, in this caſe, whether we enjoy this right in a proper manner or not. Moſt certainly we do not. It is, however, the <hi>principle</hi> on which our government, as a <hi>free</hi> government, is founded. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the conſtitution gives it us; and, however imperfectly enjoyed, we glory in it as our firſt and greateſt bleſſing. It was an attempt to encroach upon this right, in a trifling inſtance, that produced the civil war in the reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt.—Ought not our brethren in <hi>America</hi> to enjoy this right as well as ourſelves? Do the principles of the conſtitution give it us, but deny it to them? Or can we, with any decency, pretend that when we give to the king <hi>their</hi> money, we give him <hi>our own?</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The author of <hi>Taxation no Tyranny</hi> will undoubtedly aſſert this without heſitation, for in page 69 he compares our preſent ſituation with reſpect to the Colonies to that of the antient <hi>Scythians,</hi> who, upon returning from a war, <hi>found themſelves ſhut out of their own</hi> HOUSES <hi>by their</hi> SLAVES.</note>—What diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence does it make, that in the time of <hi>Charles the Firſt</hi> the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to take away this right was made by <hi>one man</hi>; but that, in the caſe of <hi>America,</hi> it is made by a body of men?</p>
               <p>In a word. This is a war undertaken not only againſt the principles of our own conſtitution; but on purpoſe to deſtroy other ſimilar conſtitutions in <hi>America</hi>? and to ſubſtitute in their room a military force. See page 14, 15.—It is, therefore, a groſs and flagrant violation of the conſtitution.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. Of the Policy of the War with <hi>America.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN writing the preſent Section, I have entered upon a ſubject of the laſt importance, on which much has been ſaid by other writers with great force, and in the ableſt manner.<note n="†" place="bottom">See particularly, a ſpeech intended to have been ſpoken on the bill for altering the Charter of the Colony of Maſſachuſett's Bay; the <hi>Conſiderations on the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures carrying on with reſpect to the Britiſh Colonies</hi>; and the <hi>Two Appeals to the Juſtice and Intereſts of the People.</hi>
                  </note> But I am not willing to omit any topic which I think of great importance, merely becauſe it has already been diſcuſſed: And, with reſpect to this in particular, it will, I believe, be found that ſome of the obſervations on which I ſhall inſiſt, have not been ſufficiently attended to.</p>
               <p>The object of this war has been often enough declared to be "maintaining the ſupremacy of this country over the colonies." I have already enquired how far reaſon and juſtice, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Liberty, and the rights of humanity, entitle us to this ſuperemacy. Setting aſide, therefore, now, all conſiderations of this kind, I would obſerve, that this ſupremacy is to be maintained, either merely <hi>for it's own ſake,</hi> or for the ſake of ſome public intereſt connected with it and dependent upon it. —If <hi>for its own ſake</hi>; the only object of the war is the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of dominion; and its only motive is the luſt of power.— All government, even <hi>within</hi> a ſtate, becomes tyrannical, as far as it is a needleſs and wanton exerciſe of power; or is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried farther than is abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve the peace and to ſecure the ſafety of the ſtate. This is what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent writer calls GOVERNING TOO MUCH; and its effect muſt always be, weakening government by rendering it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and odious.—Nothing can be of more importance, in governing diſtant provinces and adjuſting the claſhing inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of different ſocieties, than attention to this remark. In theſe circumſtances, it is <hi>particularly</hi> neceſſary to make a ſparing uſe of power.—Happy would it have been for <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> had this been remembered by thoſe who have lately conducted its affairs. But our policy has been of another kind. At a period when our policy ſhould have been moſt concealed, it has been brought moſt in view; and, by a progreſſion of violent meaſures, every one of which has increaſed diſtreſs, we have given the world reaſon to conclude, that we are acquainted with no other method of governing than <hi>by force.</hi>—What a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015032_0031_0F955084B7631F78"/>
ſhocking miſtake?—If our object is power, we ſhould have known better how to uſe it; and our rulers ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that freemen will always revolt at the ſight of a naked ſword; and that the complicated affairs of a great kingdom, holding in ſubordination to it a multitude of diſtant commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, all jealous of their rights, and warmed with ſpirits as high as our own, require not only the moſt ſkilful, but the moſt cautious and tender management. The conſequences of a different management we are now feeling, We ſee our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves driven among rocks, and in danger of being loſt.</p>
               <p>There are the following reaſons which ſeem to make it too probable, that the preſent conteſt with <hi>America</hi> is a conteſt for power only, <note n="*" place="bottom">I have heard it ſaid by a perſon in one of the firſt departments of the ſtate, that the preſent conteſt is for DOMINION on the ſide of the colonies, as well as on ours: And ſo it is, indeed; but with this eſſential difference. <hi>We</hi> are ſtruggling for dominion over OTHERS. <hi>They</hi> are ſtruggling for SELF dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The nobleſt of all bleſſings.</note> abſtracted from all the advantages connected with it.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> There is a love of power for it own ſake inherent in human nature; and it cannot be uncharitable to ſuppoſe that the nation in general, and the cabinet in particular, are too likely to be influenced by it. What can be more flattering than to look acroſs the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> and to ſee in the boundleſs continent of <hi>America,</hi> increaſing MILLIONS whom we have a right to order as we pleaſe, who hold their property at our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and who have no other law than our will. With what complacency have we been uſed to talk of them as OUR ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?—Is it not the interruption they now give to this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Is it not the oppoſition they make to our pride; and not any injury they have done us, that is the ſecret ſpring of our preſent animoſity againſt them?—I wiſh all in this kingdom would examine themſelves carefully on this point. Perhaps, they might find, that they have not known what ſpirit they are of.—Perhaps they would become ſenſible, that it was a ſpirit of domination, more than a regard to the true intereſt of this country, that lately led ſo many of them, with ſuch ſavage folly, to addreſs the throne for the ſlaughter of their brethren in <hi>America,</hi> if they will not ſubmit to them; and to make offers of their lives and fortunes for that purpoſe.—Indeed, I am perſuaded, that, where pride and the luſt of dominion exterminated from every heart among us, and the humility of Chriſtians infuſed in their room, this quarrel would be ſoon ended.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:015032_0032_0F955085760B4808"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> Another reaſon for believing that this is a conteſt for power only is, that our miniſters have frequently declared, that their object is not to draw a revenue from <hi>America</hi>; and that many of thoſe who are warmeſt for continuing it, repreſent the <hi>American trade</hi> as of no great conſequence.</p>
               <p>But what deſerves particular conſideration here is, that this is a conteſt from which no advantage can poſſibly be derived, —Not a revenue: For the provinces of America, when deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, will afford no revenue; or if it ſhould, the expence of ſubduing them and keeping them in ſubjection will much exceed that revenue.—Not any of the advantages of trade: For it is a folly, next to inſanity, to think trade can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by impoveriſhing our cuſtomers, and fixing in their minds an everlaſting abhorrence of us.—It remains, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this war can have no other object than the extenſion of power.—Miſerable reflection!—To ſheath our ſwords in the bowels of our brethren, and ſpread miſery and ruin among a happy people, for no other end than to oblige them to acknowledge our ſupremacy. How horrid!—This is the curſed ambition that led a <hi>Caeſar</hi> and an <hi>Alexander,</hi> and many other mad conquerors, to attack peaceful communities, and to lay waſte the earth.</p>
               <p>But a worſe principle than even this, influences ſome among us. Pride and the love of dominion are principles hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough; but blind reſentment and the deſire of revenge are infernal principles; and theſe, I am afraid, have no ſmall ſhare at preſent in guiding our public conduct.—One cannot help indeed being aſtoniſhed at the virulence, with which ſome ſpeak on the preſent occaſion againſt the Colonies.—For, what have they done?—Have they croſſed the ocean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded us? Have they attempted to take from us the fruits of our labour, and to overturn that form of government which we hold ſo ſacred?—This cannot be pretended.—On the contrary. This is what we have done to them.—We have tranſported ourſelves to their peaceful retreats, and employed our fleets and armies to ſtop up their ports, to deſtroy their commerce, to ſeize their effects and to burn their towns. Would we but let them alone, and ſuffer them to enjoy in ſecurity their property and governments, inſtead of diſturbing us, they would thank and bleſs us. And yet it is WE WHO imagine ourſelves ill-uſed.—The truth is, we expected to find them a cowardly rabble who would lie quietly at our feet,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015032_0033_0F9550863610D5E8"/>
and they have diſappointed us. They have riſen in their own defence, and repelled force by force. They deny the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our power over them; and inſiſt on being treated as free communities —It is THIS that has provoked us; and kindled our governors into rage.</p>
               <p>I hope I ſhall not be here underſtood to intimate, that <hi>all</hi> who promote this war are actuated by theſe principles. Some, I doubt not, are influenced by no other principle, than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what they think the authority of this country over its Colonies, and to the unity and indiviſibility of the Britiſh Empire. I wiſh ſuch could be engaged to enter thoroughly into the enquiry, which has been the ſubject of the firſt part of this pamphlet; and to conſider, particularly, how different a thing maintaining the authority of government <hi>within</hi> a ſtate is from maintaining the authority of one people over another, already happy in the enjoyment of a government of their own. I wiſh farther they would conſider, that the deſire of maintaining authority is warrantable, only ſo far as it is the means of promoting ſome end, and doing ſome good; and that, before we reſolve to ſpread famine and fire through a country in order to make it acknowledge our authority, we ought to be aſſured that great advantages will ariſe not only to ourſelves but to the country we wiſh to conquer.—That from the preſent conteſt no advantage to ourſelves can ariſe, has been already ſhewn, and will preſently be ſhewn more at large.— That no advantage to the Colonies can ariſe from it, need not, I hope, be ſhewn. It has however been aſſerted, that even <hi>their</hi> good is intended by this war. Many of us are perſuaded, that they will be much happier under our government, than under any government of their own; and that their liberties will be ſafer when held for them by us, than when truſted in their own hands.—How kind is it thus to take upon us the trouble of judging for them what is moſt for their happineſs? Nothing can be kinder, except the reſolution we have formed to extirminate them, if they will not ſubmit to our judgment. —What ſtrange language have I ſometimes heard? By an armed force we are now endeavouring to deſtroy the laws and governments of America; and yet I have heard it ſaid, that we are endeavouring to ſupport law and government there. We are inſiſting upon our right to levy contributions upon them; and to maintain this right, we are bringing upon them all the miſeries a people can endure; and yet it is aſſerted; that we mean nothing but their ſecurity and happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:015032_0034_0F955086F7C90568"/>But I have wandered a little from the point I intended prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to inſiſt upon in this ſection, which is,
<q>the folly, in reſpect of policy, of the meaſures which have brought on this conteſt; and its pernicious and fatal tendency.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The following obſervations will, I believe abundantly prove this.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> There are points which are likely always to ſuffer by diſcuſſion. Of this kind are moſt points of authority and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; and the beſt policy is to avoid, as much as poſſible, giving any occaſion for calling them into queſtion.</p>
               <p>The Colonies were at the beginning of this reign in the habit of acknowledging our authority, and of allowing us as much power over them as our intereſt required; and more, in ſome inſtances, than we could reaſonably claim. This habit they would have retained; and had we, inſtead of impoſing new burdens upon them, and increaſing their reſtraints, ſtudied to promote their commerce, and to grant them new Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they would have been always growing more attached to us. Luxury, and, together with it, their dependence upon us, and our influence <note n="*" place="bottom">This has been our policy with reſpect to the people of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, that we now ſee their parliament as obedient as we can wiſh.</note> in their aſſemblies, would have increaſed, till in time perhaps they would become as corrupt as ourſelves; and we might have ſucceeded to our wiſhes in eſtabliſhing our authority over them.—But, happily for them, we have choſen a different courſe. By exertions of authority which have alarmed them, they have been put upon examining into the grounds of all our claims, and forced to give up their luxuries, and to ſeek all their reſources within themſelves: And the iſſue is likely to prove the loſs of <hi>all</hi> our authority over them, and of all the advantages connected with it. So little do men in power ſometimes know how to preſerve power; and ſo remarkably does the deſire of extending do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſometimes deſtroy it.—Mankind are naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to continue in ſubjection to that mode of government, be it what it will, under which they have been born and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Nothing rouſes them into reſiſtance but groſs abuſes, or ſome particular oppreſſions out of the road to which they have been uſed. And he who will examine the hiſtory of the world will find, there has generally been more reaſon for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that they have been too patient, than that they have been turbulent and rebellious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:015032_0035_0F955087B704BB68"/>Our governors, ever ſince I can remember, have been jealous, that the Colonies, ſome time or other, would throw off their dependence. This jealouſy was not founded on any of their acts or declarations. They have always, while at <hi>peace</hi> with us, diſclaimed any ſuch deſign; and they have continued to diſclaim it ſince they have been at <hi>war</hi> with us. I have reaſon, indeed, to believe, that independency is, even at this moment, generally dreaded among them as a calamity to which they are in danger of being driven, in order to avoid a greater.—The jealouſy I have mentioned was, however, natural; and betrayed a ſecret opinion, that the ſubjection in which they were held was more than we could expect them always to endure. In ſuch circumſtances, all poſſible care ſhould have been taken to give them no reaſon for diſcontent; and to preſerve them in ſubjection, by keeping in that line of conduct to which cuſtom had reconciled them, or at leaſt never deviating from it, except with great caution; and particularly, by avoiding all direct attacks on their property and legiſlations. Had we done this, the different intereſts of ſo many ſtates ſcattered over a vaſt continent, joined to our own prudence and moderation, would have enabled us to maintain them in dependence for ages to come.—But inſtead of this, how have we acted?—It is in truth too evident, that our whole conduct, inſtead of being directed by that ſound policy and foreſight which in ſuch circumſtances were abſolutely neceſſary, has been nothing (to ſay the beſt of it) but a ſeries of the blindeſt rigour followed by retractation; of violence followed by conceſſion; of miſtake, weakneſs and inconſiſtency.—A recital of a few facts, within every body's recollection, will fully prove this.</p>
               <p>In the 6th of <hi>George the Second,</hi> an act was paſſed for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing certain duties on all foreign ſpirits, molaſſes and ſugars imported into the plantations. In this act, the duties impoſed are ſaid to be GIVEN and GRANTED by the Parliament to the King; and this is the firſt <hi>American</hi> act in which theſe words have been uſed. But notwithſtanding this, as the act had the appearance of being only a regulation of trade, the colonies ſubmitted to it; and a ſmall direct revenue was drawn by it from them.—In the 4th of the preſent reign, many alterations were made in this act, with the declared purpoſe of making proviſion for raiſing a revenue in America. This alarmed the Colonies; and produced diſcontents and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015032_0036_0F9550887817E4D0"/>
which might have convinced our rulers that this was tender ground, on which it became them to tread very gently. —There is, however, no reaſon to doubt but in time they would have ſunk into a quiet ſubmiſſion to this revenue act, as being at worſt only the exerciſe of a power which then they ſeem not to have thought much of conteſting; I mean, the power of taxing them EXTERNALLY.—But before they had time to cool, a worſe provocation was given them; and the STAMP ACT was paſſed. This being an attempt to tax them INTERNALLY; and a direct artack on their property, by a power which would not ſuffer itſelf to be queſtioned; which eaſed <hi>itſelf</hi> by loading <hi>them</hi>; and to which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to fix any bounds; they were thrown at once, from one end of the continent to the other, into reſiſtance and rage. —Government, dreading the conſequences, gave way; and the Parliament (upon a change of miniſtry) repealed the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> without requiring from them any recognition of its authority, or doing any more to preſerve its dignity, than aſſerting, by the declaratory law, that it was poſſeſſed of full power and authority to make laws to bind them in all caſes whatever.—Upon this, peace was reſtored; and, had no farther attempts of the ſame kind been made, they would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have ſuffered us (as the people of <hi>Ireland</hi> have done) to enjoy our declaratory law. They would have recovered their former habits of ſubjection; and our connexion with them might have continued an increaſing ſource of our wealth and glory.—But the ſpirit of deſpotiſm and avarice always blind and reſtleſs, ſoon broke forth again. The ſcheme for drawing a revenue from <hi>America,</hi> by parliamentary taxation, was reſumed; and in a little more than a year after the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> when all was peace, a third act was paſſed, impoſing duties payable in <hi>America</hi> on tea, paper, glaſs, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters colours, &amp;c.—This, as might have been expected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived all the former heats; and the Empire was a ſecond time threatened with the moſt dangerous commotions.—Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment receded again; and the Parliament (under another change of miniſtry) repealed all the obnoxious duties, EXCEPT that upon tea. This exception was made in order to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſhew of dignity. But it was, in reality, ſacrificing ſafety to pride; and leaving a ſplinter in the wound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a gangrene.—For ſome time, however, this relaxation anſwered its intended purpoſes. Our commercial intercourſe
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015032_0037_0F955089387A38B0"/>
with the Colonies was again recovered; and they avoided nothing but that tea which we had excepted in our repeal. In this ſtate would things have remained, and even tea would perhaps in time have been gradually admitted, had not the evil genius of <hi>Britain</hi> ſtepped forth once more to embroil the Empire.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt India</hi> company having fallen under difficulties, partly in conſequence of the loſs of the <hi>American</hi> market for tea, a ſcheme was formed for aſſiſting them by an attempt to recover that market. With this view an act was paſſed to enable them to export their tea to <hi>America</hi> free of all duties here, and ſubject only to 3d. per pound duty, payable in <hi>America.</hi> By this expedient they were enabled to offer it at a low price; and it was expected the conſequence would prove that the Colonies would be tempted by it; a precedent gained for taxing them, and at the ſame time the company relieved. Ships were, therefore, fitted out; and large cargoes ſent. The ſnare was too groſs to eſcape the notice of the Colonies. They ſaw it, and ſpurned at it. They refuſed to admit the tea; and at BOSTON ſome perſons in diſguiſe buried it in the ſea.—Had our governors in this caſe ſatisfied themſelves with requiring a compenſation from the province for the damage done, there is no doubt but it would have been granted. Or had they proceeded no farther in the infliction of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than ſtopping up the port and deſtroying the trade of Boſton, till compenſation was made, the province might poſſibly have ſubmitted, and a ſufficient ſaving would have been gained for the honour of the nation. But having hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto proceeded without wiſdom, they obſerved now no bounds in their reſentment. To the Boſton port bill was added a bill which deſtroyed the chartered government of the province; a bill which withdrew from the juriſdiction of the province, perſons who in particular caſes ſhould commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and the <hi>Quebec</hi> bill. At the ſame time a ſtrong body of troops was ſtationed as <hi>Boſton</hi> to enforce obedience to theſe bills.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Appendix.</note> All who knew any thing of the temper of the Colonies ſaw that the effect of all ſudden accumulation of vengeance, would probably be not intimidating but exaſperating them, and driving them into a general revolt. But our miniſters had different apprehenſions. They believed that the male contents in the Colony of <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi>'s were a ſmall party, headed by
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015032_0038_0F955089F4FD79B8"/>
a few factious men; that the majority of the people would take the ſide of government, as ſoon as they ſaw a force among them capable of ſupporting them; that, at worſt, the Colonies in general would never make a common cauſe with the province; and that, the iſſue would prove, in a few months, order, tranquility, and ſubmiſſion.—Every one of theſe apprehenſions was falſified by the event that followed.</p>
               <p>When the bills I have mentioned came to be carried into execution, the whole Province was thrown into confuſion. Their courts of juſtice were ſhut up, and all government was diſſolved. The commander in chief found it neceſſary to fortify himſelf in BOSTON; and the other Colonies imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſolved to make a common cauſe with this Colony.</p>
               <p>So ſtrangely miſinformed were our miniſters, that this was all a ſurpriſe upon them. They took fright, therefore; and once more made an effort to retreat; but indeed the moſt ungracious one that can be well imagined. A propoſal was ſent to the Colonies, called Conciliatory; and the ſubſtance of which was, that if any of them would raiſe ſuch ſums as ſhould be demanded of them by taxing themſelves, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament would forbear to tax them.—It will be ſcarcely believed, hereafter, that ſuch a propoſal could be thought conciliatory. It was only telling them;
<q>if you will tax yourſelves BY OUR ORDER, we will ſave ourſelves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of taxing you.</q>—They received the propoſal as an inſult; and rejected it with diſdain.</p>
               <p>At the time this conceſſion was tranſmitted to <hi>America,</hi> open hoſtilities were not begun. In the ſword our miniſters thought they had ſtill a reſource which would immediately ſettle all diſputes. They conſidered the people of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as nothing but a mob, who would be ſoon routed and forced into obedience. It was even believed, that a few thouſands of our army might march through all <hi>America,</hi> and make all quiet wherever they went. Under this conviction our miniſters did not dread urging the Province of <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett's-Bay</hi> into rebellion, by ordering their army to ſeize their ſtores, and to take up ſome of their leading men.—The attempt was made.—The people fled immediately to arms, and repelled the attack.—A conſiderable part of the flower of the Britiſh army has been deſtroyed.—Some of our beſt Generals, and the braveſt of our troops, are now diſgracefully and miſerably impriſoned in <hi>Boſton.</hi>—A horrid civil war is commenced:—And the empire is diſtracted and convulſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:015032_0039_0F95508AB87C4420"/>Can it be poſſible to think with patience of the policy that has brought us into theſe circumſtances? Did ever Heaven puniſh the vices of a people more ſeverely by darkening their counſels? How great would be our happineſs could we now recal former times, and return to the policy of the laſt reigns? —But thoſe times are gone.—I will, however, beg leave for a few moments to look back to them; and to compare the ground we have left with that on which we find ourſelves. This muſt be done with deep regret; but it forms a neceſſary part of my preſent deſign.</p>
               <p>In thoſe times our Colonies, foregoing every advantage which they might derive from trading with foreign nations, conſented to ſend only to us whatever it was for our intereſt to receive from them; and to receive only from us whatever it was for our intereſt to ſend to them. They gave up the power of making ſumptuary laws, and expoſed themſelves to all the evils of an increaſing and waſteful luxury, becauſe we were benefited by vending among them the materials of it. The iron with which providence had bleſſed their country, they were required by laws, in which they acquieſced, to tranſport hither, that our people might be maintained by working it for them into nails, ploughs, axes, &amp;c. And, in ſeveral inſtances, even one Colony was not allowed to ſupply any neighbouring Colonies with commodities, which could be conveyed to them from hence.—But they yielded much farther. They conſented that we ſhould have the appointment of one branch of their legiſlature. By recognizing as their King, a King reſident among us and under our influence, they gave us a negative on all their laws. By allowing an appeal to us in their civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, they gave us likewiſe the ultimate determination of all civil cauſes among them.—In ſhort. They allowed us every power we could deſire, except that of taxing them, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in their internal legiſlations: And they had admitted precedents which, even in theſe inſtances, gave us no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable authority over them. By purchaſing our goods they paid our taxes; and, by allowing us to regulate their trade in any manner we thought moſt for our advantage, they enriched our merchants, and helped us to bear our growing burdens. They fought our battles with us. They gloried in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us. All their gains centered among us; and they always ſpoke of this country and looked to it as their home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:015032_0040_0F95508B76889240"/>Such was the ſtate of things.—What is it now?</p>
               <p>Not contented with a degree of power, ſufficient to ſatisfy any reaſonable ambition, we have attempted to extend it.— Not contented with drawing from them a large revenue <hi>indirectly,</hi> we have endeavoured to procure one <hi>directly</hi> by an authoritative ſeizure; and, in order to gain a pepper-corn in this way, have choſen to hazard millions, acquired by the peaceable intercourſe of trade.—Vile policy! What a ſcourge is government ſo conducted?—Had we never deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our old ground: Had we nouriſhed and favoured <hi>America,</hi> with a view to commerce, inſtead of conſidering it as a country to be governed: Had we, like a liberal and wiſe people, rejoiced to ſee a multitude of free ſtates branched forth from ourſelves, all enjoying independent legiſlatures ſimilar to our own: Had we aimed at binding them to us only by the tyes of affection and intereſt; and contented ourſelves with a moderate power rendered durable by being lenient and friendly, an umpire in their differences, an aid to them in improving their own free governments, and their common bulwark againſt the aſſaults of foreign enemies: Had this, I ſay, been our policy and temper; there is nothing ſo great or happy that we might not have expected. With their increaſe our ſtrength would have increaſed. A growing ſurplus in the revenue might have been gained, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> invariably applied to the gradual diſcharge of the national debt, would have delivered us from the ruin with which it threatens us. The Liberty of <hi>America</hi> might have preſerved our Liberty; and, under the direction of a patriot king or wiſe miniſter, proved the means of reſtoring to us our almoſt loſt conſtitution. Perhaps, in time, we might alſo have been brought to ſee the neceſſity of carefully watching and reſtricting our paper-credit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus we might have regained ſafety; and, in union with our Colonies, have been more than a match for every enemy, and riſen to a ſituation of honour and dignity never before known amongſt mankind.—But I am forgetting myſelf.— Our Colonies are likely to be loſt for ever. Their love is turned into hatred; and their reſpect for our government into reſentment and abhorrence.—We ſhall ſee more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly what a calamity this is, and the obſervations I have now made will be confirmed, by attending to the following facts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:015032_0041_0F95508D9935A0E8"/>Our American Colonies, particularly the Northern ones, have been for ſome time in the very happieſt ſtate of ſociety; or, in that middle ſtate of civilization, between its firſt rude and its laſt refined and corrupt ſtate. Old countries conſiſt, generally, of three claſſes of people; a GENTRY; a YEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANRY; and a PEASANTRY. The Colonies conſiſt only of a body of YEOMANRY <note n="*" place="bottom">Excepting the <hi>Negroes</hi> in the Southern Colonies, who probably will now either ſoon become extinct, or have their condition changed into that of <hi>Freemen.</hi>— It is not the fault of the Colonies that they have among them ſo many of theſe unhappy people. They have made laws to prohibit the importation of them; but theſe laws have always had a negative put upon them here, becauſe of their tendency to hurt our Negro trade.</note> ſupported by agriculture, and all independent, and nearly upon a level; in conſequence of which, joined to a boundleſs extent of country, the means of ſubſiſtence are procured without difficulty, and the temptations to wickedneſs are ſo inconſiderable, that executions <note n="†" place="bottom">In the Province of Maſſachuſett's Bay there has not been, I am informed, more than one execution theſe 18 years.</note> are ſeldom known among them. From hence ariſes an encouragement to population ſo great, that in ſome of the Colonies they double their own number in fifteen years; in others, in eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years; and in all, taken one with another, in twenty-five years.—Such an increaſe was, I believe, never before known. It demonſtrates that they muſt live at their eaſe; and be free from thoſe cares, oppreſſions, and diſeaſes which depopulate and ravage luxurious ſtates.</p>
               <p>With the population of the Colonies has increaſed their trade; but much faſter on account of the gradual introduction of luxury among them.—In 1723 the exports to <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> were 16,000 l.—In 1742 they were 75,295 l.—In 1757 they were increaſed to 268,426 l. and in 1773 to half a million.</p>
               <p>The exports to all the Colonies in 1744 were 640,114 l.— In 1758, they were increaſed to 1,832,948 l. and in 1773, to three millions. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. Burke (in his excellent and admirable Speech on moving his reſolutions for conciliation with the Colonies. P. 9. &amp;c.) has ſhewn, that our trade to the Colonies, including that to <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> was in 1772 nearly equal to the trade which we carried on with the whole world at the beginning of this Century.</note> And the probability is, that, had it not been for the diſcontents among the Colonies ſince the year 1764, our trade with them would have been this year double to what it was in 1773; and that in a few years more, it would not have been poſſible for the whole kingdom, though conſiſting only of manufacturers, to ſupply the American demand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:015032_0042_0F95508DBA7FCCB0"/>This trade, it ſhould be conſidered, was not only thus an increaſing trade; but it was a trade in which we had no rivals; a trade certain, conſtant, and uninterrupted; and which, by the ſhipping employed in it, and the naval ſtores ſupplied by it, contributed greatly to the ſupport of that navy which is our chief national ſtrength.— Viewed in theſe lights it was an object unſpeakably important. But it will appear ſtill more ſo if we view it in its connexions and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies. It is well known, that our trade with <hi>Africa</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> cannot eaſily ſubſiſt without it. And, upon the whole, it is undeniable, that it has been one of the main ſprings of our opulence and ſplendour; and that we have, in a great meaſure, been indebted to it for our ability to bear a debt ſo much heavier, than that which, fifty years ago, the wiſeſt men thought would ſink us.</p>
               <p>This ineſtimable prize, and all the advantages connected with <hi>America,</hi> we are now throwing away. Experience alone can ſhew what calamities muſt follow. It will indeed be aſtoniſhing if this kingdom can bear ſuch a loſs without dreadful conſequences.—Theſe conſequences have been amply repreſented by others; and it is needleſs to enter into any account of them—At the time we ſhall be feeling them —The Empire diſmembered; the blood of thouſands ſhed in an unrighteous quarrel; our ſtrength exhauſted; our merchants breaking; our manufacturers ſtarving; our debts increaſing; the revenue ſinking; the funds tottering; and all the miſeries of a public bankruptcy impending—At ſuch a <hi>criſis</hi> ſhould our natural enemies, eager for our ruin, ſeize the opportunity—The apprehenſion is too diſtreſſing.—Let us view this ſubject in another light.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion, particular attention ſhould be given to the preſent SINGULAR ſituation of this kingdom. This is a circumſtance of the utmoſt importance; and as I am afraid it is not much conſidered, I will beg leave to give a diſtinct account of it.</p>
               <p>At the REVOLUTION, the <hi>ſpecie</hi> of the kingdom amounted according to <note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Davenant's works, collected and reviſed by Sir Charles Whitworth, Vol. 1. Page 363, &amp;c. 443. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Davenant</hi>'s account, to eighteen millions and a half.—From the ACCESSION to the year 1772, there were coined at the mint, near 29 millions of gold; and in ten years only of this time, or from January 1759 to January
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015032_0043_0F95508E75E604F8"/>
1769, there were coined eight millions and a half. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Conſiderations on Money, Bullion, &amp;c. Page 2 and 11.</note> But it has appeared lately, that the gold ſpecie now left in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is no more than about twelve millions and a half.— Not ſo much as half a million of <hi>Silver ſpecie</hi> has been coined theſe ſixty years; and it cannot be ſuppoſed, that the quantity of it now in circulation exceeds two or three millions. The whole ſpecie of the kingdom, therefore, is probably at this time about <note n="†" place="bottom">Or nearly the ſame that it was in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s time. See Dr. Davenant's works, Vol. 1. Page 365.</note> fourteen or fifteen millions. Of this ſeveral millions muſt be hoarded at the <hi>Bank.</hi>—Our circulating <hi>ſpecie,</hi> therefore, appears to be greatly decreaſed. But our wealth, or the quantity of money in the kingdom, is greatly increaſed. This is paper to a vaſt amount, iſſued in almoſt every corner of the kingdom; and, particularly, by the BANK of ENGLAND. While this paper maintains its credit it anſwers all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of ſpecie, and is in all reſpects the ſame with money.</p>
               <p>Specie repreſents ſome real value in goods or commodities. On the contrary; paper repreſents immediately nothing but ſpecie. It is a promiſe or obligation, which the emitter brings himſelf under to pay a given ſum in coin; and it owes its cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to the credit of the emitter; or to an opinion that he is able to make good his engagement; and that the ſum ſpecified may be received upon being demanded.—Paper, therefore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents coin; and coin repreſents real value. That is, the one is a <hi>ſign</hi> of wealth. The other is the <hi>ſign</hi> of that <hi>ſign.</hi>—But farther. Coin is an <hi>univerſal</hi> ſign of wealth, and will procure it every where. It will bear any alarm, and ſtand any ſhock.—On the contrary. Paper, owing its currency to opinion, has only a local and imaginary value. It can ſtand no ſhock. It is deſtroyed by the approach of danger; or even the <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of danger.</p>
               <p>In ſhort. Coin is the baſis of our paper-credit; and were it either all deſtroyed, or were only the quantity of it reduced beyond a certain limit, the paper circulation of the kingdom would ſink at once. But, were our paper deſtroyed, the coin would not only remain, but riſe in value, in proportion to the quantity of paper deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>From this account it follows, that as far as, in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſpecie is not to be procured in exchange for paper, it repreſents <hi>nothing,</hi> and is worth <hi>nothing.</hi>—The ſpecie of this kingdom is inconſiderable, compared with the amount of the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015032_0044_0F95508F35677E58"/>
paper circulating in it. This is generally believed; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is natural to enquire how its currency is ſupported.— The anſwer is eaſy. It is ſupported in the ſame manner with all other bubbles. Were all to demand ſpecie in exchange for their notes, payment could not be made; but, at the ſame time that this is known, every one truſts, that no alarm producing ſuch a demand will happen, while he holds the paper he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of; and that if it ſhould happen, he will ſtand a chance for being firſt paid; and this makes him eaſy. And it alſo makes all with whom he traffics eaſy.—But let any events happen which threaten danger; and every one will become diffident. A run will take place, and a bankruptcy follow.</p>
               <p>This is an account of what <hi>has</hi> often happened in <hi>private</hi> credit. And it is alſo an account of what <hi>will</hi> (if no change of meaſures takes place) happen ſome time or other in <hi>public</hi> credit. The deſcription I have given of our paper-circulation implies, that nothing can be more delicate or hazardous. It is an immenſe fabrick, with its head in the clouds, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually trembling with every adverſe blaſt and every fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trade; and which, like the baſeleſs fabrick of a viſion, may in a moment vaniſh, and leave no wreck behind.—The deſtruction of a few books at the <hi>Bank</hi>; an improvement in the art of forgery; the landing of a body of <hi>French</hi> troops on our coaſts; inſurrections threatning a revolution in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or any events that ſhould produce a general panic, however groundleſs, would at once annihilate it, and leave us without any other medium of traffic, than a quantity of <hi>ſpecie</hi> ſcarcely equal in amount to the money now drawn from the public by the taxes. It would, therefore, become impoſſible to pay the taxes. The revenue would fail. Near one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty millions of property would be deſtroyed. The whole frame of government would fall to pieces; and a ſtate of nature would take place.—What a dreadful ſituation? It has never had a parallel among mankind; except at one time in <hi>France</hi> after the eſtabliſhment of the Royal <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi> Bank. In 1720 this Bank broke; <note n="*" place="bottom">See Sir James Steuart's Enquiry into the Principles of political Oeconomy, Vol. II. Book 4. Chap. 32.</note> and, after involving for ſome time the whole kingdom in a golden dream, ſpread through it in one day, deſolation and ruin.—The diſtreſs attending ſuch an event, in this free country, would be greater than it was in <hi>France.</hi> Happily for that kingdom, they have ſhot this gulph. Paper-credit has never ſince recovered itſelf there; and their
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015032_0045_0F95508FF7DF7B68"/>
circulating caſh conſiſts now all of ſolid coin, amounting, I am informed, to no leſs a ſum than fifteen hundred millions of <hi>Livres</hi>; or near ſixty ſeven millions of pounds ſterling.— This gives them unſpeakable advantages; and, joined to that quick reduction of their debts which is inſeparable <note n="*" place="bottom">Their debts conſiſt chiefly of money raiſed by annuities on lives, ſhort annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, anticipations of taxes for ſhort terms, &amp;c. During the whole laſt war they added to their <hi>perpetual</hi> annuities only 12 millions ſterling, according to Sir James Steuart's account; whereas we added to theſe annuities near 60 millions. In conſequence therefore of the nature of their debts, as well as of the management they are now uſing for haſtening the reduction of them, they muſt in a few years, if peace continues, be freed from moſt of their incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances; while we probably (if no event comes ſoon that will unburthen us at once) ſhall continue with them all upon us.</note> from their nature, places them on a ground of ſafety which we have reaſon to admire and envy.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſubjects on which I ſhould have choſen to be ſilent, did I not think it neceſſary, that this country ſhould be apprized and warned of the danger which threatens it. This danger is created chiefly by the national debt. High taxes are neceſſary to ſupport a great public debt; and a large ſupply of caſh is neceſſary to ſupport high taxes. This caſh we owe to our paper; and, in proportion to our paper, muſt be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiveneſs of our taxes.—King William's wars drained the kingdom of its ſpecie. This ſunk the revenue, and diſtreſſed government. In 1694 the BANK was eſtabliſhed; and the kingdom was provided with a ſubſtitute for ſpecie. The taxes became again productive. The revenue roſe; and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was relieved.—Ever ſince that period our paper and taxes have been increaſing together, and ſupporting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and one reaſon, undoubtedly, of the late increaſe in the productiveneſs of our taxes has been the increaſe of our paper.</p>
               <p>Was there no public debt, there would be no occaſion for half the preſent taxes. Our paper-circulation might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The balance of trade would turn in our favour. Specie would flow in upon us. The quantity of property deſtroyed by a failure of paper-credit (ſhould it in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances happen) would be 140 millions leſs; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſhock attending it would be <hi>tolerable.</hi> But, in the preſent ſtate of things, whenever any calamity or panic ſhall produce ſuch a failure, the ſhock attending it will be <hi>intolerable.</hi> —May heaven ſoon raiſe up for us ſome great ſtateſman who ſhall ſee theſe things; and enter into effectual meaſures, if not now too late, for extricating and preſerving us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:015032_0046_0F955090B6657DC8"/>Public banks are, undoubtedly, attended with great conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies. But they alſo do great harm; and if their emiſſions are not reſtrained, and conducted with great wiſdom, they may prove the moſt pernicious of all inſtitutions; not only, by ſubſtituting <hi>fictitious</hi> for <hi>real</hi> wealth; by increaſing luxury; by raiſing the prices of proviſions; by concealing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable balance of trade; and by rendering a kingdom incapable of bearing any <hi>internal</hi> tumults or <hi>external</hi> attacks, without the danger of a dreadful convulſion: But, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, by becoming inſtruments in the hands of miniſters of ſtate to increaſe their influence, to leſſen their dependence on the people, and to keep up a deluſive ſhew of public proſperity, when perhaps, ruin may be near. There is, in truth, nothing that a government may not do with ſuch a mine at its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as a public Bank, while it can maintain its credit; nor, therefore, is there any thing more likely to be IMPROPERLY and DANGEROUSLY uſed.—But to return to what may be more applicable to our ſtate at preſent.</p>
               <p>Among the cauſes that may produce a failure of paper-credit, there are two which the preſent quarrel with <hi>America</hi> calls upon us particularly to conſider.—The firſt is,
<q>An unfavorable balance of trade.</q>
This, in proportion to the degree in which it takes place, muſt turn the courſe of foreign exchange againſt us; raiſe the price of bullion; and carry off our ſpecie. The danger to which this would expoſe us is obvious; and it has been much increaſed by the new coinage of the gold ſpecie which begun in 1772. Before this coinage, the greateſt part of our gold coin being light, but the ſame in currency, as if it had been heavy, always remained in the kingdom. But, being now full weight, whenever a wrong balance of foreign trade alters the courſe of exchange, and gold in <hi>coin</hi> becomes of leſs value than in <hi>bullion,</hi> there is reaſon to fear, that it will be melted down in ſuch great quantities, and exported ſo faſt, as in a little time to leave none behind; <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi> in the diſpute between him and Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> contended for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the ſtandard ſilver. One of his reaſons was, that it would render the ſilver-coin more commenſurate to the wants of the nation; and CHECK HAZARDOUS PAPER-CREDIT. —Mr. CONDUIT<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir ISAAC NEWTON's ſucceſſor in the mint, has propoſed, in direct contradiction to the laws now in being, that all the bullion imported into the kingdom ſhould be carried into the mint to be coined; and only coin allowed to be exported. "The height," he ſays,
<q>of paper-credit is the ſtrongeſt argument for trying this and <hi>every other</hi> method that is likely to increaſe the coinage. For whilſt Paper-credit does in a great meaſure the buſineſs of money at home, Merchants and Bankers are not under a neceſſity, as they were formerly, of coining a quantity of ſpecie for their home trade; and as Paper-credit brings money to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to be exported, the money may go away inſenſibly, and NOT BE MISSED TILL IT BE TOO LATE: And where Paper-credit is large and increaſing, if the money be exported and the coinage decreaſe, THAT CREDIT MAY SINK AT ONCE; for want of a proportionable quantity of <hi>Specie,</hi> which alone can ſupport it in a time of diſtreſs.</q>

which muſt prove, that the whole ſuperſtructure of paper-credit, now ſupported by it, will break down.—The only remedy, in ſuch circumſtances, is an increaſe of coinage at the mint. But this will operate too ſlowly; and by raiſing the price of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, will only increaſe the evil.—It is the <hi>Bank</hi> that at ſuch a time muſt be the immediate ſufferer: For it is from thence that thoſe who want coin for any purpoſe will always draw it.</p>
               <p>For many years before 1772, the price of gold in <hi>bullion</hi> had been, from 2 to 3 or 4 per cent, higher than in <hi>coin.</hi> This was a temptation to melt down and export the coin, which could not be reſiſted. Hence aroſe a demand for it on the BANK; and, conſequently, the neceſſity of purchaſing bullion at a loſs for a new coinage. But the more coin the Bank procured in this way, the lower its price became in compariſon with that of bullion, and the faſter it vanished; and, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the more neceſſary it became to coin again, and the greater loſs fell upon the Bank.—Had things continued much longer in this train, the conſequences might have proved very ſerious. I am by no means ſufficiently informed to be able to aſſign the cauſes which produced the change that happened in 1772. But, without doubt, the ſtate of things that took place before that year muſt be expected to return. The fluctuations of trade, in its beſt ſtate, render this unavoidable. But the conteſt with our Colonies has a tendency to bring it on ſoon; and to increaſe unſpeakably the diſtreſs attending it.</p>
               <p>All know that the balance of trade with them is greatly in our favour; <note n="†" place="bottom">According to the accounts of the exports to, and imports from the North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Colonies, laid before Parliament; the balance in our favour appears to have been, for 11 years before 1774, near <hi>a million and a half</hi> annually.</note> and that this balance is paid partly by direct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittances of bullion; and partly by circuitous remittances through <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. which diminiſh the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance againſt us with theſe countries.—During the laſt year they have been employed in paying their debts, without adding to them; and their exportations and remittances for that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:015032_0048_0F95509237B1EB58"/>
purpoſe have contributed to render the general balance of trade more favourable to us, and, alſo, (in conjunction with the late operations of the Bank) to keep up our funds. Theſe remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances are now ceaſed; and a year of two will determine, if this conteſt goes on, how far we can ſuſtain ſuch a loſs without ſuffering the conſequences I have deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond event, ruinous to our paper-circulation, which may ariſe from our rupture with <hi>America,</hi> is a deficiency in the revenue. As a failure of our paper would deſtroy the revenue, ſo a failure of the revenue, or any conſiderable diminution of it, would deſtroy our paper. The BANK is the ſupport of our paper; and the ſupport of the BANK is the credit of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Its principal ſecurities, are a capital of near eleven millions lent to government; and money continually advanced to a vaſt amount on the Land-tax, Sinking-fund, Exchequer-bills, Navy-bills, &amp;c. Should, therefore, deficiencies in the revenue bring government under any difficulties, all theſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities would loſe their value, and the <hi>Bank</hi> and Government, and all private and public credit, would fall together.— Let any one here imagine, what would probably follow, were it but ſuſpected by the public in general, that the taxes were ſo fallen, as not to produce enough to pay the intereſt of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debts, beſides bearing the <hi>ordinary</hi> expences of the nation; and that, in order to ſupply the deficiency and to hide the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, it had been neceſſary in any one year to anticipate the taxes, and to borrow of the Bank.—In ſuch circumſtances I can ſcarcely doubt, but an alarm would ſpread of the moſt dangerous tendency.—The next foreign war, ſhould it prove <hi>half</hi> as expenſive as the laſt, will probably occaſion ſuch a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; and bring our affairs to that criſis towards which they have been long tending.—But the war with <hi>America</hi> has a greater tendency to do this; and the reaſon is, that it affects our reſources more; and is attended more with the danger of internal diſturbances.</p>
               <p>Some have made the proportion of our trade depending on <hi>North-America</hi> to be near ONE HALF. A moderate compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation makes it a THIRD. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the ſubſtance of the evidence on the petition preſented by the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Planters and Merchants to the Houſe of Commons, as it was introduced to the BAR, and ſummed up by Mr. GLOVER.</note> Let it, however be ſuppoſed to be only a FOURTH. I will venture to ſay, this is a proportion of our foreign trade, the loſs of which, when it comes to be felt, will be found inſupportable.—In the article of <hi>Tobacco</hi>

                     <p>The annual average of the payments into the Exchequer, on account of the duties on tobacco, was for five years, from 1770 to 1774, 219, 117 l. excluſive of the payments from <hi>Scotland.</hi>—Near one half of the <hi>tobacco</hi> trade is carried on from <hi>Scotland</hi>; and above <hi>four fifths</hi> of the tobacco imported is afterwards exported to <hi>France Germany</hi> and other countries.

But to this muſt be added a deduction from the produce of the <hi>Exciſes,</hi> in conſequence of the increaſe of the poor, of the difficulties of our merchants and manufacturers, of leſs national wealth, and a retrenchment of luxury. There is no poſſibility of knowing to what theſe deductions may amount. When the evils producing them begin, they will proceed rapidly; and they may end in a general wreck before we are aware of any danger.</p>
               <p>In order to give a clearer view of this ſubject, I will in an Appendix, ſtate particularly the national expenditure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for ten years, from 1764 to 1774. From that account it will appear, that the money drawn every year from the public by the taxes, falls but little ſhort of a ſum equal to the whole <hi>ſpecie</hi> of the kingdom; and that, notwithſtanding the late increaſe in the productiveneſs of the taxes, the whole ſurplus of the national income has not exceeded 320,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> This is a ſurplus ſo inconſiderable as to be ſcarcely ſufficient to guard againſt the deficiencies ariſing from the common fluctuations of foreign trade, and of home conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is NOTHING when conſidered as the only fund we have for paying off a debt of near 140 millions.—Had we continued in a ſtate of profound peace, it could not have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of any diminution. What then muſt follow, when one of the moſt profitable branches of our trade is deſtroyed; When a THIRD of the Empire is loſt; when an addition of many millions is made to the public debt; and when, at the ſame time, perhaps, ſome millions are taken away from the revenue?—I ſhudder at the proſpect.—A KINGDOM, ON AN EDGE SO PERILOUS, SHOULD THINK OF NOTHING BUT A RETREAT.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV. Of the Honour of the Nation, as affected by the War with <hi>America.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ONE of the pleas for continuing the conteſt with <hi>America</hi> is, <q>That our honor is engaged; and that we cannot recede without the moſt humiliating conceſſions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to this, it is proper to obſerve, that a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made between the nation and its rulers. It is melancholy that there ſhould be ever any reaſon for making ſuch a diſtinction. A government is, or ought to be, nothing but an inſtitution for collecting and for carrying into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the will of the people. But ſo far is this from being in general the fact, that the meaſures of government, and the ſenſe of the people, are ſometimes in direct oppoſition to one another; nor does it <hi>often</hi> happen that any certain concluſion can be drawn from the one to the other.—I will not pretend to determine, whether, in the preſent inſtance, the diſhonour attending a retreat would belong to the nation at large, or only to the perſons in power who guide its affairs. Let it be granted, though, probably far from true, that the majority of the kingdom favour the preſent meaſures. No good argument could be drawn from hence againſt receding. The diſgrace to which a kingdom muſt ſubmit by making conceſſions, is nothing to that of being the aggreſſors in an unrighteous quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; and dignity, in ſuch circumſtances, conſiſts in retracting freely, ſpeedily, and magnanimouſly.—For, (to adopt, on this occaſion, words which I have heard applied to this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in a great aſſembly, by a peer to whom this kingdom has often looked as its deliverer, and whoſe ill ſtate of health at this awful moment of public danger every friend to <hi>Britain</hi> muſt deplore) to adopt, I ſay, the words of this great man—
<q>RECTITUDE IS DIGNITY. OPPRESSION ONLY IS MEANNESS; AND JUSTICE, HONOUR.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will add, that PRUDENCE, no leſs than HONOUR, requires us to retract. For the time may come when, if it is not done voluntarily, we may be <hi>obliged</hi> to do it; and find ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of granting that to our diſtreſſes, which we now deny to equity and humanity, and the prayers of <hi>America.</hi> The poſſibility of this appears plainly from the preceding pages; and ſhould it happen, it will bring upon us diſgrace indeed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace greater than the worſt rancour can wiſh to ſee accumulated
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:015032_0051_0F95509537E3D4B0"/>
on a kingdom already too much diſhonoured.—Let the reader think here what we are doing.—A nation, once the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Liberty in diſtant countries, and the ſcourge of tyranny, changed into an enemy to Liberty, and engaged in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reduce to ſervitude its own brethren.—A great and enlightened nation, not content with a controuling power over millions of people which gave it every reaſonable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, inſiſting upon ſuch a ſupremacy over them as would leave them nothing they could call their own, and carrying deſolation and death among them for diſputing it.—What can be more ignominious?—How have we felt for the brave <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicans,</hi> in their ſtruggle with the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and afterwards with the <hi>French</hi> government? Did GENOA or FRANCE want more than an abſolute command over their property and legiſlations; or the power of binding them in all caſes whatſoever?— The <hi>Corſicans</hi> had been ſubject to the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>; but finding it difficult to keep them in ſubjection, they CEDED them to the <hi>French.</hi>— All ſuch ceſſions of one people to another are diſgraceful to human nature. But if our claims are juſt, may not we alſo, if we pleaſe, CEDE the Colonies to <hi>France?</hi> —There is, in truth, no other difference between theſe two caſes than that the <hi>Corſicans</hi> were not deſcended from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who governed them, but that the <hi>Americans</hi> are.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who ſeem to be ſenſible, that the authority of one country over another, cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the ſervitude of one country to another; and that unleſs different communities, as well as different parts of the ſame community, are united by an equal repreſentation, all ſuch authority is inconſiſtent with the principles of Civil Liberty. But they except the caſe of the Colonies and <hi>Great Britain</hi>; becauſe the Colonies are communities which branched forth from, and which, therefore, as they think, belong to <hi>Britain.</hi> Had the colonies been communities of <hi>foreigners,</hi> over whom we wanted to acquire dominion, or even to extend a dominion before acquired, they are ready to admit that their reſiſtance would have been juſt.—In my opinion, this is the ſame with ſaying, that the Colonies ought to be worſe off than the reſt of mankind, becauſe they are our own <hi>Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again. The United Provinces of <hi>Holland</hi> were once ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> monarchy; but, provoked by the violation of their charters; by levies of money, without their conſent; by the introduction of Spaniſh troops among them by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:015032_0052_0F9550F864DD8000"/>
in their antient modes of government; and the rejection of their petitions, they were driven to that reſiſtance which we and all the world have ever ſince admired; and which has given birth to one of the greateſt and happieſt Republics that ever exiſted.—Let any one read alſo, the hiſtory of the war which the <hi>Athenians,</hi> from a thirſt of Empire, made on the <hi>Syracuſans</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> a people derived from the ſame origin with them; and let him, if he can, avoid rejoicing in the defeat of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let him, likewiſe, read the account of the ſocial war among the Romans. The allied ſtates of <hi>Italy</hi> had fought the battles of <hi>Rome,</hi> and contributed by their valour and treaſure to its conqueſts and grandeur. They claimed, therefore, the rights of Roman citizens, and a ſhare with them in legiſlation. The Romans, diſdaining to make thoſe their <hi>fellow-citizens,</hi> whom they had always looked upon as their <hi>ſubjects,</hi> would not comply; and a war followed, which ended in the ruin of the Roman Republic. The feelings of every <hi>Briton</hi> in this caſe muſt force him to approve the conduct of the Allies, and to condemn the proud and ungrateful Romans.</p>
               <p>But not only is the preſent conteſt with <hi>America</hi> thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to us, becauſe inconſiſtent with our own feelings in ſimilar caſes; but alſo becauſe condemned our own practice in former times. The Colonies are perſuaded that they are fighting for Liberty. We ſee them ſacrificing to this perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion every private advantage. If miſtaken, and though guilty of irregularities, they ſhould be pardoned by a people whoſe anceſtors have given them ſo many examples of ſimilar conduct. ENGLAND ſhould venerate the attachment to Liberty amidſt all its exceſſes; and, inſtead of indignation or ſcorn, it would be moſt becoming them, in the preſent inſtance, to declare their applauſe, and to ſay to the Colonies—
<q>We excuſe your miſtakes. We admire your ſpirit. It is the Spirit that has more than once ſaved <hi>ourſelves.</hi> We aſpire to no dominion over you. We underſtand the rights of men too well to think of taking from you the ineſtimable privileges of governing yourſelves; and, inſtead of employing our power for any ſuch purpoſe, we offer it to you as a friendly and guardian power, to be a mediator in your quarrels; a protection againſt your enemies; and an aid to you in eſtabliſhing a plan of Liberty that ſhall make you great and happy. In return, we aſk nothing but your gratitude and your commerce.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:015032_0053_0F9550F90D7E0E48"/>This would be a language worthy of a brave and enlightened nation. But alas! it often happens in the <hi>Political World</hi> as it does in <hi>Religion,</hi> that the people who cry out moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently for Liberty to themſelves are the moſt unwilling to grant it to others.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt violent enemies of the Colonies has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced them "all Mr. Locke's diſciples."—Glorious title! —How ſhameful is it to make war againſt them for that reaſon?</p>
               <p>But farther. This war is diſgraceful on account of the perſuation which led to it, and under which it has been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. The general cry was laſt winter, that the people of NEW-ENGLAND were a body of cowards, who would at once be tumbled into ſubmiſſion by a hoſtile look from our troops. In this light were they held up to public deriſion in both Houſes of Parliament; and it was this perſuaſion that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, induced a Nobleman of the firſt weight in the ſtate to recommend, at the paſſing of the <hi>Boſton Port Bill,</hi> coercive meaſures; hinting at the ſame time, that the <hi>appearance</hi> of hoſtilities would be ſufficient, and that all would be ſoon over, SINE CLADE.—Indeed no one can doubt, but that had it been believed ſome time ago, the people of <hi>America</hi> were brave, more care would have been taken not to provoke them.</p>
               <p>Again. The manner in which this war has been hitherto conducted, renders it ſtill more diſgraceful.—Engliſh valour being thought inſufficient to ſubdue the Colonies, the law and religion of <hi>France</hi> were eſtabliſhed in <hi>Canada,</hi> on purpoſe to obtain the power of bringing upon them from thence an army of <hi>French Papiſts.</hi> The wild <hi>Indians</hi> and their own Slaves have been inſtigated to attack them; and attempts have been made to gain the aſſiſtance of a large body of Ruſſians.— With like views, <hi>German</hi> troops have been hired; and the defence of our Forts and Garriſons truſted in their hands.</p>
               <p>Theſe are meaſures which need no comment. The laſt of them, in particular, having been carried into execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of parliament, threatens us with imminent danger; and ſhews that we are in the way to loſe even the <hi>Forms</hi> of the conſtitution—If, indeed, our miniſters can, at any time, without leave, not only ſend away the national troops, but introduce <hi>foreign</hi> troops in their room, we lie entirely at mercy; and we have every thing to dread.</p>

               <head>SECT. V. Of the Probability of Succeeding in the War with America.</head>
               <p>LET us next conſider how far there is a poſſibility of ſucceeding in the preſent war.</p>
               <p>Our own people, being unwilling to enliſt, and the attempts to procure armies of <hi>Ruſſians, Indians,</hi> and <hi>Canadians,</hi> having miſcarried; the utmoſt force we can employ, including fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, does not exceed, if I am rightly informed, 30,000 effective men. Let it, however, be called 40,000. This is the force that is to conquer half a million <hi>at leaſt</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">A quarter of the inhabitants of every country are fighting men.—If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Colonies conſiſt only of two millions of inhabitants, the number of fighting men in them will be half a million.</note> of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined men fighting on their own ground, within ſight of their houſes and families, and for that ſacred bleſſing of Liberty, without which man is a beaſt, and government a curſe. All hiſtory proves, that in ſuch a ſituation, a handful is a match for millions.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> a few ſtates thus circumſtanced, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, for thirty years, the whole force of the Spaniſh monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, when at its zenith; and at laſt humbled its pride, and emancipated themſelves from its tyranny.—The citizens of SYRACUSE alſo, thus circumſtanced, withſtood the whole power of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and almoſt ruined them.—The ſame happened in the conteſt between the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the cantons <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Appendix to Dr. Zubly's Sermon, preached at the opening of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Congreſs of <hi>Georgia.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Switzerland.</hi>—There is in this caſe an infinite difference between attacking and being attacked; between fighting to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> and fighting to <hi>preſerve,</hi> or <hi>acquire</hi> Liberty. —Were we, therefore, capable of employing a <hi>land</hi> force againſt <hi>America</hi> equal to its own, there would be little proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſucceſs. But to think of conquering that whole continent with 30,000 or 40,000 men to be tranſported acroſs the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> and fed from hence, and incapable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited after any defeat—This is indeed a folly ſo great, that language does not afford a name for it.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to our naval force, could it ſail at land as it does at ſea, much might be done with it; but as that is
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:015032_0055_0F9550FA918317E0"/>
impoſſible, <hi>little</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> can be done with it, which will not hurt <hi>ourſelves</hi> more than the <hi>Coloniſts.</hi>—Such of their mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time towns as they cannot guard againſt our fleets, and have not been already deſtroyed, they are determined either to give up to our reſentment, or <note n="*" place="bottom">NEW-YORK has been long deſerted by the greateſt part of the inhabitants; and they are determined to burn it themſelves, rather than ſuffer us to burn it.</note> deſtroy themſelves: The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which will be, that theſe towns will be rebuilt in ſafer ſituations; and that we ſhall loſe ſome of the principal pledges by which we have hitherto held them in ſubjection.— As to their trade; having all the neceſſaries and the chief conveniencies of life within themſelves, they have no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon it; and the loſs of it will do them unſpeakable good, by preſerving them from the evils of luxury and the temptations of wealth; and keeping them in that ſtate of virtuous ſimplicity which is the greateſt happineſs. I know that I am now ſpeaking the ſenſe of ſome of the wiſeſt men in America. It has been long their wiſh that <hi>Britain</hi> would ſhut up all their ports. They will rejoice, particularly, in the laſt reſtraining act. It might have happened, that the people would have grown weary of their agreements not to export or import. But this act will oblige them to keep theſe agreements; and confirm their unanimity and zeal. It will alſo furniſh them with a reaſon for confiſcating the eſtates of all the friends of our government among them, and for employing their ſailors, who would have been otherwiſe idle, in making repriſals on Britiſh property. Their ſhips, before uſeleſs, and conſiſting of many hundreds, will be turned into ſhips of war; and all that attention, which they have hitherto confined to trade, will be employed in fitting out a naval force for their own defence; and thus the way will be prepared for their becoming, much ſooner than they would otherwiſe have been, a great maritime power. This act of parliament, therefore, crowns the folly of all our late meaſures.—None who know me, can believe me to be diſpoſed to ſuperſtition. Perhaps, however, I am not in the preſent inſtance, free from this weakneſs. —I fancy I ſee in theſe meaſures ſomething that cannot be accounted for merely by human ignorance. I am inclined to think, that the hand of Providence is in them working to bring about ſome great ends.—But this leads me to one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration more, which I cannot help offering to the public, and which appears to me in the higheſt degree important.</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:015032_0056_0F9550FB5509FC80"/>In this hour of tremendous danger, it would become us to turn our thoughts to Heaven. This is what our brethren in the Colonies are doing. From one end of <hi>North America</hi> to the other, they are FASTING and PRAYING. But what are we doing?—Shocking thought! we are ridiculing them as <hi>Fanatics,</hi> and ſcoffing at religion.—We are running wild after pleaſure, and forgetting every thing ſerious and decent at <hi>Maſquerades.</hi>—We are gambling in gaming-houſes; traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficking for Boroughs; perjuring ourſelves at Elections; and ſelling ourſelves for places.—Which ſide then is Providence likely to favour?</p>
               <p>In <hi>America</hi> we ſee a number of riſing ſtates in the vigour of youth, inſpired by the nobleſt of all paſſions, the paſſion for being; free; and animated by piety.—<hi>Here</hi> we ſee an old ſtate, great indeed, but inflated and irreligious; enervated by luxury; encumbered with debts; and hanging by a thread. —Can any one look without pain to the iſſue? May we not expect calamities that ſhall recover to <hi>reflection</hi> (perhaps to <hi>devotion</hi>) our <hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is our cauſe ſuch as gives us reaſon to aſk God to bleſs it? —Can we in the face of Heaven declare,
<q>that we are not the aggreſſors in this war; and that we mean by it, not to acquire or even preſerve dominion for its own ſake; not conqueſt, or Empire, or the gratification of reſentment; but ſolely to deliver ourſelves from oppreſſion; to gain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for injury; and to defend ourſelves againſt men who would plunder or kill us?</q>—Remember, reader, whoever thou art, that there are no other juſt cauſes of war; and that blood ſpilled, with any other views, muſt ſome time or other be accounted for.—But not to expoſe myſelf by ſaying more in this way, I will now beg leave to recapitulate ſome of the arguments I have uſed; and to deliver the feelings of my heart in a brief, but earneſt addreſs to my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>I am hearing it continually urged—
<q>Are they not our ſubjects.</q>—The plain anſwer is, they are not your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The people of <hi>America</hi> are no more the ſubjects of the people of <hi>Britain</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the people of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> are the ſubjects of tne people of <hi>Middleſex.</hi> They are your <hi>Fellow-ſubjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"But <hi>we</hi> are taxed; and why ſhould not <hi>they</hi> be taxed?" —<hi>You</hi> are taxed by yourſelves. They inſiſt on the ſame pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege. —They are taxed to ſupport their own governments;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:015032_0057_0F9550FC0C0FDC30"/>
and they help alſo to pay your taxes by purchaſing your manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, and giving you a monopoly of their trade. Muſt they maintain <hi>two</hi> governments? Muſt, they ſubmit to be <hi>triple</hi> taxed?—Has your moderation in taxing yourſelves, been ſuch as encourages them to truſt you with the power of taxing them?</p>
               <p>"But they will not obey the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Laws.</hi>"— Say rather, they will not obey <hi>your</hi> parliament and <hi>your</hi> laws. Their reaſon is: They have no voice in your parliament. They have no ſhare in making <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>What I have ſaid, in Part 1ſt. Sect. 3d, of ſubjecting a number of ſtates to a general council repreſenting them all, I ſuppoſe every one muſt conſider as entirely theoretical; and not a propoſal of any thing I wiſh may take place under the Britiſh Empire</p>

Why will you diſturb them in the enjoyment of a bleſſing ſo invaluable? Is it reaſonable to inſiſt, that your diſcretion alone ſhall be their law; that they ſhall have no conſtitutions of government, except ſuch as your parliament ſhall be pleaſed to leave them?—What is your parliament?—Powerful indeed and reſpectable: But is there not a growing intercourſe between it and the court?, Does it awe miniſters of ſtate as it once did?—Inſtead of contending for a controuling power over the governments of <hi>America,</hi> ſhould, you not think more of watching and reforming your own?—Suppoſe the worſt.

               <p>"If <hi>they</hi> can ſubſiſt without you; and alſo <hi>you</hi> without them," the attempt to ſubjugate them by confiſcating their effects, burning their towns, and ravaging their territories, is a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton exertion of cruel ambition, which however common it has been among mankind, deſerves to be called by harder names than I chuſe to apply to it.—Suppoſe ſuch an attempt was to be ſucceeded: Would it not be a fatal preparation for ſubduing yourſelves?

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>HAVING ſaid ſo much of the war with America, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the danger with which it threatens us, it may be expected that I ſhould propoſe ſome method of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this danger and of reſtoring this once happy Empire to a ſtate of peace and ſecurity.—Various plans of pacification have been propoſed; and ſome of them by perſons ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their rank and merit, as to be above my applauſe. But till there is more of a diſpoſition to attend to ſuch plans; they cannot, I am afraid, be of any great ſervice. And there is too much reaſon to apprehend, that nothing but calamity will bring us to repentance and wiſdom.—In order, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to complete my deſign in theſe obſervations, I will take the liberty to lay before the public the following ſketch of one of the plans juſt referred to, as it was opened before the holidays to the houſe of Lords by the <hi>Earl of Shelburne</hi>; who while he held the ſeals of the Southern Department, with the buſineſs of the Colonies annexed, poſſeſſed their confidence, without ever compromiſing the authority of this country; a confidence which diſcovered itſelf by peace among themſelves, and duty and ſubmiſſion to the Mother-country. I hope I ſhall not take an unwarrantable liberty, if, on this occaſion, I uſe his Lordſhip's own words, as nearly as I have been able to collect them.</p>

               <p>Meet the Colonies on their own ground, in the laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the Congreſs to the king. The ſureſt, as well as the moſt dignified mode of proceeding for this country.— Suſpend all hoſtilities—Repeal the acts which immediately diſtreſs America, namely, the laſt reſtraining act,—the charter act,—the act for the more impartial adminiſtration of juſtice;—and the Quebec act.—All the other acts (the cuſtom-houſe act, the poſt-office act, &amp;c.) leave to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate reviſal.—There will be found much matter which both countries may wiſh repealed. <hi>Some</hi> which can never be given up, the principle being that regulation of trade for the common good of the Empire, which forms our <hi>Palladium. Other</hi> matter which is fair ſubject of mutual accommodation. —Preſcribe the moſt explicit acknowledgment of your right of regulating commerce in its moſt extenſive ſenſe; if the petition and other public acts of the Colonies have not already, by their declarations and acknowledgments, left it upon a ſufficiently ſecure foundation.—Beſides the power of regulating the general commerce of the Empire, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further might be expected; provided a due and tender regard were had to the means and abilities of the ſeveral provinces, as well as to thoſe fundamental, unalienable rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> which no father can ſurrender on the part of his ſon, no repreſenter on the part of his elector, no generation on the part of the ſucceeding one; the right of judging not only of the <hi>mode</hi> of raiſing, but the <hi>quantum,</hi> and the appropriation of ſuch aids as they ſhall grant.— To be more explicit; the debt of <hi>England,</hi> without entering into invidious diſtinctions how it came to be contracted, might be acknowledged the debt of every individual part of the whole Empire, Aſia, as well as America, included.— Provided, that full ſecurity were held forth to them, that ſuch free aids, together with the Sinking Fund (Great Britain contributing her ſuperior ſhare) ſhould not be left as the privy purſe of the miniſter, but be unalienably appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the original intention of that fund, the diſcharge of the debt;—and that by an honeſt application of the <hi>whole</hi> fund, the taxes might in time be leſſened, and the price of our manufactures conſequently reduced, ſo that every contributory part might feel the returning benefit—always ſuppoſing the laws of trade duly obſerved and enforced.</p>

They offer a relaxation of the authority of this country, in points to which the Colonies have always conſented, and by which we are great gainers; at the ſame time, that, with a rigour which hazards the Empire, we are maintaining its authority in points to which they will never conſent; and by which nothing can be gained.</note> or a barren metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical chimaera.—How long theſe ends may continue attainable, no man can tell.—But if no words are to be relied on except ſuch as make againſt the Colonies—If nothing is acceptable, except what is attainable by force; it only remains to apply, what has been ſo often remarked of unhappy periods,—<hi>Quos deus vult, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Theſe are ſentiments and propoſals of the laſt importance; and I am very happy in being able to give them to the public from ſo reſpectable an authority, as that of the diſtinguiſhed Peer I have mentioned; to whom, I know, this kingdom, as well as America, is much indebted for his zeal to promote thoſe grand public points on which the preſervation of Liberty among us depends; and for the firm oppoſition which, jointly with many others (Noblemen and Commoners of the firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and abilities,) he has made to the preſent meaſures.</p>
            <p>Had ſuch a plan as that now propoſed been adopted a few months ago, I have little doubt but that a pacification would have taken place, on terms highly advantageous to this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.—In particular. It is probable, that the Colonies would have conſented to grant an annual ſupply, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by a ſaving of the money now ſpent in maintaining troops among them, and by contributions which might have been gained from other parts of the Empire, would have formed a fund conſiderable enough, if unalienably applied, <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Appendix.</note> to redeem

the greateſt part of the public debt; in conſequence of which, agreeable to Lord Shelburne's ideas, ſome of our worſt taxes might be taken off, and the Colonies would receive our manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures cheaper; our paper-currency might be reſtrained; our whole force would be free to meet at any time foreign danger; the influence of the Crown would be reduced; our Parliament would become more independent; and the kingdom might, perhaps, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to a ſituation of permanent ſafety and proſperity.</p>
            <p>To conclude.— An important revolution in affairs of this kingdom ſeems to be approaching. If ruin is not to be our lot, all that has been lately done muſt be undone, and new meaſures adopted. At that period, an opportunity (never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to be recovered, if loſt) will offer itſelf for ſerving eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially <hi>this country,</hi> as well as <hi>America</hi>; by putting the national debt into a <hi>fixed</hi> courſe of payment; by ſubjecting to new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, the adminiſtration of the finances; and eſtabliſhing meaſures for exterminating corruption and reſtoring the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution—For my own part; if this is not to be the conſequence of any future changes in the miniſtry, and the ſyſtem of corruption, lately ſo much improved, is to go on; I think it totally indifferent to the kingdom who are <hi>in,</hi> or who are <hi>out</hi> of power.</p>

               <p>I have given the <hi>Navy Debt</hi> as it was about a year ago. It muſt be now greatly increaſed.—The <hi>Civil Liſt Debt</hi> has been given by gueſs. It is generally acknowledged not to be leſs than the ſum I have ſpecified; and it is alſo expected, that the Civil Liſt income will be raiſed to 900,000 l. <hi>per annum.</hi>—In 1769 the ſum of 513,511 l. was granted by parliament towards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the arrears and debts then due on the Civil Liſt.</p>
               <p>By an act of the firſt of George II. the Civil Liſt was made up 800,000 l. whenever, in any year, the duties and revenues appropriated to it fell ſhort of that ſum. The clear produce of theſe duties for 33 years, or from Midſummer 1727, to Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer 1760, was, according to a particular account in my poſſeſſion, 26,182,981 l. 17s. 6d. or 795,242 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> They fell ſhort, therefore, talking one year with another, <hi>more</hi> than they exceeded, —In 1747, they had been deficient for ſeven years together; and the whole deficiency amounted to 456,733 l. 16 s.—which, in conformity to the act I have mentioned, was made good to his majeſty out of the ſupplies for that year.—In 1729 alſo, 117.000 l. was granted out of the ſupplies for the like reaſon.— This is all the money, received by his late majeſty from parliament, towards ſupporting his houſhold and the dignity of his civil government; or 810,749 <hi>per ann.</hi>—I have thought proper to ſtate this matter ſo particularly here; becauſe accounts groſsly wrong have been given of it.</p>
               <p>The amount of the National Debt, it has appeared, was laſt year 137 millions.—The great deficiencies of laſt year, added to the extraordinary expences of the preſent year, will increaſe this debt conſiderably.—Drawing out, embodying, and maintaining the militia in the laſt war, coſt the nation near half a million <hi>per ann.</hi> —We cannot reckon upon a leſs expence in doing this now. Add
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015032_0065_0F9550FE4CB5B920"/>
to it, pay for foreign troops, and all the extraordinary expences of our increaſed Navy and Army, tranſport ſervice, recruiting ſervice, ordnance, &amp;c. and it will be evident that the whole expence of this unhappy year muſt be enormous.—But I expect that care will be taken to hide it, by funding as little as poſſible, and that for this reaſon it will not be known in its full magnitude, till it comes to appear another year under the articles of Navy debt, extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the army, tranſport bills, ordnance debentures, &amp;c. making up a vaſt unfunded debt which may bear down all public credit.</p>

               <p>It muſt be ſeen, that this account is imperfect, It is, however ſufficient to prove, that the whole money raiſed DIRECTLY by the taxes, exceeds conſiderably ELEVEN MILLIONS. But as the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:015032_0070_0F95510453521350"/>
increaſed price of one commodity has a tendency to raiſe the price of other commodities; and as alſo dealers generally add more than the value of a tax to the price of a commodity, beſides charging intereſt for the money they advance on the taxes; for theſe reaſons, it ſeems certain, that the taxes have an INDIRECT effect of great conſequence; and that a larger ſum is drawn by them from the public, than their <hi>groſs</hi> produce.—It is farther to be conſidered, that many of the perſons who are now ſupported by collecting the taxes would have ſupported themſelves by commerce or agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, therefore, inſtead of taking away from the public ſtock, would have been employed in increaſing it.—Some have reckoned that on all theſe accounts the expence of the taxes is <hi>doubled</hi>; but this muſt be extravagant. Let us ſuppoſe a <hi>quarter</hi> only added; and it will follow, that the money drawn from the public by the taxes (excluſive of thoſe which maintain the poor) is near 14 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions <hi>per ann</hi>; a ſum almoſt equal to the whole ſpecie of the kingdom; which, therefore, had we no paper currency, would be totally inadequate to the wants of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Without all doubt ſuch a ſtate of things, in a great commercial nation, is moſt dangerous, and frightful; but it admits of no remedy, while the public debt continues what it is.—With a view, therefore, to the quick reduction of this debt, I will throw away, after, all I have ſaid on this ſubject on former occaſions, the following propoſals.—It has appeared, that, ſuppoſing the taxes not to become leſs productive, and the current national expence to continue the ſame that it had been for ten years before 1775, a ſurplus may be expected in the revenue of about 300,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> —With a ſurplus ſo trifling, nothing can be done; but it might be increaſed, firſt of all; By keeping the LAND TAX for the future at 4s. in the pound.—As rents have been almoſt doubled, this will not be much more to the preſent proprietors of land, than 2s. in the pound was formerly. 'Tis, therefore, equitable; and it will add to the national income near 450,000 l.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> All the money now ſpent in maintaining troops in America might be ſaved.—The Colonies are able to defend themſelves. They wiſh to be allowed to do it. Should they ever want the aid of our troops, they will certainly be very willing to pay us for them. Indeed I am of opinion, they will never be willing to make pence with us, without ſtipulating that we ſhall withdraw our troops from them. Were there any external power that claimed and exerciſed a right of ſtationing troops in this country, without our conſent, we ſhould certainly think ourſelves entirely undone.—I will eſtimate this ſaving at no more than 200,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi>

                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> I do not ſee why the peace-eſtabliſhment might not be reduced to what it was, at an average, in 1768, 1769 and 177O. This would produce a ſaving of 350,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi>—I might here propoſe reducing the peace-eſtabliſhment for the <hi>Navy</hi> to what it always was before the laſt war, or from 16,000 to 10,000 men. But it would be infinitely better to reduce the ARMY; and this might produce a farther ſaving of great conſequence.—But waving this, I ſhall only mention,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That contributions might be obtained from <hi>North America</hi> and other parts of the Britiſh Empire, on the principles ſtated, from the EARL of SHELBURNE'S authority, in page 60.— I will eſtimate this at no more than 300,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi>—Add the <hi>Surplus</hi> now in our poſſeſſion; and the total will be 1.600,000. —In the <hi>Introduction</hi> to the third edition of the Treatiſe on <hi>Reverſionary Payments,</hi> I have explained a method of paying off with a ſinking Fund of a million <hi>per ann.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">At the time of writing the introduction here referred to, about three year ago, I <hi>thought,</hi> or rather <hi>hoped,</hi> that the ſurplus of the revenue might be taken at 900 000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> But it muſt be conſidered, that the nation was then in poſſeſſion of a contribution of 400,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> from the Lodia Company, which has been ſince loſt,—See the Additional Preface to the 2nd Edition <hi>of the Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the National Debt.</hi>
                  </note> a hundred millions of the national debt in forty years. What then might not be done with ſuch a Fund as this?</p>
               <p>In five years 18.986,300l. will fall from an intereſt of 4 <hi>per cent.</hi> to 3 <hi>per cent.</hi>—Alſo, 4.500,000 l. 3½ <hi>per cent.</hi> 1758, will fall, in ſix years, to an intereſt of 3 <hi>per cent.</hi>—The long Annuities granted in King WILLIAM'S time, amounting to 136,453 l. will, in 18 years, become moſtly extinct; as will alſo the greater part of the Life Annuities ſpecified in page 63.—All theſe ſavings amount to more than 400,000 l. <hi>per ann.</hi> And, were they to be added to the fund as they fall in, its operations would be ſo much accelerated, that in a few years we ſhould ſee this country above all its difficulties.—Still more might be done by ſtriking off unncceſſary places and penſions; by giving up all the means of corruption; by reducing the pay of the great officers of ſtate; and ſimplifying the taxes—A miniſter who appeared determined to carry into execution ſuch a ſyſtem, would ſoon gain the confidence of the public; endear himſelf to all honeſt men; and in time come to be bleſſed as the Saviour of his country.—But what am I doing?—We have no ſuch happy period before us.—Our miniſters are active in purſuing meaſures which muſt increaſe our burdens. A horrid civil war is begun; and it may ſoon leave us nothing to be anxious about.</p>
