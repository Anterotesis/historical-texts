         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Could very willingly have diſpens'd with meeting you at this time, not only becauſe the Seaſon of the Year makes it uneaſie to many of you, who live in remote parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to give your attendance here, but alſo becauſe the day of the Anniverſary <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>But the preſent Exigence of Affairs is ſuch, That the Council and I have thought it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary, we ſhould meet and conſult about it in General Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> in this and the Neighbouring Colonies, are ſaid to have Combin'd with the <hi>Eaſtern Indians,</hi> intending to make a general Inſurrection and Rebellion; and if we may Credit the Advices we have from ſome hands, the time for Execution of this their ill Deſign is near at hand: and ſo near, that it will be in vain to try to avert the blow by Treaty or the promiſe of any advantages to them; but we muſt rather think of Suppreſſing them by force of Arms. In order to which you will do well to conſider of a way to make ſuch Levies of Souldiers as ſhall be ſufficient to defend the Country, and being Levied to Diſcipline and make them Expert in the Exerciſe and Uſe of their Arms.</p>

               </gap> if a way were found out to oblige the Forces to March out of the Province as often as the Kings Service requires it; it is our duty to aſſiſt our Neighbours and Fellow Subjects: And it has always been reckoned a point of Policy, and Prudence, to keep danger as much at a diſtance as 'tis poſſible.</p>
            <p>It were well too, if a Law were made to puniſh Mutiny, and Deſertion, in time of actual War, without which the Souldiers you Raiſe, will not be tractable to the Command of their Officers, and ſo will not anſwer your end in Raiſing them.</p>
            <p>You will do well to make proviſion of a ſufficient quantity of Arms and Ammunition, and that with all the Expedition that may be, That the Country may be furniſh'd with both for their Defence.</p>

It belongs to you to conſider what that Charge will be, and to provide Funds accordingly.</p>
