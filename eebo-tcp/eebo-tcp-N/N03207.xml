            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE prophecies contained in this chapter, as well as in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and two following, relate chiefly to the happy deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the land of their captivity, and their reſtoration to the enjoyment of the inſtitutions of God's worſhip, and of all the rights and privileges of his peculiar people in their own land. And becauſe the deſign of God in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his own people into captivity, was to reform and purge them from their ſins, eſpecially from their idolatries, which had been very provoking to him,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003886_0004_10020B8A42C63C50"/>and againſt which he teſtified his diſpleaſure in that awful diſpenſation; therefore in the predictions and promiſes of their return out of captivity, we find fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent intimations of a ſignal work of repentance, that ſhould be wrought in them, to prepare and qualify them for ſo great a mercy, that before their return to their own <hi>land,</hi> and in order to it, they ſhould firſt penitently return to the <hi>Lord their God,</hi> from their ſins and idols, with humiliation &amp; ſupplication; that God being reconciled to his people upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, might with honour to himſelf, appear for them as remarkably in works of mercy, as ever he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd againſt them in works of judgment. For a <hi>ſpecimen,</hi> or proof hereof, let it ſuffice to cite one paſſage, &amp; that parallel to our context Jer. 50. 4, 5. <hi>In thoſe days, and in that time, ſaith the Lord the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhall come, they &amp; the children of</hi> Judah, <hi>together, going and weeping: they ſhall go, and ſeek the Lord their God. They ſhall ask the way to</hi> Zion, <hi>with their faces thitherward,</hi> ſaying, <hi>come and let us join ourſelves to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And it is obſervable, that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are there joined with the children of <hi>Judah</hi> in their return to God, &amp; ſeeking the way to <hi>Zion;</hi> for it is a miſtake to think, that only the tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> return'd out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; for there were many of the ten tribes that aſſociated with the two tribes in their return from <hi>Babylon.</hi> Particularly, we read 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> ix. 3 of <hi>the children of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>and</hi> Manaſſeh, that <hi>dwelt in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> after the captivity<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See</hi> Dr. PRIDEAUX <hi>Connect.</hi> Part 1. Book 3.</note>. Therefore in our text, where the ſame work of repentance is foretold, and exemplify'd, and on the ſame occaſion, and in order to the ſame happy iſſue of the troubles of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, here promis'd, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is brought in <hi>bemoaning himſelf,</hi> &amp;c If it be ask'd, why <hi>Ephraim,</hi> rather than <hi>Judah?</hi> I can give no account, unleſs it be for one
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003886_0005_1002678DDAA2FC28"/>or other of theſe reaſons, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe, that as the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is often denominated in the prophets from <hi>Ephraim</hi> the ruling tribe; ſo <hi>Ephraim</hi> firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; profeſſedly revolted to idolatry in the ſeparation of the ten tribes from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> under <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> and idolatry being the ſpecial ſin that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd God to caſt his people out of the land he had given them, it being a breach of the marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and them, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> being in a ſpecial manner guilty of this ſin, <hi>he</hi> therefore eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, is brought in exerciſing repentance for it: and this may be the meaning of that penitent reflection in the following verſe. <hi>I was aſhamed, yea even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> Which may be underſtood of this ſin of idolatry, which was the ſin of the ten tribes from their <hi>youth,</hi> from their very beginning, when they were firſt form'd into a kingdom, and which was indeed their reproach and ruin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe in the verſes immediately preceeding, a promiſe is made for the comfort of <hi>Rachel</hi> particularly, mourning bitterly for the loſs of her children, that they ſhould return <hi>from the land of the enemy,</hi> verſe 15, 16, 17. therefore in the verſes immediately following, the repentance of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> who deſcended from <hi>Rachel,</hi> is particularly mentioned, &amp; God's acceptance of him to mercy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as that which prepared the way to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe of his deliverance &amp; reſtoration. <hi>I have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf,</hi> that is, the deſcendants of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> nothing being more uſual in the prophets, than to put the name of the progenitor for his poſterity, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> for the children and poſterity of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And to go no farther than the context, Rachel <hi>weeping for her children,</hi> is put for the matrons in <hi>Iſrael</hi> about the time of the captivity, who deſcended from <hi>Rachel.</hi> The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are here ſpoken of as a ſingle perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to ſhew that their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould be general, and that they ſhould be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003886_0006_10026790531525A8"/>unanimous in it, and as Mr. HENRY obſerves <q>it is thus expreſs'd, that it might be the better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to particular penitents, for whoſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and encouragement this paſſage is intended.</q>

               </gap> mercy of God. He bewails his impatience, and incorrigibleneſs under the great and ſore calamities God had inflicted on him for his ſins, and in order to his amendment. <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke.</hi> Which ſpeaks either his need of chaſtiſement; I was untractable, and not to be manag'd or govern'd by gentler methods, therefore I needed, and juſtly deſerved this ſevere correction; or rather it ſpeaks the effect of his chaſtiſement; thus I was chaſtiſed indeed, but behaved myſelf very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly under it, as a <hi>bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> I was not amended by it, but grew impatient and refractory under the yoke of afflictions; this he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on now (when God had begun to mollify his heart) with humiliation for his paſt contumacy: and hence he is convinced that the greateſt afflictions will not ſuffice to bring a ſinner to repentance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effectual operations of divine grace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it to God, as an argument, in pleading for that grace; which is the import of the petition that follows in the words of the text, <hi>turn thou me,</hi> &amp;c. wherein we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A prayer for converting grace. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned;</hi> it ſpeaks his ſenſe of his own impotency to turn himſelf, his need of the grace of God to turn him, his dependance on that grace, and earneſt deſire of it. <hi>Turn thou me,</hi> and then I ſhall <hi>be turned</hi> q. d. if thou Lord wilt exert the power of thy grace, the effect ſhall certainly follow, then I ſhall be aſſuredly and effectually turned.

And he that truly deſires, and prays for converting grace, muſt be underſtood to purpoſe and reſolve to repent, and turn to God in a dependance on that grace, to improve the grace given, and co-operate with it, in actual converſion from ſin to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An argument or plea to inforce this Petition, <hi>for thou art the Lord my God.

            <p>It is a very harſh, and forc'd expoſition which <hi>Grotius</hi> gives of theſe words, to this purpoſe, <hi>return thou me to my own country, and then I will repent:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a preſent obſtinate, incorrigible diſpoſition, contrary to the whole tenor of this paſſage, which exhibits a moſt humble, contrite, penitent frame, on the ſinner's part: and the moſt tender expreſſions of pity and compaſſion on God's part, of any that are to be met with in the whole ſcripture. Unqueſtionably therefore, the <hi>turning</hi> here intended, is no other than the converſion of the ſoul from ſin to God.

But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him in his moral character and relation, as an holy and righteous ruler, and a kind and gracious benefactor; ſo we may be ſaid to forſake him by ſin, and return to him by repentance, and obedience.

            <p>And as to the requiſites and ingredients in a ſound converſion, let me only note,
<list>
                  <item>1. In the converſion of a ſinner, there is a work of conviction and humiliation wrought in his ſoul; whereby he is convinced of the evil, and damnable nature of ſin; his carnal reſt is diſturb'd and broken, he finds himſelf deſerted of his earthly refuges, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs of relief from every creature to his wounded conſcience, and is heavy laden with a ſenſe of guilt and corruption, which is the wormwood and gall that embitters all his comforts, and the ſting of all his afflictions, and fills his ſoul with vexation and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003886_0012_1002679B24E8E9E0"/>terror, which excites in him a loathing of his ſins, and an earneſt deſire to leave them, and to have no more commerce with them This work of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is neceſſary to mortify the love of ſin, and to break off the ſinner's heart from it, to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of God's grace and mercy in Chriſt, welcome to him on any terms, and to influence his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and endeavours unto a ready compliance with all the methods of grace, &amp; the terms and conditions of ſalvation. This is exemplify'd in the prodigal ſon, who never tho't of returning to his father's houſe, till reduc'd to the laſt extremity. Luk xv. 17, 18. <hi>When he came to himſelf, he ſaid, how many hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of my father have bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger: I will ariſe, and go to my father.</hi> And in thoſe three thouſand converted, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. who when they heard the word preached by <hi>Peter,</hi> with a cloſe application to their conſciences, <hi>were pricked in their heart, and ſaid, men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> And in <hi>Saul</hi> Act ix 6 <hi>he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And the ſame temper, and contrition of ſpirit is repreſented in the inſtance before us, of a true penitent, ver. 19. <hi>After that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, yea, even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In the converſion of a ſinner, there is a change wrought in the temper, byaſs, and inclination of the ſoul; turning it from ſin to holineſs, from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to God: it does not ſuffice to converſion, that a ſinner forſakes ſome ſins, that he lived in before. Men may eſcape the pollutions of the world, and be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly reform'd, and yet retain their ſwiniſh nature, which afterward they may, and too often do diſcover by returning <hi>with the ſow that is waſhed, to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire,</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 20, 22. But there muſt be an inward change in the diſpoſition of the mind, an healing and renovation of the powers and paſſions of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003886_0013_10020B940BEB48E8"/>the ſoul, by the word and ſpirit of God, of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, conſcience, will, and affections: the ſinner is transform'd, by the renewing of his mind, into a new creature. Rom. xii. 2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.</hi> He is rectified in his apprehenſions, and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of things, he ſees more of the deformity of ſin, of the beauty of holineſs, of the vanity of the world, of the need and worth of a Saviour, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and importance of things ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, than ever he ſaw before; the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in part cured of their corrupt byaſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly inclined to the things of God, to ſeek, ſerve, and enjoy him. Sin hath its riſe from a corrupt heart. Mat. xv. 19. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murthers, adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. therefore the work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion muſt begin in the heart, the fountain of all external operations, in purging, healing, and rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe inward ſprings of motion; and this inward change of the heart is neceſſary to an univerſal change of life and converſation: and this is the peculiar ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of God's grace promiſed, Ezek. xxxvi. 26, 27 <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will put my ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, &amp; ye ſhall keep my judgments and do them.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. In converſion, a ſinner forſakes all his former ſins both in heart and life. This is inſiſted on as the prime requiſite in actual converſion. Iſal lv. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his tho'ts: and let him return unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) He forſakes all ſin in general; that is, tho' ſin ſtill adheres to him, and ſins of infirmity will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably attend him every day in this <hi>interim</hi> of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, yet he allows no ſin to reign in him, he cheriſhes no ſin in his heart; but in his judgment, will, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003886_0014_1002679CB278F1B8"/>cxix. 104. <hi>Through thy precepts I get underſtanding: therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi> And the reaſon is, he that truly turns from any ſin, as ſin, as it is againſt God and his law, muſt turn from every ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) He forſakes <hi>his beloved ſin</hi> in ſpecial: that ſin, whatever it be, whether pride, uncleanneſs, injuſtice in traffick, drunkenneſs, lying, or any other ſin, which he is moſt addicted to, thro' age, conſtitution, cuſtom, condition or circumſtances of life, and which he is moſt tender of, and moſt eaſily and frequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by, and which he is moſt loath to part with; which, yet, his heart chiefly ſmites him for under convictions; that ſin, I ſay, a true convert will be moſt careful to forſake, and mortify, and watch, and ſtrive, and pray againſt it, and get the victory over it. The call is, to turn eſpecially from our own evil way. Jer. xviii. 11. <hi>Return ye every one from his evil way.</hi> And the truth of grace will diſcover itſelf in the moſt ſerious endeavours to keep ourſelves from <hi>our own iniquity.</hi> Pſal xviii 23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him: and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3) He will forſake the ſins both of heart and life. He will particularly forſake heart ſins, and abhor evil and vain tho'ts, and imaginations, all unbelieving, irreverent, blaſphemous, and murmuring thoughts againſt God, and his providence; uncharitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous and revengeful thoughts againſt his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and all proud, covetous, unclean thoughts; he will cruſh ſin in the <hi>Embryo,</hi> and not ſuffer luſt to conceive in his heart, nor evil <hi>thoughts to lodge</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. Jer. iv. 14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou may'ſt be ſaved; how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Here lies the main difference between a ſincere convert, and an hypocrite; the care of the latter is chiefly employ'd in keeping clean the outſide, that he might recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf to the good opinion of men, and if he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003886_0015_100267A013EBE250"/>can but do this, all is well, though he is full of all uncleanneſs, hypocriſy, and iniquity within. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is the firſt and chief care of a true convert to approve his heart to God's acceptance, to keep the mind and affection clean, pure, chaſt, and meet for communion with him. He will take care to have a pure heart, as well as clean hands<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxiv. 4. <hi>Jam.</hi> iv. 8</note> Again, he will exerciſe a ſtrict care to forſake all ſin in his life; and <hi>to live no longer the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, but to the will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. iv. 2. For tho' every one is not certainly a true convert, that forſakes ſome ſins he had formerly lived in, and leads a life viſibly blameleſs; yet a true convert will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly forſake all his former ſinful cuſtoms, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; for where there is a change of the heart, there will be a change of the way; and the ſtreams will partake of the nature of the fountain: and in this <hi>the children of God</hi> are manifeſtly diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>the children of the devil,</hi> namely, in their <hi>abſtinence from,</hi> and <hi>oppoſition to all</hi> ſin. 1 Joh. iii 9, 10 <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin: for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God. In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4) In converſion the ſinner <hi>returns to God</hi> whom he had forſaken, and <hi>devotes himſelf to him by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if it ſeem too preſuming for a poor ſinful creature to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a ſolemn covenant tranſaction with the great God of heaven; 'tis true, GOD, abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, is inacceſſible to ſinful men; there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him but by a <hi>Mediator:</hi> we ſhould therefore be humbly ſenſible of the diſtance and variance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us, and ſee our need of the mediation of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in whom he is reconcilable, and converſable with man, and offers a covenant of reconciliation to us, founded on the atonement made by his blood, <hi>in whom we have acceſs with confidence</hi> in the love and compaſſions of the Father<note n="‖" place="bottom">

Again, (2) It ſhews the invincible efficacy of divine grace.

Chap. iv. 18. <hi>Having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, thro' the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart;</hi> he is wholly eſtranged from things ſpiritual &amp; heavenly, &amp; has a ſtrong bent to the things of the fleſh, and the world, and a root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed averſion to holineſs, which nothing can effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cure, but the divine operations of the Spirit of God. Our Saviour proves the neceſſity of the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating grace of the Spirit, in order to our being reſtored to the ſpiritual life, and to an inheritance in the kingdom of God, from the univerſal corruption, and carnality of man's nature. Joh. iii. 6, 7. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit. Marvel not,</hi> therefore adds he, <hi>that I ſaid unto thee, ye muſt be born again.</hi> That a man who is carnal by nature, might become ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, there is a neceſſity of the regenerating work of the Spirit. Without the reſtoring grace of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, man fallen is not only impotent, but full of enmity againſt holineſs, and the duties of the ſpiritual life, as the ſcriptures abundantly declare. Joh. xv. 5. <hi>Without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye can do nothing;</hi> no more than a <hi>branch</hi> ſever'd from the <hi>vine,</hi> can bear fruit of it ſelf. Rom. viii. 7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be.</hi> Col. i. 21. — <hi>alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works:</hi> or, as the original might be rendred, <hi>enemies by your mind in wicked works.</hi> The mind and affections being ſtrongly bent to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003886_0019_10020B84DC657860"/>courſes of tranſgreſſion, is the cauſe of all enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. And how can ſuch a degenerate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, renew himſelf by repentance, or convert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, without the ſpecial influences of divine grace?</p>

               </gap> It is called <hi>the workmanſhip of God,</hi> and aſcrib'd to his creating power, which exceeds all power in the creature.

Regeneration and converſion, in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, are uſed as terms equivalent, but in a ſtrict ſenſe, there is this difference, regeneration confers a ſupernatural power, or ſpiritual inclination of the ſoul dead in ſin; in <hi>converſion,</hi> this power is drawn forth into act, in the exerciſe of repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and in both theſe the grace of God works, both in conferring vital powers, and in drawing them out into act; and the quick'ning of a ſoul, that lies in a ſtate of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death, by the regeneration of the Spirit is neceſſary unto actual converſion. And this is aſcribed intirely to God, excluſive of all other cauſes. Joh. i. 13. <hi>Which were born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> And if ſuch a change as amounts to a new birth, is neceſſary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner, ſurely man cannot be the author of it in himſelf, no more than he may be ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf at firſt; but the power and grace of God is neceſſary to the production of it</p>

It may therefore be aſſerted with good reaſon from ſcripture, that if God doth not beſtow his ſpecial converting grace on a ſinner, he never will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003886_0021_100267AA94F157E8"/>him.

            <p n="1">(1) Becauſe the regeneration and converſion of a ſinner is <hi>expreſly aſcribed to the will of God,</hi> and <hi>as expreſly denied to the will of man.</hi> In the fore cited <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 13. believers in Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> The new birth is not the product of the will of man, but of the will of God. Jam. i. 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us,</hi> &amp;c. Again Rom. ix. 15, 16. <hi>He ſaith to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion.</hi> His inference hence is, <hi>ſo then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> and that according to his own ſovereign will. The phraſe, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,</hi> as it ſpeaks the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute freedom of the divine will, ſo it imports the irreſiſtable efficacy of it. If God <hi>will have mercy</hi> on any ſoul, nothing in the world ſhall hinder it; for there is a powerful efficacy in the will of God, <hi>he

            <p n="2">(2) It is aſcribed to the <hi>mighty power of God,</hi> even that power to which all things are poſſible. When our Saviour had laid open the difficulties of ſalvation, or of entering into the kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 26, 27. the diſciples were exceedingly ſurprized, and being <hi>aſtoniſhed out of meaſure,</hi> ſaith the evangeliſt, <hi>ſaid among themſelves, who then can be ſaved?

The young man that came to Chriſt with that queſtion, <hi>good maſter, what ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</hi> (on which occaſion thoſe words were ſpoken by our Saviour) ſhew'd as good a diſpoſition to the kingdom of God, as any meer natural man may ordinarily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do, yet it required the almighty power of divine grace to bring him into it, and to ſubdue his heart and will, to the grace and government of Chriſt; and when this power is put forth the moſt obſtinate ſhall be made to yield to it.

It is more than the reformation of a ſcandalous life. 2 Pet. ii. 20. <hi>If after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowlege of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is worſe with them, than the beginning.</hi> It is ſuppoſed, that men may be outwardly reformed, and purg'd from the groſs <hi>pollutions of the world,</hi> by

Again, it is more than ſome compunction and ſorrow for ſin. How often do awakenings, convictions, and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions prove abortive, not being deep and ſerious enough, to produce a thorow change in men's hearts and lives. Yet again, it is more than putting in practice ſome neglected duties of religion; many miſtake here, if they who have neglected prayer a great part of their lives, begin now to pray in their families, or in ſecret, if they publickly recognize the covenant of their baptiſm, if they join themſelves to the communion of God's people in ſpecial ordinances, and come to the Lord's table, ſurely now (they are apt to think) they are converted perſons, now they are juſt men that need no repentance: alas, fooliſh virgins! have you never read or heard, that Chriſt in the great day, will ſay, <hi>depart from me,</hi> to many that will be able to plead, <hi>we have eaten, and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets,</hi> Luk xiii. 26, 27. and what the doom of the man was in the parable, who came to the marriage feaſt, <hi>not having on a wedding garment,</hi> Mat. xxii. 11, 12.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What has been ſaid, <hi>ſerves for conviction to thoſe that indulge a ſecret opinion of their own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, and power to repent and turn to God when they pleaſe.</hi> Such a conceit may be found with many, who yet have orthodox notions concerning man's impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and the neceſſity of effectual grace. For the truth of this, I will appeal to the conſciences of many, who under ſtrong convictions of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and danger of their condition, and of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of converſion, to ſatisfy conſcience reſolve that ſome time hereafter they will repent, yet for the preſent wilfully neglect the doing what they think they can do in order to converſion, and what they purpoſe ſome time or other to do. Now what does this argue, but that you think it is in your own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to repent when you pleaſe, without any more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace from God? otherwiſe it is a deſperate hazard you run, by putting off convictions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring repentance, while the Spirit of God is ſtriving with you, leſt he depart, and return no more. And I am perſwaded, if ſinners would ſeriouſly conſider this, and believe it, they could not be eaſy in their wretched neglects and delays. Again, have you not, when luſts have been importunate, and temptations ſtrong, yielded to commit a ſin againſt conſcience, and, it may be, againſt ſolemn vows, with ſuch a tho't as this, if I venture this once, it is but to repent, and all will be well. And does not this ſuppoſe, that you think that repentance is at any time in your power, whether God gives you the grace of his Spirit or no? otherwiſe it is a fearful venture indeed, to provoke God to his face, by whoſe grace alone, you muſt be enabled to repent, if ever you do ſo in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Be deterr'd from ſinning upon preſumption of repenting;</hi> for this very reaſon, becauſe of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the grace of God, to thy repentance and converſion, which he is not bound to give. He may
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003886_0028_100267B3AB428238"/>do it, and he may not, if he pleaſe. If thou takeſt the liberty of thy will to ſin, God may take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his will to deny thee grace, and leave thee to thine own hardneſs, and impenitent heart, to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up to thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may ſerve <hi>to humble all, eſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ones, in a ſenſe of the hardneſs and obſtinacy of their hearts by nature,</hi> that nothing can move or melt to a temper pliable to God's will, but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual grace of the Spirit of God. Judgments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it of themſelves, they may rouze and terrify, but without the gracious influences of the Spirit, will rather have an hardning efficacy. An unconverted ſinner under divine chaſtiſements, behaves <hi>as a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock unaccuſtomed to the yoke.</hi> A meſſenger from the dead cannot do it. Luk. xvi. 31. <hi>If they hear not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the prophets, neither will they be perſwaded</hi> (i. e. to repent, <hi>ver.</hi> 30) <hi>though one roſe from the dead.</hi> The moſt awakening ſermons, the moſt lively preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot do it. All the <hi>former prophets</hi> could not ſoften and ſubdue the hearts of the men of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Zech. vii. 12. <hi>Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hoſts hath ſent in his Spirit, by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hoſts Iſaiah</hi>'s preaching did but make their <hi>heart fat, and their ears heavy,</hi> and cloſed <hi>their eyes,</hi> that they did not <hi>ſee with their eyes,</hi> nor <hi>hear with their ears,</hi> nor <hi>underſtand with their hearts,</hi> that they might be <hi>converted,</hi> and <hi>healed, Iſai.</hi> vi. 10. that is, this was the effect of his preaching, thro' the hardneſs of the people's hearts. And thy heart is made of the ſame metal. If <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> were alive, there is hardneſs enough in thy heart to withſtand all their calls, expoſtulations, and warnings. Nay, if Chriſt himſelf were on earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, who is greater than all the prophets, if he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003886_0029_100267B6230E8C60"/>ſhould weep over thee, as he <hi>wept over Jeruſalem</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> xix. 41.</note>, he could not humble, ſoften, nor convert thine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate heart, without exerting his omnipotent grace. Learn then, to <hi>know the plague</hi> of thine own heart<note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>King.</hi> viii. 38.</note>, and ſeriouſly bewail it before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let it be improved for <hi>caution againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing this doctrine of the neceſſity of God's grace in the work of converſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is abuſed, when men pretend it as an excuſe for their continuance in ſin, or neglect of known duties; they hope to amend and do better, when God gives them grace; and thus, in a very impious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they lay the blame of their ſins, upon God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them grace. But know, O ſinner, that thou art bound by the command, which requires nothing of thee, but what is ſuited to the powers of thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature; and thine impotency to do what is required, lies not in the want of natural faculties, but in an obſtinate and perverſe diſpoſition of will, which is ſo far from excuſing thee from the duties of holineſs, that the neglect of them muſt needs expoſe thee to the upbraidings of thine own conſcience. And the promiſe offers thee grace ſufficient in a ſenſe of thine own impotency, and thou art forever inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if thou doſt not ſeek it earneſtly, and uſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means to attain it; but if you content your ſelves in the ſlothful neglect of what you may and can do in the uſe of means, you deſpiſe the grace of God, and forfeit the influences and aſſiſtances of it, and will periſh as inexcuſably, as if it had been ever ſo fully in your own power to convert yourſelves.</p>
               <p>Again, It is abuſed, when perſons admit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements from duties, becauſe they are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003886_0030_10020BA719F9FA88"/>whether God will give them grace, and for that reaſon are diſcouraged eſpecially from binding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with religious vows to an holy life, and taking upon them the obligations of their baptiſmal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or joining themſelves in church fellowſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is doubtful whether God will give them grace, which is neceſſary to enable them to live up to their religious engagements.</p>
               <p>But the apoſtle has taught us to reaſon quite the contrary way. Phil. ii. 12, 13. <hi>Work out your own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling, for it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> He doth not ſay, becauſe <hi>it is God who works in you of his good pleaſure,</hi> therefore ſit ſtill, and wait for the motions and operations of grace; no, but be encouraged hence to work, to ſtir up yourſelves, and put forth endeavours in working out your ſalvation, never queſtioning the concurrence and powerful aids of divine grace; which are never wanting to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endeavours; and then be encouraged to hope for the ſucceſs of your endeavours, for if God works in you, and with you, your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord. Wherefore give up yourſelves to God, uſe the means of grace, you are then in the way of God's bleſſing, make trial of his ways in good earneſt, depend on his promiſed grace, and you ſhall find it <hi>ſufficient</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 9.</note> to carry you thro', as thouſands have done before you, who have had no more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's grace than you, but they truſted God, and were helped, and found his grace ſufficient for them.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, if God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, then let me do what I will, or can, I may yet fall ſhort of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:003886_0031_100267B7AE21A588"/>
But this is a prepoſterous way of reaſoning. 'Tis true I muſt acknowledge, that God is at liberty to withhold his grace (for if it were due, it were not grace) and may juſtly do it after all my endeavours, for my ill deſervings, yet conſidering the general offer of grace to all, without exception, it is much more reaſonable, and more for the glory of God, and for the honour of his grace, to argue thus, Let me do what I can in the uſe of means, and I have no reaſon to deſpair of grace, and help from God, but rather much encouragement to expect it; and a ſenſe of ſin and unworthineſs ſhould be no diſcouragement, for he gives grace to none becauſe they are worthy, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it to none meerly becauſe of their unworthineſs, for ſo he ſhould deny it to all; ſay then, Lord, I am a poor wretched creature, unworthy of a favourable look from thee, there is nothing in me to move thee to pity or help me, but my own wants and miſeries; yet ſince thy grace is free to all, even the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and thou haſt mercy in a ſovereign way on whom thou wilt, if therefore, Lord, thou wilt, thou canſt glorify thy mercy on ſuch a vile unworthy object as I am, therefore will I wait on thee, and if I periſh, I will periſh at the footſtool of thy grace. A ſoul bro't into this humble yielding frame, is a fit object of the divine compaſſions and grace. Jam. iv. 6, 7. He <hi>giveth grace unto the humble. Submit yourſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to God.</hi> Hence,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let me proceed to an uſe of exhortation, from the conſideration of the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>victorious efficacy</hi> of the grace of God in converſion, <hi>Let all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, be excited and quick'ned to pray to God, and pray earneſtly for his converting grace,</hi> to be poured out on themſelves and their children: for if converſion be the gift and work of God's grace, what more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and neceſſary, than that his grace ſhould be acknowleg'd and magnified, by our humble dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thus God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects we ſhould ſhew our value of this bleſſing, and our diſpoſition and readineſs to aſcribe to him the praiſe and glory of it intirely. And there are ſeveral ſorts of perſons concern'd in this exhortation, to whom therefore I would addreſs it with all ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would preſs it upon all unconverted o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, or thoſe who have reaſon to think themſelves ſuch, to pray to God for his converting grace. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> On true converts themſelves, after grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſtill to pray for the grace of God to convert, and recover them from their backſlidings. or decays of grace they may have fallen into. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> On Parents in covenant with God, to pray for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted children. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> On the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted children of the covenant in particular, to pray for the grace of God to convert and turn them to himſelf; taking encouragement from their viſible covenant relation to God, as their God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Let me urge and inculcate, <hi>the great duty and concern of unconverted ſinners to pray for converting grace;</hi> purſuant to the <hi>ſecond point</hi> of obſervation from the example in the text: which contains (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) a petition for converting grace, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes every unconverted ſinner to offer up to God. And though <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who is here brought in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his converſion, was not altogether in a ſtate of natural corruption, and unregeneracy; his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in this and the following verſe, is expreſſive of a very humble and penitent diſpoſition, a good work was already begun in him by the grace of God: yet ſtill the ſame grace was neceſſary to bring it to ſome perfection, without which (that is, if God ſhould then have left him, without the further aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of his grace) he is ſenſible that he ſhould ſtill miſcarry, that he ſhould ſtill wander from his duty and happineſs, and never be thorowly <hi>converted</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003886_0033_10020BAC12F921C8"/>
                  <hi>healed;</hi> and therefore prays, <hi>turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi> The ſame ſenſe every unconverted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ought to have of his condition, and to humble himſelf, and confeſs his ſins, &amp; bewail his impotency and inſufficiency to turn himſelf, and to beg of God the powerful influences and aids of his Spirit, in order to his effectual converſion.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that ſuch ſinners are as uncapable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, as of converting themſelves, they are uncapable of making ſuch humble, penitent, believing ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as God will accept, for this ſuppoſes them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready endow'd with the grace of repentance. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Anſwer,</hi> Sinners muſt needs be ſuppoſed to have deſires of their own happineſs, which are inſeparable from a reaſonable creature, and it is the will of God that ſuch deſires ſhould be cultivated and improv'd; there are many important duties of religion urg'd upon men, from a ſuppoſition of theſe natural deſires of their own welfare; and if ſinners would ſuffer themſelves to be ſet right, by the rules of the word, in the method of purſuing theſe deſires, they would not fail of everlaſting happineſs, and under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they may deſire the grace of God, without which, they know they cannot be ſaved; and it muſt needs be granted alſo, that they are capable of <hi>taking to themſelves words</hi> to expreſs ſuch deſires to God; and if ſinners might be prevailed with to do this, with that fervency and importunity that the nature of the thing requires, tho' prompted thereunto meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a concern for their own welfare, they have ſufficient encouragement ſet before them, to hope that ſuch their deſires and prayers ſhall not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without ſucceſs. Wherefore in order to the inforcement of this exhortation, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew theſe two things,
<list>
                     <item>1. That <hi>it is the unqueſtionable duty of all unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and unconverted ones to pray to God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003886_0034_100267BD1FB61E48"/>
2. That <hi>it is their great concern to pray for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>it is the unqueſtionable duty of all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unconverted ones to pray to God.</hi> Though they are ſuppoſed deſtitute of ſupernatural habits, and the indwelling preſence of the Spirit of grace and ſupplication, that ſhould frame their hearts unto this duty, in order to the acceptable performance of it, they are ſtill under indiſpenſable obligations to pray to God: and the more ſinful and wretched their condition is, and the more ſenſible they are of their own vileneſs, and unworthineſs, the more need they have certainly, to bemoan themſelves to God, and pour out their hearts before him in prayer, for the ſuccours of his mercy and grace.</p>
               <p>That this is matter of plain duty, appears, in that prayer is a duty of worſhip founded on the law of nature, the obligations whereof reach every man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of equal extent with the humane nature; this is a part of natural homage due from all reaſonable creatures to the God that made them, by the law of their creation, and dependance on him. Pſal. c. 2, 3. <hi>Serve the Lord with gladneſs —. Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we ourſelves.</hi> Pſal. xcv. 6, 7, <hi>O come let us worſhip, and how down: let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his paſture, and the ſheep of his hand.</hi> It is highly reaſonable that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending creatures, endow'd with reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhould in this way, own the ſovereign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their beings, on whom they have a conſtant and neceſſary dependance for life, breath, and all things. The neglect whereof therefore is a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the end of our creation, and a violation of the prime dictate of the law of nature. For prayer is a duty which natural conſcience requires of men, there is a natural reverence of God in the conſciences of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003886_0035_100267BF97B32380"/>men that prompts them to this duty. The unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned heathen, tho' miſtaken in the objects of their worſhip, have yet ever tho't it their duty to pray to the gods they own'd. Thus thoſe pagan <hi>mariners</hi> in <hi>Jon.</hi> i. 5. in a diſtreſſing tempeſt at ſea, being taught, as it ſhould ſeem, by the meer voice of nature, <hi>cried every man to his god.</hi> And thoſe that neglect this part of God's worſhip, are juſtly conſtrued to caſt off the natural reverence of God. Job xv. 4 <hi>Thou caſteſt off fear, and reſtraineſt prayer before God.</hi> Moreover.</p>
               <p>This duty is enforced by the plain poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the word, often repeated, from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof no ſort of men can pretend exemption. Such as Pſal. lxii. 8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times, ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, pour out your heart before him.</hi> Iſai. lv. 6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him, while he is near.</hi> Luk. xviii. 1. <hi>He ſpake a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray and not to faint.</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 8. <hi>I will that men pray every where,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe &amp; the like commands which often occur in ſcripture, enjoin the duty upon men indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, without determining whether they be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or unregenerate, and are of equal extent with the law of nature obliging every man to pray. Again,</p>
               <p>There are many gracious promiſes God has made to prayer, which are deſign'd for the encouragement of ſuch ſinners, and do therefore greatly inforce their obligations thereunto; ſuch as Prov. viii. 17. <hi>They that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Mat. vii. 7, 8 <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. every one, whoſoever he be, that makes a buſineſs of ſerious importunate prayer, ſhall undoubtedly find acceptance and ſucceſs in his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Iſai. xlv. 19. <hi>I ſaid not to the ſeed of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain.</hi> And many others of the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003886_0036_100267C226D29940"/>which ſhould encourage and perſwade all men, even the vileſt ſinners to the practice of this duty; ſo that their intereſt invites them, &amp; their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities ſhould drive them to their prayers. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider again, that the natural ſtate of fallen man is a ſtate of extream indigence: he is <hi>wretched, miſerae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, poor, blind and naked,</hi> Rev. iii. 17. which calls aloud upon him to apply himſelf to the mercy of God by earneſt prayer for relief. Who of all the living do more need divine mercy and ſuccour than unregenerate ſinners? ſo that their being ſinners, and unregenerate, is ſo far from excuſing them from prayer, as a duty they are unfit for, that it ſhews them the greater need they have to pray, to confeſs their iniquities, &amp; beg pardon of their offended Lord, and his grace and mercy to heal the maladies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the neceſſities of their poor periſhing ſouls. And let me add,</p>
               <p>That God's affording to ſinners a day of grace, and a ſeaſon of trial in this world, for their eternal ſtate, confirms their obligations to this duty, and ſhould quicken them to the ſpeedy and ſerious practice of it. Thro' the riches of God's goodneſs and for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they are ſtill in the land of hope, in a ſtate of trial, and expectation; their final condition is not yet determined, God hath not yet paſs'd a ſentence of rejection upon them, he doth not yet ſay unto them, <hi>tho' you cry unto me, I will not hear,</hi> ſuch a ſentence he will paſs upon men, when he comes to deal with them in wrath, and to execute judgment without mercy<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. <hi>i. 28.</hi> Mic. <hi>iv. 3.</hi>
                  </note>. And this is the condition of thoſe poor ſinners that are gone to their everlaſting ſtate, tho' they cry never ſo earneſtly for mercy, it will be all in vain, when their ſtate of trial is over, and their opportunities of grace at an end, the bowels of God's
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003886_0037_10020BAF245FDBF0"/>compaſſions will be for ever ſhut up againſt them. Many will at laſt cry with the greateſt vehemence and importunity, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> when it will be too late to prevail by their moſt importunate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, the <hi>door</hi> of mercy being <hi>ſhut</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 10, 11, 12.</note>. But it is not ſo with ſinners in this time of trial and hope that God has mercifully afforded them in this world; the door of mercy is now open to the greateſt ſinners, eſpecially to thoſe that enjoy the goſpel, and means of grace; they have the greateſt encouragement that can be deſired to ſeek God; he is near to them in the offers of his grace, and the ſtrivings of his Spirit, it is now a time when he may be found by humble, and diligent ſeekers. God reveals himſelf to them on a mercy ſeat, and the way to <hi>the throne of grace</hi> is open to them by the mediation of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who is ready to befriend them by his agency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion with the Father. They have <hi>now an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time,</hi> and day of ſalvation<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 2</note>; and their penitent ſupplications may find acceptance with the God of mercy, as God <hi>heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. From all which conſiderations it appears, that ſinners in a ſtate of unregeneracy are under the plaineſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to pray to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object</hi> But it is ſaid, <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb xi 6 And that <hi>the ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. xv. 8. therefore ſome may be ready to think that it is better to forbear a duty, than to contract new guilt by the performance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> It is granted, that faith towards God, and the Mediator, is certainly neceſſary to our pleaſing God in duties of worſhip, eſpecially in prayer: and that the unregenerate not having a juſtifying faith
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003886_0038_100267C3B35459B0"/>
                  <hi>cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. viii. 8. And further, it is true that ſuch ſinners as go on wilfully in a courſe of tranſgreſſion, and rebellion againſt God, can't be tho't to pray acceptably, yea their prayers are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him; for <hi>be that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer ſhall be abomination,</hi> Prov xxviii. 9. But what does all this infer, but that whilſt men content themſelves in an unregenerate ſtate, and live ſecurely in ſin, and think by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſervices and duties of worſhip, to atone for their moral tranſgreſſions, they are the objects of God's diſpleaſure, and the more ſo for their hypocriſy, and diſſimulation in their prayers and devotions. And this, ſurely, is a very dangerous ſtate not to be reſted in ſecurely. But for a more direct anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in a word or two,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) If unregenerate ſinners are bound to pray by the law of nature, and the expreſs commands of God's word, as has been prov'd, it is unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that their want of fit qualifications ſhould make void their obligations thereunto; for then it would follow, that the profaneſt ſinners would be chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with no guilt, for their ungodly neglects of the plaineſt duties of God's worſhip, as being under no obligation to them for want of ſuitable qualifications; which is an open abſurdity; yea, this very defect is their ſin and fault, for what is it that may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to render ſinners unqualified, or unmeet for the duty of prayer? not meerly their being ſinners; for the greateſt ſinners praying to God in an humble, penitent, broken hearted manner, ſhall, without doubt, find acceptance with him: but their being wilful reſolved ſinners, ſecurely perſiſting in ſin, which is rather an aggravation of their guilt than any excuſe for their omiſſion of God's worſhip.</p>
               <p>Therefore,</p>

(2) It is equally their duty to <hi>repent, believe,</hi> and <hi>pray;</hi> as the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> directs <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act. viii. 22. <hi>Repent of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God,</hi> &amp;c. When ſinners, therefore, are called upon to pray, it is not meant that they ſhould pray without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and faith towards the mediator, but theſe graces are to be exerciſed in prayer, we muſt exerciſe repentance in humiliation, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin, and faith in our ſupplications for mercy in the name of Chriſt, which ſuggeſts another argument whereby this duty is enfore'd. For if it be the duty of ſinners to repent and believe in Chriſt, as moſt certainly it is, then it is unqueſtionably their duty to pray, for theſe graces are to be acted in prayer, and every man that ſets himſelf to repent, or makes any offer towards it, will think it his duty to pray to God; 'tis one of the firſt and main duties in which his own conſcience will direct him to exerciſe repentance. And there is no incongruity in calling upon ſinners to exerciſe repentance and faith in their prayers to God for the grace of repentance, and converſion, becauſe the operations of divine grace are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be expected, than in concurrence with our beſt endeavours in the uſe of the means of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Tho' ſinners be not at preſent in a ſtate of juſtification and acceptance with God, though they have not as yet receiv'd the <hi>Spirit of adoption,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them to cry, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> yet it muſt be confeſs'd, that it is much better and ſafer for them to pray as well as they can, than wholly to neglect it. There is certainly a difference to be made between wicked men, or thoſe that are in an unregenerate ſtate, in reſpect of their prayers; and it may truly be ſaid, that the prayers of ſome ſinners are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the will of God, than thoſe of others. some pray only to cover their hypocriſy and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and get eſteem among people; as the phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who <hi>gave alms,</hi> and <hi>prayed, that they might be

Some pray in a formal manner, without any ſerious deſires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, meerly from a dictate of conſcience. Some pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for proviſion for their luſts; they <hi>ask amiſs, that</hi> they might <hi>conſume it upon their luſts,</hi> Jam. iv. 3. Some think by their prayers to make ſome compenſation for paſt miſcarriages, that they may run on a new ſcore; 'tis no wonder at all that ſuch prayers are an abomination to the holy God. But then it muſt be acknowleged, that there are ſome ſinners, who are put upon praying, and that in ſecret, by a ſenſe of their ſinful and wretched ſtate, and their need of a Saviour, and out of a ſerious concern for the welfare of their ſouls. And ſuppoſing that ſuch ſinners are not yet converted, yet there are hopeful ſymptoms upon them, and they are making progreſs towards converſion; and certainly it is much more pleaſing to God, for ſinners to pray as well as they are able, in a contrite ſenſe of their ſins and wants, and their caſe is more hopeful, than if they liv'd in the careleſs omiſſion of ſuch an important duty of worſhip and means of grace. Conſider therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">(4) Prayer is one of thoſe ordinances of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he conveys ſaving grace, and therefore to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by unregenerate perſons, no leſs than the hearing of the word, as being an appointed means of converſion; in the want of ſupernatural abilities, they muſt improve their natural faculties, &amp; continue lying at <hi>the pool of Betheſda,</hi> waiting on God in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances, for the quickning healing influences of his holy Spirit. You are directed to <hi>take with you words, and turn to the Lord, and ſay unto him, take away all iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Hoſ. xiv. 2. And in this way God may meet you, as he has met thouſands, with his gracious viſits, and ſpiritual bleſſings. But this leads me to the ſecond particular,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003886_0041_100267C8D4CE3F88"/>
2. That it is <hi>the great concern of unconverted ſinners to pray for converting grace.</hi> And having ſhew'd it to be their unqueſtionable duty to pray, that it is their great concern to pray for converting grace, requires no great labour or proof. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Converſion and repentance is the gift of God, and not in the ſinners own power without divine grace, as has been prov'd, and every ſuch giſt muſt be ask'd in prayer. Regenerating grace is a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>perfect gift</hi> that comes down from the <hi>Father of lights.</hi> Jam. i. 17, 18 <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights. Of his own will begat he us,</hi> &amp;c Therefore it is highly fitting, and reaſonable, that if any man lack this gift, he ſhould ask it of God, as verſe 5 <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom,</hi> or grace, <hi>let him ask of God, that giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th not, and it ſhall be given</hi> 'Tis fitting that the indigent ſinner ſhould expreſs his deſire and value of this gift; and that the donor of it ſhould be acknowleg'd, and the honour of his grace ſecur'd by humble and earneſt prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) God has promiſed the grace of regeneration and converſion. The firſt ſaving grace is matter of promiſe; it is exhibited to ſinners in ſuch promiſes as theſe, Deut. xxx. 6. <hi>The Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. xxxi. 33, 34. <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts — They ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. xxxvi. 26. <hi>A new heart will I give you,</hi> &amp;c. Now the promiſes are the rule &amp; warrant of our prayers. To pray for what God has promiſed to give is to ask according to his will, <hi>and this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, be heareth us,</hi> Joh v. 14. And the promiſes afford great encouragement to a ſinner's prayers, for hereby it appears not only that God can
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003886_0042_10020BB4CA3914A8"/>work converſion if he will, but alſo that he will do it for ſome, yea for many, and moſt probably for thoſe whoſe hearts are ſtirred up to ſeek unto him for it. And ſuch is the wretchedneſs of an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate, that a probability of obtaining ſo great a bleſſing ſhould excite all to pray for it.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Prayer is the means ſanctified, and appointed by God for the obtaining this gift. Among the many choice mercies promiſed to the church and people of God, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. the promiſe of giving <hi>a new heart,</hi> and ſpiritual bleſſings, is of principal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. yet the means which God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the accompliſhment of this his promiſed grace, is ſerious and earneſt prayer; as it follows, ver. 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</hi> So Luk. xi. 13 — <hi>How much more ſhall your heavenly father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> God can indeed work grace without our prayers, and he is ſometimes <hi>found of them that ſought him not</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> lxv.i.</note>, in a way of ſovereign preventing mercy: but tho' God has not ty'd himſelf to means, ſo as never to work without them, yet he has ſo ty'd us to them, as that we ſhould never expect any ſaving influences from above in the neglect of them, eſpecially to prayer, which is a ſelf abaſing, and ſoul-humbling duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and conductive to the honour of divine grace, and neceſſary to prepare us for the bleſſed effects of it.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) The calls of God to repentance and converſion are deſign'd to direct and quicken ſinners to ſeek his converting grace. God calls ſinners to do that which without his effectual grace they cannot do, as Ezek. xviii. 32 <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit:</hi> and yet it is his grace alone that muſt do this, which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003886_0043_100267CA55F34EF8"/>therefore he has promiſed, <hi>chap.</hi> xxxvi. 26. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, God's calls to ſinners to turn, and make them a new heart, are not uſeleſs and in vain, tho' they labour under a moral impotency to obey theſe commands; but they are deſign'd to ſet them about their duty, with all ſeriouſneſs, which is the moſt effectual means of beating down all carnal conceits of their own ſufficiency, which they are prone to indulge, that being ſenſibly convinc'd of their own impotency, they might humbly implore the grace of God to work that in them which he requires of them. A man confined to a ſick bed, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſometimes imagine that he can get up, &amp; walk, as at other times; but the leaſt attempt ſoon makes him ſenſible of his impotence. So ſinners may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they can break off their ſins by repentance, and turn to God when they pleaſe, and can ſcarce believe a neceſſity of the almighty power and grace of God to work a change in their hearts in order thereunto, but when they make the attempt in good earneſt, and ſet themſelves ſeriouſly about the work of repentance, in renouncing carnal habits, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling their ſouls unto obedience to the will of God, they ſoon begin to feel their own weakneſs, and need of the ſuccours of divine grace, to carry them thro' a courſe of repentance, in humiliation for, and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſin, and in recovering them to and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing them in a new and holy courſe of life; a ſenſe whereof naturally and neceſſarily leads them to their prayers, &amp; engages them to ſeek God by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and earneſt ſupplications for the promiſed aids and influences of his grace and Spirit. So that as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are deſign'd to encourage their compliance with the commands, ſo the calls and commands of the word are deſign'd to drive them to the promiſes, to ſeek by prayer the grace promiſed, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their effectual recovery from ſin to holineſs.</p>
               <p n="5">

(5) If ſinners are obliged to pray for any thing, they have the greateſt reaſon in the world to pray for converting grace. This is of greater neceſſity and importance to their happineſs, than all temporal bleſſings, than health, wealth, liberty, peace, or even than their daily bread: theſe things ſerve only to the comfort and convenience of this preſent mortal life, and afford no relief to the ſoul againſt its greateſt neceſſities, and miſeries, but the renewing &amp; healing grace of God is neceſſary to the life and well being of the immortal ſoul. Yea, in ſome ſenſe they have more need to pray for converting grace, than for the remiſſion of their ſins; for though this ought to be ask'd of God in prayer, yet without converſion there is no poſſibility of obtaining it, repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins being inſeparably connected in the goſpel covenant But if we obtain converting grace, we are aſſured of the forgiveneſs of ſins, and of all the privileges of mercy, by the certain promiſe of God. Iſai lv. 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, — and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And if God gives repentance, he will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſtow remiſſion of ſins: for he <hi>hath exalted</hi> his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>with his right hand, to be a prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins,</hi> Act. v. 31. Thus you ſee how much it is the concern of the unconverted to pray for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace.</p>
               <p>Now then, let all unconverted ones, and all thoſe that have juſt grounds to fear that they are yet in their ſins, and ſtrangers to the new birth, ſuffer the word of exhortation to prevail with them.</p>
               <p>Be excited in a ſenſe of duty and intereſt, to put forth endeavours, and cry mightily to the God of all grace for his effectual renewing, quick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning, heart-changing grace, which is neceſſary to your turning
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003886_0045_100267CCEA7F74A0"/>from ſin, and living to God; beg of him to give you repentance (as well as forgiveneſs of ſins) by the operation of his Spirit, &amp; thro' the merit of his Son's blood. To that end,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Think often and ſeriouſly, of the miſeries of your condition whilſt unconverted; <hi>the wrath</hi> and curſe <hi>of God abideth</hi> on you<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 36.</note>: and without conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is no pardon, no peace with God, no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, no poſſibility of eſcaping the perdition of hell. Chriſt has told you once, and again, Luk. xiii. 3, 5. <hi>That except ye repent, ye ſhall periſh:</hi> and without the effectual grace of God, you never will repent, or be converted. The <hi>carnal mind,</hi> and will, <hi>is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God,</hi> oppoſite to all holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 7. and will for ever continue ſo, unleſs divine grace work a change in the byaſs and inclination of your ſouls. As it is ſaid, <hi>through</hi> faith ye are ſaved<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8.</note>, ſo thro' converſion ye are ſaved, and <hi>that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Let ſuch thoughts as theſe dwell on your minds day and night, when you riſe up and when you lie down, to quicken your importunities at the throne of grace, for divine mercy and grace in Chriſt to ſuccour the preſſing neceſſities of your ſouls. And conſider further,</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the preſent accepted time be neglected, you will cry in vain when it will be too late. They that turn their back upon God all their days, yet <hi>in the time of their trouble, they will ſay, ariſe, and ſave us,</hi> Jer. ii. 27. In a time of diſtreſs or ſickneſs, or under the near approach of death, ſinners will cry to God for mercy, if their conſciences be not fearfully ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; a ſenſe of their neceſſities will urge &amp; conſtrain them to it; which ſhews, that it is meer ſecurity and obſtinacy, that they do not <hi>now</hi> pray as well as when
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003886_0046_100267CE8E9B7C98"/>diſtreſs cometh, that they do not <hi>now</hi> lay to heart their ſpiritual neceſſities, and ſtir up themſelves to ſeek God, <hi>while he may be found</hi> a prayer hearing God: and for the neglect hereof, God threatens that they ſhall cry and not be heard. Prov. i. 24,—28. <hi>Becauſe I have called</hi> (viz. verſe 23. <hi>Turn thou at my reproof) and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand</hi> in the offers and promiſes of grace (ſuch as, <hi>behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you,</hi> ver. 23.) <hi>and no man regarded</hi> &amp;c. then it follows, <hi>I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh, — then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me.</hi> Again conſider,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you periſh without the grace of God, it will evidently appear that your deſtruction is of your ſelves. Tho' you cannot ſave yourſelves, nor in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto recover yourſelves out of your miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degeneracy by a true repentance without the efficacious working of divine grace; yet ſince God offers you this grace, and is ready to confer it, and waits but for your humble and earneſt ſeeking for it. Mat. vii. 7, 8. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> Which words of our Saviour imply, that none that ever ſet themſelves in good earneſt to ſeek the grace of God, and continued importunate, at the door of mercy, have been rejected, but have obtained their ſuit; for <hi>every one that asketh, receiveth:</hi> ſince, I ſay, this grace is to be had for asking by importunate prayer, if you will not be perſwaded to do thus much, you muſt needs inexcuſably periſh; it will appear that God has done for you all that becomes him, as a wiſe and gracious ruler to do for his worthleſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted creatures, to prevent their being loſt for ever; and the blame of your perdition will lie wholly at your own door; becauſe you deſpiſed the grace of
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003886_0047_10020BB9AF98A1A0"/>God, whilſt it might have been obtained, not eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it worth asking; how juſtly may Chriſt then upbraid you with your folly, in your contempt and refuſal of his grace, as the cauſe of your eternal. ruin, <hi>You would not come unto me, that you might have life,</hi> Joh. v. 40.</p>
               <p>How ſad is it, ſinner, (if thou believeſt theſe things) that the conſideration of the miſery and danger of a ſinful ſtate, will not preſs out one ſigh or groan from thy heart, or excite thee to offer up one cry, to breath out one fervent deſire to the <hi>Father of mercies</hi> (who alone is ready and able to pity and help thee) from one week, or month, or year, to another? and how much more lamentable is thy caſe, the leſs it is lamented by thee?</p>
               <p>But if by theſe conſiderations, I might prevail with any to engage in the ſerious practice of the duty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to; let me proceed to counſel and direct you in a few words,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider well what it is you muſt aim at in your prayers and endeavours after converſion. I have endeavoured by ſome brief hints, to obviate your miſtakes about converſion. If you imagine, that no more is intended in it than a forſaking ſome ſinful cuſtoms, or refraining from groſs ſcandals, or leading a life viſibly blameleſs in the eyes of men, or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſors, or putting on a form of godlineſs, and keeping up a courſe of external religious duties (all which a meer hypocrite may do (to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) as well as a true ſaint) you will ſcarce ſee any need of the phyſician of ſouls, or any need of the healing grace of God, or of earneſt ſupplications for that grace to repair the diſtemper'd frame of your ſouls. But you muſt know, that converſion conſiſts in the recovery of your ſouls to the life of God, from which you are naturally eſtranged; your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003886_0048_100267D207BE5C60"/>and judgments muſt be renewed unto a thorow conviction of the evil of ſin, and of the vanity of the world, and the inſufficiency of all its enjoyments, of all the pleaſures, profits, and honours of it to relieve you againſt your greateſt miſeries, or to make you truly happy; and of your abſolute need of Chriſt, and of his ſuperlative worth, and excellency, and ſufficiency to anſwer all your ſpiritual neceſſities and diſires; the bent of your wills muſt be turned to chooſe and love God in Chriſt as your chief good, in oppoſition to the world, and the idols of it; the prevailing aim of your lives both in duties of worſhip, and in common converſation, muſt be to pleaſe God, by approving your hearts to him, in a ſtrict courſe of obedience and ſpiritual devotion to him; your affections muſt be diſplac'd, taken off from things on earth, and ſet on the things above. In a word, the image of Chriſt muſt be formed in the heart, and the whole ſoul muſt be endow'd with ſuch a ſpiritual, divine temper, as may qualify it for complacential converſes with God, and render it meet to ſee and enjoy him in heaven. Nothing ſhort of this muſt be your aim, when you ſet yourſelves to pray for the grace of God to renew and convert you, for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting whereof you will ſee a neceſſity of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt importunity in your addreſſes to the throne of grace, for the heavenly influences of the divine Spirit. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt pray <hi>with deep humiliation</hi> in a ſenſe of the miſeries of your carnal natures 'Tis a requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite of acceptable prayer, that a man ſhould <hi>know the plague of his own heart,</hi> 1 King. viii. 38 This <hi>plague of the heart,</hi> is the corruption and depravity of the degenerate ſoul of man, which admits of various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, according to the different reſpects in which it ſtands in oppoſition to the bleſſed God; (for the averſion of the heart from God, and its oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, is the great diſeaſe of all humane ſouls,

Till a man comes to know, and have ſome experience of the <hi>plague of his own heart</hi> all his prayers will be flat and cold, and undertaken but for form ſake: but when he once begins to feel his diſeaſe, and to have a true ſenſe of this heart plague, then the ſpiritual phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician

               <p n="4">4. You muſt pray with earneſtneſs and conſtancy. Be very importunate at the throne of grace; the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of your ſouls, require the greateſt earneſtneſs and vigour in your ſupplications, beg as for your lives, that God would give you the ſaving grace of his holy Spirit. It may be you will ſay, I have often prayed to this purpoſe, but ſtill I find my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts as ſtrong as ever, and my heart as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſubdued to the will of God as before. But it may be thus only in your own ſenſe, and apprehenſion, and you may perhaps be more ſenſible of the power of ſin and corruption than before, which is often the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003886_0053_100267D9AE9523F0"/>caſe of ſinners under a work of illumination. But if this be really the caſe, the true reaſon may be becauſe you do not ſtir up yourſelves to earneſtneſs in prayer, but perform the duty in a formal heartleſs manner, rather from a dictate of conſcience, that you ought not to leave it undone, than from the inward ſenſe of your minds and deſire of your ſouls in a ſenſe of indigence &amp; want. If therefore you would ſucceed in your ſupplications, ſtir up warm &amp; earneſt deſires towards God, wreſtle thro' diſcouragements, ſay with <hi>Jacob, I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me</hi>

Our Saviour has, in ſeveral parables, recommended and encouraged importunity in prayer; particularly Luk. xi. 5, — 9. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, which of you ſhall have a friend, and ſhall go unto him at midnight, and ſay unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; for a friend of mine in his journey is come unto me, and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſet before him: and he from within ſhall anſwer and ſay, Trouble me not, the door is now ſhut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot riſe &amp; give thee. I ſay unto you, tho' he will not riſe and give him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is his friend; yet becauſe of his importunity, he will riſe and give him as many as he needeth</hi> The ſcope and deſign of which parable, is declared in the words immediately ſubjoin'd; <hi>and I ſay unto you, ask, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> And the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bleſſing he directs us there to ask, is the gift of <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> ver. 13. the author of all ſaving grace. The parable is not ſo to be underſtood, as if the bleſſed God needed our importunity, or was moved by it (as men are) to do that which he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do otherwiſe; but it is deſign'd to ſhew the ſucceſs of importunity in our prayers, and its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing efficacy for the obtaining mercy from God,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003886_0054_10020BC22695D690"/>not by making him more willing to give, but by making our own hearts more fit and prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the bleſſing ask'd.</p>
               <p>Again, you muſt be frequent &amp; conſtant in prayer. It is not ſufficient once, or twice, in a pang of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make a fervent prayer for grace, but you muſt <hi>continue in prayer</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let your prayers for converting grace be followed with anſwerable endeavours in the work of converſion. This direction indeed would be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, if ſinners might be perſwaded to be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately deſirous of their own converſion; for is it poſſible to deſire any thing very earneſtly, and to ſit ſtill without ſuitable endeavours? if it be not ſo in temporal concerns, it is a deluſion if we imagine it will be of any more force in the matters of our ſouls. In praying to God for his grace to turn you from ſin to holineſs, you admoniſh yourſelves of what muſt be your aim and endeavour in the courſe of your lives. If you revert to your former looſe vain behaviour, you do in effect deny, and retract your own prayers: and can you then think, that God will have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them? Tho' you cannot turn yourſelves, without the ſpecial grace of God, yet he expects, that you ſhould <hi>frame your doing to turn</hi> to him<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. <hi>v. 4.</hi>

And for our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ask the holy Spirit, our Saviour, that he might root out of our minds, thoſe unworthy conceits we are apt to entertain of the bleſſed God, as if he were hardly drawn, or with great difficulty prevailed with, to beſtow his gifts of ſpecial grace, has aſſured us that he is much more wiſe, and kind, ready and willing, to give his holy Spirit to humble importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſeekers, than earthly parents are to give good gifts unto their children. Luk xi 11, 13. <hi>If a ſon ſhall ask bread of any of you, who is a father, will he give him a ſtone?</hi> No ſurely, he muſt have an heart of ſtone indeed, who will deny his child bread, when he needs it, and asks it,— <hi>if ye then, being evil</hi> (as the beſt parents are in compariſon with God, who only is

He has all the virtues and perfections of creatures, in himſelf, in a ſuper-eminent manner; ſo here, he that has put ſo much compaſſion into the heart of a father, ſhall not he have the compaſſions of a father, infinitely, and tranſcendently in himſelf? He hath infinite wiſdom to chuſe what is beſt for us, and infinite goodneſs to beſtow it on all that ask him, and that is his holy Spirit, which is comprehenſive of all good things; (compare <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 11) thus ready and willing is God as a Father, to give the grace of his holy Spirit, which is neceſſary to converſion and ſanctification, to poor, humble, importunate ſupplicants.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, if I were a child of God, I could take more encouragement from his fatherly love and compaſſions, but I am a ſinner, and an enemy.</p>
               <p>But does not this argue, that you have ſo much the more need of his Spirit to renew, and heal, and ſanctify you for his ſervice? You are a ſinner, but you deſire to be a repenting, returning ſinner; an enemy, but you deſire to become a willing ſubject; and are you not ſenſible of your want of his Spirit? and hath God excluded any ſenſible ſinner from this encouragement to ask, which is grounded on his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal goodneſs &amp; pity?

               <p n="2">(2) From the conſideration of <hi>the creating power</hi> of God.

Tho' we ſee nothing but ruin and diſorder in our ſouls, blindneſs in the underſtanding, obſtinacy in the will, rebellion in the affections and appetites, againſt the dictates of conſcience, yet deſpair not of a reparation, the creating power of God, to which all things are poſſible, is a great ſupport to faith in prayer. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God,</hi> Pſal li. 10. The God whom we pray to is able to create, to bring order out of confuſion, beauty out of deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, light out of darkneſs, and to rear up to himſelf living temples out of the ruins of man's apoſtacy: what we cannot do for ourſelves, and what no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can do for us, that God can do; for nothing is too hard for creating power.</p>

(3) From the conſideration of <hi>the creating goodneſs</hi> of God. <hi>For his good pleaſure all things are, and were created,</hi> Rev. iv. 11.

And why ſhould all theſe motives and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments loſe their efficacy upon you? Remember, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that it is a limited time, and but of a ſhort du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the golden ſceptre is extended, that God offers his grace and mercy to you, which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by your importunate intreaties at tho throne of grace: and is this ſeaſon to be trifled away in ſecurity and indolence? If you neglect this day of your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, thro' remiſsneſs and ſloth, it may be over before you are aware; and then how wretched and deſperate will your condition be to eternity?

Such a plea from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted ſinner, is very agreable to the will of God, and muſt needs be of great force and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with him. Partly,</p>
               <p n="2">(2) As it argues <hi>a good temper of mind, and a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition pleaſing to God to improve a covenant intereſt in him, as a plea for ſpecial grace.</hi> It may indeed, be pleaded by believers, for all kinds of mercies, even
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:003886_0079_100267FFA4658140"/>temporal mercies. <hi>Jacob</hi> improves it as a ground of truſt in God, for <hi>bread to eat,</hi> and <hi>raiment to put on,</hi> and providential protection<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxviii <hi>20, 21.</hi>
                  </note>. But to make choice of and prefer renewing grace above all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of covenant mercies, is no ſmall ſymptom of a gracious diſpoſition, which he that <hi>will not break a bruiſed reed,</hi> nor <hi>quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> will not deſpiſe, becauſe it is the work of his own grace: and when God has put ſuch a tho't and deſire into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's heart, it may reaſonably be hop'd, that it ſhall not be without ſucceſs. We know how <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in that prayer, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> i. God puts it to his choice to ask what he would, ver. 7. — <hi>Ask what I ſhall give thee,</hi> Solomon's requeſt is, ver. 10. <hi>Give me now wiſdom, and knowlege, that I may go out and come in before this people;</hi> and how pleaſing this requeſt was to God, appears from the anſwer given to it, ver. 11, 12. <hi>God ſaid to Solomon, Becauſe this was in thine heart, and thou haſt not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet haſt asked long life, but haſt asked wiſdom and knowlege for thy ſelf, that thou mayeſt judge my people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is granted unto thee, and I will give thee riches and wealth, and honour, ſuch as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither ſhall there any after thee have the like.</hi> Thus, thoſe that <hi>ſeek fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe the glory of God is more nearly intereſted in this petition and plea;</hi> more than in praying for the pardon of ſin: for pardon of ſin more immediately reſpects the ſinner's ſecurity and comfort, which he may deſire from ſelf-love; but grace to ſerve God, is more immediately conducive to his glory Now as Chriſt has taught us to make this our firſt &amp; principal
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:003886_0080_10020BE3F0B4C7D0"/>petition, <hi>thy name be hallowed,</hi> or glorified, ſo the more nearly the glory of God's name is concern'd in any petition that we offer up to him, the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it is to him, &amp; the more hope of ſpeeding. And it is eſpecially for the glory of God in the eyes of the world, that thoſe to whom he ſtands in viſible rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be an holy people, as his name is more diſhonour'd by the unholineſs of their lives, than by the ſins of others; for he will <hi>be ſanctified in all them that come nigh him,</hi> Lev. x 3. And as God makes this an argument with himſelf in promiſing ſanctifying grace to his people. Ezek. xxxvi. 22, 23. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I do not this for your ſakes, O houſe of Iſrael, but for my holy Names ſake, which ye have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned among the heathen. — And I will ſanctify my great Name, which was prophaned among the heathen, which ye have prophaned in the midſt of them,</hi> &amp;c. So it may be pleaded to good purpoſe, by the children of God's people, in prayer for converting ſanctifying grace; <hi>Not for my ſake Lord,</hi> tho' thou ſhouldeſt have no regard to ſuch an unworthy worm as I am, but (ſince thou haſt taken me into ſo near a relation to thyſelf) <hi>for thy holy Names ſake,</hi> for the glory of thy great Name (which will be more <hi>polluted</hi> and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by my ſins, than by the ſins of others who are aliens and ſtrangers) I beg the promiſed gift of thy grace, to make me holy, and to enable me to walk anſwerably to my covenant relation to thee, and that thou may'ſt be <hi>ſanctified</hi> in me, <hi>in the eyes</hi> of men. And what is this but to pray that God's name may be glorified?</p>
               <p>'Tis confeſs'd that the ſpirit of this plea (as it has been open'd in theſe particulars) can proceed only from a gracious heart, which has been impreſs'd by the Spirit of God, with a diſpoſition and tendency towards its divine original: but it ſhall ſuffice to have ſhewed the native import of it rightly managed, and how prevalent with God, and what abundant encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:003886_0081_1002680152D676C8"/>it affords the children of the covenant in praying for the grace of repentance, and converſion. Now then, let it be briefly applied,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) In a word of exhortation <hi>to parents in covenant with God, to pray for their unconverted children.</hi> In your ſupplications at the throne of grace for your own ſouls, you muſt bear upon your heart the caſe of your children's ſouls, and be earneſt in prayer, as for other mercies which they need, ſo more eſpecially &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the ſaving grace of the covenant, that their ſouls may be cured of their corrupt byaſs, that they may be principled with the fear of God betimes, that they may be made wiſe, and virtuous, and holy; that <hi>good things</hi> may be <hi>found in them towards the God of Iſrael;</hi> that being begotten again by the Spirit, they may be inſtated in the bleſſings of God's family, and that whether they live a longer or ſhorter time, in health or ſickneſs, in proſperity or adverſity in this world, they may be made heirs of life &amp; immortality, and live in God's favour, and in his preſence for ever hereafter. It is unqueſtionably the duty of all parents thus to pray for their children eſpecially of thoſe that are in covenant with God, in imitation of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the father of the faithful, Gen. xvii 18. <hi>O that Iſhrael might live before thee!</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. xxix. 19. <hi>Give unto Solomon my ſon a perfect heart to keep thy commandments —.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you muſt expreſs and exerciſe ſaith in God's promiſe, <hi>I will be the God of thy ſeed;</hi> and plead the ſame argument that is here put into their mouths, Lord, thou art the God of my children by external covenant, and haſt encouraged me therefore to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to thee, and they are thine not only by creation, but by baptiſmal dedication: O take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them for thy ſelf, betimes, by thine indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Spirit, <hi>turn them</hi> to thyſelf from ſin &amp; ſatan from the vanities of the world, and a vain converſation;
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:003886_0082_1002680409203E20"/>they are <hi>the children of the covenant,</hi> O <hi>ſend</hi> the Spirit of thy Son <hi>to bleſs them in turning them from their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> By ſaith plead the promiſes God has made to the ſeed of his people, the promiſe of <hi>circumciſing</hi> their hearts, of <hi>pouring his Spirit</hi> and <hi>bleſſing</hi> upon them, and of their being <hi>taught of the Lord.</hi> Iſai. liv. 13. <hi>Remember thy word</hi> of promiſe, <hi>and eſtabliſh it</hi> unto my children, <hi>on which thou haſt cauſed me to hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you muſt expreſs your value of this bleſſing. For God to <hi>be the God</hi> of your children, is a far greater privilege, than to have all the riches, wealth, and honours of the world heap'd upon them: and he will then be their God according to the full intention, and utmoſt extent of his covenant love: when he gives them his Spirit to regenerate, and ſanctify them to himſelf. O then, put in for a ſhare in this privilege, on the behalf of your children, by your earneſt prayers for them, that whatever they want, they may not want the ſpecial bleſſings of the covenant, for therein is all their ſalvation, and all that is neceſſary &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to their happineſs in both worlds. Thus you muſt expreſs your tender affection to your children. When they labour under grievous bodily diſeaſes, you are full of compaſſion towards them, &amp; will ſeek to the phyſician for healing; and can you without concern, ſee them infected with ſpiritual diſtempers, the hereditary diſeaſe of a carnal nature derived by their natural birth from our firſt parents, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cure wrought by regenerating grace. will prove mortal to their ſouls? How many diſtreſſed parents came to our Saviour, when on earth, for the cure of their ſick and diſeaſed children, and prevailed; take encouragement hence, and ſhew your compaſſion to the ſouls of your children, by bringing them in the arms of your faith and prayer to the great phyſician; and beg the healing influences of his grace on their ſouls Every godly parent, next to the ſalvation of his own ſoul, will be moſt ſolicitous &amp; deſirous of the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:003886_0083_10020BE8C0E14FB0"/>converſion &amp; ſalvation of his childrens ſouls, which muſt be expreſs'd both by frequent inſtructions, counſels, and admonitions, and alſo by conſtant and fervent prayer with and for them: perhaps they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect praying for themſelves, how ſad would it be, if you alſo ſhould neglect praying for them!</p>
               <p>And let not thoſe parents that are exerciſed with ungracious wicked children (which has been the lot of many a godly parent) be therefore diſcouraged from praying for them; for how perverſe and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſoever they be, if God undertake to <hi>turn</hi> them they <hi>ſhall be turned.</hi> He that can of <hi>ſtones raiſe up children to Abraham,</hi> can eaſily by his grace ſoften and ſubdue the hardeſt heart, reduce the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and refractory, and work a cure on the moſt deſperately diſeaſed ſoul. Be encouraged then, to hope and pray for their converſion. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was a very vicious youth, for whom his godly mother <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> was often in tears and prayers: a certain pious Biſhop obſerving her weeping for her ſon, ſaid unto her, <hi>it cannot be that a ſon of thoſe tears ſhould periſh</hi>

Therefore hold on praying, though there ſhould be no more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement than that, <hi>Who can tell whether God will be gracious</hi> unto you, that your <hi>child may live</hi>

God is ready to give Himſelf, his Son, his Spirit and grace to ſuch as you, which you ſhould improve as a motive to ſeek him earneſtly &amp; diligently; and as a ground of faith and confidence in prayer. Bleſs God, therefore, for ſo diſtinguiſhing a favour, that you have <hi>a name</hi> and <hi>a place in his houſe,</hi> and are admitted into ſo near a relation to him; on which account, you may with good reaſon ſay, <hi>the lines are fallen to me in pleaſant places, yea I have a goodly heritage.</hi> Yet be caution'd againſt truſting in the privileges of your birth, and baptiſm; for tho' you are born of the moſt religious parents, and baptized in the church, yet you are alſo born in ſin and corruption as much as others, and <hi>are by nature children of wrath even as others:</hi> the natures you derived from your firſt birth, being as carnal, and as deeply polluted as thoſe of others; and the ſins of your lives being againſt greater mercies and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than the ſins of others, will expoſe you to a ſorer condemnation.

See alſo a neceſſity of the grace of God to work this change in you, and of earneſt ſupplication for that grace, whereunto you are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the covenant offers, and promiſes of grace, ſealed to you in your baptiſm, the obligations &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges whereof you ſhould ſeriouſly &amp; well conſider.</p>
               <p>And if theſe conſiderations have been effectual to work any convictions on your minds, delay not the proſecution of them, but take the firſt opportunity in ſome convenient retirement, to pour out your hearts before God in the language of repenting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and fall down on your knees, and ſay, in words to
