            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE enſuing epiſtolary poems contain a deſcription rather of paſſions than of incidents. They reſulted from an idea of it being poſſible to unite the impaſſion'd fondneſs of <hi>POPE'S</hi> ELOISA, with the chaſter tenderneſs of <hi>PRIOR'S</hi> EMMA; avoiding the voluptuouſneſs of the firſt, and the too conceding ſoftneſs of the ſecond. It is hoped the Reader will diſtinguiſh between the apprehended poſſibility of exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in verſe a more faultleſs female Character than the EL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OISA of <hi>POPE,</hi> or the EMMA of <hi>PRIOR,</hi> and the raſh and vain deſign of equalling, much leſs of ſurpaſſing the tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poetic excellence of either of thoſe Compoſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE</hi> LOUISA of the following pages has all that enthuſiaſm which ſprings from an heart warmly affectionate, joined to a glowing and pictureſque imagination. Her ſenſibilities, heightened, and refined in the boſom of Retirement, know no bounds, except thoſe which the dignity of conſcious Worth, and a ſtrong ſenſe of Religion preſcribe. It is feared the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern young Ladies will have little ſympathy with her, ſince ſhe is unfaſhionably enthuſiaſtic, and unfaſhionably tender.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AN</hi> ingenious Friend, after reading the firſt epiſtle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that LOUISA might have deſcribed with more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting particularity her Lover's declaration of his paſſion, and the manner in which ſhe received that declaration; but the Author thought the preſent method of conveying that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the mind of the Reader more poetic. <hi>POPE'S</hi> ELO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ISA is minute in her deſcription of the awful Scenery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the rocks, the ſtreams, and mountains, of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clete,
<pb facs="unknown:022137_0004_0FB6CB460BA28BD0"/>
but by no means minute concerning the amorous eclair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſement between herſelf and Abelard. LOUISA diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates her Lover's early attentions to her, tho' ſhe leaves the manner of his declaring their ſource very much to the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Her application of the beautiful ſcenic objects, by which ſhe was at that interval ſurrounded, to her own, and to her Lover's ſituation; and the poſſing ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to their preſent altered appearance, contraſts the charms, and bloom of the firſt, with the chill drearneſs of the ſecond. There it was that the Author had in view that ſtriking letter in the 3d Vol. of the Nouvelle-Heloiſe, which deſcribes St. Preaux accompanying Mrs. Wolmar to the rocks of Meillerie, then covered with the richneſs of Summer-luxuriance; and painting to her the ſituation of that very Scene, when he had viſited it alone, amidſt the horrors of Winter, and found thoſe horrors congenial to the temper of his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS</hi> Poem has little chance to be popular. A feeling Heart, and a fondneſs for Verſe muſt <hi>unite</hi> to render it inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting. A feeling Heart without a glowing Imagination will be tired of the Landſcape-painting, ſomewhat luxuriantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed. An Imagination that glows, while the Heart is frozen, has a propenſity to fancy every thing proſaic which is not imagery, and will probably yawn over the reaſoning of theſe Lovers, and ſicken over their tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IF,</hi> however, this little Work has the honor to intereſt and pleaſe the Few, in whom the kind and ſweet affections are
<pb facs="unknown:022137_0005_0FB6CB479B559AB8"/>
blended with poetic taſte, the end for which it is publiſhed will be obtained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>EXCEPT</hi> ſome ſlight alterations, which have been made ſince the two firſt Editions, the hundred and fifty ſix lines, with which the poem opens, were written when the Author was only nineteen. They had been miſlaid during a long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, It is ſixteen months ſince they were accidentally recovered. Some few Friends, to whom the Fragment was ſhewn, thought it worth being extended into a regular Work The firſt, and third of theſe epiſtles are deſigned to be deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and ſentimental; the ſecond, and laſt, dramatic.</p>

               <hi>NOTE,</hi> UPON reading this third Epiſtle to a Friend, he obſerved, that perhaps a compariſon of <hi>LOUISA's</hi> own ſituation with the harder fate of her Lover, and her tender pity for the inevitable miſeries of ſuch a union, might have been acceptable in the place of the epiſode of <hi>CLAIRMONT,</hi>

and the deſcription of the bower; but it ſhould be conſidered, that <hi>LOUISA</hi> wrote under the immediate impreſſion of her extacy to find <hi>EUGENIO</hi> guiltleſs; that her Mind was not ſober'd enough for reflection. To have inveſtigated the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy lot of her Lover muſt have been a melancholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Eaſed of an oppreſſive weight of miſery, her exhilarated ſpirits admit not, ſo early, any painful ideas. She does not diſcriminate, ſhe felicitates her deſtiny. Her ſympathy in the fate of her Friends grows more lively—ſhe recollects the ſituation of <hi>CLAIRMONT</hi>—Joy is naturally loquacious, and ſhe is gratified in relating his ſtory to her <hi>EMMA.</hi> She awakens with new vivacity to the impreſſions of pleaſure, which her Mind was accuſtomed to receive from ſcenic objects. The propenſity to dwell on them prevailed even in the hours of her unhappineſs. It is an habit which compares and aſſimilates the ſmiling, or the gloomy views of Nature to the internal feelings, and is common to people of a lively imagination. In the exultation of her Heart to find her Lover yet eſtimable, <hi>LOUISA</hi> ſpeeds to the bower, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſ'd with his image. Its beauties ſtrike her more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly than ever, and in this frame of Mind ſhe naturally feels delight in painting them.</p>
