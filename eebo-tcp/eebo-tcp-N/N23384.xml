            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN the wild and barren country of Aberdeenſhire, within a league of the ſea-ſhore, and on the ſummit of a lofty hill, ſtood a gothic caſtle. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered walls that had for ages ſeverely felt the reſiſtleſs hand of time were here and there decayed and crumbling into duſt; the battlements which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030954_0006_0FEA08B8C7C61CC0"/>
ſeemed enveloped in the clouds, were all overgrown with ivy, and become the abode of the ill-favored and omin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feathered race. No vicinity, ſave a few ſtraggling cottages, the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the vaſſals; no ſound, but where the ocean in ſullen fury, laſhed the ſandy beach, and diſmal murmurs echoed thro' the rocks.</p>
               <p>This manſion, while the ſceptre of England was ſwayed by Henry the VIth, was the property of Sir James Wallace, a deſcendant of that illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous character, William Wallace, who choſe to encounter the perils and the frowns of war, rather than ſee his country become the ſpoil of a rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invader. Surely the eye that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſes thy fate, will not, cannot, refuſe the tribute of a tear to thy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance! Peace to thy hallowed ſhade; and may thy manly virtues meet with the reward above that was denied them here!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030954_0007_0FEA08BA7920A628"/>
The caſtle had been beſtowed on William as ſome ſmall recompence for the ſervices he had done his king and country, and had from that period con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his family.</p>
               <p>Sir James reſembled not his noble anceſtor; of a ſordid diſpoſition, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, cruel, and deſigning, his heart was a ſtranger to humanity or compaſſion. The ſmiling cherub Charity dared not approach his inhoſpitable roof; and the child of neceſſity, who at his portal craved a ſcrap of bread, was not only peremptorily refuſed, but if inſtigated by biting want to repeat the requeſt, was ſpurned from off the threſhold.</p>
               <p>The partner of his bed was a being every way oppoſite to himſelf: her ſuſceptible heart never felt greater ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction than in relieving the needy, reclaiming the abandoned, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the virtuous!</p>

Matilda, ſo ſhe was called, was daughter to the Lord Glencairn, a man who, but for one failing, was formed an ornament to ſociety. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was his darling paſſion, and the wiſh of aggrandizing, and enriching his family, wholly employed his thoughts.</p>
               <p>At the caſtle of this Baron, Sir James firſt ſaw lady Wallace, and aſked her of the Earl, who joyfully conſented to accept him as his ſon. Not ſo Matilda; the diſſimilarity of diſpoſition with which nature had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued herſelf, and Wallace, cauſed her juſtly to look with horror on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching nuptials. Nor was that the only reaſon; her gentle heart had long and faithfully been given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Alan Duntrone, of a noble, but unfortunate family, whoſe chief boaſt conſiſted of an illuſtrious deſcent, and an unſpotted reputation, was the object of her affection. He had, ſometime
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030954_0009_0FEA08C114B18BE0"/>
before embarked for France, to ſerve under the banners of the Gallic Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch; and had not been long upon the continent, ere the fatal news arrived that he had fallen covered with wounds and glory. But the heart of Matilda was too firmly attached ever to be withdrawn from her firſt and only love.</p>
               <p>Glencairn commanded his daughter on pain of denouncing a curſe upon her head, to become the wife of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. The timid and dutiful victim yielded to the rigor of her unnatural parent, and at the altar preſented her hand, and pledged thoſe vows which were in the poſſesſion of her loſt Alan.</p>
               <p>Alas! can the gaudy ſplendor of a court, the noiſy riot of a midnight banquet, or a profuſion of uſeleſs ore, inſure content? Erroneouſly too oft do parents judge, and while they fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatter themſelves they are enſuring
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030954_0010_0FEA08C36F269A38"/>
their offspring's happineſs, plunge them in laſting miſery!</p>
               <p>A ſhort time ſubſequent to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Lady Wallace, her father paid the great debt to nature, and on his death-bed declared the injuſtice he had done his child, implored her pardon, and cloſed his eyes for ever, in hopes of meeting more mercy above, than he had ſhewn his daughter here.</p>
               <p>The edge of her grief (for ſpite of the harſh treatment ſhe had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, ſhe tenderly loved her Father) was ſomewhat blunted by the birth of a female, whoſe helpleſs infancy arouſed her from the ſtupor into which ſhe had ſunk, and for whoſe ſake alone ſhe wiſhed to live.</p>
               <p>Fortune whoſe delight it is to ſport and trifle with the feelings of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, fully evinced her blindneſs, and diſregard of merit, in the fate of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda.</p>
               <p>

The barren habitation in the north ill ſuited with the libertine diſpoſition of Sir James, and his chief time was ſpent at Edinburgh, where in the buſtle of the Scotiſh Court, he forgot his ſuffering wife; immured in a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary caſtle, without a friend into whoſe breaſt ſhe could pour her ſorrows, and hope for conſolation. The ſtillneſs in which ſhe ſat and watched the slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of her little cherub, were uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſave by the diſtant roaring of the waves, and whiſtling of the wind, which howled diſcordant through the ancient pile, and were at intervals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the voice of the nightly ſcreech owl, melancholy inhabitant of the lofty battlements.</p>
               <p>Yet even this ſad conſolation ſhe was in a ſhort time deprived of. Her worthleſs lord had beſtowed his heart on a woman, in whoſe breaſt vice reigned as predominant as did virtue in that of his conſort; ſhe was the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow of an officer about the king's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030954_0012_0FE9FCDC59451DC0"/>
her birth was low, and the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted rank wherein ſhe had latterly ſhone, was inſufficient to irradicate the ſelfiſh ideas that were ingrafted by nature in her diſpoſition. The thought of ſuch a man as Wallace at her feet, at once flattered her vanity, and made that reſtleſs ambition, which had been long kindling in her boſom, burn with inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate fury. After a time ſpent in

                     <l>Lab'ring for her purpoſe,</l>
                  </q>
ſhe yielded to his deſires, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo, that he baniſhed his deſerving lady the caſtle, and ſubſtituted herſelf as miſtreſs. He, no leſs a dupe than villain, conſented, and inſtantly ſet out for Aberdeen, where on his arrival, he acquainted Matilda with the reaſon of his unlooked-for viſit; and farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her ſhe muſt then, it being night, depart, but that her infant ſhould remain behind.</p>

The feelings of a mind, ſuſceptible as her's, may be better imagined than deſcribed. On one ſide, her paſſions were torn by wounded pride, while on the other the ſofter ſenſes were rouſed by maternal affection.</p>
               <p>Recovering herſelf, however, ſhe yielded to neceſſity, ſnatched a parting kiſs from her darling babe, moiſtened its little face with tears, and left the Caſtle, attended only by Carrol, a creature of Sir James's, who had orders to convey her on board a veſſel that lay at the ſhore, from thence to proceed to Rouen, and lodge her in a convent, the abbeſs of which by bribes and promiſes, he had made his own.</p>
               <p>Carrol executed his commiſſion punctually, he delivered his truſt, with a ſtrict charge that a ſcrutinizing eye ſhould be kept upon her conduct; then returned, and rendered his maſter happy, by informing him "his loudeſt fears were huſhed."</p>

Jane (the daughter of Wallace) was thus, in the age of infancy, left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a friend who would inſtruct her inexperienced mind, and train her in the ſacred paths of virtue!</p>
               <p>A ſhort time previous to the exile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lady Wallace, her brother Archibald, who had ſucceeded the late Earl, his father, in the title and eſtates, ſuddenly diſappeared; nor were the moſt accurate enquiries able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the myſtery in which his fate was involved. Every ſearch proving abortive, Sir James ſent his truſty fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower Carrol to the Caſtle of Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn, with orders to bring his nephew Eldred, ſon to the aforementioned Archibald, to Edinburgh, as he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take upon himſelf the guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the young Baron.</p>
               <p>On his arrival, he reſided with Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, who, when he wrote to inform his infamous paramour of the ſteps he had taken in the north, requeſted her

               <p>ELDRED, the young Lord of Glencairn, who was about the age of Jane, was happy in ſuch a playmate; they let the hours glide by in pleaſure, and never did there appear a tedious one, but that on which they parted for the night.</p>
               <p>Thus did they beguile their time till Eldred attained his 18th year, and though reared by his uncle in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more ſuited to the abject ſtation of a ſervile lacquey, than the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of an illuſtrious houſe, he diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a diſpoſition replete with valour, and affability. To his inferiors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending

as the pliant reed to every puff of wind; but to thoſe who ſought to play upon his generous nature he reſembled the ſtubborn foreſt oak, that bids defiance to the jarring elements, and braves the fury of the winter's ſtorm.</p>
               <p>The youthful amuſements of Jane, and her couſin, had inſenſibly created a ſincere and ardent affection, which on their nearer approach to maturity, gained ſtrength; nothing ſeemed wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to complete their happineſs. Too tranſient is the bliſs of mortals, ſhallow is the cup of joy preſented to their lips, and ſcarce do they taſte the enticing beverage, ere the bitter dregs at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom deſtroy the flavor of the wiſhed for draught!</p>
               <p>Such was the caſe of our young lovers; fortune was about to turn her wheel, and hurl them from the ſpoke of felicity to agony intolerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030954_0018_0FEA07C99473A820"/>
Fame had blown the beauty of Jane to the remoteſt parts of Caledonia's land, and a powerful and wealthy Highland Chief, named Donald of the Iſles, (between whoſe father and Sir James had ſubſiſted a ſtrong friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) was induced by her voice to quit his paternal fields, and judge whether report had or had not exaggerated. With a numerous retinue of knights and retainers he arrived at the manſion of Wallace, and was welcomed there with pomp and affected hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>With impatience did he tarry for the minute that was to introduce him to the object who had cauſed his journey. But when he ſaw her he thought that had he been kept for ages in ſuſpenſe, this one interview would have amply repaid him. All day did he contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate her charms, and when the hour of darkneſs warned him to retire, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the tedious night that tore her from his ſight. Loſt were the luxuries of the banquet on him, nor could the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030954_0019_0FEA07CFABAB9C78"/>
draughts of wine he ſwallowed, waſh away the paſſion which had taken root on his heart. He retired not to reſt, but to deviſe the means by which he ſhould make her his own. At laſt he reſolved to aſk her of Sir James, but not till he had predetermined, in caſe he had met with a refuſal, force ſhould put him in poſſeſſion of what was denied to his intreaties.</p>
               <p>To a mind like his nothing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impracticable; of ſtrong paſſions, and unable to reſtrain them, 'tis not a matter of wonder he ſoon fixed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, nor could the moſt imminent danger, or oppoſition, have put him from his purpoſe. Of a bold and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial deportment, he had all that feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his countenance, which marks the Caledonians: brave to an exceſs, but artful to an equal degree, and would have waded through the blood of multitudes to accompliſh his deſires: Such was the character of Eldred's rival.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:030954_0020_0FEA07D619FBA068"/>
He preferred his courtſhip with ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſmiles, and ſpeeches formed by art and cunning; ſhe heard him at firſt with indifference, he perſiſted and was requitted with contempt. He then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his ſuit to the Baron, he boaſted of the high renown of his anceſtors, and the wide extent of his domain, he expatiated on the number of his vaſſals, and ſet forward the mutual advantages that would accrue from an alliance. Wallace liſtened to him with attention, while he recollected with diſguſt the attachment he had obſerved to ſubſiſt between Jane and Eldred. He ſought his daughter and commanded her to receive the addreſſes of his gueſt.</p>
               <p>In vain the aſtoniſhed maid lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wept, intreated; in vain ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated herſelf at the feet of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling father; in vain ſhe tore her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered locks, and ſmote her breaſt in anguiſh! Her ſupplications far from mitigating, added <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

purpoſe: he mingled curſes, and unkind reproaches, with his perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>"Alas! ſaid Jane, "Can Donald prize the conſtrained embraces of a heart that beats for another? Will ſighs and groans accord with the careſſes of a bridegroom? To Eldred my faith is given, never, never to be broken!"</p>
               <p>"By the Holy-rood! replied Sir James, "This obſtinacy irritates me; nor ſhall my wiſhes be fuſtrated by the idle pretenſions of a boy; pay therefore the regard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and deference due to my mandate, or woe upon thy head. Meantime, preparations ſhall be made for the ſolemnity. Mark my words, and ſee thou doſt obey them!"</p>
               <p>Then, with indignation burſting from his eye, he quitted the chamber, leaving his daughter in a ſtate of ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, till the entrance of Eldred awoke her from a trance, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, perceived the tears faſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030954_0022_0FEA07E1C8356CD8"/>
trickling down her lilly cheek, and with eager affection conjured her to make known the cauſe; which, when he knew, rage ſo ſhook his frame as to deprive him of articulation.</p>
               <p>After a pauſe, "Can heaven," he exclaimed, "ſuffer ſuch injuſtice? O Jane, if thy affection be ardent, as I flatter myſelf it is, you cannot refuſe the boon which thus on my knees I crave!"</p>
               <p>"Pronounce it," quoth Jane, "you know full well I can deny you naught."</p>
               <p>"Enchanting ſound!" cried the enraptured lover, "Oh! then, my best beloved, conſent to fly with me beyond the reach of ſuch parental cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; in ſome far diſtant private corner of the kingdom, let us obliterate the remembrance of your father's cruelty, and ſoothe the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The bare idea of ſuch a ſtep, at firſt made the timid ſoul of Jane recoil; to quit the Caſtle clandeſtinely, and with a man, how muſt, ſhe thought, her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation ſuffer!</p>
               <p>At length, however, theſe fears and ſcruples were over-ruled by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive eloquence of Eldred, and the conſcious purity of her own intentions.</p>
               <p>"Yet," ſaid Glencairn, "Can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to immure thoſe beauties in a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which heaven beſtowed to grace a court? Impoſſible!</p>
               <p>"Let not that thought diſturb you," returned his miſtreſs, "Contentment is the ſource of bliſs, the clay-built hovel will when you are preſent, appear a gorgeous palace, and the humble pallet, whereon I ſhall repoſe me, will yield a more refreſhing ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, than, robbed of thee, I ſhould find under the richeſt canopy.</p>

               <p>THE next conſideration was, how and when they ſhould effect their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape; it was determined to meet at midnight near a cavern that was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated at no great diſtance from the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and had formerly, in thoſe times when the Engliſh Edward was wont to invade his neighbors kingdom, been converted by the Scots into a priſon, wherein they caſt ſuch of the enemy as became their captives. It had not been uſed by the ſtate for near a century, and the key had ever remained in cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tody of the Wallaces.</p>
               <p>This ſpot was fixed upon as the leaſt liable to diſcovery, a vulgar notion hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prevailed among the peaſants that it was haunted; nay, they went ſo far
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030954_0026_0FEA07FD53265030"/>
as to aver they had heard frequent and melancholy noiſes iſſue from it. This ſuperſtition Sir James had ſtrenuouſly endeavored to ſuppreſs, ſwearing who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dared to propagate ſuch idle vague reports, ſhould pay for their credulity.</p>
               <p>Tediouſly, to the lovers, did the ſteeds of Phoebus go their daily courſe, and with impatience they watched their deſcent behind the weſtern hills. The chapel clock announcing the hour of twelve, Jane haſtened to the place of rendezvous, and Glencairn not being arrived, ſeated herſelf upon a fragment of ſtone, bitterly lamenting her way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fate.</p>
               <p>"How cruel," ſhe ſaid, "is my deſtiny; deprived in my earlieſt infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a mother's foſtering care, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a harſh father to give my hand unto a man whoſe mind I am ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unacquainted with.

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:030954_0027_0FEA0806524133D8"/>
"Her care is ſtill for you," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a voice; while Jane, horror-ſtruck, threw her eyes around, and perceived a figure ſuddenly turn an angle of the cavern; at this inſtant a dusky cloud enveloping the moon, left her in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect darkneſs, and on returning light in vain ſhe ſought for the cauſe of her ſurprize.</p>
               <p>Scarce had ſhe recovered from her panick, ere the ſound of footſteps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled her fears, which were as quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpelled when ſhe ſaw Glencairn approach. She informed him of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary adventure, which he ſought to perſuade her was but the coinage of her brain; yet too firmly was it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the mind of Jane, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it was fancy.</p>
               <p>After ſome time, beſtowed in mutual vows, ſealed by their lips and witneſſed by the chaſte Diana, they appointed a meeting early on the enſuing morn at a cottage in the near valley. The

owner was a venerable woman, who had had the charge of Jane during her infancy, but had been diſmiſſed on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda's expulſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They then, with reluctance, bade adieu, and returned by different roads to the caſtle.</p>
               <p>At day-break Jane proceeded to the appointed ſpot, reflecting on the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a circumſtance, which her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent viſit to the cottage brought freſh to recollection. It was briefly this: In her ſeveral ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>tions thither, to which ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               <p>In vain had ſhe queſtioned old Maud concerning her viſitor; in vain had ſhe
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030954_0029_0FEA080FC0A36808"/>
perplexed herſelf in conjectures of who it ſhould be; and the predominant deſire of woman, dear curioſity, was left unſatisfied!</p>
               <p>At the lowly portal ſhe found El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; he conducted her in, where ſhe was welcomed by the good hoſteſs, who had got the licenced trick of age. Prolixity in converſation was her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king feature; nor was there a poſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of bringing her to the end of a tale, till ſhe had made her accuſtomed obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
               <p>"My beloved miſtreſs," ſhe cried, "in the name of the Holy Virgin, how come I honored with your company at ſo early an hour? Has any miſhap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen you? I fear there has, for right ſure am I that my laſt night's dream bodes nothing good; however I will not at preſent trouble you with that, but return to ſomething of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. My good Lord, your couſin, informed me that I might expect you;

but uſeleſs were my enquiries to what I ſtood indebted for your viſit."</p>
               <p>"My good mother," anſwered El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, "had you permitted, I ſhould ere this have ſolved your queſtion."</p>
               <p>"There now!" returned the aged owner of the houſe, "had I permitted! Have I not already ſaid I intreated you?"</p>
               <p>"Maud," ſaid Jane, "am I, from this to conclude you conſider my viſit as unſeaſonable?"</p>
               <p>"Unſeaſonable!" exclaimed the cottager with energy, "Alas, how little you know my heart! and yet you ſhould know it, none ever had a greater intereſt in it. How often have you in early years reclined upon my boſom? Ah! thoſe days for happineſs, I never ſhall ſee their parallel. Yet what am I?

               <p>Jane tarried the concluſion of this eloquent harangue, well knowing it would be fruitleſs to attempt an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, then thanking Maud for her good wiſhes, made known her purpoſe, which ſhe had hardly ended, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The character of this ſervant was alſo ſomewhat ſingular; he was firmly atttached to his maſter, and would with pleaſure have ſacrificed his own life in his defence.

               <p>They begged Maud to introduce the lady; who entered the room vieled, and Jane, by her figure, diſcovered the perſon ſhe had ſo frequently ſeen there, who took her hand and preſſed it with fervor to her lips, inviting heaven to ſhower its choiceſt gifts upon her head,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030954_0034_0FEA082D84E77670"/>
and to avert thoſe calamities which had befallen her mother. Then preſenting the hand ſhe held to Eldred, bade him in broken ſobs, conſider the value of the jewel he was about to have in charge; murmured a bleſſing on them and precipitately withdrew, leaving her ſpectators in amazement!</p>
               <p>Jane took leave of her nurſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glencairn had forced a purſe upon her, they mounted their ſteeds and ſhaped their courſe ſoutherly, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to travel as far as Wales, amidſt the lofty mountains of that country, to tend their herds and live in peaceful retirement.</p>
               <p>They rode converſing on the ſtrange rencounter at the abode of Maud, which much engroſſed their thoughts; and the more ſo as Jane affirmed ſhe had heard the voice before, till the dark gathering of the clouds foretold the impending ſtorm, and they had juſt gained ſhelter in an adjacent grove,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030954_0035_0FEA0835D4C8E088"/>
when the rain poured down in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, loud whiſtled the wind amidſt the lofty foilage, while blue and forked lightning, gave a momentary gleam, and the big thunder, in deep, awful ſtrains, growled over their heads.</p>
               <p>"Aye," cried Andrew, (throwing his plaid over his ſhoulders) "This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of an excellent proverb, <hi>Though the ſun ſhine, leave not your cloak at home."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While they remained under ſhelter, they were ſurpriſed by the voices of men, one of whom cried, "They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be far off, I have good intelligence this is the road they took!"</p>
               <p>"'Tis well," returned another, "if they are taken, our labour will be well requitted."</p>
               <p>"If!" anſwered a third voice, "I will purſue them to the end of the world. By the beard of Holy St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, our Lord would ſacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us

               <p>"Alas!" ſhe ſaid, "theſe are our purſuers! What will become of us?</p>
               <p>"Fear not, my love," exclaimed Eldred, "I will protect you, while life exiſts!"</p>
               <p>"Then, my Lord," ſaid Andrew, "the moſt certain way of doing that, will be to run away; for take my word, you will not long have life, if you remain here." "Silence," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his maſter.</p>

               <p>THEY then continued their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and arrived in an extenſive val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, ſurrounded by a hanging wood. The rays of the God of Day, who was faſt retiring for the night, caſt a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſhade and added to the beauty of the ſcene. Through the dale, over a pebbled bed, meandered a bubbling ſtream, flanked on each ſide by mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful willows. Caſting their eyes around in wonder, at the door of a cell they deſcried a man veſted in hermit's garb, who ſate apparently in melancholy
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030954_0039_0FEA0844B28ED348"/>
reverie. Around the porch were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven jaſmines and honey-ſuckles, the fragrance of which was odoriferous.</p>
               <p>The Anchorite, on obſerving our travellers approached and requested them, in a ſtile more ſuited to the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed air of a courtier than the uſual addreſs of a recluſe, to enter his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; to which they conſented, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling what could have induced a man who ſeemed deſigned by Nature for the higheſt ſphere, thus to ſeclude himſelf, particularly as he was not of age to loſe all reliſh for the pleaſures of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. The traces on his features ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather the effect of cruel retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than of time; yet had it not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed that grace and affability, which accompanied his every word and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor was their wonder diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they eſpied a ſuit of armour ſuſpended from the ſtoney roof.</p>
               <p>"Enter," he cried, "my humble dwelling, and accept a hearty welcome,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030954_0040_0FEA08484BA16AC0"/>
which will be your only ſauce to the poor fare that I can ſet before you." <hi>"A good appetite is the beſt ſauce;"</hi> ſaid Andrew hurrying out to turn the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes looſe, that he might the ſooner be enabled to convince them there was truth in his aſſertion.</p>
               <p>The hermit then produced ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruit, and water from the rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let that flowed before his door; of which Eldred and his fair companion partook ſparingly. In the mean time, Andrew, having diſpatched his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, quickly proved, by the attack he made on the proviſions, that abſtinence was not in the liſt of his philoſophic virtues. "Aye," ſays he "this is as it ſhould be, After the outſide has been ſo mauled, as that of my unhappy carcaſe has, tis fit the inſide ſhould be well lined, to ſupport the whole caſe.</p>
               <p>To be ſure your beverage is none of the ſtrongeſt. I have been well buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted by this element any time for the laſt hour: but, thank Heaven, my

               <p>Their repaſt ended, the Anchorite, who called himſelf Ambroſe, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the hiſtory of the young fugitives, concealing only their names; on which he made them the offer of his habitation as a refuge, until the ſearch which would neceſſarily be made after them ſhould ſubſide. This friendly propoſal they joyfully accepted; and the daughter of Wallace being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with a ſtraw bed, the only one the place afforded, retired; while the Hermit, Glencairn, and Andrew, drew around a good neat fire for the night.</p>
               <p>The ſubſequent morning, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galing themſelves, Jane and her lover walked into the ſurrounding wood, when ſhe, faint for want of that reſt which her perturbed ſtate of mind had denied her during the night, reſolved to ſeek it under the ſhadow of ſome
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030954_0042_0FEA084F0F6C49B8"/>
kindly tree; ſhe therefore deſired El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to leave her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and traverſed the grove for ſome time. But how can his horror be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, when on his return he ſaw not Jane. Half frantic, he loudly called upon her name, but all in vain! At length he bethought himſelf, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſhe might have taken her way to the hermitage; and haſting thither, met his truſty ſquire.</p>
               <p>"Andrew," cried he, "haſt thou ſeen the Lady Jane? I quitted her for a ſhort time, and on coming to the ſpot again, my longing eyes to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe looked for her.</p>
               <p>"My Lord," replied his attendant, "there is an old adage, and a very true one, that <hi>After joy comes ſorrow."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Have you ſeen her?" returned the impatient Eldred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:030954_0043_0FEA0852F7251C78"/>
"No my Lord," ſaid he, "but let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Regardleſs of theſe obſervations, Glencairn made for the cell of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, and enquired of the holy man, whether his miſtreſs had been there; on being anſwered in the negative, with wild deſpair pictured in his frenzy-rolling eye, again he darted amidſt the impervious ſhade of the encircling fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, making it re-echo with his cries; till exhauſted nature yielded beneath her burden, and he ſunk ſupine upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Ambroſe, who, with Andrew, had been the whole day in ſearch of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, found him at laſt in the ſituation before mentioned; his face wrapped in the plaid robe he wore, and his brown locks wet with the evening dew.</p>
               <p>Deaf to the entreaties of the Hermit, he remained immoveable, till ſoftened
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030954_0044_0FEA0858D8A41718"/>
by the perſevering and reiterated ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Andrew and the good man, he ſuffered them to conduct him unto the hermitage. On his arrival, the agitation his ſpirits had ſuſtained brought on a raging fever, ſo deſperate, that for ſeveral days his life was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of, during which time his hoſt adminiſtered ſuch drugs as the produce of the earth enabled him to prepare. But conſcious that his patient's mind ſtood moſt in need of medicine, he took the earlieſt opportunity that returning reaſon offered, on the part of Eldred, to inculcate the principles of religion, and ſooth his tortured ſoul.</p>
               <p>"My ſon," ſaid he, "reflect that the ways of providence are blind and intricate! ſhall poor weak man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reaſon, and ſay to Power Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, thou haſt done amiſs? Bow with ſubmiſſion to the will of Heaven, and pour that precious cordial patience on your heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:030954_0045_0FEA085B8A4F9A48"/>
"True," cried Andrew, <hi>"Patience is a plaiſter for all ſores."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Ah, father!" exclaimed Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn, "to the inſenſate feelings of an anchorite, my grief, I know, appears extravagant. But how can one, ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the world judge of thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations by which the ſuſceptible paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of frailer mortals are actuated? Had you, indeed, ever known what it is to love, and have the idol of your ſoul thus torn away, you might with juſtice reaſon on my caſe."</p>
               <p>"True again," ſaid the philoſophic ſquire, <hi>"None know the weight of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's burden."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the latter part of Eldred's ſpeech, the ſcalding drop rolled down the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit's cheek: after a time he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>"Alas, my ſon! you know not what you have innocently done; probed a

wound, which though long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is not, nor ever will be healed."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"It is ill healing an old ſore!"</hi> ejac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated Andrew.</p>
               <p>"Had I ever loved!" continued Ambroſe; "O! did you know my long ſad ſufferings, your own, heavy as you think them, placed in the ſcale againſt mine, would ſtrike the beam; and notwithſtanding the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of them will rouſe a train of gloomy reflections, that for a moment ſcarce had ſlumbered, yet will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them, that, by the compariſon you may learn to bear with reſignation the ills allotted to you."</p>
               <p>"You had better not," cried the ſquire of Glencairn, <hi>"When ſorrow is aſleep, awake it not."</hi>

               <p>"Do not, from this," continued he, "infer you ſhould deſpiſe wealth. No conſider it as the beſt gift of Heaven, provided you have the bleſſing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the proper uſe of it, which ſurely is, that thoſe who moſt abound, may have the ſatisfaction of relieving others, that are undeſervedly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous."</p>

"This I almoſt deſpaired to obtain, well knowing his predominant foible was ambition, to which he would have ſacrificed every thing moſt dear to him.

               <p>"And who art thou" he cried "who pretendeſt to it? What feats of heroic proweſs haſt thou accompliſhed, or is thy name diſtinguiſhed amongſt the chieftains of the north?

               <p>"I had ſcarce made my comment on the ſcene before me, ere my attention was again rouſed by the clatter of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching horſes, and I ſoon heard their riders tap gently at the portal, which being opened, they aſked if any company was within."</p>

               <p>"Having drank, the horſemen mounted and galloped off, leaving me in a ſtate of mind more eaſily conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than deſcribed. I had not much time allowed me for reflection, as I

I inſtantly extinguiſhed my lamp, and placing myſelf behind the door, by the pale light that invaded my chamber window, I ſaw him enter the room and advance to the bed, whereon he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his intended victim lay. I unſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſword, and ſtraitway plunged it in his heart.</p>
               <p>"Traitor!" I exclaimed, "take from my hand the juſt reward of thy crimes—crimes which exceed all bounds. To lure the unwary traveller to his death, under the plauſible maſk of hoſpitality, is ſure a ſpecies of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled villainy.

               <p>"I then hurried from the room, and having capariſoned my charger, left the

It was ſtill ſo dark I was compelled to ride at random, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what route I took, and at the hazard of falling into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's hands. At laſt, the welcome ſound of a diſtant bell ſaluted my ear, and, looking towards the ſide from whence it iſſued, I deſcried by the rays of the ſun, that now began to ſhoot above the duſky horizon, the ſpires of a monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery: cheered by the ſight, my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted ſtrength was renovated. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at the gate, I demanded admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which was granted, and I uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an apartment, where I found the ſuperior.

On my appearance, he utterred a groan, and fell back ſpeechleſs. After a pauſe, he ſhewed ſigns of returning life, and at length being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf upon his arm exclaimed, "There ſtands my murderer!"</p>
               <p>"I was inſtantly ſurrounded, and, ſpite of all oppoſition, diſarmed; then hurried to a melancholly dungeon, where they loaded me with chains. Thus manacled, theſe fathers of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

               <p>"We came into a large hall, where the inhabitants of the monaſtery were already aſſembled, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their various implements of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

Petrified at the idea of becoming a ſlave, at a time I flattered myſelf ſecure of laſting felicity, my reaſon forſook me, and I ſingly ſought to repel the foe, but all in vain, a blow from a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-axe laid me inſenſate on the deck, and I became their priſoner.</p>

               <p>"I mentioned this abruptly, fearful ſhe ſhould have formed any thought of accompanying me; but much I wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her.

               <p>"I preſſed her hand to my lips, and departed, ſtrongly impreſſed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of her generous conduct. I followed my guide to the beach, and finding the galley in perfect readineſs, I rewarded the ſlave and embarked.</p>

"Never did I experience a night of more real ſatisfaction.

               <p>"After a pleaſant voyage, I landed at Leith; and recompenſing the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the captain, proceeded to the manſion of my forefathers. By what various emotions was I actuated as I journeyed thither! I was received at the gate by the ſteward, a venerable man, who had ſpent his youth in our family.</p>
               <p>"He ſtarted at the ſight of me, as though he had ſeen an apparition. "Doſt thou not know me, Charles?" ſaid I.</p>

               <p>"You had not been gone twelve months, before a Scots Chief, on a dark night, claimed ſhelter here from the inclemency of the elements, which I need not tell you was granted; for never did traveller paſs theſe walls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out refreſhment.

               <p>"I therefore withdrew privately from the caſtle, as I well knew if Charles became acquainted with my deſign, he would oppoſe it with every argument he was maſter of.

               <p>ELDRED thanked the Anchorite, and would sain have profited by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but the loſs of his beloved miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs had fixed a barbed arrow in his heart, the gangrene wound of which the hand of philoſophy could not heal.</p>
               <p>He remained with Father Ambroſe until his bodily health was reſtored, when again the remembrance of Jane drove him almoſt to deſperation.</p>
               <p>"Good heaven!" he cried, "my ſufferings are more than I can endure."</p>

               <p>"No more, I charge thee; if thou canſt afford me no conſolation, for thy life attempt not to trifle with my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings."</p>
               <p>"<hi>Fall not out with thy friend for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle.</hi>"</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:030954_0086_0FEA07F375D11D68"/>
"Well, well, my honeſt fellow, I have been haſty, I pray you pardon me."</p>
               <p>"I do," ſaid Andrew; "<hi>Happy is he who knows his follies in his youth.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The impetuous ſallies of paſſion on the part of Eldred, were reſtrained by the perſuaſive arguments of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and it was ſettled they ſhould abandon the hermitage on the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day. They made their intention known to Father Ambroſe, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated his noble gueſt, but in vain, to prolong his ſtay.</p>
               <p>On the enſuing morn, the Recluſe drew from his breaſt a caſket.</p>
               <p>"This," ſaid he, "is the legacy of an expiring foe. I treaſured it, hoping it would have proved the means of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting me to her I adored. Thoſe thoughts are cruſhed forever! Accept this as a memorial of one, who though

but a ſhort time honored with your acquaintance, has for you a ſincere reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect."</p>
               <p>So ſaying, he took out a ring, which he preſented to Glencairn, who thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for his preſent; but on looking at it, the blood forſook his cheek, and his whole frame was convulſed at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it bore the creſt of his family.

                  </gap>e; yet could he not account for his parent having ſerved in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh army. Again he thought, he might have been influenced by ſome grievance, to oppoſe the intereſts of France, and for that reaſon had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately abſconded from Scotland. To cenſure his hoſt would be an act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, as to the fortune of war he ſtood indebted for his loſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:030954_0088_0FEA0803782B3DF0"/>
Theſe were the feelings that tore his mind; he inſtantly ordered his charger, and taking an abrupt leave of the Anchorite, whom he could not ſee but with horror, vaulted into his ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and haſtened from the valley.</p>
               <p>He rode towards the manſion of Wallace, and diſmounted at twilight at the cottage of Maud, whom he queſtioned concerning Jane.</p>
               <p>"On the firſt news of your flight," anſwered ſhe, "Sir James and Donald, attended by their retainers, followed you; but to my great ſurprize, on the ſubſequent evening, the former return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without his gueſt, denouncing the curſe of an irritated parent on his daughter, and vowing he would no farther purſue her, but leave her to reap the juſt reward of her diſobedience. This ſtartled me, and I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſhe is in their hands, but where they have ſecreted her, heaven knows."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:030954_0089_0FEA08084EB76138"/>
This intelligence increaſed Eldred's anxiety.</p>
               <p>"Let us be gone, Andrew," he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "to the dwelling of this accurſed rival: dearly ſhall he make atonement for his villainy?</p>
               <p>In vain were Maud's endeavors to diſſuade him from his purpoſe; in vain ſhe painted the dangers he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily encounter, and the improbabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of deriving any ſucceſs from his raſh project.</p>
               <p>"You forget," ſaid he, "the name I bear, never did baſe fear, or the thought of danger invade the mind of my illuſtrious race, nor will I be the firſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So ſaying, in oppoſition to the ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous intreaties of Maud, he mounted his ſteed, and attended by Andrew, ſhaped his courſe northward.</p>

               <p>Advancing towards it he met a youth, whoſe military accoutrements beſpoke him one of Donald's retinue; and on examining his countenance, the air of ingeniousneſs with which it was ſtrongly imprinted, prompted Eldred to make his confidante, and to endeavor by gold, that all-perſuaſive argument, to win him to his intereſt.</p>
               <p>He accoſted him with ſome trivial queſtion, aſking whoſe was the adjacent manſion; after which, he informed the

Theſe words charmed Glencairn, who was perſuaded that at leaſt, in this inſtance, the face was an index of the mind. He inſtantly imparted his buſineſs to the ſtranger, who confeſſed Jane was within the caſtle; at the ſame time, he acknowledged the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of Donald, and vowed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſchemes of Eldred as much as in him lay.</p>

               <p>ELDRED croſſed the draw-bridge without the leaſt ſuſpicion, and had ſcarce entered the court-yard, when his ear was ſaluted by the jocund ſound of feſtivity. He entered the building and making his way to that part whence the noiſe proceeded, he came to a hall which was decorated by the arms and banners of its various poſſeſſors. Here he ſound a goodly company ſacrificing largely to Bacchus: ſwiftly was the mantling goblet paſſed around, while the warlike deeds of the Scottiſh Chieftains rung through the ſtately ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifice!</p>

Eldred, darting a look around, ſaw at the farther end his rival, and Jane ſeated by him, over whoſe ſpirits, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the juice of the grape, nor the voice of the bard, had the leaſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Pale melancholly was pictured in her features; her face was averted from the hated ſociety wherein ſhe was compelled to mix, while the briny moiſture from her eye fell in the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cup, and diluted the potent bev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erage.</p>
               <p>The ſight of his miſtreſs fired the ſoul of Glencairn; hardly could he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from ſacrificing the raviſher in the midſt of his adherents; but poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prevented him, and he determined to counteract the villainy of Donald by ſtratagem.</p>
               <p>Long did he continue at the caſtle, without the happineſs of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a word to the loved object who had brought him thither; when, as he ſtood reclining againſt his beachen ſpear

in painful rumination, the highland chief paſſed near him, and fixed his eyes ſtedfaſtly on him; then ſuddenly withdrawing them, left the court-yard. Our hero was in amazement, he nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally conjectured he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>His ſuſpicions however were ſoon evaporated, by the Baron taking no farther notice of him, and fortune ſoon after favored his wiſhes. As his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs was enjoying the cool evening breeze upon the terrace, he found means to convey a letter, unperceived, into her hand, imparting the danger he encountered for her ſake, and with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery tender argument, ſoliciting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview that night, near the weſtern tower, as his friend Edric would have charge of the draw-bridge, who would enable him to ſnatch her from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in which ſhe languiſhed.</p>

Eldred waited with anxiety, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable companion of love, till he thought the inhabitants of the caſtle buried in ſleep, then flew upon the wings of impatience to the appointed ſpot. Long did he tarry, but no Jane appeared. Furious at his diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was about to retire, when the diſtant view of a female, again rekin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled his hopes, and in a minute he held the daughter of Wallace in his arms, fain would he have chid, but joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his tongue from any language, ſave what love inſpired. With rapture he ſtrained her to his breaſt, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive he ſhould be once more deprived of her.</p>
               <p>Thus does the ſhipwrecked mariner—when wan deſpair forbids the thought of ever regaining land, by chance ſome friendly billow wafts him towards a rock, where cloſe he clings, and fears the impetuous ſurge will tear him from his only hope!</p>

With eagerneſs did Glencairn hurry croſs the draw bridge, where he was joined by his ſquire, who had received from Edric intimation of his maſter's deſign.</p>
               <p>"Theſe excurſions," ſaid Andrew, "may be vaſtly entertaining to you, my Lord and Lady, who are lovers, who can banquet on each other's words, and warm yourſelves with the breath of mutual proteſtations. But, for my part, I would rather have been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in feaſting on a well fed Capon, and a flaggon of wine. Here have I tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, until I am perfectly a walking piece of ice; my body is now in as cold a ſtate as the ſummit of Arthur's ſeat on a winter's night. Our horſes too are ſtolen, and by the beard of St. Andrew which way they went I know not: however 'tis for your ſervice I ſuffer this inconvenience, and that thought ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens my ſufferings."</p>

Already they were at a diſtance from the hoſtile place, and ſafe they thought from the perſecution of their enemies. The tranſition from a ſituation ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, to one directly oppoſite, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch a revolution in their tender minds, as lovers can only imagine.</p>
               <p>They were fondly entertaining each other with mutual proteſtations, when the harſh din of footſteps faſt advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cauſed them to mend their pace. Taking Jane's trembling hand, Eldred hurried on, but their purſuers gained upon them, and he diſtinguiſhed the voice of Donald.</p>
               <p>"Stop, villain!" he cried, "yield up your prize, or this moment you breathe your laſt."</p>
               <p>They were now ſo cloſe, that all eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape was hopeleſs. Eldred, therefore, like to the foreſt lion when at bay, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf before his fair companion, and drawing his ſword prepared to meet

               <p>Donald perceived this ſpeech was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to excite his anger, that ſo he might be irritated, and deprive his rival of a hateful exiſtence.</p>

               <p>DESPAIR now ſeized upon the ſoul of Eldred; deprived of liberty, robbed of the idol of his heart, whom with its utmoſt fervency he worſhipped, what could he wiſh for but death?</p>
               <p>Irritated by reflection, and accuſing fate, that inſtead of permitting him to end his life in battle, like his anceſtors, had doomed him to periſh in ignoble bondage, perhaps by the hand of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin, he traverſed his dungeon, till his foot ſtriking againſt a ſomething threw him on the ground.</p>

ſearch he picked up a dagger, which from the feel he judged to be a ruſty one. While his thoughts were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in vain conjectures, how, or for what purpoſe the inſtrument came there, the beams of the moon obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gleamed through an aperture, in the roof of the cell, and preſented to his aſtoniſhed ſight an human ſkeleton, then diſappearing he was again involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chaos.</p>
               <p>So momentary and ſo faint had been the light, he could not perſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but the horrors of his ſituation had conjured up this phenomenon, and that 'twas but a phantom of his diſordered brain.

heart, and though unmoved he would have encountered a hoſt of foes, yet did this awful ſcene ſo work upon his fancy he could ſcarcely ſupport himſelf; a cold and chilly dew flowed down his limbs, his knees forgot their office and ſhook under him, his nerves were all relaxed and ſinewleſs as the new-born infant's.</p>
               <p>"What bloody act has this infernal den been made the ſcene of?" he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily cried; Unhappy wretch I am doomed to mingle my duſt with thine: Alas! thy miſeries are ended, mine to come."</p>
               <p>Harraſſed with mental and corporeal fatigue, he threw himſelf upon the bed, and ſtrove to gain a temporary relief from his anxiety by ſleep, but the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpending poppies fled his eyelids, and his groans of anguiſh echoed through the place. He aroſe, walked in a ſtate of diſtraction, and his reflections ſerved only to make his ſituation more deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030954_0108_0FEA08E90CFE62B0"/>
In vain did he endeavour to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the myſterious gloom that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded his underſtanding; the more he tried to unravel the knotted clue, the more was he entangled in the maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of conjecture, without one leading thread to guide him to certainty; while the horrors of darkneſs, the whiſtling wind, and dreary ſounds of diſtant bells increaſed the gloom.</p>
               <p>During the whole night he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by a repetition of ſighs and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly noiſes, which iſſued from one particular direction, and kept him in a ſtate of racking uneaſineſs and anxiety.</p>

'Twas a ſpacious, lofty vaulted cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern; on one ſide ſtood an oaken table, rotten and worn out with age; a ſtool that bore the ſame marks of antiquity, and a bed of ſtraw. Upon the table was placed a lamp and tinder box, which, to the priſoner, was a cheering ſight, as it would prevent his paſſing another night in the darkneſs which he had ſpent the one preceding.</p>

               <p>'TIS now neceſſary to return to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald, who having reſigned the captive Eldred to his followers, entered the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſummoned Andrew to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Judging of others by himſelf, he imagined the Squire's fidelity might be ſhaken by the power of gold, and determined to make him aſſure the daughter of Wallace, that Eldred had entirely reſigned her to the Lord of the Iſles, on condition that he was reſtored to liberty. This he knew muſt give Jane a deſpicable opinion of her lover, and poſſibly might favor his own ſuit.</p>
               <p>Donald took his ſeat in the hall, and the follower of the Lord Glencairn was ſoon uſhered in.</p>

"Approach and fear not," ſaid the Chief, "fain would I be thy friend. Convince the lady Jane thy maſter has renounced her, and fortune is thy own. As an earneſt of my favor, I preſent you with this purſe."</p>
               <p>"No, my Lord," anſwered Andrew "my affection for him I ſerve, was the gift of nature; I conſider it as ſacred, and will preſerve it as I would the laſt legacy of a departed friend. Barter it for gold! No! keep it yourſelf, you have more need of it."</p>
               <p>"I need of it?" replied Donald.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you!" cried the ſquire, "Go, purchaſe a freſh conſcience, if you can. Exchange your robe, if poſſible, for an honeſt heart, and think yourſelf happy in your bargain."</p>
               <p>"Wretch!" returned the chief, "obey me, or dread my vengeance."</p>

                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:030954_0115_0FEA08FAB75E6488"/>
"My lord," ſaid Andrew, "reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, my philoſophy is equally proof againſt your menaces, as your gold."</p>
               <p>"Fool!" exclaimed the enraged Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald, "Guards convey him back to priſon, and double load him with chains!"</p>
               <p>"I defy you," retorted the faithful fellow, "double that again, the tho't of having acted rightly will make my irons light; while the weight that clogs thy boſom will make your frame heavy, though in the ſtate of Adam."</p>
               <p>"Away with him!" cried the chief.</p>
               <p>The ſoldiers obeyed, and having pinioned his arms, which gave him an appearance not unlike a truſſed capon, conveyed him to his cell, and left him, with the alternative of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Here is indeed," muttered the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, "ſufficient room for meditation; here I can indulge my philoſophy, which bids fair to be put to the proof, and with as little fear of interruption as the diſtreſſed cottager has to fear the relief of greatneſs. Should I ever be delivered from this Giant of the Caſtle, this Donald, never more will I act a part ſo ill ſuited to my abilities, as that of a Squire. I am certain Mars did not preſide at my nativity. I am rather apt to think my parents were thinking of an olive branch at the time—No matter; I am afraid my death will be occaſioned by the branch of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oak. I ſhould not be ſurprized if this fiend was to hang me, and then my maſters promiſes would be fulfilled, that by following his fortune, I ſhould get exalted. Sure enough, I ſet out with a promiſing proſpect; but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of the old proverb, <hi>Praiſe a fair day at night.</hi> I am afraid I ſhall be kept as a ſcare-crow, though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth there ſeems little occaſion for

that, the birds appear to have as great an averſion as myſelf to this place. The only one I ſaw, during my ſtay at Edric's friend's, was an old owl, as melancholy as myſelf. Oh, that I was reading Plato in the buttery; there I had food for the body as well as for the mind. Alas! I ſhall never ſee thoſe days again."</p>
               <p>Thus did the unlucky Andrew la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his fate.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Donald ſought the apartment of Jane, whoſe timid nature he diſturbed with his impetuous ſolicitations. Much were her hours embittered by his addreſſes; ſtill ſhe reſiſted his importunities, as firmly as the rock withſtands the laſhing waves beneath; and an unlooked for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance called him, for a time, from the caſtle, and relieved her from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of his company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:030954_0118_0FEA090166BF4020"/>
Nor was his conduct to Jane the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injuſtice Donald was guilty of, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, at that period, abounded with robbers; the whole kingdom was in a ſtate of civil war; the depredations of banditti were not only tolerated but encouraged by the barons. Nay they were employed by them to deſtroy the neighbouring nobility.</p>
               <p>Donald, whoſe diſpoſition was ſuited to ſuch deeds, ſoon made himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. At the inſtigation of Earl Douglas, the moſt powerful of the Caledonian chiefs, who had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the king's army, he ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a numerous force to join him, under the command of Lauchlan Macleod, and Murdock Gibſon, two noted rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, with whom he invaded every place that was devoted to their ſovereign, ſparing neither age nor infancy, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns and villages, and enriching himſelf with the ſpoils thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:030954_0119_0FEA0903E1B87A10"/>
He attacked Argyle, and the Iſle of Arran; and having obtained poſſeſſion of the Caſtle of the latter by ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, he levelled it with the earth.</p>
               <p>From thence he paſſed to Lochaber, and to Murray, where he exerciſed the ſame barbarities as at the preceding places.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe deſtroyed the Caſtle of Inverneſs, after having taken it in a manner unworthy a warrior, and put the garriſon to the ſword.</p>
               <p>Theſe things he did, not ſo much to gratify Lord Douglas, as to indulge his own ſanguinary, avaricious turn of mind. Like the devouring locuſt, he carried with him deſtruction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the miſeries of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

               <p>WHILE the iron hand of civil war raged thus in Scotland, Henry of England perceiving an advantageous opportunity, as he and his predeceſſors were ever wont to do, commanded the inhabitants of Northumberland, and the other counties on the borders, to make incurſions; while the diſtracted ſtate of Caledonia, prevented James, (the ſovereign of that nation) making any conſiderable attempt to repulſe the foe; and a defeat of his army by Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Piercy, Earl of Northumberland, cauſed Donald to think this a favorable juncture to obtain a pardon for himſelf and his aſſociates.</p>

He therefore ſent meſſengers to this purpoſe to his majeſty, who handled the matter very craftily, not openly and plainly forgiving the tyrant, nor yet making the ambaſſadors entirely deſpair of remiſſion for their chief.</p>
               <p>He anſwered them gently, that the Lord of the Iſles deſerved no mercy at his hands, that the languinary acts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That his pardon depended entirely on himſelf; that he ſhould do ſome praiſe-worthy action, ere he was reinſtated in his favor, and that he ſhould moreover repair every injury inflicted by him.</p>
               <p>With this anſwer Donald was obliged to be content. At the ſame time am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors arrived from Richard, Duke of York, to cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Scottiſh monarch againſt Henry the ſixth, whom he purpoſed to depoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to place himſelf upon the throne of England; in return for which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to reſtore the lands in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland enjoyed by James's progenitors, with Berwick and all the fields adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and, to conclude, vowed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual peace and amity, to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between the two realms.</p>
               <p>When the ambaſſadors had concluded their harangue, they thus received their anſwer:</p>
               <p>"It is not unknown the juſt title that Richard Plantagenet hath to the crown of England; but my aſſiſtance ſhould not be too precipitately granted, neither ſhould a prince, who has ſo long, and by conſent of his kingdom, been inveſted with the inſignia of roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, be deſpoiled for a light cauſe, nor without mature deliberation; but that I refer to the wiſdom of the Engliſh nobility. I have juſt reaſon for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030954_0123_0FEA090DB408F7F8"/>
againſt my brother Henry. Firſt, that he did, without provocation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade my dominions, at a time when they were internally rent by civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions; then alſo when I did ſeek redreſs, he delayed to give me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereupon. If, therefore, the Duke of York, with the Lords of his faction, will keep promiſe, I here pledge myſelf, that my whole ſtrength ſhall be exerted to drive your preſent ſovereign from the throne, and place the crown upon his rival's head."</p>
               <p>With this anſwer the ambaſſadors took their leave, and repeated the ſame to their maſter.</p>
               <p>In the mean time James ſummoned his forces to be ready on a certain day, in order to invade their ancient enemies. On his march he was met and accoſted by an Engliſh, a creature of king Henry's, and a perfect adept in the art of lying. He was accompanied by a monk, who feigned a marvelous grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,

                  </gap> pretended he was entruſted with bills and commiſſions from the Pontiff of Rome.</p>
               <p>He thus addreſſed the Caledonian Prince.</p>
               <p>"It is the Pope's command, that neither the ſovereign of Scotland, nor any of his army, ſhall paſs farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, on pain of the curſes and cenſures of Holy Kirk. For through the frivolous diſſentions of Chriſtian kings, have the Turks, (thoſe cruel enemies to our religion) crept daily more and more into Europe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be all debates, battles and ſtrife ſet aſide between the diſciples of our Saviour, and their utmoſt endeavors uſed to expel the infidels, who would not only ſpoil them of their worldly liberty, but alſo of the word of God: on which account, I am now authoriſed by the Pope, to promiſe, that all rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages committed by King Henry ſhall
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030954_0125_0FEA091321F75BB8"/>
be repaired, and that ye be from this time on terms of amity."</p>
               <p>James, believing nothing of deceit in theſe fraudulent hypocrites, obeyed the mandate, and diſbanded his troops, but was not long returned, before he diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the craft and ſubtilty of his foes; equally enraged at his own credulity, he collected a freſh body of men, and entered the Engliſh borders.</p>
               <p>While theſe tranſactions paſſed, the Duke of York led his forces againſt Henry, whom he attacked, routed his army, ſlew many of his leaders, and made the king himſelf priſoner, whom he conducted to London, where the Parliament pronounced him incapable of ruling, though they permitted him to continue the regal title, conſtituting Richard governor of the realm.</p>
               <p>Thus was Henry, who at the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the prime of manhood deprived of both, and the prophecy made good. "<hi>That Henry of Monmouth ſhould win, what Henry of Windſor ſhould loſe.</hi>"</p>
               <p>In the mean time James invaded the Engliſh ſovereign's favorers in the north, and when he had won the town of Roxburgh, and laid ſiege to the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thereof, ambaſſadors arrived, from his ally the Duke of York, requeſting him to raiſe the ſiege, as he had entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried his point.</p>
               <p>James claimed the lands promiſed, to which the ambaſſadors replied they could not give an anſwer.</p>
               <p>Iritated at finding himſelf the dupe of both parties, he vowed revenge, and ſwore he would dye the white roſe of a deeper hue than its rival. Moreover, that he would not depart till the caſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Soon after he was joined by Donald, and a powerful reinforcement, who offered to penetrate farther into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and by ſeveral deeds of valour, he recommended himſelf particularly to the notice of his monarch; his tent was pitched neareſt him, and nought was done without his concurrence.</p>
               <p>During the ſiege, the King was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſlain by the burſting of a cannon, near which he ſtood. His death was regretted by every one; but in a ſhort time his place was ſupplied by his queen, who arrived with her ſon, and reſtrained their grief.</p>
               <p>"Here," ſhe cried, "is the offspring of him you lament; ſhew your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your deceaſed Prince, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking the enemies of his ſucceſſor, nor vainly yield to an unmanly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row."</p>

               <p>The manuſcript dropped from the hand of Glencairn at theſe lines, by which he learned the ſkeleton was that of his long loſt father. He preſſed the tablets to his lips with devotion, then ſtarting from his ſeat, he flew to the receſs where he had depoſited the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; threw himſelf upon the ground, and claſped the fleſhleſs bones within his arms. At length he reſolved to dig a grave, and commit them to the earth.</p>
               <p>This he accompliſhed by means of the ruſty dagger he had found: then wrapping his robe, of which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted himſelf, round the corſe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it to that from whence it ſprung.</p>
               <p>At that moment the nightly ſcreech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owl uttered a lamentable cry, which
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030954_0134_0FEA0929B671E590"/>
was anſwered by a deep groan that iſſued from the corner whence he had heard the preceding ones. His blood grew clotted in his veins, he fancied the ſpirit of his departed ſire had taken that method of ſpur him to revenge.</p>
               <p>"Shade of my ill-fated, my lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed father!" exclaimed Eldred, "reſt in peace! Fear not, but thy murder ſhall be expiated.

               <p>Having prayed awhile, he covered the bones with earth, and paſſed the remainder of the night in heavy rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

               <p>ELDRED bedewed the ſheets with his tears, placed them in his boſom, and repaired to the grave of his parent. While every faculty was abſorbed in contemplation, a loud ſhriek made the vital blood grow chilly at his heart; at the ſame time a noiſe at the gate of the cavern cauſed him to ſeek the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He expected to ſee his execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but his horror was converted into ſurpriſe, when he beheld a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and advancing towards him; he deſcried the features of Duncan, ſon of Carrol, who was Sir James's agent
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030954_0138_0FEA0934A84D6DB8"/>
in his villainies, and an inhabitant of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>"Good heaven!" cried Eldred, "by what ſtrange chance do I find thee here? tell me."—</p>
               <p>"Suſpend your enquiries," returned the youth, "and conſider only your ſafety. Your priſon doors are open to you, fly."</p>
               <p>The ſilver tongues of angels could not have been more welcome to the ears of Glencairn than theſe words, ſtill his admiration increaſed.</p>
               <p>"I conjure you," ſaid he, "inform me by what ſtrange means your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is enabled to befriend me."</p>
               <p>"Briefly thus: laſt night, in paſſing through the gallery of the caſtle, the buz of people in converſation attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my notice. I liſtened, and heard Sir James and my father in earneſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030954_0139_0FEA09365EE06758"/>
you, they often mentioned, and from what they ſaid, I learned you were here in confinement, and under the latter's cuſtody.</p>
               <p>"He had for ſome time a large bunch of keys, of which he is ſo extremely careful, that in the day he kept them under lock, and at night depoſited them beneath his pillow. I queſtioned him concerning what place they were the ſafeguard of, but was ſilenced with a frown."</p>
               <p>"Suſpend your idle curioſity, nor for your life attempt to develope the ſecrets of my heart."</p>
               <p>"This was his anſwer. What I heard in the gallery convinced me thoſe were the keys of your priſon, and I have ſpent the whole day in deviſing means for your emancipation. To night my father was unexpectedly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by Sir James, and being at the time employed in the locker, where
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030954_0140_0FEA0937FA8C1D08"/>
he kept his charge, in his haſte, left the door open, and gave me the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-for opportunity of reſtoring you to that liberty, which, but for this lucky chance, you never would have regained. Surely I am not culpable in thwarting the ſchemes of a parent, when they are unworthy of him; and that Being, whoſe ſcrutinizing eye can look into my very ſoul, knows that I act but from his juſt impulſe."</p>
               <p>"What ſavage place is this?" ſaid Eldred, "<hi>The Haunted Cavern!</hi>" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Duncan. "<hi>The Haunted Cavern,</hi> indeed!" exclaimed our hero, "Little did I think, at the time I treated the report but as the idle chimera of the peaſants, that 'twas the haunt of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved—."</p>
               <p>He recollected himſelf in time, to prevent the ſecret of the murder eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his lip. He quitted the cell, after damping the earthy pillow of his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030954_0141_0FEA093C9B8CB048"/>
and vowing to dedicate his life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to revenge.</p>
               <p>At the door of his dungeon, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned his deliverer every acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment that a heart ſtored with grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude could inſpire; then left him, and went to the humble dwelling of old Maud, where he begged ſhe would permit him to remain for a ſhort time, telling her, as ſhe valued his life, not to divulge his being there.</p>
               <p>Eldred determined here to make his abode, till the ſearch, which would of courſe be made, ſhould ceaſe; then to viſit the manſion of his anceſtors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the unnatural end of his father, and invoke the tenants to arm them for revenge on his aſſaſſin.</p>
               <p>He paſſed the night in a ſtate of anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety. In the morning, the ſame lady whom he had ſeen at the cottage on the day of his elopement with Jane, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain made her appearance; ſtill ſhe was
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030954_0142_0FEA093E42D046A0"/>
veiled; with impatience ſhe queſtioned him concerning his fair couſin, in which he ſatisfied her as much as in him lay,</p>
               <p>In the evening Maud, by the deſire of Glencairn, repaired to the caſtle, and on her return gave him the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account.</p>
               <p>"I hobbled at your requeſt to the Baron's. I am ſure my old feet ach for it, and well they may; for croſſing the rocks that lie 'twixt here and there would bruiſe the hoof of a camel."</p>
               <p>"Spare your obſervations," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Eldred, "and tell me what ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings you have brought."</p>
               <p>"Spare my obſervations!" returned ſhe, "I have made none, except on my fatigue, and the badneſs of the road. Well, at laſt I arrived at Sir James's, and the firſt perſon that I ſaw was Duncan; knowing from the ſervice he had done you, and a ſignal ſervice
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:030954_0143_0FEA0940C36F3238"/>
too, let me tell you. Sure his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will make ſome recompence for the life of his father; never were two ſo unlike. There is as much difference between them as there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s 'twixt a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin of whiſkey and a pail of ditch wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Ah, my Lord, your gratitude to him cannot be too great."</p>
               <p>"I am not," ſaid Eldred, "to learn what I owe him, nor will my heart, I hope, ever forget the favors I have received from any. Reſt aſſured, my good mother, you ſhall not go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded."</p>
               <p>"Reward!" ſaid the old woman, "I ſcorn it! 'tis my heart that prompts me to lend you what little aid I can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that looks for no other reward than the ſatisfaction it feels in doing good. Well, I imparted to Duncan your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here."</p>
               <p>"Strange things," replied he, "have happened at the caſtle: laſt night, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:030954_0144_0FEA0943E9CC2648"/>
my abſence at the <hi>Haunted Cavern,</hi> a pilgrim arrived at the gate; the laws of hoſpitality forbad Sir James to refuſe the lodging he demanded, or reſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he would have done it."</p>
               <p>"This Duncan need not have told me, for I know the Baron's diſpoſition; he conſiders not the proper uſe of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which heaven by granting in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to one, enables him to aſſiſt thoſe to whom fortune has been leſs bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Theſe are my ideas of wealth, and I am ſure—."</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake!" cried the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Eldred, "ſuſpend your comments, and eaſe my impatience!"</p>
               <p>"Well, well!" ſaid Maud, "you are impetuous, but when your youthful blood is lowered by age, you will know better."</p>
               <p>"This pilgrim," continued Duncan, "has won the hearts of the whole fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily;
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030954_0145_0FEA094633161C18"/>
they idolize him. Now mark me; at the dead of night, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were alarmed by the cries of Sir James; they flew to his chamber, and found him in a ſtate impoſſible to pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: His eyes were glaring, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration dropped from off him, and his features were convulſed with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. In the firſt ſally of his panic, he unwarily diſcovered the cauſe; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the apparition of the late Lord Glencairn had appeared to him, had opened the curtains at the bottom of his couch, preſented himſelf in armour, and that having ſtood there a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſuddenly vaniſhed. "My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," continued Duncan, "now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the apartment, and ordered the domeſticks to retire. In the morning, he informed them 'twas nothing more than a dream with which their Lord had been troubled, and which had left ſo ſtrong an impreſſion on him. This, though they mentioned not their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, I could obſerve they were far from crediting. Sir James is confined
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030954_0146_0FEA0947DF00D808"/>
by illneſs to his bed, and much I fear a guilty conſcience is his complaint. Recal to mind the miſterious manner in which the late Lord of Glencairn diſappeared: I dare ſay no more, but I would not have his heart in my breaſt for a kingdom. Trembling, I ſaw Carol take the keys and quit the caſtle: in a little time be returned, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of me whether I had not, on the preceding evening, touched them; I denied having ſeen them. He ſat for ſome time muſing, then ſtarting from his chair, left me; but I am certain he has concealed his priſoner's eſcape from Sir James."</p>
               <p>"This was Duncan's account, and you have it in his own words."</p>
               <p>Here Maud ceaſed to ſpeak, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred gave her the thanks which were her due.</p>

Unknowingly he took his way towards the Cavern, and ſeating himſelf upon a fragment of ſtone, contemplated the beauties of nature: the moon ſhone bright, but was now and then obſcured by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome clouds which ſwiftly flew acroſs the luminary, and ſeemed to foretel the approaching ſtorm. Here he was ſoon diſturbed by the ſame noiſe he had been accuſtomed to hear while in confinement and which now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to iſſue from the cave. He ſtarted, and perceived a figure gliding

along at no great diſtance. Reſolved, if poſſible, to know what it was, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, but in vain; the various turnings of the rocks favored the object of his purſuit, who ſoon diſappeared, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t him wrapped in wonder. He recollected a ſimilar circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faling Jane, and conſidered this as a ſtimulative to him to avenge his father's death.</p>
               <p>The caſtle clock now chimed the hour of twelve, and the faſt falling rain warned him to retire. He meaſured his ſteps towards the manſion of Wallace, determined no longer to delay his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and by a ſecret paſſage enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the building. The time conſpired with his purpoſe; the croaking raven from the mouldering turrets welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his approach; he haſtened to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of his uncle, and entered it; around the couch the curtains were cloſed; he undrew them, and beheld his victim buried in ſleep, while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,

that bane to reſt, diſturbed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his ſlumbers.</p>
               <p>"Behold!" he cried, "the ghaſtly ſpectre! See how his eye-balls glare! Alas! poor injured ſhade, can nought make thee atonement? Oh, murdered brother!"</p>
               <p>The inflamed temper of Eldred could brook no more, in rage he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Villain! awake and meet thy doom!" Wallace opened his eyes, and ſeeing Glencairn, the blood forſook his cheek: fixed as though influenced by the baſiliſk, he gazed upon the youth, when the power of utterance return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: "Gracious powers!" he cried, "who is it I ſee?"</p>
               <p>"Thou ſeeſt," ſaid Eldred, "the offspring of the murdered Archibald. Long haſt thou triumphed, and with impunity enjoyed the produce of thy crimes; vengeance is now at hand;

               <p>"I ſubmit," quoth Wallace, "to the will of fate: my puniſhment is juſt; but, O! I charge thee give me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time for penitence, if heaven grants it, do not thou refuſe it!"</p>
               <p>"Impoſter!" returned Glencairn, "too well I conceive the ſhallow arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: thou wouldeſt gain time, in the vain hope that ſome of thy infernal pack will reſcue thee, their leading blood-hound: but prepare—as well might the taken deer uſe perſuaſion with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He raiſed his dagger, and was about to plunge it in the breaſt of his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate victim, when an oppoſite door ſuddenly opened, and a pilgrim enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crying; "Hold! hold thy hand!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:030954_0151_0FEA09932A811698"/>
Surprize called Eldred from his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; he caſt his looks upon the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who tearing from his face an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial beard, and diveſting himſelf of his weeds, diſplayed the figure of a warrior, (like to that he had ſeen in his dream) who flew into his arms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming; "My ſon, my ſon!"</p>
               <p>So momentary had been this ſcene, that the faculties of Eldred were total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpended, and the unhappy Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, on ſeeing the palmer throw off his diſguiſe, had fallen into a ſwoon.</p>
               <p>"Merciful powers!" cried the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed youth, "is it poſſible I ſee my father?"</p>
               <p>"Thou doſt," replied his ſire, for it was him: "in me thou ſeeſt him, while I behold in thee a ſon, to reward my paſt misfortunes, and ſoothe my lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hours."</p>

Joy, the natural conſequence of ſuch unexpected happineſs, having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſubſided, their thoughts were turned to the wretched criminal, who ſtill remained inſenſate. At length, with much care, they brought him to himſelf, but no ſooner did he deſcry the features of his injured brother, than he relapſed into his former ſtate; nor was it but with much difficulty they could convince him 'twas not the ſpirit, but the living Archibald, who ſtood before him, and ſtrove by every ſoothing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to reconcile the culprit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—but ineffectual were his endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, repentance had touch'd his heart; and the barbed dart of conſcience for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade him eaſe.</p>

Seek not to make me wiſh for life, even now I feel the biting agonies of death: ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon my ſervants, and let me by repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration make ſome atonement." The domeſticks appeared.</p>
               <p>"Remember," quoth Wallace, "my nephew Eldred, is the heir of all that I poſſeſs; thou, much wronged brother, curſe not my memory; your ſiſter, my injured wife, was at the inſtigation of Duncan, by my orders, ſent to—"</p>

Eldred then requeſted an account of his own fortunes.</p>
               <p>"Alas! my ſon," he replied, "I cannot ſatisfy you without entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a detail of my ſufferings; misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes I will no more entitle them, ſince I have at laſt the happineſs of ſeeing you again. When laſt theſe eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held you, you were an infant; your mother dying in giving you birth, my whole affection centered in the dear pledge ſhe left behind her, and I thought ſhe lived again in you, on whom my heart reclined as its laſt prop. On that fatal night that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from my Caſtle, before I moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I preſſed you to my heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked a bleſſing on you; then journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the dwelling of Wallace, who having intimation of my deſign to viſit him, planted the ruffians who took me in the grove. This I learned from himſelf on his viſiting me in the cavern. It would be ſuperfluous to mention cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of which the manuſcript
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:030954_0157_0FEA09A2FA669B78"/>
has informed you: four tedious years did I paſs in that dreary place, during which time my reſt was often diſturbed by the melancholy noiſes you have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. In vain were my endavors put in force to diſcover the cauſe; in vain I racked my brain, and at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Cavern was haunted by ſome reſtleſs ſpirit: full of theſe thoughts, my time grew doubly irkſome.</p>
               <p>"One ſtormy night, the rain beat hard againſt my priſon roof; the peals of thunder rattled o'er my head, and vivid flames of ſulphureous lightning flaſhed through the opening of the rock. Suddenly me thought, from the tremendous craſh, the cave was rent in pieces: I flew to the receſs where the ſhock ſeemed above the reſt; but what was my ſurpriſe, when I found a part of it neareſt the ground torn by the fury of the elements, was broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? nor can I picture the agitation of my mind, when I diſcovered it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into a long narrow paſſage. I
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030954_0158_0FEA09894E7D80D0"/>
conſidered this as the kind work of Providence, and falling on my knees, returned thanks to the Almighty, who thus ſeemed to promiſe me my liberty.</p>
               <p>"I extinguiſhed my lamp, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the path might lead me to. I felt my way for ſome time, and at length deſcried a glimmering light, which made me more cautious how I proceeded. On my nearer approach, I found it was diffuſed by a lamp, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by a long iron chain from the roof of a cave, round which were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, breaſt-plaits cuiraſſes, helmets, in ſhort, every implement of war. At the far end ſat the figure of a man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſteel, and his beaver being up gave me an opportunity of ſeeing his face, which was as pale, as death. I was much aſtoniſhed, nay, ſuch was the effect of my ſurpriſe, that I conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered him as ſomething ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>"On recollection, I thought my beſt way would be to return to my dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030954_0159_0FEA095DF837EC08"/>
and tarry a fitter opportunity. I did ſo, and waited with impatience the return of the following evening. As ſoon as it arrived I ſought the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage again, and in the cave beheld the ſame figure as before. I ſtood for ſome time gazing on him, my ſituation being ſuch as gave me a full view of him without fear of diſcovery. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly he ſtarted from his ſeat, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed through an outlet that was near him. After a time, finding all quiet, I ventured out, but at that inſtant he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and ſeeing me, unſheathed his ſword and made towards me. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately the place was ſo well ſtored with weapons, that I ſoon armed myſelf, and after an obſtinate combat, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him drowned in blood upon the earth.</p>
               <p>"Compaſſion prompted me to give him every aſſiſtance in my power. I unbuckled his breaſt-plate, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to ſtaunch his wound, but he puſhed me from him."</p>

"Your care" he ſaid, is vain: even now the Angel of death hovers around me, and will ſhortly cloſe my eyes for ever! Misfortunes, biting want have leagued me with a band of robbers; liſten to my ſufferings and pity me.!</p>
               <p>"I am ſon to the late Sir William Lovel, England claims my birth: in the fruitful county of Norfolk I drew my firſt breath, and received the foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering care of a fond father; the tender ſolicitude with which he watched my juvenile years, can never be oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the tablets of my memory, ſo long as I poſſeſs the power of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>"I alighted by his deſire, and was conducted into the cottage, where the firſt object that attracted my notice was his lovely ward, Lauretta. Never did I behold ſo charming a creature; but if I was captivated by her beauty, I was much more ſo by her engaging modeſt mein, which had ſuch an effect upon me, I from that moment became enſlaved.</p>

               <p>"The good man heard me without a ſingle interruption, then replied; "my dear William, I do not blame you; you are young, and I muſt own the perſon on whom you have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your love, though neither rich or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly born, is worthy of your tenderneſs; I entertained indeed better hopes, but rather than ſee you thus, you have my leave to eſpouſe Lauretta."</p>

               <p>"I ſet forward, determined to turn my back on Norfolk for ever. I trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled the whole night and the following day, ſcarce taking any refreſhment. I entered Scotland, and was paſſing near this ſpot, when my way was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by a man, who brandiſhing his ſword, bade me deliver my money. Unuſed to be commanded, I refuſed, on which he furiouſly attacked me; but I, aware of him, unſheathed my weapon and eſcaped the blow. Long we fought, without the leaſt advantage on either ſide, till a deep wound which he received in the ſword arm, cauſed him to drop his falchion.</p>
               <p>"My life is yours," he exclaimed, "take it!"</p>
               <p>"I replied, no! although the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked manner in which you attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me would authorize ſuch a deed, yet

               <p>"He was about to return his thanks, when I obſerved a body of men iſſue from a grove at no great diſtance, and haſten towards us.

               <p>"I found by the deference paid him, he was their captain. His hurt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red aſſiſtance; and ſeeing I was fatigued he begged I would accompany him to his cave, where I ſhould be welcome to paſs the night. Unable to ſuſpect a perſon who had behaved ſo nobly, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his invitation.</p>

"We walked till we came to a group of lofty rocks, and having wandered about half a mile in the midſt of them, entered this place. The chief having had his wound dreſſed ordered ſome refreſhment.

               <p>"Having finiſhed our repaſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.

               <p>"I thanked him for his kindneſs, but aſſured him my griefs were not within his power to cure.

Convinced by his manner he meant me well, I reſolved to truſt him with my hiſtory, which I had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er finiſhed, than in a fit of paſſion he cried, "Juſt heaven? are ſuch villains, the worſt of robbers, permitted to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the laſh of cenſure and rigour of the law, while miſerable wretches like

               <p>"FAINTLY can I picture the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations at that moment, in which all remembrance of my paſt ſorrows were for a time ſuſpended. The miſt of night was fleeting faſt, while in the eaſt the ruddy tinted ſky announced the arrival of the god of day, and caſt its influence on the boſom of the ocean. The air after ſo long confinement I could ill bear: ſtill the neceſſity of my quick departure gave me freſh vigour, and urged me on. I travelled towards my caſtle, and at length the turrets of my manſion ſhewed themſelves, when the appearance of an aged peaſant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to make towards him, and I quickly recognized his features; his

               <p>"Indeed!" anſwered I, "and was it always ſo?"</p>

               <p>"I ventured to diſcover myſelf, and his joy at ſeeing me was extreme, but was ſuddenly checked by recollecting where I was.</p>

"Hold!" I interrupted, "for my life I care not; know you any tidings of my ſon?"</p>
               <p>"I know but little," returned the peaſant, "'twas here believed you were aſſaſſinated; a ſhort time after, Sir James ſent for your ſon to Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and garriſoned the caſtle with his own followers, diſcharging yours.

               <p>"What could I think? From his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human treatment to me, what could I ſuppoſe but you were no more?</p>

But after a time, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had by ſome involuntary crime, drawn down the vengeance of heaven on me and mine; ſo I imagined the only method to reconcile the Deity, would be by performing ſome action that might appear laudable to him, and nothing ſeemed more ſuited than

undertaking a pilgrimage to the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I therefore provided myſelf with a habit for the purpoſe, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced my journey, having ſworn the old man never to divulge his knowledge of my exiſtence, and was accompanied by his good wiſhes,</p>
               <p>"Long, long and tedious was the way: unprotected from the ſcorching heat of the Aſiatic ſun, I wandered, and having reached the deſtined ſpot, performed my miſſion. I then traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the eaſtern continent, ſtill in Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's weeds, and afterwards return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Europe, moſt part of which I croſſed. At Italy, I met with ſome more of my own calling, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed making the tour of England. I accompanied them, and being ſo near my native country, I was by an invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary impulſe compelled to viſit it. I ſought the caſtle of Wallace, and claimed entertainment there; I learned from the converſation of the domeſtics, you had been reared by your uncle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

a ſhort time previous, when you had abſconded with the daughter of Sir James.</p>
               <p>"I laſt night threw aſide my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and entered his room: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly remembered my features, but ſuppoſing me dead, imagination cauſed him to conſider me as the ſpirit of the brother he had ſo much wronged. I had this night retired to the cloſet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining his apartment, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſcloſe myſelf, and ſeek to ſoothe him to repentance, when the words I heard convinced me you were my ſon; and I will no more complain of the ſickle goddess, ſince you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to me."</p>
               <p>Here the Lord Glencairn concluded his narration.</p>
               <p>On the following day the cavern was ſearched; they removed the rubbiſh and entered the paſſage; the noiſes which had been heard were again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030954_0181_0FEA09B1521541D8"/>
At length they diſcovered ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral cells, and delivered innumerable captives who had long groaned in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and whoſe appearance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for the diſturbances experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Eldred and his father, while in confinement. They moreover ſecured the banditti, and reſigned them to the rigour of the law. In ſhort, juſtice was again practiſed, and the whole neighbourhood rung with the names of Eldred and Glencairn.</p>
               <p>It is now proper to mention Donald, whom we left a laurelled conquerer at Roxburgh. Fluſhed with conqueſt, and rendered more arbitrary from the fevorable opinion entertained of him by the queen, he repaired to the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and Jane ſtill perſiſting in her refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of his hand, he reſolved by force to make her his. His confeſſor, who for the conſideration of a little yellow droſs, cleanſed his ſoul, and gave him a abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appeared a proper perſon. Choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dead of night, by force he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030954_0182_0FEA09CFEB6B6EC8"/>
the chamber of his intended vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, attended by his ſacerdotal friend and bade her yield her hand.</p>
               <p>The unhappy maid upon her knees, intreated death in preference; conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by every ſolemn argument to refrain from his deſign. But as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually might the trembling lamb plead for life to the voracious wolf, as ſhe have ſoftened Donald's inflexible mind.</p>
               <p>"Thy prayers are vain, weak maid," he cried, "I am preparing for thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. What canſt thou wiſh for? If power, my wide domains will give thee that, accompanied by wealth; if love, behold me now, though with the ſmooth and artful tale of hypocrites I cannot plead my paſſion, yet at thy feet I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay my heart."</p>
               <p>"Hold!" exclaimed Jane, "Diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling villain? too well I ſee through thy poor artifice: but here, in the ſight
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030954_0183_0FEA098169933BF8"/>
of heaven, I ſwear I will never be thine!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, my ſaucy dame?" return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Baron, "we'll try thy boaſted perſeverance. Come father, execute your office."</p>
               <p>The prieſt had juſt begun the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, when they were ſtartled by loud and reiterated jars againſt the caſtle gate. Donald himſelf appeared care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of this unexpected intruſion, and again ordered the monk to proceed. He did ſo, and the irrevocable ring was about to be placed on the tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hand of Jane, when the chamber door was violently burſt open, and an armed warrior ſtood before the aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed Donald!</p>
               <p>"Monſter!" ſaid the ſtranger, "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the lady, and oppoſe the ſtrength of one more equal to thee!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:030954_0184_0FEA09BC04144020"/>
So ſaying, he immediately aſſailed the Lord of the Iſles: their ſwords caſt round a dreadful gleam, and victory ſeemed doubtful; when fortune, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her wheel out of its uſual track, a thing too rare, favored the juſter cauſe; the unknown cavalier diſarmed his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, who was now entirely in his power.</p>
               <p>"Thy life is fairly mine," exclaimed the conqueror, "but let the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I extend to thee, teach thee to practice mercy to thy enemies. Live and repent!"</p>
               <p>Jane, who had been an anxious ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator of the combat, was wrapped in ſilent gratitude, when the ſtranger raiſing his beaver, diſovered the face of her loved Glencairn. The ſudden change from deep deſpair to joy depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her of all power, and ſhe ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſate into the arms of Eldred.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:030954_0185_0FEA09C5CAD9F058"/>
By this time the Lord Glencairn joined his ſon; they uſed their endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in reſtoring Jane, and at length ſucceeded; when the latter introduced her to his father, who received him with a parental affection.</p>
               <p>During theſe tranſactions, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the two Noblemen entirely vanquiſhed the retainers of Donald; they ſearched the caſtle, and gave liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Edric, who was joyfully received by the young Lord Eldred; and in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon had found Andrew, but in a very weak condition.</p>
               <p>"Here," ſays one of the officers, "is a priſoner, but he ſeems to be in ſo bad a ſtate, that were he releaſed, he would ſcarce be able to leave the place."</p>
               <p>"You are miſtaken," replied the Squire, "were my priſon doors now open, notwithſtanding the pain theſe ſteel ornaments with which they have honored me, have cauſed, I could ſkip

away as nimbly as a flea over a Friar's noſe."</p>
               <p>They liberated and conducted him to his maſter; his groteſque appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance excited a ſmile on the features of his ſpectators: his red beard was grown to an enormous length, and from the dirt which was gathered therein, gave him more the reſemblance to a demon than a human being. Immediately on his entrance, he cried; "Ah, my Lord, is it poſſible it is you? Alas? you thought your cares were all over when laſt you quitted this infernal dwelling, but you are ſo precipitate; recollect an old proverb that I oft repeated to you; <hi>An ounce of diſcretion is worth a pound of wit!</hi> By the maſs there ſtands old Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, alias Donald! the laſt time I ſaw him <hi>he looked as hot as if he had been eating Tewkſbury muſtard.</hi>"</p>
               <p>"Silence," replied Eldred, (then preſenting his father) "do you know this perſon, Andrew?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:030954_0187_0FEA097DA79A1B78"/>
"Hey! what! Oh, a ghoſt! a ghoſt!"</p>
               <p>"No my honeſt fellow," returned Archibald, "I am no ghoſt!"</p>
               <p>"Huzza! huzza!" cried the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed Squire, "he's alive."</p>
               <p>"Andrew," ſaid Clencairn, "for your fidelity to my ſon, you ſhall be rewarded. I will place you—"</p>
               <p>"Not in the army, I hope my Lord," interrupted Andrew, believe me, I ſhall make but a pitiful ſoldier. I have ſo great an antipathy to ſteel, that I would not be taylor to his majeſty, merely becauſe I ſhould have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obliged to handle a needle."</p>
               <p>"Fear not," exclaimed his maſter, "your poſt ſhall be exempt from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger."</p>

                  <pb n="188" facs="unknown:030954_0188_0FEA09CA01F59258"/>
"I thank you, my Lord," replied his ſervant, "that poſt will juſt ſuit me."</p>
               <p>They now prepared to depart, and having ſentenced the prieſt to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual impriſonment, and pardoned Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald, (who lived many years a ſincere penitent) they purſued their journey to Aberdeenſhire. In the way, Eldred informed Jane of her father's death, at which ſhe betrayed evident marks of grief: they however ſought to conſole her by ſaying, that on her arrival ſhe would meet with one, who would more than make reparation for her loſs.</p>

               <p>The ſtranger fell upon her neck, and they mingled their tears of love and tenderneſs; while the drop of ſympathy more precious than the indian pearl, ſell from the eyes of Eldred and his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Jane inſtantly recognized the figure ſhe had ſo often ſeen at old Maud's.</p>
               <p>All now was happineſs at the caſtle, ſave that the breaſt of Eldred was touched with remorſe for his ungrateful

conduct to the hermit. He could not bear to ſuffer in the opinion of ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a creature, and inſtantly diſpatched a meſſenger in queſt of him. His let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaid.</p>
               <p>"THE perſon he had ſo hoſpitably entertained at his cell was now reſtored to happineſs, and wiſhed the anchorite to ſhare his joy."</p>
               <p>Jane entreated her parent to relate, by what ſtrange means ſhe had been torn from her, and why ſhe ſo long took up her abode at the cottage of Maud.</p>
               <p>"Alas! my child," replied Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, "I have ſuffered much: my hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is unentertaining, and my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes have been ſolely created by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious man. My father, heaven reſt his aſhes, firſt forbade me to love the youth to whom my heart was ſo firmly attached, that even now the paſſion lurks at my breaſt. Compelled to marry one who bore me not the leaſt

affection, who ſought my alliance to gratify his avarice, who drove me from my native land, and immured me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the lofty walls of a mouldering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Carol was the perſon he fixed on to conduct me."</p>
               <p>"Villain!" exclaimed Glencairn, "he has eſcaped too well! On hearing I was alive, and with my ſon, in the apartment of his Lord, he fled. Oh! had he fallen into my power, the moſt galling cruelties tyranny ever invented had been his!"</p>
               <p>"Happy am I," returned Lady Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, "he is not. If the Almighty think fit to ſpare him, and grant him leiſure for repentance, ſhall man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it?"</p>
               <p>"But to reſume my tale. He lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in the convent, the abbeſs of which for ſome time, treated me with tenderneſs and affection; at length ſhe hinted a diſtant wiſh that I ſhould take

the viel; but finding I would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand her, ſhe ſpoke more plainly, I then peremptorily refuſed; ſince when ſhe endeavored by every rigorous means to compel me, but in vain. I rather would have fallen a ſacrifice at the altar, than offer a divided heart to heaven.</p>
               <p>"My life was now become a burden to me, when I recollected an old french ſoldier, who daily implored charity at the grate. I reſolved on bribing him; I told him frankly the treatment I had received, and promiſed him a purſe of gold, if he would aſſiſt me in making my eſcape, and that he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the garden wall in the duſk of the evening. He aſſured me of his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, vowed to die in my ſervice, and moreover offered to accompany me till I was aſſured of my ſafety.</p>
               <p>"At ſun ſet I equipped myſelf with a Friar's habit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with in the courſe of the day,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030954_0193_0FEA095A1A2F9918"/>
and was ſuffered by the porter to depart without the leaſt ſuſpicion. My truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoldier was waiting for me, and we took a long leave of the convent.</p>
               <p>"He procured me a paſſage in a veſſel bound for Scotland, for which place I embarked, after having reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and landed ſafely in my native country. I inſtantly repaired to the cottage of Maud, where I have ſince tarried, and conſoled myſelf by being near you, my daughter. I am the perſon who was introduced to you by the good old woman, on the morning of your elopement: I am the object who cauſed your terror at the cavern, by addreſſing you, and who have ſince beheld your couſin Eldred there. He ſought to overtake me, but the mazes and windings of the rocks favored my flight, and I eſcaped him.</p>
               <p>"My reaſon for theſe walks was, that as I was fearful of being ſeen, which I muſt have been, had I ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030954_0194_0FEA09CD984F7AF0"/>
out by day light, I embraced the hour of darkneſs to enjoy the freſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorating air. On the rumour of Sir James's deceaſe, of Eldred ſucceeding him in the eſtate, and that my brother lived, I haſtened to the caſtle. Time had not ſo much altered the lineaments of a ſiſter, but that I was known, and received with ſuch unfeigned marks of affection, that a life of gratitude will ſcarce repay what I owe."</p>
               <p>"No more of that," ſaid Archibald, "our hours of miſery, I truſt, are paſt; be thoſe to come, of joy!"</p>
               <p>In a few days Eldred's meſſenger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, announcing the arrival of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ambroſe. The young Lord hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out from the company to welcome him, and preſently returned leading in the hermit, who no ſooner entered the apartment, than he ſunk lifeleſs upon the floor.</p>
               <p>

All ran to him, and were buſy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving him: at laſt they ſucceeded in their endeavors, and on ſeeing Lady Wallace, he exclaimed, "Gracious heaven! Matilda!"</p>
               <p>The well known voice ſtruck con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to her heart, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many years they had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from each other, ſhe ſtraightway knew her Alan! her beloved Alan! whom ſhe ſuppoſed to have periſhed in the Gallic wars.</p>
               <p>They renewed their vows of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love. Glencairn welcomed him as the companion of his youth; while Jane and Eldred ſtood wrapped in won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the ſcene.</p>
               <p>They all removed to the caſtle of Glencairn, where, after the tedious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of a year from the death of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, Alan Duntrone received the hand of his widow, and at the ſame time El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred was bleſt with his lovely Jane.</p>

The antique pile now rung with mirth and feſtivity. Bonfires blazed; the mantling juice of the grape ſwelled on the hoſpitable board; the pliant fingers of the bards flew o'er the ſtrings of the ſoul-ſubduing lyre, while their tongues alternately rehearſed the deeds of wariors, and conſtancy of maidens.</p>
               <p>The caſtle of Wallace was convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an alm's houſe, where age and infancy met with a ſanctuary from the iron gripe of indigence, and of which the philoſopher Andrew was conſtituted governor.</p>
               <p>Edric was maintained as the Squire of Eldred; Duncan, the ſon of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as his ſteward: Maud enjoyed a conſiderable penſion from the purſe of Eldred. In ſhort, no one who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his welfare went unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Duntrone, with his lady, reſided at the manſion of his anceſtors; Eldred

and Jane at the caſtle of Lord Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cairn, who grew old amidſt a numerous offspring of grand-children.</p>
