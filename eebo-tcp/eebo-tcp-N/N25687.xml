            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>CAROLINE OF LICHTFIELD<note n="*" place="bottom">Not Lichtfield in England, but Litchfield, a ſuppoſed Pruſſian title.</note>.</head>
                  <p>THE Baron of Lichtfield was High Chamberlain and Miniſter of State to the King of Pruſſia. "Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line," ſaid he to his daughter, as they one day ſat at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, "tell me, (the Baron had an inſinuating ſmile as he ſpoke, with ſomewhat of penetration in his look) tell me, dear Caroline, is thy heart free?"</p>
                  <p>"Sir!"</p>
                  <p>Caroline did not immediately comprehend his meaning.</p>
                  <p>"It is two months ſince I brought thee to court, from the retreat in which thou hadſt been educated; and haſt thou ſeen nobody in that ſhort ſpace, no young courtier, to whom thy heart would give a preference?"</p>
                  <p>Caroline was but ſixteen, and the queſtion was of that kind that uſually embarraſſes, when addreſſed to a virgin of ſixteen. Caroline, however, might reply without dread or heſitation. Her young boſom, as pure and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil as in the ſerene and jocund days of infancy, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſighed, except for pleaſures innocent and pure as it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A new blown roſe, a favorite bullfinch, or a fairy tale, had, hitherto, been the general limits of her hopes and fears. Theſe pleaſures, indeed, ſince ſhe had come to court, had been ſomewhat ſuperſeded by a ball, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, or a new-faſhioned cap; but that man might influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the happineſs of her life had never yet entered her imagination. Thoſe who were the beſt and moſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable dancers, certainly, gave her the greateſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while at an aſſembly; but, the ball over, Caroline could ſweetly ſleep twelve hours together, awake with a ſong, and prepare for a new appointment, without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the partner with whom ſhe laſt had danced.</p>

Liſten to me ſeriouſly, Caroline," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, drawing his chair cloſer to hers, and tenderly claſping her hand. "You have the misfortune to be the only daughter of the High Chamberlain of Pruſſia, and heireſs to twenty-five thouſand crowns a year."</p>
                  <p>The mixture of irony and ſatisfaction viſible in his countenance, though unſeen by Caroline, while rehearſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his titles and eſtate, proved, too powerfully, that theſe his misfortunes were his ſupreme pleaſures. But it was neceſſary to his preſent purpoſe to aſſume a philoſophic, a diſintereſted, and a ſentimental air, thereby to inſpire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and, by affecting the paſſions, to read the heart, and induce obedience. This was the more eaſy for him to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in that he was not only perfectly a courtier, but had a degree of natural eloquence, which ſupplied the want of a ſound underſtanding, or a feeling heart. Beſides, it is not eaſy, at ſixteen, to diſcover the face of honeſty from the maſk, eſpecially when a father ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>The word misfortune, however, had ſomewhat ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Caroline; who, thinking ſhe perhaps had miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, repeated, ſmiling, "Misfortune, papa!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, misfortune, my child," replied the Baron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently affected. "I ſee, with pleaſure, you know not as yet all the conſequences of theſe ſeeming bleſſings, for this informs me you ſtill remain ſuch as I could wiſh you to be."</p>
                  <p>A thouſand confuſed ideas were croſſing and combating one another in the mind of Caroline. Misfortune and herſelf had never before been united in her imagination: the idea for a moment made her melancholy, and ſhe ſtood with downcaſt eyes, unconſciouſly plucking the leaves of a roſe, which ſhe held in her white and virgin hand.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my dear daughter," ſaid the Baron, riſing, and gravely walking the room, "it is often one of our greateſt misfortunes to be born of noble parents, and to be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of vaſt domains. The chain, I ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034126_0004_0FFA1BAE0A28F7A8"/>
aſſuming a cheerful ſmile of benig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ear ſhall hang lightly, and be ever worn with grace and pleaſure."</p>
                  <p>The Baron pauſed, and Caroline looked up, vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to comprehend to what this his preface tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He continued:</p>
                  <p>"My dear girl, the firſt wiſh of my heart has ever been thy felicity. Long have I foreſeen (the Baron ſighed, but the Baron was a courtier), long feared, that not on me, but on a Monarch, whoſe power is abſolute, and muſt not be controverted, thy deſtiny would depend — No, not on a tender father! To avoid, therefore, heaping on thee the diſtreſs, the torment, of combating affections which may not be conſulted, ever ſince the death of thy mother I have committed thy education to a friend, whoſe care and retired ſituation have preſerved thy heart free. I have ſacrificed the ſweet pleaſure of living with my child, of ſuperintending her education, and being myſelf delighted with her progreſs, to her future happineſs; and if I have ſecured this happineſs, my ſelf-denial will be more than repa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, my dear dear father!" cried Caroline, kiſſing the Baron's hand, which ſhe moiſtened with her tears, unable to expreſs her ſenſations. Somewhat ſhe would have added, but he interrupted her.</p>
                  <p>"The moment is arrived, my daughter, in which the ſucceſs of all my precautions muſt be aſcertained. Two months ſince (thou we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t then at Rindaw) the King told me he ſhould with pleaſure behold thee united to the Count of Walſtein, his known favorite, and his preſent ambaſſador to Peterſburgh. Notwithſtanding that this marriage might even exceed the utmoſt wiſhes of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I alleged thy great youth, in hopes to ſee the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony deferred, and longer to enjoy thy company, longer to behold thee a part of myſelf.</p>
                  <p>"The King replied, thy ſociety I might and ſhould enjoy as ſoon as thou wert married. Caroline, ſaid he, muſt now be ſixteen; it is time ſhe ſhould come to adorn my court, and make my Walſtein happy. He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn immediately from his embaſſy; ſend, therefore, for your daughter, and the nuptials ſhall as immediately take place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:034126_0005_0FFA552D33C839C0"/>"I could make no reply to a command ſo preciſe; and, is thou knoweſt, I directly came and brought thee hither. But ſcarcely had we returned before I learnt the Count was fallen dangerouſly ill on the road, and that his arrival and our intents were, for a while ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. I, therefore, thought it uſeleſs to ſpeak to thee of a marriage which, perhaps, might never take place; and I was willing to ſee thee enjoy, for a moment, the ſweet illuſions of youth. Yeſterday evening, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Count returned, recovered from his illneſs, and the King ſent inſtantly for me, preſented my future ſon-in-law, and bade me prepare for this marriage with all poſſible ſpeed. Thou ſeeſt I could no longer delay to inform thee of the will of my ſovereign: thou ſeeſt, my child, thy deſtiny is fixed. My fear was that, during the two months thou haſt been at court, thy young heart might, unfortunately, have ſelected ſome one of the youths thou haſt ſeen there. Thus, what ſhould have been thy happineſs would then, have been thy miſery; but I ſee, with tranſport, thy heart is yet untouched; thy preſent ſimplicity and innocence are certain proofs, and my Caroline may now comply, may give me her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that ſhe will willingly become the Counteſs of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, and the Ambaſſadreſs of Ruſſia. Wilt thou not, my Caroline? Wilt thou not, my child?"</p>
                  <p>Theſe fine titles, emphatically dwelt on, dazzled the young fancy of Caroline. Aſtoniſhed, taken by ſurpriſe, and conceiving nothing ſo wonderful and ſo charming as all at once to become an Ambaſſadreſs, and a Counteſs, ſhe raiſed her charming blue eyes, and looking at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while they ſparkled with pleaſure—</p>
                  <p>"What," ſaid ſhe, in the ſimplicity of her heart, "ſhall I be all that, papa? Indeed I am exceedingly glad to hear it!"</p>
                  <p>Her natural good ſenſe, for ſhe had abundance, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reproved her: ſhe felt ſhe had rather ſpoken from the fulneſs of her heart than from prudent reflection; again her eyes were caſt down, and the blood roſe bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her cheeks, till they reſembled the roſe leaves ſhe had juſt been ſcattering. After a moments ſilence, ſhe timidly added, ſtill with downcaſt eyes,</p>
                  <p>"But I have never ſeen the Count, papa; and if I ſhould not love him?"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034126_0006_0FFA589E172A6B80"/>"You muſt marry him, notwithſtanding, my child," inſtantly replied the Baron. "We only aſk your hand; there is no authority, royal or paternal, which can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the heart."</p>
                  <p>This moral ſentiment was, no doubt, a very ſtrange one to come from the mouth of a father; but the Baron, we may well conjecture, had his reaſons for being thus relax.</p>
                  <p>Caroline replied, with ſurpriſe, "Indeed, papa, I do not underſtand you. Give the Count my hand and not my heart! No, really, papa, I do not underſtand you!"</p>
                  <p>"You will do before you have lived ſix months at court," replied the Baron, as he roſe. (Another proof, this, that the Baron was a courtier.) "But this is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our preſent purpoſe. Give me thy promiſe, thy ſolemn promiſe, my Caroline, that thou wilt fulfil the engagement I have entered into in thy name. I am wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for at court; I will announce thy conſent, dine there, and return, this evening, with the Count. Go, dreſs thyſelf, and prepare to receive the man who is ſhortly to be thy huſband."</p>
                  <p>After having received the ſolemn promiſe of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and tractable Caroline, and tenderly kiſſed her, he departed, well ſatisfied with his negotiation.</p>
                  <p>The reader, perhaps, may expect that the ſweet Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, left alone, would then, immediately, have abundance of ſerious reflections on all that had paſſed; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on the approaching marriage. For ſix-and-twenty theſe would have afforded ſufficient ſubject for a whole morning's contemplation; but, at ſixteen, the mind does not dwell ſo long on the ſame ſubject. Truth, however, obliges us to remark that Caroline, after the departure of her father, remained full ten minutes in the ſame place and attitude; which certainly was a thing ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
                  <p>At length, finding ſhe had ſo many things to think on that ſhe could abſolutely think on nothing, and that the ruſhing ideas floated and whirled into confuſion, ſhe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtarted up, ran to her piano forte, and played co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillons and country dances, <hi>preſto preſtiſſimo,</hi> for a full half hour.</p>
                  <p>Now, while ſhe was playing, it happened naturally enough to ſtrike her active imagination, how delightfully
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034126_0007_0FFA1A3315BAF148"/>
the Count would dance them all with her; "and it will be quite charming," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "to continually have a partner at one's command."</p>
                  <p>Dance!—His Excellency dance!—Yes, to be ſure; his Excellency dance: for the Baron had been very careful to inform her that, notwithſtanding his high rank, great dignity, and that he was alſo an Ambaſſador, he ſtill was not above thirty; which circumſtance, it is very probable, pleaſed her full as much as all the aforeſaid titles, dazzling as they were: for though this was nearly twice the age of Caroline, ſhe had remarked that men of thirty, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of ſixteen, are a kind of cotemporaries.</p>
                  <p>Thus, forming the project of dancing everyday, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould be the miſtreſs of her own houſe, ſhe ran to the garden to gather a noſegay. There, as ſhe plucked the flowers, ſhe ſaw ſeveral beautiful butterflies wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from bud to bud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, delighted with the reſtleſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, and their various hues, and vivid tints, began, with ardour, to purſue them: till, ſomewhat heated and fatigued, without having had the good fortune to catch a ſingle fugitive, ſhe conſoled herſelf with ſuppoſing the Count, more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble and active than her, would catch them for her. "Beſides," ſaid ſhe, ſkipping back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the houſe, "we ſhall be very unfortunate, indeed, if we can't both of us entrap them."</p>
                  <p>The hour of dreſſing ſucceeded, and, while at her toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, the idea of jewels, new dreſſes, equipage, balls, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, and aſſemblies, preſently made her forget the butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies: for, with the lively, the innocent, and the happy Caroline, one pleaſure came but to efface another.</p>
                  <p>"O yes," ſaid ſhe, "I well know Ambaſſadors' ladies are invited every where, are dreſſed like queens, and are envied by the whole world. Inſtead of ſimple flowers, I ſhall have cluſters of diamonds adorning my hair; my dreſſes ſhall be all the moſt fanciful and elegant ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and I will put them on with a grace that ſhall charm every eye, and win every heart."</p>
                  <p>Thus, the conjugal felicity of Caroline, founded on dreſs, dancing, and butterflies, ſeemed to her the moſt certain of all certain things: ſhe already beheld herſelf the happieſt of women, employed every moment to embelliſh her perſon, and enchant her Ambaſſador, and expected
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034126_0008_0FFA58AC9421CF00"/>
him with an impatience unchecked by any fear, except that of not appearing ſufficiently handſome in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>As for him, ſhe was well aſſured he would pleaſe her infinitely; for, innocently thoughtleſs as ſhe appeared, ſhe ſtill had her moments of reflection; and, all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances again and again conſidered, had fully perſuaded herſelf the Count was the moſt charming man in the world.</p>
                  <p>He was the King's Favorite! Her father had told her ſo; and the word Favorite was moſt extenſive and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant to the imagination of Caroline. She, in the country, had likewiſe had her little court, and her little Favorites; there was her favorite bird, her favorite lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog, her favorite lamb, and theſe were all the prettieſt creatures of their kind, ſhe had ever beheld; wherefore, there could be no doubt but the Favorite of a King muſt be the Phoenix of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Of all this ſhe was ſo perfectly convinced, ſo happy, and ſo rejoiced to think ſhe ſhould ſee him, that, when her maid came to tell her he was come, and that her father waiting for her, ſhe made but one ſkip from the glaſs to the door; where finding the High Chamberlain, who earneſtly bade her to remember her promiſe, he took her by the hand, which trembled with pleaſure and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between his, and, exorting her to be very prudent, and behave with great propriety, led her to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which was the Favorite of the King.</p>
                  <p>They entered, Caroline looked, and no ſooner ſaw, than, inſtantly hiding her eyes with her hands, ſhe gave a piercing ſhriek, and diſappeared like a flaſh of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at midnight.</p>
                  <p>Now, while the father follows, while he employs the whole force of paternal eloquence to calm and make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline return, let us give the outline of the picture that thus had terrified; let us juſtify the young and innocent Caroline.</p>
                  <p>The Count of Walſtein was, in f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct, little more than thirty; but an enormous fear on one cheek, a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance exceſſively meagre and of a livid yellow, round ſhoulders, and, inſtead of hair, a periwig, made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at leaſt fifty. His large black eye was fine; but, alas! it was ſingle; he had but one, the other a bullet had extinguiſhed. Nature deſigned him for a tall and well-proportioned man, but a habit of ſtooping had prevented
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034126_0009_0FFA554314642B48"/>
her intent. He had one very good leg; but this huſband, who was to dance from morning to night, and aid Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line to catch butter-flies, walked with difficulty, and limped exceedingly on the other.</p>
                  <p>Such was the exterior appearance of Walſtein, and we ſhall hereafter ſee how far the mind correſponded with the body, We have ſaid enough, at preſent, to paliate the emotion and the flight of Caroline. Perhaps, we will not ſay but that, had ſhe taken time to conſider and examine, ſhe might have found an air of grandeur, and a ſomewhat of benevolence, characterizing this uncouth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. But ſhe ſaw only the fear, the one eye, the round ſhoulders, the periwig, and the limping gait. She had received the firſt impreſſion, and, almoſt fainting in her apartment, Caroline ſcarcely heard her father's menaces and prayers to return. Her only anſwer was a torrent of tears, and her ſtruggles to overcome the ſhock, rather increaſed than repelled her diſorder.</p>
                  <p>Her father, finding it impoſſible ſhe ſhould appear again at preſent, left her, and went back to the Count. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that this would certainly be the wiſeſt courſe, and that his daughter's ſudden illneſs would be ſufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
                  <p>He found his intended ſon-in-law exceedingly agitated at his reception, and too truly ſuſpecting the motive. But the High Chamberlain was ſo eloquent, ſo perſuaſive, when he had any purpoſe to obtain, and his oratory was ſo powerful on the preſent occaſion, that the Count was appeaſed; fully convinced that a violent head-ach, the conſequence of the preparations of that buſy day, which had ſuddenly ſeized Caroline, had been the ſole occaſion of her exclamation and her flight. It may be, even, that he feigned conviction. Who dare be reſponſible for courtiers? Hiſtorians, the moſt exact, by them may be deceived.</p>
                  <p>Be theſe things as they may, he took leave of the High Chamberlain, hoping to find the young lady recovered, and not liable to the ſame diſorder on the morrow; tho' it is very certain, Walſtein found himſelf a good deal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by what had paſſed. Not that we will ſuppoſe him in love with Caroline, whom he had ſcarcely ſeen, but that this marriage was in many reſpects exceedingly ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his wiſhes and his views; inſomuch that he thought
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034126_0010_0FFA1C07907086D0"/>
the future happineſs of his life depended on it; not to mention the will and pleaſure of the King. This latter might be as ſtrong a reaſon for the Favorite as for the High Chamberlain; and the latter undoubtedly thought it irreſiſtable. We muſt own he would have been wiſe to have pre-informed his daughter of the perſon of the Count. He felt all this, and deeply regretted his want of foreſight; but it was too late. He imagined it beſt to extort a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from which ſhe would not dare to recede. Little had he foreſeen the effect of the firſt interview, or the terror of Caroline, which was doubled by the imaginary and beautiful picture ſhe had formed of the Count.</p>
                  <p>The moment he was alone, he returned, and found her juſt as he had left her. She had ſtill, however, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength to fall at his feet and implore his mercy, conjuring him, by every tender appellation, not thus to ſacrifice his child.</p>
                  <p>The High Chamberlain ſaw her emotion was too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for her to hear reaſon at that inſtant. We would not have the reader think it too ſtrange, but he was even affected himſelf, raiſed her with tenderneſs, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her to be calm, and to aſſure herſelf that her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was the utmoſt of his hopes, and that he would ſpeak with her on the ſubject the next morning; and, again exhorting her to be tranquil, leave weeping, and go to reſt, quitted her apartment.</p>
                  <p>The drowning wretch, 'tis ſaid, will catch at ſtraws. Caroline ardently ſeized this ray of hope, and her fears were almoſt huſhed to peace. Ah! thought ſhe, how good is my papa! How dearly he loves me! How deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is he to ſee me happy! Surely then, ſince it is his wiſh, he will not unite me to a monſter who has but one eye, whoſe legs do not pair, who is humpbacked, and who wears a periwig!</p>
                  <p>Caroline ſaw defects ten-fold defective: but ſuch is the nature of youth; its propenſities, its paſſions, its love, its friendſhip, its averſions are all extremes. At firſt ſhe thought herſelf loſt beyond recovery; at preſent ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined herſelf freed for ever from the Count, and as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly recovered the gaiety that had ſo ſuddenly fled.— Somewhat wearied, however, ſhe went to bed, reflecting on the ſtrange and ſingular taſte of Kings in the choice of their Favorites, and proteſting that, were ſhe a Queen, Walſtein never ſhould be hers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="unknown:034126_0011_0FFA1A4F012D8380"/>As ſound was her ſleep, and as gentle were her dreams, as if nothing had happened; and when the morning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, no ſtronger impreſſion remained than that which an ugly viſion ſometimes occaſions. Preſently her father entered, and found the ſame ſmile, the ſame ſweetneſs, the ſame infantine graces with which he was daily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Nay, ſhe was fonder, more attentive, more eager to oblige than uſual; and thanks for his condeſcenſion, of which ſhe entertained no doubt, were in every motion and in every look; though ſhe dared not retrace the paſt, her heart was all gratitude and joy for the future. Her father's behaviour increaſed it; for, inſtead of reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, his looks were all good nature, and kindneſs and ſmiles accompanied every expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Lovely girl! Sweet emblem of innocence, that, kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thou thinkeſt thou haſt a father, a tender father; thou art to learn that he is only a Miniſter of State and a High Chamberlain!</p>
                  <p>Let us, however, be juſt: except his titles, his places, and his penſions, of all things in the world the Baron certainly loved his daughter the beſt. Not to mention that he really thought, for ſuch was his manner of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was laying the foundation of her future happineſs by ſo high an alliance, ſo magnificent a marriage! made immediately under the auſpices of the King! and by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King! and to the Favorite of the King! and with the daughter of the High Chamberlain of the King!</p>
                  <p>Determined, therefore, to accompliſh his purpoſe, by prayer or by power, he thought it beſt firſt to try how far affection and tenderneſs might win. Taking, therefore, his daughter's hands, and tenderly claſping them between his own—</p>

thou, the darling of thy father's heart, be the cauſe of this his miſery? What talk I of miſery? His certain, his inſtantaneous death!"</p>
                  <p>The trembling, the tender, the affectionate Caroline, a thouſand times more terrified by this idea than ſhe even had been by the aſpect of Walſtein, ſhuddering, flung herſelf into her father's arms.</p>
                  <p>"I will obey, I will obey," repeated ſhe ſobbing. "Lead me to the altar this moment; lead me, if ſo it muſt be! Cauſe your death! I! God of Heaven forbid! Oh! my father, go immediately, tell the King to diſpoſe of me as he pleaſes; only let him reſtore his favour and friendſhip to my father. Yes, I promiſe, ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to ſubmit to his will; but do thou, alſo, my father, promiſe me not to die."</p>
                  <p>So ſtrongly had the idea of her father's death ſeized upon her imagination that ſhe feared leſt a moment's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay might make it certain. She would willingly have gone, even herſelf, and told the Count ſhe was ready to be his; and ceaſed not to intercede with the Baron to depart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, to the King; again engaging herſelf, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the moſt poſitive and unlimited, to be in all things obedient.</p>
                  <p>Once more left alone, ſhe thought no more of court balls, cotillons, or chaſing butterflies. With one hand hiding her eyes, mournfully reſting upon her elbow, and agitated by a thouſand ſtruggling ſenſations, ſhe remained motionleſs; incoherently dreading leſt the leaſt change or movement might precipitate her into the gulph that ſeemed gaping to receive her, and in which ſhe were then eternally ſunk. Filial affection, at length, came to her aid. Once more erect ſhe ſat, with ſelf-approbation rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when ſhe recollected that, by ſuffering herſelf, ſhe ſhould ſave her father. "I ſhall preſerve his honour, and, with his honour, his life," ſaid ſhe, with affection and admiration mingled: her own heroiſm inſpired the latter; and which a ſentiment ſo virtuous ever muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in a noble mind.</p>
                  <p>"Yet how dear muſt I pay for this!" continued ſhe, "and what ſhall my life be?"</p>
                  <p>Straight the image and figure of the Count preſented itſelf, and the father vaniſhed. Caroline ſhuddering, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled, and doubted whether yet ſhe ſhould keep her word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:034126_0014_0FFA1BC86423F7E8"/>In this attitude, in this agitation, ſhe continued, when her father ſuddenly returned, Joy exceſſive brightened in his countenance.

See, my Caroline, my child, my darling, what obedience is, and what ſhall be its reward."</p>
                  <p>Caroline, alas! thought not of rewards, but of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, and of the confirmation of the fearful ſentence ſhe herſelf had pronounced. Her father reproved her for not having employed the time of his abſence at her toilette. The day before, ſhe herſelf would have been very ſorry to have been caught by Majeſty in her preſent diſhabille; but, at preſent, this was become a trifle beneath thought; and ſhe waited, in expectation of her auguſt viſitor, without once caſting a look towards the glaſs.</p>
                  <p>The Baron was in his fourth repetition of the manner in which ſhe ſhould comport herſelf, when he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the rattling of the coach wheels. Up he ſtarted, ran to receive Majeſty, and left the trembling Caroline to the aſſiſtance of ſalts, and as much fortitude as ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could collect, for this interview of conſtraint and dread. The Monarch entered, followed only by his Favorite and his High Chamberlain, elate with joy, and inſtated with ſelf-applauſe.</p>
                  <p>"Beauteous Caroline," ſaid the king, as he advanced and preſented the Count, "be thou the recompenſe of the man who has rendered me ſo many important ſervices; and do thou, dear Walſtein, receive, from my hand, this lovely bride, whoſe worth, I am certain, thou wilt well know how to eſtimate."</p>
                  <p>The Count drew near, and, taking the half retiring hand of Caroline, begged her, with a low and timid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, kindly to confirm his happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Had the riches of the whole world, and all its Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, been proſtrate at the feet of Caroline, ſhe could not have articulated a ſingle word. Perhaps, had ſhe raiſed her down caſt eyes, and looked at the bridegroom, ſhe might have had ſufficient power to have ſaid no. But this ſhe very prudently avoided. She made a moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034126_0015_0FFA556A40003E80"/>
courteſy, and, at the king's deſire, ſat down in ſilence. This command was well timed: had ſhe been longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to ſtand, the ſcene of over-night might again have been repeated. A univerſal tremor had come over her; ſhe was obliged to have recourſe to her ſalts, and might ſtill, perhaps, have betrayed her feelings by a fainting fit, or a deluge of tears, had not a glance of her father, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf almoſt fainting at ſeeing her agitation, reſtored her all her fortitude: ſhe even forced a ſmile, to quiet his fears, and collected the reſolution to anſwer the King's conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending interrogation, by ſaying, ſhe was very well. Every thing was then placed to the account of country education and virgin timidity.</p>
                  <p>She hoped the company would retire, or, at leaſt, change the ſubject of converſation; but ſhe was deceived. To reſpect the feelings of their ſubjects is one of thoſe things that Kings underſtand the leaſt; and his Pruſſian Majeſty, delighted with the marriage he himſelf had made, could talk of nothing elſe. Totally inattentive to the ſuffering Caroline, he dwelt circumſtantially on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, firſt naming the day, then the hour, and then the place of performing the ceremony.</p>
                  <p>Unable to ſupport this any longer, Caroline, at length, made another effort, and begged permiſſion to retire. Her prayer was granted, and the Monarch did not neglect, as ſhe made her reverence, to ſalute her by the title of the Counteſs of Walſtein.</p>
                  <p>The youthful and wretched Counteſs, alone in her apartment, gave a full flow to affliction. Finding, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that tormenting reflection could not change her deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, <hi>that</hi> now being fixed beyond the power of reprieve, ſhe wiſely concluded ſubmiſſion was her only courſe; and to take ſuch advantage as her preſent ſituation might afford her beſt expedient.</p>

                     </gap>hat a young girl of ſixteen could reaſon thus prudently. Misfortune is a moſt able maſter; and a few hours of affliction, trouble, and terror, had taught Caroline more than years of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. She heard the coach of the King depart with much leſs emotion than ſhe felt at its thundering approach; and her father had the ſatisfaction to find her tolerably calm and reſigned, when he came to acquaint her with the royal arrangements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:034126_0016_0FFA58C49CE1FB60"/>The marriage was fixed for that day week; the Count had deſired it might be as ſecret as poſſible, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at his country ſeat, ſix leagues from Berlin; and, moreover, that the rejoicings, viſits, bride-favours, and preſentation of the Counteſs at court, ſhould not take place till the ceremony was over.</p>
                  <p>Caroline highly approved the Count's plan, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her father's permiſſion to paſs the intervening time in retirement. So well pleaſed was the Baron with her doc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lity, that, except breaking off the marriage, there was nothing ſhe could have aſked he would have refuſed; he therefore promiſed, and kept his word. Her ſolitude was uninterrupted, except by a few viſits from the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; and him the Baron undertook to hold in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Thus, while they were deep in politics, debating on matters of high moment, States, Empires, and Kings, Caroline was ſilently determining to execute the projects ſhe had formed.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not follow her through the many and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ideas which occupied her mind, during this peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential week; it is ſufficient for us to obſerve that ſhe might, truly, be ſaid to have thought more, in that ſpace of time, than ſhe had done in the whole courſe of her life. With the reſult of all this thinking we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently become acquainted.</p>
                  <p>Time paſſes away as well in pleaſure as in pain. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then the redoubted day, on which the ſate of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line was irrevocably to be fixed. She was prepared for it, and appeared perfectly reſigned. Her father was in ecſtacies, for he was now at the height of all his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honours. Majeſty, in perſon, intended to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his daughter to the altar. The High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, good man, would have been happy to have had the whole world ſpectators; but two Lords of the court, and their wives, were alone appointed aſſiſtants. He conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf, however, with the idea of the many fine things he ſhould have to relate on his return to Berlin. Off they ſet, for the country ſeat of the Count; and the tender bride, more thoughtful than melancholy, not only ſupported the journey exceedingly well, but even the marriage ceremony, which was immediately performed on their arrival: the Baron, wondering at, and bleſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034126_0017_0FFA557FAE594F88"/>
for, the dexterity and addreſs with which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the obedience of Caroline, had, at length, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible gratification of preſenting her to the King by the title of the <hi>Counteſs of Walſtein!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was the only moment in which the fortitude of Caroline had nearly forſaken her. Affected, agitated, by the careſſes of the High Chamberlain, who was unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his panegyric, ſhe owned ſhe deſerved not all this praiſe, and earneſtly ſupplicated him to ſpare her. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline had a delicate heart, on which every praiſe the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron beſtowed inflicted a freſh pang.</p>
                  <p>They were to return that evening to Berlin, there to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall the young Counteſs in her new dignity, as Lady of Walſtein Houſe; and they were already preparing to depart, when, taking advantage of the moment when the Count was ſtanding alone, concealed by the projecting of the window, ſhe went up to him, preſented a paper, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to read it with indulgence, and retired into an anti-chamber, where, ſhe told him, ſhe would wait for his anſwer, and his orders. Surpriſed as much as man could poſſibly be, the Count inſtantly opened the letter, and read:</p>
                  <p>"My Lord,</p>
                  <p>"I have obeyed. The abſolute commands of my father and my King have given me to you, and yours at preſent I am; wholly yours; I acknowledge no other maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You only have the right to diſpoſe of me, and from you I dare aſk and hope benevolence, indulgence, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. Yes, it is from him who juſt has ſworn to make me happy I now preſume to aſk what may aſcertain my happineſs, and, no doubt, his own. You know not, my Lord, cannot imagine, how much the young creature, to whom you but this inſtant gave your hand, is unworthy of that honour; how little reaſonable ſhe is, and how much a child; how much it behoves her to paſs whole years in that retreat where ſhe has been educated, and with that dear friend who has been to her a mother. Oh, conſent! I conjure you in mercy to conſent and ſuffer me this evening to return to Rindaw; there to wait till my reaſon has ſo far conquered prejudice that I may ſubmit, without expiring, to engagements I have formed. By doing this, you will enſure gratitute inexpreſſible, and, perhaps, accelerate that event. Your refuſed on the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034126_0018_0FFA58C99D060DC0"/>
contrary—Yes, be certain, your refuſal will, equally, and forever, deprive you of the wretched Caroline.</p>
                  <p>"I feel, moſt forcibly, the juſt reproaches I merit by acting thus. This letter ſhould not have been ſent now; but, had I explained what my ſenſations were before our union, I ſhould have hazarded the life of my father: at preſent I only hazard my own. He ſwore, ſolemnly ſwore, he could not ſurvive his diſgrace; and his diſgrace was inevitable if I did not become yours. Yours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I am, and the King now will reſt ſatisfied: for I dare hope that, ſhould he make my father reſponſible for my conduct, and ſhould this conduct offend him, you will have the juſtice to ſave my father, and inform him, that I alone am culpable. But certainly the King cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his want of zeal, or the unlimited obedience with which he is devoted to his will; neither will I complain, if you, only, will have the goodneſs to grant my preſent requeſt."</p>
                  <p>This letter, the offspring of a hundred, which had been written and torn during the preceding week, had been finiſhed that very morning before they left Berlin. If ever man was aſtoniſhed, confounded, thunderſtruck, it was the Count of Walſtein. He could not believe what he beheld. What! a young creature ſo timid, and ſo ſubmiſſive! Had ſhe a will of her own? And could ſhe declare what that will was with fortitude like this?</p>
                  <p>Again he read the paper, and pity preſently ſucceeded to ſurpriſe. He then ſaw ſhe had been the ſacrifice of deſpotiſm and ambition; and mortally reproached himſelf for being the object and the cauſe. Though we all may be ſomewhat deceived reſpecting our own perſonal attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and though the Count, like others, might not be wholly exempt from ſelf-illuſion, he ſtill did himſelf the juſtice to imagine he certainly had not been married for his beauty; but, from the poſitive aſſurances of the High Chamberlain, and the apparent reſignation of Caroline, he ſuppoſed, at leaſt, it had been witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Beloved,</hi> Walſtein would have added; but it was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt trying affliction. A mirror hung over the table at which he wrote; he looked in it and durſt not. Half opening the door of the anti-chamber, where Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line waited the ſentence of life or death, he gave in his ſhort anſwer, which ſhe tremblingly received, and inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſenſation of Caroline, when ſhe attempted to read, was dread; but this, as ſhe proceeded was preſently diſſipated, and when ſhe had ended ſhe was ſo ſurpriſed, ſo affected, ſo grateful, that ſhe had almoſt an inclination to recall the Count; but unfortunately for him, as ſhe looked through the window, ſhe ſaw him walking in the gardens with the King. Walking and broad day-light are little favourable to a man who limps in his gait, and whoſe face is disfigured by wounds. Could ſhe have read his billet, and forgot his perſon, the effect would have been different; her favourable ideas would not have been ſo eaſily effaced, nor would ſhe, ſo inſtantly, again have felt that impatient deſire of returning to her former retreat. Beſides, indeed, ſhe recollected it was too late; that ſhe had gone too far to recede, without appearing capricious and weak. While thus ſhe reflected, ſtill looking through the window at the Count, his billet crumbled away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her fingers, and, like the impreſſion it had made, was no more.</p>
                  <p>While Caroline was thus employed, the generous Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein was uſing all his influence with the King, over whoſe mind he had a wonderful aſcendency, perſuading him to conſent to the requeſt ſhe had made. He ſhewed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034126_0020_0FFA58D91890D950"/>
his Majeſty the letter, who, inſtead of anger, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf intereſted and affected by the ſtyle and reſolution of a girl ſo innocent and ſo young.</p>
                  <p>"There is energy in this young lady's character," ſaid the monarch, as he ended, and looking at the Count as he returned the letter.</p>
                  <p>He looked, and could not help acknowledging that his Favorite did not, altogether, poſſeſs that kind of form which the hoping fancy of ſixteen loves to contemplate. The recollection came a little too late, but the moment was favourable to Caroline, and he added—</p>
                  <p>"You are right, Walſtein. You muſt overlook this whim. She is a child, whom it will be beſt to indulge. She will ſoon be tired of her retreat; and as to the thing moſt eſſential, the fortune, it is yours. A man has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enough of his wife's company."</p>
                  <p>The Monarch was frank; but, ſtate ſecrets excepted, Monarchs take little trouble to diſguiſe their thoughts. Accordingly, the ſentence pronounced, the High Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain was ſent for, this new project communicated, and his daughter's letter ſhewn. He was, certainly, in a very high paſſion, but the preſence of Majeſty made him, apparently, ſomewhat calm: and, after hazarding a few objections, which were ſilenced, he was all acquieſcence. The King, indeed, who had never before ſeen him of a different opinion, thought it exceedingly ſtrange, and, likewiſe, ſomewhat preſuming, he ſhould be ſo at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; which thoughts he did not take the leaſt trouble to conceal. Whereupon the High Chamberlain, a little affrighted, made a moſt profound and reverential bow, ſupplicated pardon, and begged his Majeſty would diſpoſe of his daughter juſt as his Majeſty ſhould pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion of this conſultation was that Caroline ſhould return, that very evening, to Rindaw; where the Baroneſs and Canoneſs of that name, by whom ſhe had been educated, lived. Here ſhe had permiſſion to remain as long as ſhe pleaſed, concluding ſhe would ſoon be glad to return. A clauſe was, indeed, annexed, which ſeemed to render a long ſtay impoſſible; and this was, that the moſt profound and abſolute ſecrecy muſt be kept concerning the marriage. The King did not give his reaſons; indeed, Reaſon to Kings is a ſuperfluous thing, Will is ſufficient. It has, moreover, been ſaid, he was
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034126_0021_0FFA559425D64F50"/>
fearful leſt this hiſtory ſhould caſt ſome kind of ridicule either upon his High Chamberlain, or his Favorite, or, perhaps, even upon himſelf; but, we muſt own, this aſſertion is too improbable to be true.</p>
                  <p>Leave we theſe in the uncertainty in which we found them, and let us add that it was his Majeſty's command Caroline ſhould ſtill paſs by her own name, and that no individual ſhould know ſhe was the Counteſs of Walſtein. He went ſo far as to declare that, the moment the leaſt breath tranſpired, ſhe ſhould again beome ſubject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal power, and that her indiſcretion ſhould enſure the loſs of his favour. All this he ſaid, looking ſtedfaſtly at the High Chamberlain, who could not get the words out faſt enough to inform his Majeſty of the eternal ſilence he himſelf ſhould keep.</p>
                  <p>The King, likewiſe, preſſingly, recommended ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thoſe who had been preſent at the ceremony; who readily promiſed obedience, and who readily did not tell it—to above ſome thirty of their friends; and that under the moſt ſolemn promiſes it ſhould go no farther. Ah, happy Berlin! that thus, for a whole week, was plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſupplied with behind-fan whiſpers and corner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations!—"Do <hi>you</hi> know that Count Walſtein has married the High Chamberlain's daughter!—Is it poſſible?—Oh! the King himſelf was preſent!—Indeed! —Fact, I aſſure you! I had it from the firſt hand; but don't mention it; don't let my name appear," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus ran Rumour, or rather, thus ſhe flew; but as there was no farther confirmation of theſe whiſperings, as Caroline did not appear, as the Count returned quietly on his embaſſy to Ruſſia, as the High Chamberlain was diſcreet, and as, moreover, new ſecrets made the old for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, it was, at length, either not believed or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered.</p>
                  <p>Behold, then, the nuptial day concluded in a very different manner from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what might have been imagined. The Baron was required to inform his daughter that her requeſt was granted, and that ſhe had le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e to live retired at Rindaw. He was, likewiſe, to have conducted her thither himſelf; but Walſtein, fearing he ſhould ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t upon her that wrath which had been ſo much curbed by the King, was deſirous to bereave his young bride of ſo diſagreeable a travelling companion. He therefore, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034126_0022_0FFA58DE12E789E0"/>
purſuaded his dear father-in-law that it was moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to his intereſt not to leave the Court, in this critical conjuncture; and as the High Chamberlain had not the ſame taſte for retirement with his daughter, he thought proper to confide her to the care of truſty ſervants, and to ſend a letter by her to his dear friend the Baroneſs and Canoneſs, for ſhe was both, of Rindaw.</p>
                  <p>This Canoneſs, with whom we ſhall ſoon become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, was a moſt excellent lady in her way. She had formerly been deeply in love with the High Chamberlain who likewiſe, had himſelf been as much in love with her as it was poſſible for him to be; but reaſons of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, wealth, and ambition, ever deciſive with the High Chamberlain, had determined him to marry the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Caroline. The affectionate, the tender, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Baroneſs, thus croſſed in love, had vowed celibacy, became a Canoneſs, retired totally from the faſhionable world, and lived privately at her chateau. To meditate on her perfidious High Chamberlain, renew her vows of eternal fidelity, read novels and romances from morning till night, imagine parallels between herſelf and the hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the tale, to faunter in her gardens, and muſe for hours in lonely arbours, had been her mode of life for ſeveral years. This paſſion, ſo ſtrong, might be ſaid, at laſt, to periſh of inanity and want of food. Therefore, when her dear Chamberlain, become a widower, offered to recompenſe her conſtancy by marriage, ſhe was prudent enough to refuſe, alleging ſhe had totally loſt the habits of high life, and all reliſh for courts: which indeed was very true: but, pleaſed with the propoſal, ſhe promiſed eternal friendſhip, offered to take his daughter under her care, and educate her till the time of her marriage. We have before ſeen the motives which determined the Baron to accept this offer; and the rather, modeſtly added he, becauſe he really knew nothing of the education of a daughter.</p>
                  <p>It might be preſumed, our romantic Baroneſs knew, perhaps, as little as himſelf of the matter; but no; a few ridiculous ſingularities excepted, ſhe did not want under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and was really, and earneſtly, deſirous to fulfil the duty ſhe had undertaken. She had read much, had addicted herſelf to various uſeful ſtudies, and had become very capable of inſtructing her pupil, and of forming her heart and mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:034126_0023_0FFA55A76139CC60"/>Some remains we own there were of ancient habitudes; of a ſentimental and Quixote imagination: and this was the more pleaſant by being a ſingular contraſt to her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character, which was indiſcretion perſonified; though ſhe had an inexhauſtible goodneſs of heart. But it has been remarked that theſe two qualities are very frequently companions, and the Canoneſs was an inſtance of its truth. She was ſo frank, ſo unſuſpicious, ſo confiding, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much to talk, that it was not poſſible for her to keep a ſecret above half an hour. And, as for friends, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon ſhe ſaw might ſoon become her deareſt intimate.</p>
                  <p>Her reputation was ſo well known, even at court, and her indiſcretions ſo indubitable, that there was an abſolute prohibition laid on Caroline not to tell her the ſecret, as well as on the High Chamberlain. Caroline, who dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daily remonſtrances and perſecutions, was happy at the interdict.</p>
                  <p>The obedient Baron, ever ſubmiſſive to his Maſter's will, wrote, by his order, to the Canoneſs, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>age of his daughter being deferred for ſome time, he again confided her to the care of his dear friend, the Baroneſs.</p>
                  <p>Caroline, provided with this letter, took leave of her father kneeling for pardon and benediction. The High Chamberlain, well ſatisfied, High Chamberlain to remain, granted both the one and the other with a tenderneſs that did not come truly from the heart. He ſaw her depart for Rindaw, which was only ſeven or eight leagues thence, and ſoon after, returned himſelf to Berlin, with the King and the Ambaſſador.</p>
                  <p>Caroline could not help being ſomewhat ſurpriſed, at firſt, at ſeeing herſelf alone in one of the Count's carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Affected by her father's farewell and the quick ſucceſſion of events, it would be difficult to deſcribe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what paſſed in her mind; all there was tumult and diſorder, and ſhe ſcarcely knew whether it were better to rejoice or weep: all things happened as ſhe herſelf had deſired; but, perhaps, though ſhe did not confeſs that to herſelf, ſhe expected to meet with more reſiſtance; and Caroline was not the only perſon to whom the facility of obtaining a bleſſing had diminiſhed its value.</p>

"Here I am," ſaid ſhe to herſelf (and with a ſmall tincture of ſorrow was it ſaid), "Here I am, all alone, left by myſelf; I ſaid but a word, and my father, the King, and the Count, all three are agreed I may go as ſoon as I pleaſe. Is this indifference, anger or generoſity?"</p>
                  <p>In the midſt of theſe meditations ſhe recollected the ſhort billet ſhe had torn, and endeavoured again to recall every expreſſion, and every word. She ſaw the action of the Count, at laſt, in the moſt amiable, the moſt generous point of view; a tear ſtarted into her eye, and ſhe ſighed and ſaid, "What a pity it is he ſhould not be handſome!"</p>
                  <p>Her thoughts, mingled with regret, turned, occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards her father alſo, whom ſhe had forſaken, whom ſhe had afflicted, and a little, likewiſe, on the pleaſures ſhe had abandoned, and the ſounding titles ſhe might have borne.

At certain moments her head was half out of the coach to bid them drive back to Berlin; but theſe might be called moments of forgetfulneſs; the image of the Count returned, preſented itſelf, ſhe ſhrunk back, hid herſelf in the corner, and, congratulating herſelf on her eſcape, "No, it is impoſſible," ſaid ſhe, "it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ever could ſupport! I ſhould die with apprehenſion: and to ſee him every day, and all the day, and all the night! Oh! no, it is impoſſible!" Then did ſhe applaud her fortitude, and the manner in which ſhe had fulfilled her duty, ſaved her father's life, and preſerved her liberty.</p>

                  <p>This Lady idolized her pupil, and ſeemed to have transferred the tender affection ſhe once felt for the father to the child. When the Baron had come for Caroline, and had told the Canoneſs his intention to marry her, ſo great was her deſpair, and ſo violent the efforts of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that her health was injured; ſhe had been ill ever ſince; mirth, pleaſure, happineſs fled with Caroline.

peaſants, ſervants, the whole village, whoſe dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and friend ſhe was, ceaſed not to ſpeak of her, to ſigh for her, and to ſay they had loſt their angel and their protector.</p>
                  <p>Imagine, then, what was the joy of all theſe good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when, one evening, by the clear light of the moon, a coach drove through the village (a thing that ſeldom happened, at Rindaw), and ſtopped at the Chateau, and as it ſtopped, and as the eager inhabitants crowded to ſee what and who it was, Caroline, their beloved, their ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Caroline, appeared. Enraptured to behold her, for the ſmile and the fluſh of joy on Caroline's countenance acted with ſympathetic magic on them all, they knew not what to ſay, how to teſtify then feelings.</p>
                  <p>"Are not you glad, my dear friends," ſaid ſhe, "that I am come again to live among you; again am one of yourſelves Are you not glad to ſee me once more?"</p>
                  <p>Eager enthuſiaſm and tumultuous rapture ſpoke, but they ſpoke in confuſion; and, their cries reaching the ear of the Canoneſs, ſhe ran out to ſee what all this noiſe meant. She ran, and ſhe beheld—Yes, it was Caroline— Her beloved! Her child! Her darling! She was in her arms, and the ſweet tears of ſenſibility, unreſtrained, flowed plenteouſly.</p>
                  <p>"Mamma! Mamma! My dear Mamma, your happy Caroline is returned, never to leave you more!"</p>
                  <p>The Canoneſs was the daughter of Senſibility: her frame was ſlender, her habit ſickly, and her nerves deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Caroline was alarmed to ſee her ſo much affected, her joy amounted almoſt, to ſuffocation; but the effects of joy are not often fatal. She recovered by degrees, and began to inquire of her beloved pupil what enchantment had conveyed her thither. Caroline, without further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, gave her the letter of the High Chamberlain; ſhe read it, and wanted further information concerning this marriage deferred juſt at the moment of its concluſion.</p>
                  <p>"The laſt poſt," ſaid the Baroneſs, "brought me a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from thy father, which informed me the day was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—The day fixed!—Yea, it was this very day, I believe —Let me ſee—Yes, it was this very day—This is very ſtrange!—I declare it is the moſt ſingular adventure I ever heard of, and I delight in ſingular adventures—Tell me, tell me the whole, how was it?

                  <p>To come as near the truth, however, as poſſible, for falſehood and Caroline were natural foes, ſhe confeſſed that ſhe herſelf was the cauſe of delay, that ſhe could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the deformity of the Count, for which reaſon, ſaid ſhe, "they have granted me a reſpite, but I am certain I ſhall never change."</p>
                  <p>She then, by way of excuſe, gave her friend a portrait of Walſtein, which ſhe undoubtedly did not much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh.

My grand ſyſtem is that young people ſhould be moſt paſſionately enamoured with each other before they marry, for what elſe can make us ſupport the duties, fatigues, and pangs of the marriage ſtate?

                  <p>Caroline, embarraſſed, and burthened with her ſecret, with downcaſt eyes, ſilently liſtened to this inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of words; and the happy Canoneſs, who for three months paſt had been deprived of the pleaſure of ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at her caſe, took ample revenge and did not wait for an anſwer; ſhe only pauſed a moment for breath, and then, with an air of penetration in her eye, thus continued:</p>
                  <p>"But I believe, my child, it is not love that gave thee this fortitude and this reſiſtance—Is it?—Tell me, make me thy confidant; come, own thou haſt ſeen ſome one who has found the way to pleaſe thee better than the Count."</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" replied Caroline, with innocent ſimplicity, "all men can pleaſe me better than the Count."</p>
                  <p>"All! That is ſaying a great deal, indeed. But didſt thou never diſtinguiſh any one in particular? Haſt thou never ſeen the man for whom thou wouldeſt wiſh to live, and with whom thou wouldeſt wiſh to die? Has no one yet found a place in thy heart?"</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed, Mamma," ſaid Caroline, ſighing, "I am in love with nobody, nor is any body in love with me."</p>
                  <p>"Well, that is very ſingular! There are certainly then no longer men ſo handſome as thy father at court. But have patience, my dear, all in good time, the man will be found, I warrant; as for this Count, never let me hear his name mentioned, for thou never ſhalt be his wiſe, that I am determined."</p>
                  <p>The poor young Counteſs again replied only with a ſigh, kiſſed her dear Mamma, ſaid her friendſhip was all ſhe aſked, and retired to her old apartment to repoſe after the fatigues of a very trying day.</p>
                  <p>In the morning ſhe awoke, looked round, and ſcarcely knew where or what ſhe was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Good God!" ſaid ſhe, collecting her ideas, "Is it true, or is it a dream?

                  <p>Not all the flow of ſpirits natural to her age, not all that ſweetneſs and happineſs of temper natural to herſelf, could, for ſome time, baniſh this corroding idea from her mind: it empoiſoned her pleaſures, it robbed her of that gaiety and thoſe enlivening graces with her, formerly, ſo habitual. The indulgent Canoneſs, attributing her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to the privation of town pleaſures, feigned not to perceive it, and redoubled her cares and careſſes to make her retreat ſupportable. Not only the Canoneſs, but the ſervants, individually, and even the very animals, teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their joy at the return of their favorite, and the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal attachment they felt for her who had ſo often felt for them.

The High Chamberlain had another motive, indeed, for his ſilence; he hoped dulneſs would ſoon make her tired of her retreat; and Walſtein, remembering only how much pain it muſt coſt her to reply, was ſilent leſt he

Neither did he well know in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to treat a lady ſo young, whom he knew not, by whom he was unknown, and who he might well ſuppoſe thought him little leſs than an odious tyrant. Hoping every thing, therefore, from time and maturity of reaſon, he patiently waited their effects, and returned to Peterſburg and his duty. There, multiplicity of buſineſs and affairs of great importance occupied him ſo entirely, that we will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to affirm he did not even think the caprice of his young bride very fortunate; ſince, without laying a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on her inclinations, it placed her in that kind of retreat, during his abſence, which he himſelf would moſt have deſired, without, perhaps, daring to aſk.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of all this was, that Caroline had ſcarcely remained three months at Rindaw before all that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed appeared but as a dream; which ſhe ſcarcely could, and never wiſhed perfectly to recollect.

Reading was not neglected, and her natural good taſte led her to a proper choice of books. Her perſon kept pace with her mind, and advanced to angelic perfection. Each ſucceeding day ſeemed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome new grace, and, all beautiful as ſhe was one month, ſhe was evidently more beautiful the next. She grew taller, and her ſhape was ſo fine, each limb and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

ſo proportionate, her colour was ſo blooming, the white ſo pure, the red ſo tranſparent, her eyes ſo mild, ſo large, ſo expreſſive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo innocent and yet ſo animated, that it was a delight to look upon her. Virgin timidity ſhe had, but no ill-timed baſhfulneſs that makes even the form of beauty unmeaning: if the ſympathetic tale of feeling were told, the precious pearl of ſenſibility would brighten in her eye, and fall on her cheek; and if the poet, with ſublime hand, touched the lyre, genius would inſtantly ruſh on her imagination, animate her form, and illuminate her countenance.</p>
                  <p>Her voice too ſhe learnt to modulate, and it acquired a ſweetneſs and flexibility that, when ſhe ſang to the harp, or Spaniſh guitar, it was not poſſible to reſiſt thoſe mild emotions, thoſe delicious ſenſations, which ſhe ſo well could feel, and ſo powerfully inſpire.</p>
                  <p>To theſe, her talents, her graces and her gifts, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another; which, though perhaps not ſo eſteemed, is ſtill more uncommon, and not leſs captivating. There was an elegant ſimplicity and an air of dignity in her dreſs that ſeemed to make grace itſelf more graceful. Theſe, added to her bright auburn ringlets, profuſe in growth and flowing on her neck and ſhoulders, made her a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuch as the imagination ſcarcely can conceive, and ſuch as tongue or pen muſt never hope to deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>Yes, ſuch, and ſtill more beauteous, was Caroline, at ſixteen, while all theſe blooming ſweets ſeemed doomed to wither in the deſert air, unſeen, except by the homely village ſwains, unadmired, except by the good Canoneſs.</p>
                  <p>She, it is true, was all ecſtacy, and never ceaſed regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the happy times of knighthood, and enamoured che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers, when Caroline would have, undoubtedly, been the paragon of courts, the arbitreſs of tilts and tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the reward of valour that never had been equalled. How often did ſhe vow, as ſhe beheld her, ſilently appealing to every ſacred power, that the Count of Walſtein never ſhould be maſter of ſuch a profuſion of charms! How unappeaſeable, how enraged, how furious would ſhe have been, had ſhe known ſhe was already his, and that Caroline was thus improving, thus embelliſhing for him alone! A Prince, at leaſt, ſhe deſerved; but might the Canoneſs have choſen, it ſhould have been a huſband of romance, beauteous as Aſtolpho, faithful as Amadis, and tender as Celadon: neither could ſhe help

being aſtoniſhed to find that they did not come in crowds to Rindaw, to diſpute the hand of the lovely Caroline.</p>
                  <p>As to Caroline herſelf, ſhe was aſtoniſhed at none of theſe things, and only deſired to remain where ſhe was.

This was a very different ſort of ſenſation from that which her marriage had occaſioned; the one was painful and oppreſſive, the other ſo pleaſant, that, were it not for the efforts ſhe occaſionally made, ſhe could have remained whole hours in that kind of gentle trance which the gueſts of heaven only are ſuppoſed perfectly to enjoy.</p>
                  <p>In theſe happy occupations and ſtill happier dreams did winter glide away, for nothing makes time ſo ſhort as employing it well; and the return of ſpring began to add to her pleaſures, which, however, were cruelly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Her good Mamma, who ſo long had been lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, at laſt fell dangerouſly ill. To know how ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſhe was attached to the Canoneſs, to expreſs the greatneſs of her fears, and to imagine all the duties, cares, and attentions ſhe paid her, one muſt have the heart of Caroline. During her illneſs, which laſted almoſt a month, ſhe never quitted her bedſide, and it was with difficulty they could get her to repoſe a little while, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, in the ſame chamber. Let no one imagine that the fear of again falling into her father's or her huſband's power, if her friend ſhould die, occaſioned this ſevere grief. However natural ſuch a thought might be, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once entered her mind. Haraſſed by apprehenſion, abſorbed in ſorrow, wholly occupied by nurſing, and ſolacing, and ſearing for her friend, Caroline never once thought of herſelf.</p>
                  <p>No; had it been neceſſary, to reſtore life to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs, that Caroline muſt have yielded hers to the Count, ſhe would not have heſitated a ſingle inſtant. But, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, to this cruel proof ſhe was not put. Heaven, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her tears, attentive to her prayers, which never ſaint offered more ſincere, preſerved the life of her friend; the good Canoneſs recovered by degrees, to which reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the tenderneſs of Caroline did not, perhaps, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034126_0032_0FFA19E6F49453C0"/>
leſs than the preſcriptions of the phyſician; at leaſt, ſo the Canoneſs thought, and ſo ſaid, and therefore redoubled, if it were poſſible, her former attachment to the lovely girl who gave ſuch unequivocal proofs of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>During her illneſs ſhe received a viſit from the High Chamberlain. Alarmed, as he proteſted, at the dange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of his dear friend, he had flown to Rindaw. Some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have pretended this was not his motive, but that he had hoped to take back his daughter, and with her own conſent. Continually controverted in all his ſchemes, he, unfortunately, found the ſick lady ſomewhat better, and the attentive Caroline never out of her ſight, never leaving her for a moment, more powerfully fixed at Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw by her love for the Canoneſs than even by her fear of the Count. This, certainly, was not the time to mention returning, nor yet the place; wherefore not a hint was dropped, nor was the name of Walſtein once pronounced, who was ſtill at Peterſburg.</p>
                  <p>The Canoneſs, indeed, would have pronounced it if ſhe could, that is, if ſhe had been able to expreſs all the indignation ſhe felt at this marriage; but alas! ſhe was too weak, ſhe only juſt told the High Chamberlain that his daughter was an angel, that her life was preſerved by her affection and care, and that ſhe would, therefore, conſecrate her life to her happineſs. The Baron ſoon departed, informing them he ſhould pay them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſecond viſit in autumn. It was then he expected the return of the Ambaſſador, and he told his daughter he hoped to find her perfectly reaſonable and prudent.</p>
                  <p>At any other time a viſit from her father would have moſt powerfully brought to mind what Caroline moſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forget; but ſhe was then too much occupied by her cares for her friend, and had lately been too much agitated concerning her, to think of any thing elſe. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger effaces, or, at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or feebles the fear of future and Caroline was too happy to ſee the Canoneſs recovering to imagine ſhe ever could be miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Not but that, at the Baron's departure, the autumnal viſit he anounced with ſo much ſolemnity occaſioned a kind of dread ſhe could not overcome; and, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering the emotion ſhe might cauſe her convaleſcent, ſhe fell on her neck, kiſſed her checks, bathed them with her tears, and exclaimed, "O my dear, dear Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034126_0033_0FFA5609C9EF6560"/>
now you are reſtored to me, never will I leave you more, but live and die with you." Her friend, affected even to exceſs, returned her careſſes, and promiſed that, if poſſible, they would never ſeparate.</p>
                  <p>The fear of the moment over, peace again took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſoul of Caroline. She preſently forgot the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>tumnal viſit which was at ſo prodigious a diſtance. Is it for ſixteen to fear an evil ſix months before it ſhall happen? Not to mention that ſhe had ſomething elſe to do than think about any ſuch thing. As ſoon as the Canoneſs was ſufficiently recovered, ſhe ran, morning and evening, about the garden, from flower to flower, and from arbour to arbour, enchanted and amazed at the progreſs which nature had made during her month's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that the ſorrows of a ſuffering friend had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to enliven. Never before had the return of ſpring made ſuch an impreſſion upon her; for, indeed, this was the firſt time of her life ſhe had remarked and felt the growing charms of the reviving earth in all their infant varieties; then, when each returning day Nature aſſumes a newer, and ſtill a freſher face; ſtill bequeaths other, and more abundant bleſſings to man; and, with her pure breath, inſpires pleaſure, plenty, and gladneſs of heart!</p>
                  <p>What a contraſt, this, to the cloſe Chamber, the bed of pain, watered with tears, the diſtracting complaints of her dear friend, and the dread of being left deſolate; for, if her friend died, who ſhould comfort Caroline! Yes, theſe mournful objects, theſe fearful apprehenſions were exchanged for the cowſlip meadow, the budding grove, the lilac, the violet, honeyſuccle, and the roſe of May, to which ſucceeded the hyacinth, the ranunculous, the ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone, and the tulip, enamelling the earth and perfuming the air. At day-break was heard the warbling of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand birds, and at the ſetting ſun the nightingale and the linnet again began their ſong, reſponſive from tree to tree, in ſounds melodious, wild, and ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Nothing was indifferent to, nothing loſt, nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved by Caroline. She felt all, all enjoyed, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rapture; believed ſhe inhabited an enchanted world, and her happineſs remained uninterrupted. The ſeaſon, reviving to nature, gave new life and health alſo to her friend, and ſhe recovered rapidly. A weakneſs i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

her chamber, but ſhe could breathe the pure air of ſpring in the balcony; ſhe could ſee her Caroline courſe along the gardens, collect the flowers, ſupport thoſe that droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and water and preſerve them from weeds; ſhe could hear her ſweet voice mingle with the ſong of birds, and thus enjoyed the pleaſures and the ſports of Caroline.</p>
                  <p>Another very intereſting incident was added to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> rural happineſs of the youthful Counteſs. She wiſhed to raiſe ſome monument conſecrated to her friend, and the happy epocha of her recovery. Deſirous of cauſing an agreeable ſurpriſe, ſhe took advantage of the time during which the Canoneſs was ſtill held recluſe in her chamber, to erect a ſmall temple without her knowledge. For which reaſon, ſhe choſe her ſpot in an angle of the garden, and at the far end of it, towards which the windows of the Canoneſs did not look. On this ſpot was a wild irregular arbour, full in foliage. The beech tree, the hazle, the woodbine, and the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſamine, were there abundant; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them the path that led to the arbour winded, and beſide them a ſmall clear bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k ran murmuring.</p>
                  <p>The Canoneſs had planted this arbour during the time her unfortunate paſſion was at its height; the name of the perſidious High Chamberlain had been traced on every tree by her beauteous hand; and ſhe had always preſerved her former predilection for this ſpot, the ſcore of her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, her tenderneſs, and truth.</p>
                  <p>Caroline was pleaſed with it likewiſe; the thick ſhrubs and uninterrupted ſecurity made it the delighted haunt of the red breaſt, the wren, the finch, and the linnet, and the Baroneſs and Caroline had, many a ſummer, paſſed delicious moments amid the refreſhing foliage. At the farther end, of this favoured aſylum did ſhe reſolve to erect the Temple of Friendſhip. Caroline informe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

A door which opened to the road gave them free egreſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, without being perceived from the chateau, and Caroline was too great a favorite among the ſervants to fear their indiſcretion. The Canoneſs, confined to her apartment, ſuſpected nothing of all this; Caroline might, perhaps, have betrayed herſelf, had this happened ſix months ſooner, but ſhe had learned to keep one ſecret, and the ſecond was certainly far leſs burthenſome. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care, aſſiduity, nor money were wanting; her zeal
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034126_0035_0FFA561DC089AA30"/>
communicated itſelf to the workmen; ſhe furniſhed ideas, drew plans, and was always the firſt in the morning at the building, which went forward with exceſſive rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and which was finiſhed in leſs than a month.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the temple was ready for the reception of her friend, ſhe was moſt earneſt in her entreaties to go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here. "The air of your arbour, Mamma, is ſo cool, ſo refreſhing, ſo pure, the foliage is ſo abundant, and the flowers ſo ſweet, you will be delighted."</p>
                  <p>"I have no doubt of it, my dear, but thou knoweſt I cannot walk ſo far."</p>
                  <p>"If that be all, I will carry you thither, myſelf, Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma."</p>
                  <p>Caroline was ſo preſſing, that the Canoneſs, who could deny her nothing, ſuffered herſelf, at laſt, to be carried in her arm-chair, and was well rewarded for her conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, by the ſurpriſe, the pleaſure, and the new mark of affection thus teſtified by her adopted daughter.</p>
                  <p>This little temple, or pavilion, was an octagon; the architecture was exceedingly ſimple. Eight columns of white ſtucco left an open ſpace, which was paved in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic, with black and white marble. In the middle was an altar of white marble ornamented with feſtoons of moſt elegant ſculpture; upon the altar ſtood a buſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs, modelled after an exceedingly good portrait in the poſſeſſion of Caroline. In her youth ſhe had been beautiful; and, when the High Chamberlain was her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he had more than one rival. It gave her pleaſure often to remark, that ſhe was thought greatly to reſemble the ſtatue of Cleopatra. Though grief and years had ſtolen the roſes from her cheeks, and deſtroyed ſomewhat of this reſemblance, her features were ſtill ſufficiently regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for a very agreeable buſt.</p>
                  <p>Caroline was very deſirous of engraving ſome verſes on the baſe of the altar, indicating to whom it was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but, as ſhe determined not to borrow, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to write them herſelf; and, as the talent of poetry is not, however it may be ſuppoſed, intuitive, but requires long application and ſevere ſtudy before it can be good, Caroline was not a good poet. She made the attempt, however; for when the feelings are ſtrong and the ideas flowing in abundance, the expreſſion of them ſeems, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trial, to be exceedingly eaſy; but, when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and effaced, interlined, tore, began again, and, at laſt, wrote ſome verſes, which might be, once, heard with pleaſure, but which did not deſerve to be engraved in marble. At firſt ſhe was enchanted with them, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recoiled at recollecting they ſhould always remain there, and would be read by every one. Renouncing poetical ſame, therefore, ſhe cauſed a ſimple inſcriptio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in letters of gold, to be written, beneath the buſt, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the day, the month, and the year in which the Canoneſs was ſnatched from the grave, herſelf reſtored to happineſs, and this Temple dedicated to Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>A double ſtair caſe of white marble led to an upper apartment of the ſame dimenſions and form with that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, that is to ſay octagonal, but walled in and lighted by four large windows. The ceiling was a lofty dome, painted with ſuch art that it perfectly imitated a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and cryſtal ſky. Round the walls, between the windows, were paintings, emblematic of the perſon to whom the temple was dedicated. In one of the partitions was Caroline, kneeling to Eſculapius, ardently invoking his aid, and pointing to her expiring friend. In the ſecond Caroline was aſſiſting her as ſhe roſe, while little Genii ſported around her, ſcattered flowers, overſet the table on which phials and phyſical remedies were placed, and broke the javelin of Death who was ſeen flying in the back ground. In the third a pavilion was building, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line placing the buſt upon the altar, and the Genii of friendſhip and gratitude engraving the inſcription. In the fourth and laſt, Caroline was leading, and ſuſtaining with one arm, the Canoneſs, whoſe attitude expreſſed ſurpriſe and joy, and extending the other towards the temple ſhe had been building, and which ſhe there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her.</p>
                  <p>The partitions were wainſcot, and had doors, behind each of which was a receſs for a ſmall library; a table ſtood in the middle, and cabriole chairs round the room.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, nothing was forgotten, yet all was planned and conducted by a young girl of ſixteen; but this girl was inſpired and informed by friendſhip: her heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with this affection, and, totally ignorant of any other, loving by nature, without other object of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than this her dear and only friend, to her the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſenſibility were all directed, and the dread of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her had rendered them ſtill more creative, more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034126_0037_0FFA562F9ACC0410"/>
and more profuſe. Genius likewiſe begins to ſhow itſelf at her age, and the mind and imagination have then an ardor that muſt find employment, a fire that will have fuel. Independent of the pleaſure ſhe ſhould give her friend, that which pertained to herſelf, alone, was far from ſmall. To build was in ſome ſort to create, each new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was a new enjoyment, the execution and the effect of which gave her momentary rapture. Caroline, perhaps, never enjoyed greater felicity than while ſhe was thus employed; ſo has ſhe ſince frequently acknowledged, and never, afterwards, beheld this monument of affection and friendſhip, without emotion.</p>
                  <p>Let the reader, if the reader can, imagine the ecſtacy of the ſentimental Baroneſs. It was the denouement of a romance, an incident of ſurpriſe ſo unexpected, and ſo perfectly conformable to her ideas and taſte, that it ſeemed imagined and contrived purpoſely for her—a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built by enchantment by the wand of a Fairy, or the taliſman of a Genius. Behold her claſping the lovely Sylph in her arms to whom ſhe is indebted for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy! and lo! Caroline kneeling, kiſſing her hands, and expreſſing her multitudinous ſenſations by looks and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence incapable of ſpeech! ſee them mingle their tears, each contending for ſuperior gratitude and love!</p>
                  <p>This was the moment in which Caroline felt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unmixed, free from the ſlighteſt ſhade of pain, and as pure as it was innocent. Happy age! exiſting but for the preſent moment, forgetful of the paſt, and regardleſs of the future! Rindaw was the world to Caroline, and her pavilion the Temple of Felicity. So enamoured was ſhe of it, that ſhe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The moment ſhe left the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs ſhe ſlew to the pavilion, and ſhe ſcarcely could quit it without regret.

                  <p>The clear light was equally excellent for drawing; for, by means of the four windows and Venetian blind, the light might be diſpoſed in what manner the painter plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and pencils, ballets and colours were all tranſported thither.</p>
                  <p>The place was ſo tranquil, ſo undiſturbed ſo free from
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034126_0038_0FFA19F8F07D48C8"/>
noiſe and interruption, that it was the propereſt in the world for reading, and Caroline's whole library ſtole thither by degrees. Caroline ſcarcely had any other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; ſhe never entered her own room, except to ſleep, or haſtily arrange her dreſs, and often in that of her dear mamma ſhe felt a kind of impatience to be gone. Novelty is a pleaſure which habit ſoon renders abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Let us, however, do juſtice to Caroline. She was all impatience that her friend ſhould ſo far recover her ſtrength as daily to come and live with her in her dear pavilion and ſo charmed was the Baroneſs to ſee Caroline thus happy, that ſhe contributed every thing in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to continue the ſweet delirium. How long it was to continue, how long ſhe was to love her pavilion for itſelf alone, we ſhall preſently ſee.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, the tranquil exiſtence of Caroline has glided away untroubled in its progreſs, except the now forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten week at Berlin, unmoleſted by love or hatred; for her repugnance to Walſtein, her dread of living with him, was not hatred; and if, by chance, ſhe thought of him, the remembrance inſpired gratitude for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent liberty in which ſhe lived. But this was, indeed, a kind of chance that ſeldom happened; ſeldom, indeed, did the recollection of the Count intrude itſelf, and the enjoyment of preſent pleaſures effaced his image from her mind almoſt to total forgetfulneſs. Her freedom ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed as though it had been abſolute, and did not ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a bird ſecured by a thread winging the air, warbling, and fancying itſelf as free as the feathered ſongſters that vault from buſh to buſh: its forgotten captivity is not perceived till the hand that retains it draws gently back, catches, and carefully again incloſes it within the cage.</p>
                  <p>Caroline had lately received ſome new muſic from Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; among it was a collection of lyric compoſitions, ſome of which ſhe was delighted with, and one in particular. The air ſuited her voice, and the words her feelings; ſhe ſang it from morning to night, accompanying herſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately on the guitar, the harp, and the piano forte, and each time of repeating it, finding a wiſh and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to repeat it again.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary to this our hiſtory that we ſhould inſert this ſong and, perhaps, our readers will not be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee words that gave Caroline ſo much delight.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The accent, the voice, the expreſſion, were very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the ruſtic ſongs to which ſhe was accuſtomed, and gave her infinite ſurpriſe. She left ſinging, liſtened, but heard the voice no more; ſhe then again began to ſing, but in a ſofter tone, and an accompaniment leſs loud; and diſtinctly heard, as ſhe wiſhed, the voice once more. With her guitar in her hand, ſhe ran towards the caſement to look towards the high road, where ſhe ſaw a youth, beauteous, finely formed, and arrived at full manhood, in a hunting dreſs, leaning on his fowling-piece, with his eyes fixed on the temple. This, no doubt, was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſang. Caroline, however, had but a glance of him; for the moment ſhe beheld him, confuſed and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of having been heard and ſeen, and of her own cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſhe inſtantly retired to the farther ſide of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion, where, ſtanding on tip-toe, and ſtretching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, ſhe looked, with all her might, through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow from which ſhe had fled; but it was too far diſtant, ſhe could ſee nothing. She would have begun again to ſing, only to ſee if ſhe ſhould again have been accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; but her voice failed her, ſhe could not, or durſt not, force out a ſingle ſound, and ſcarcely, and but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, could ſhe touch a few chords on her guitar.

erected, and decorated with taſte. He ſaw, remarked it, and heard moſt ſweet muſic as he ſtood; he liſtened, and yielded to the deſire of joining in ſounds ſo delightful. He then beheld a charming virgin approach the window, and it was very natural he ſhould look at her. What, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, could be more natural? And yet was Caroline oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, the whole day, by reflecting on theſe incidents, as if they had been the moſt extraordinary poſſible.</p>
                  <p>We own that to Caroline, who ſaw each ſucceeding day but like the day before, a common incident might ſeem ſtrange, and any being who ſhould interrupt ſolitude, ſo continued and ſo abſolute as her's, might well appear ſingular. Of this youth, therefore, ſhe often thought, and as often wondered who he might be, or why he ſhould travel a road where beings like himſelf were ſo ſeldom ſeen. Of theſe her cogitations, however, ſhe ſaid not a word; for ſhe felt ſome vague idea of dread leſt her dear pavilion ſhould become an interdicted place, and this, to her, would have been worſe than death.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow, therefore, ſhe flew with more early haſte even than uſual, and, after having poſſed an hour, looking through the window towards the road, and well aſſuring herſelf, by examining every way, that no one could either ſee or hear her, ſhe took her guitar, ſat down with the ſaſh thrown up, and ſang her favourite ſong from beginning to end; and, though ſhe always had liked the laſt verſe the leaſt, it this time ſo far took her fancy that it was repeated: ſhe next ſung it to her harp, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to her piano forte. At this, however, ſhe did not long remain; for it ſtood at the far end of the pavilion, and Caroline found the air ſo pure, ſo mild, ſo refreſhing, that ſhe could not poſſibly ſit any where but at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. She had written down the ſecond that ſhe had heard, and repeated in every kind of mode
<q>
                        <l>Yes, dear Indiff'rence, thee I know</l>
                        <l>The friend of bliſs, and not the foe;</l>
                     </q>
which, alas! no one came to contradict.</p>
                  <p>Tired, at length, and, for aught we know, ſomewhat chagrined to ſing ſo long by herſelf when there were peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world who ſo harmoniouſly could bear a part, ſhe threw down her muſic, laid by her inſtrument, ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden, plucked ſome flowers which ſhe toſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order into her flower-baſket, and, for want of other amuſement, again returned to the pavilion, took up her

pallet and her pencil, and careleſsly began to imitate the tints and beauties ſhe had been collecting. It was with difficulty, at firſt, ſhe could any way fix her attention, and ſhe looked oftener toward the window than the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel on which ſhe painted; but her work by degrees drew her attention, and wholly occupied her. The flowers, which from her traces took birth, pleaſed her; each new touch was happy, and gave a new effect; the powers of genius were rouſed and high in action when, ſuddenly, the clattering of a horſe's h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs were heard at a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>This noiſe, though of a very different nature, was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs ſurpriſing than the melodious ſounds of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before; it bore no reſemblance to the ſlow and heavy ſtep of the beaſt of burden or the village horſe. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the pencil was thrown by, and Caroline, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was at the window, looking every way. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently beheld, and not far diſtant, a fine handſome man, mounted on a gray horſe that champed the bit he ſeemed to diſdain, and foaming obeyed the reſtraining hand of his graceful rider.</p>
                  <p>How obſervant, how piercing, how exact is the female eye! Scarcely had Caroline ſeen the ſtranger of over-night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was in a green ſporting dreſs; the preſent youth wore a uniform; the one was on foot, the other on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; the firſt ſung, the latter galloped. How little did theſe things reſemble each other! and yet did Caroline, inſtantly, recollect theſe two to be one and the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It was not poſſible to reſiſt that curioſity that deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know if this youth could ride as well as he could ſing. He, or rather his horſe, advanced, for the proud animal was difficult to detain, and not eaſy to manage; yet was he forgotten the moment his rider had a glance of Caroline; the hand quitted the bridle for the hat (for what cavalier would forbear to ſalute an angelic creature who appeared to be the goddeſs of the temple?) and the impatient ſteed, profiting by momentary liberty, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſomewhat frightened at the ſudden motion of the rider, gave a prodigious plunge, which would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſed a rider leſs firm and daring, and ſet off, full ſpeed, regardleſs of every effort of the cavalier, and quick as lightning, was out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>Caroline, greatly terrified, gave a piercing ſhriek, and followed the horſe and his rider with looks of anxiety and dread as long as ſhe could, which, however, was but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:034126_0043_0FFA56650C72D420"/>
they were gone, but her fears remained, and again, and ardently, ſhe looked, though nothing was there to be ſeen. Fear, like other beings, propogates and multiplies, and Caroline ſaw the noble cavalier falling from his horſe, rolled in the duſt, wounded and trampled on.—If the dangerous beaſt would but run towards the village, he might there, perhaps, be ſtopped, the people might come to his maſter's aid, and they might bring him back, if wounded, to the chateau. For a moment ſhe thought to have ſent the ſervants after him, but after whom? She herſelf knew not. And which road? for there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral at leaving the village. Beſides, it was not eaſy to overtake a horſe full ſpeed. And then how could ſhe give theſe orders? It ſeemed ſo particular, at leaſt ſo ſhe feared it would ſeem. No, ſhe never could reſolve, and, therefore, remain ſhe muſt with all her anxious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſhe endeavoured to calm by recollecting how firm, how graceful the officer ſat, and how certain he ſeemed of his power before that vexatious ſalutation, for which ſhe wholly reproached herſelf; having no other perſon to ſalute, ſhe hoped the horſe would loſe his fears, and the cavalier regain his command; and even that ſhe ſhould be happy enough to ſee him again on the morrow; "and really," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "he ought to come merely to quiet my apprehenſions."</p>
                  <p>The agitation of Caroline had totally deprived her of any deſire any longer to ſing or paint; ſo, after a few turns in the garden, ſtill thinking on the youth who, like an apparition, had twice ſuddenly appeared, and twice as ſuddenly vaniſhed, ſhe returned to keep the Baroneſs company; to whom, however, ſhe did not mention a ſyllable of what had happened; fearing, no doubt, to terrify her as much as ſhe had been terrified herſelf. She went to bed impatiently wiſhing for the morrow, and ardently hoping ſhe ſhould either ſee the ſtranger, or, at leaſt, be certified he had eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt. Yeſterday, ſimple and pure curioſity had engaged her to think of him; to-day, humanity was added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the life of a man was endangered. After many reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the ſubject, and after being very angry with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly horſes, that will not ſuffer cavaliers to be polite, and take off their hats to ladies, Caroline, at laſt, fell aſleep.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow—Why on the morrow it ruined, in

torrents, from morning to night; it was a day that might well have been a day during Noah's flood; it was as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to go to the pavilion, as it was to ſuppoſe any one could ride out on ſuch a day. Caroline, baulked in all her expectations, ſound the day intolerably tedious, and, tired, and vexed to death, could find no mode plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly to employ her time; her books, her muſic, her drawings, all were at the pavilion; her heart was at the pavilion, alſo, and ſhe herſelf moſt impatiently wiſhed to be there, but, ah! it was impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Converſations with her dear Mamma, concerning rain and fine weather, and moſt ſincere wiſhes for the return of the latter, ſinging the burthen of <hi>Peaceful Indifference,</hi> and imagining the ſecond, remembering the galloping horſe, and again hoping for the morrow, where the beſt means Caroline could find of paſſing the day. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—why this good for nothing morrow was as bad as the former one; the rain was worſe and worſe, and the clouds ſeemed all to have made an appointment to meet at Rindaw. It was too much for nature to bear, and Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, for the firſt time in her life, was really out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſhewed ſhe was ſo. "Is it not intolerable, Mamma, that one cannot ſo much as ſtep into the pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? There is my flower-baſket, which I had begun to paint! The flowers will be all faded, and thoſe in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will be beat down and deluged by this good-for-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unceaſing rain! I ſhall find the leaves all torn from the roſes, and nothing but the thorns remaining."</p>
                  <p>Alas! poor Caroline! the thorns already are in thy heart; thy gaiety, before ſo uniform, is now no more; that cheerful void of care, happily improvident, which gave thee ſmiles and ſongs, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034126_0045_0FFA5674C894FDB0"/>
The diſappointment of the time paſt augmented the pleaſure of the time preſent, and ſcarcely would ſhe wait till the path was dry before ſhe flew to the pavilion.</p>
                  <p>Not her flowers, ſo much regretted, not her books, for which ſhe ſeemed to ſigh, nor yet her muſic, which might enliven the dulneſs of dark and cloudy weather, were the things that firſt drew her attention: it was the window and the road, uniform and inanimate as ſuch objects may ſeem, that attracted and riveted the eyes of Caroline. She looks this way, that way, and every way; ſhe liſtens and fears to breathe; yet nothing ſees, nothing hears; ſhe examines the humid green ſwerd, and the gravel-path, trying if ſhe can diſcover the new-made traces of a horſe's hoof. "Ah! could I only know he had paſſed this way, that he were ſafe, that no accident had happened, how tranquil, how perfectly contented ſhould I be! For, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, I was the cauſe of his misfortune. If I had left the window, he would not have pulled off his hat, and his horſe would not have been frightened; but only let me get the leaſt glimpſe of him once again, and I will withdraw inſtantly, that he no more may be tempted to ſalute me." Thus to herſelf ſaid Caroline.</p>
                  <p>Now, ſo it happened, juſt as thus ſhe had ſaid, ſhe not only had a glimpſe, but a full view of a caval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, wearing the ſame uniform, mounted on the ſame gray, unruly horſe, and advancing, full trot, towards the pavilion, from which he was as yet at ſome diſtance. Well then, there he was, ſafe and unhurt, and Caroline, <hi>no doubt,</hi> was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eaſy; and, <hi>no doubt,</hi> ſhe will retire, as ſhe promiſed herſelf, and think of him no more.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore the tremor which ſuddenly has ſeized her? Wherefore this quickening pulſe, this palpitating heart, this ſpreading ſuffuſion that dyes alabaſter ſcarlet, and gives the roſe of the cheek a deeper hue? I know not wherefore theſe things were; I only know they were, and that Caroline was all agitation. She was going to leave the window, but juſt at that moment, for things will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen oddly, her handkerchief, on which ſhe had been leaning, fell, and was borne (no doubt by Zephyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, for they are apt at wanton and malicious tricks), yes, it was borne into the middle of the highway.</p>
                  <p>Caroline was abſolutely in deſpair: the act was moſt ſurely involuntary, yet ſo it might not ſeem; not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that this was ſtill more dangerous to the cavalier than
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034126_0046_0FFA55004DC72150"/>
the ſalute ſhe meant to avoid; for it is certainly leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to take off one's hat, on horſeback, than to pick up a handkerchief from the ground. This was a very juſt concluſion, but ſo was not the next ſhe made; ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the cavalier ſtill ſo far diſtant as to give her time to run down, open the pavilion door, ſally forth, pick up her handkerchief, and re-enter before he ſhould arrive. The idea ſhe thought excellent, it ſeemed to be the only poſſible expedient of clearly demonſtrating that the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief had not been purpoſely thrown out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow for the cavalier to pick up; nor was there time to loſe in reflection; away, therefoer, ſhe flew to the door, opened it, and was ſtepping out at the very moment that the young officer, after alighting from his horſe, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the act of taking up the handkerchief.</p>
                  <p>With a graceful and dignified manner the youth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and, in an elegant compliment returned his prize; while Caroline, diſconcerted and unable to reply, extended her timid hand. The youth, with infinite mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, begged permiſſion to ſee the garden and pavilion, which, he ſaid, appeared moſt charming. Underſtanding the ſilence of the trembling Caroline as conſent (cavaliers will ſo underſtand), he preſently hung the bridle of his horſe to the pavilion door, and followed her.</p>
                  <p>The latent feelings of Caroline told her ſhe ought to have denied his requeſt; but which way? Caroline was naturally all benevolence, and there is ſomething pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in denial. Neither did ſhe perceive any infinite evil which could thence reſult. Her own innocence, her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ignorance of the world, concealed the danger that might lurk thus under the form of a youthful ſoldier. Beſide, his uniform ſpoke him a gentleman, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eaſe of his manner of no mean birth: his politeneſs was ſo natural, ſo graceful, ſo familiar, the tone of his voice, his modeſt confidence, all confirmed him perfectly well bred. The ſymmetry and beauty of his form made not all that impreſſion which might naturally be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe Caroline durſt not look at him; and yet ſhe had ſeen ſufficient to find that his full fine eyes were moſt expreſſively intelligent, and ſhe very ſoon could have informed us that his teeth were white and regular, his ſmile enchanting, his noſe acquiline, his viſage oval, his eyebrows markingly arched, his ſtature tall, his dark com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion animated by the warm glow of youth and health,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034126_0047_0FFA56878B41E988"/>
and that his open and frank countenance inſpired confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and friendſhip the moment they were beheld. All theſe things had the furtive beauteous Counteſs preſently remarked. This might, perhaps, in part, excuſe that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility with which ſhe ſuffered him to walk up into the pavilion; unleſs it ſhould be thought more natural to caſt the whole blame on abſolute Innocence, too ſecure in its own ſimplicity. But whether this or that excuſe were beſt, there he is, there looks, there admires, there praiſes with ecſtacy, and yet with propriety, void of exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the taſte and the talents which had decorated the temple. The altar and paintings particularly fixed his attention. He aſked an explanation; it was given, and thus he gained a happy opportunity of learning to whom the place belonged without the indelicacy of interrogation, though neither the names of the Baroneſs of Rindaw or the High Chamberlain Lichtfield made him more polite, more attentive, or more reſpectful; for that was impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>The ſong and the guitar were lying on the piano forte, which, with a gentle but ſubmiſſive ſmile, led him to mention the ſecond, and to aſk pardon for that teme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity which had ſuffered him to mingle his voice with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſounds he had heard, and which, he added, he ſhould be moſt happy again to hear. He ſaw the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition augmented the confuſion of Caroline; he ſaid not a word more concerning it, therefore; but ſpoke of muſic, its effects and charms, like one who felt them, and was the firſt to propoſe quitting the pavilion and walking in the garden.</p>
                  <p>The fortitude of Caroline began to return: the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's converſation was ſo agreeable, ſo unaffected, and yet ſo animated, that it could not long leave her under any conſtraint; and, after a turn or two in the garden, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſpoke to him as naturally as if they had been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all their lives. With the moſt perfect ſimplicity did ſhe relate the terror with which ſhe had been ſeized at the impetuoſity of the unmanageable horſe, and tell all her fears and apprehenſions during thoſe two dreadful days of rain. Deſirous, however, as ſhe was to learn the name of the cavalier, this was a thing ſhe durſt not aſk; ſhe only underſtood he was captain in the guards, and her country neighbour, which both gave her pleaſure; for the one informed her he was a proper viſitor, and the other that ſhe ſhould certainly ſee him again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:034126_0048_0FFA55106C68A318"/>A quarter of an hour, which, ſhort as it was, ſeemed ſtill infinitely ſhorter, they thus converſed; when the ſteed, neighing and pawing at the door, became ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient that his maſter was obliged, however unwilling, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to mount. "Really," ſaid Caroline to him as he threw the bridle over his neck, "were I in your place, Sir, I ſhould not like a horſe that would neither permit one to take off one's hat nor walk in a garden."—Ah! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite are the charms of Innocence! The ſtranger with a ſmile half reſtrained, aſſured Caroline his horſe ſhould be better taught, and that, indeed, he had played him to many malicious tricks, of which he ſhould be corrected; then, lightly vaulting into the ſaddle, after a thouſand repeated thanks to Caroline for her condeſcenſion, he departed, as ſlowly as poſſible, curbing the haughty ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal to obedience. Caroline, as ſlowly, returned to the pavilion, as ſoon, that is, as he was out of fight; her head, aye and her heart too, wholly occupied by the departed cavalier.</p>
                  <p>"How amiable his perſon! how ſoft, how attentive his manners! Oh that Heaven had given me a brother like him! How dearly would he have been beloved!— But wherefore may I not love this youth as I ſhould love a brother, or as a friend, ſent by Heaven to make ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude cheerful? Yet how do I know if ever I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him again?"</p>
                  <p>Thus meditated Caroline; and what the thought was which, added to this latter, ſo might move her we know not, but Caroline felt a ſudden oppreſſion at her heart, and the tear roſe gliſtening in her eye. Senſible of this, and ſomewhat alarmed, ſhe was deſirous to divert her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to other objects, and ſat down to her muſic; but the two days rain had put her harp and guitar out of tune, and ſhe was obliged to lay them by; the piano forte was leſs affected, and ſhe played an adagio, which but augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed melancholy. To painting ſhe had next recourſe, but with no better ſucceſs; and reading was ſtill lets amuſing than either: ſhe opened books, but they ſeemed dull and ill written before ſhe had finiſhed a period. Some change muſt certainly have taken place, for objects that before gave pleaſure, at preſent gave diſtate, or painful laſſitude at beſt.</p>
                  <p>Caroline returned to the garden, and took the ſame
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034126_0049_0FFA569785D91200"/>
round ſhe lately had gone with the cavalier, ſtopped at the ſame places, and recollected every expreſſion, every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and every look. The grand queſtion now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be determined; that is to ſay, whether ſhe ſhould or ſhould not, tell all that had happened to the good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs. Silence was diſagreeable, and to myſtery Caroline was naturally averſe; yet ſhe ſeemed more averſe to ſpeak or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> occaſion. She knew not how to ſpeak, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>

                     </gap>k; and, ſuppoſing there to be nothing wrong in keeping the ſecret, there was nothing difficult in it; for ſecrecy was, at preſent become habitual, and ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it may be, leſs communicative. Beſide, what ſhould ſhe ſay? "Why mention a perſon, whom, perhaps, I ſhall never ſee again, whoſe name I know not? It will be time enough if he ſhould return. And then ſhould the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs blame me for having admitted him into the garden, forbid me the pavilion, and not ſuffer me any more to look out of the window!"</p>
                  <p>Caroline half ſhuddered, as thus ſhe meditated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to tell what had happened. When, however, ſhe returned to her friend, ſhe could not forbear aſking a thouſand queſtions concerning the neighbourhood, for two leagues round. As the Canoneſs never was viſited, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line knew none of the neighbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, nor had ſhe ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, made the leaſt enquiry; though her good friend made a merit of knowing the genealogy of all their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies through every branch. To queſtion her concerning the characters and affairs of her neighbours was taking her on her weak ſide; and poor Caroline had a hundred hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to hear, while the only on to which ſhe could have liſtened with pleaſure was unrelated. Not the leaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance could ſhe learn that had any reference to the ſtranger. Here lived an old Baron who had retired from the army, with his wife as old as himſelf, ſhut up in their chateau; there a young couple, with ſeveral children, but they were infants, and all girls. Yonder, as you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the village, an ancient commander of the Teutonic Order; very infirm, very avaricious, and on very good terms with his gouvernante. A little farther, an old dowager, with an only ſon of five and twenty.</p>
                  <p>Caroline, who was half aſleep, no ſooner heard of the only ſon of five and twenty, than ſhe was as perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake as ever ſhe had been in her life; but to little purpoſe
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034126_0050_0FFA57A4700E3348"/>
half an ideot, with no other employment that what hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking afforded, and who, notwithſtanding his great riches, could purſuade no woman to become his wife. Ah! thought Caroline, that is not my cavalier.</p>
                  <p>The Baroneſs continued, for it was not eaſy to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her, and ſhe was inexhauſtible. At laſt Caroline, quite wearied, and learning nothing of what ſhe moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to know, wiſhing to be alone, took advantage of a ſlight head-ach, and retired ſooner than uſual. "He is not my neighbour, then," ſaid ſhe ſighing. "And has he deceived, could he deceive me? If ſo, I ſhall never ſee him more. Well then I muſt forget, never think of him more."</p>
                  <p>Moncrief has ſaid that the very act of determining to forget makes us remember. Thus, Caroline, fortifying herſelf in this her noble reſolution, forget the cav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lier by recollecting every word that had paſſed; and, thus rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, dropt aſleep. No doubt the project of thinking on him no more was her firſt on waking the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She roſe, and reſolved not to go to the pavilion all the forenoon: habit was very ſtrong, and was with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty vanquiſhed, yet vanquiſhed it was: ſhe raiſed her drooping flowers, examined her aviary, and ſat down to her embroidery, every moment repeating, "I muſt think of him no more," and as often looking towards the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion. "Dear pavilion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid Caroline, ſighing, "I am never happy but when I am there; I muſt pay it a viſit, but it ſhall be very very late, when I am ſure no perſon is walking. I will not go, at ſooneſt, before four o'clock in the afternoon."</p>
                  <p>The day appeared exceedingly long, and Caroline perſuaded herſelf it was already far advanced, as ſhe ſauntered near the pavilion, when ſhe heard, in the very court-yard of the chateau, the trampling of a horſe and the ſound of hoofs ſhe began to think ſhe recollected, which made her heart palpitate. In a moment a ſervant enters and announces the Baron of Lindorf. The aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Baroneſs recollects to have heard the name, and gives orders for his admiſſion; when the charming ſtranger of the pavilion, with all his grace and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, appeared.</p>
                  <p>Poor Caroline, what was thy emotion! How bitterly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> didſt thou reproach thyſelf for not having mentioned him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> friend! How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> are thy bluſhes at thy

own diſſimulation! For, whether he ſpeak or whether he do not, thou art, equally, afraid of his indiſcretion and his ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Lindorf choſe the latter; a glance at Caroline, who, tremblingly confuſed, alternately pale and red, had cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſied to him with downcaſt eyes and timidity in every feature, in a moment informed him how it was proper to act. He returned her ſalutation as if it had been the firſt time he had ſeen her; and addreſſing himſelf to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs, congratulated himſelf on the happineſs of being her neighbour, with ſelf-reproaches for not having ſooner profited by this advantage.</p>
                  <p>The Baroneſs, to whom this youthful cavalier was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtranger, aſked an explanation, and learned that the commander of the Teutonic Order had, like herſelf been ill, but had not, like her, recovered; for he was lately dead, and the Baron of Lindorf, his nephew and heir, was come to take poſſeſſion of the manſion and eſtate of Riſberg, which was adjoining to the Barony of Rindaw. He had at firſt intended not to make a long ſtay, but the country had pleaſed him infinitely; and he had very lately come to a reſolution to paſs the remainder of the ſummer there. His firſt wiſh was to be acquainted with his lovely neighbours, to preſent them his duty and his homage, and to ſolicit permiſſion theſe occaſionally to renew.</p>
                  <p>All this was ſaid looking towards Caroline, who, with her eyes fixed on her work, which ſhe was induſtriouſly ſpoiling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pt a profound ſilence. Thanks, however, to the good Canoneſs, the converſation was not therefore interrupted; ſhe gave the hiſtory of her whole illneſs, then reverted with great pity, to that of the Commander, and lamented his death, of which ſhe had been wholly ignorant. "It was but yeſterday," ſaid ſhe, "I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned him to Caroline, who had aſked me who were my neighbours."</p>
                  <p>Lindorf did not recollect himſelf ſoon enough totally to ſuppreſs a ſmile, and Caroline was abſolutely ready to faint with ſhame and vexation.</p>
                  <p>The Baroneſs proceeded with compliments to the heir, and enquiries concerning the eſtate and property, which muſt from the character of the Commander, be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. After which came interrogatories concerning the degree of kindred in which the deceaſed and the youth
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034126_0052_0FFA1B0DD5B02F60"/>
ſtood, all which ſhe anſwered herſelf. "Oh! I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every branch of the family. Your name is Lindorf, is it not? Yes, yes, your name is Lindorf; and you inherit in right of my Lady, your mother. She, yes, ſhe was Baroneſs of Riſberg, own ſiſter to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, as I think; yes, yes, I am ſure ſhe was. To be ſure, I was not perſonally acquainted with her, but one of your lady aunts was educated in the very convent I was, and ſhe told me of this marriage of her ſiſter with your father. Aye, with the Baron of Lindorf, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it as well as if had only happened yeſterday. There was a mutual paſſion, real and true love, and I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affected by the ſtory. Your aunt was in my confidence alſo; I told her of my paſſion for the High Chamberlain. Upon my word, all this ſeems as if it had happened laſt week, and here I ſee a fine young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man—the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ldeſt of the family, I ſuppoſe—Were there many children?—Is your father ſtill alive; and my Lady your mother too?—Ah! they ſtill adore each other, no doubt. Love, love, only, can give happineſs; and my dear friend, your aunt, whom I juſt now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is ſhe dead? Is ſhe married? It is ſo long ſince we ſaw each other, and I have lived retired here ſo many years, that I have quite loſt ſight of former friends."</p>
                  <p>Theſe queſtions ſucceeded each other with ſuch rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that Lindorf, ſurpriſed at the voluble haſte with which they were delivered, ſcarcely could find opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to come in with a yes; or no; I am an only ſon; I had the misfortune to loſe my parents: with like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as conciſe as poſſible. But his eyes, continually fixed on Caroline, would have ſaid many things to her if Caroline would have attended to them. She, ſeemingly obſervant of nothing but her work, had not ventured a ſingle word, when the Canoneſs deſirous of doing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to her friendſhip and affection, aſked her to ſhow the young cavalier her pavilion; and, not foreſeeing the leaſt obſtruction, began, without waiting her reply, to give him its hiſtory; why it had been built, by whom the altar, the buſt, the inſcription, the painting, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and every thing; all which he knew as well as herſelf; though by his manner, it might well have been ſuppoſed he had never heard it before.</p>

like Caroline's this was too much; ſhe could ſupport it no longer; and when her friend, ſurpriſed at her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to go to the pavilion, repeated her command, ſhe ſcarcely could articulate that a ſudden and ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition had ſeized her, and that it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould go. In reality her voice was ſo affected, her face ſo pale, and her whole form ſo altered, that her indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was ſufficiently viſible, and made the Baroneſs very uneaſy, "Dear child, what can be the matter?" ſaid ſhe, laying her hand on her forehead. "Yeſterday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I particularly remarked, when you came in, you ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſent, and your mind wholly occupied; and, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days paſt, you have not only retired ſooner than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but have been particularly melancholy and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. My Caroline, Sir, certainly has a fever; 'tis that vile pavilion that kills her. I aſſure you, Sir, ſhe is quite infatuated with it; and lately, more than ever; for, notwithſtanding the humidity of the earth and the air, the moment it had ceaſed raining ſhe would be gone, by which means ſhe has caught cold."</p>
                  <p>Lindorf, without being remarkably vain, had heard ſufficient to imagine himſelf a party ſomewhat concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, ſuffering with the ſuffering Caroline, and moſt deſirous of relieving her from pain, he ſhortened his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, took leave of the ladies, and hoped the indiſpoſition of Carolin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> would have no bad conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Caroline made no other anſwer than by courteſying, and the Baroneſs, repeatedly, entreated Lindorf to take advantage of their near neighbourhood and come fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the chateau of Rindaw.—"It is but a ſtep," ſaid ſhe. "The poor Commander was gouty, and during three parts of the year, never ſtirred abroad; but you, Sir, are young and agile, and it will be only a ſhort walk to our houſe. Miſs Lichtfield will not always be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and ſome other day will ſhew you her pavilion: ſhe tells me it is moſt excellently adapted to muſic; you, no doubt are a muſician, and you may play and ſing in concert."</p>
                  <p>It only wanted this laſt trait to complete the confuſion of Caroline, and the Baroneſs ſeemed not willing any thing ſhould be wanting. At length the cavalier depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Canoneſs was ſilent. Caroline, however, was not greatly relieve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

tears and ſobs that roſe thronging for paſſage. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs attributed all to her indiſpoſition, and begged her to go and lie down. Caroline was glad to profit by the permiſſion. Her chagrin, however, went with her; but, being alone, ſhe could now abandon herſelf to grief, and again and again repeated, "Good God! what muſt he think of me!"</p>
                  <p>The Canoneſs, alone alſo, was occupied by ideas much leſs melancholy; the handſome, the amiable Lindorf had obſolutely gained her heart; he was preciſely the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhe wiſhed for her dear Caroline. And how happy ſhould ſhe be to have her near her, at leaſt for a part of the year; and to ſee her ſo well, ſo properly, and ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly married! The young officer united in himſelf every thing ſhe wiſhed; youth, beauty, wit, birth, fortune; for, without mentioning his own wealth, of which he was before in poſſeſſion, being an only ſon and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents deceaſed, the inheritance of the avaricious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander muſt have been, immenſe. Already high in rank in the army, every thing that ambition could hope he ſeemed formed to obtain.</p>
                  <p>The advantages of Lindorf were great, yet her dear Caroline was in no reſpect inferior: firſt, Caroline was an angel, and as to fortune, that of the High Chamberlain was not to be diſdained; to which ſhe ſhould add all her own; and, together, they would be vaſt. No match, in ſhort, could be every way more proper; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Caroline ſhould be Baroneſs of Lindorf, or her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhould be ſtrangely fruſtrated. She even fixed on the epocha for celebrating the wedding; the autumn following ſhe determined on, when the High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was to pay his promiſed viſit.</p>
                  <p>In thinking all this ſhe reſolved carefully to conceal her projects and ideas even from Caroline. It would, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, be very difficult to be ſilent, but her paſſion for every thing romantic was ſtill ſtronger than her inclination to talk. She imagined what a pleaſure it would be to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the effects of ſympathy; to follow it through the progreſſions of two young hearts; day after day to ſee p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>on augmented by hope and fear; and, at laſt, to make them happy at the very moment when they expected to be eternally miſerable. Oh! what delicious pleaſure, this for the Baroneſs! But this ſhe could not obtain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by keeping her ſecret.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:034126_0055_0FFA56CDE828AB90"/>As to the projected union with the Count of Walſtein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe troubled herſelf little concerning it; ſhe thought it impoſſible not to make the High Chamberlain underſtand reaſon; for he, moſt certainly, knew, by his own heart, the influence of mutual paſſion. "I need only—(the Baroneſs was almoſt as ſimple and innocent as Caroline) I need only to recall to memory how much we ſuffered for each other, and he will yield, with melting tears, to the happineſs of a pair of true lovers. On this condition, too, I will leave Caroline all I poſſeſs. Beſide, when the High Chamberlain ſhall ſee the youthful Lindorf, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as he is, can he, for a moment, make compariſon between him and a monſter? No, no; leave we ſympathy, love, and paternal tenderneſs to their natural effects, and the happineſs of my dear Caroline is for ever fixed."</p>
                  <p>While the good Canoneſs was compoſing her little ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and enjoying, by anticipation, the tender ſcenes at which ſhe ſhould be preſent, and the ſweet delight of making two beings happy, Caroline was abandoning her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to grief and ſelf-reproach, for having acted ſo impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and given Lindorf an idea ſo much the reverſe of her real character. Every word the Baroneſs had ſaid, though unintentionally, had made a wound; every word a thouſand times recalled the bluſhes and confuſion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline. "I will leave Rindaw," ſaid ſhe, "never more to return. Yet to fly-would be to confeſs my guilt; and to confirm the idea, the cruel, diſtracting idea, that I am diſſembling, falſe, and artful. Oh! impoſſible!"</p>
                  <p>Then did ſhe ſearch for and imagine all imaginary means of ſelf-juſtification; but found not one which did not increaſe, inſtead of eradicate ſuſpicion. So troubled were her thoughts that all night long ſhe lay, reſtleſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by ten thouſand fears and ſuſpicions; and, for the firſt time in her whole life, ſleep fled from the eyelids of Caroline. How long, how painful was this night, and yet how much was her agitation increaſed, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when a letter, addreſſed to her, was brought by a ſervant of Lindorf's, who was waiting for an anſwer! The offended Caroline had almoſt inſtantly returned it uno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.—"What," ſays ſhe, "does he write to me pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to demonſtrate how much he deſpiſes me? Nothing but the idea he muſt have entertained of me, for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible conduct, could have emboldened him to take ſuch a liberty. Yet is not this his excuſe? And am not
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034126_0056_0FFA57B54D1722A0"/>
I alone guilty? How polite, how reſpectful was he before the unfortunate viſit of yeſterday! Yes, I myſelf, alone, am to blame."</p>
                  <p>But what was to be done with the packet? To open it was impoſſible; to return it unopened was very ſevere. Beſide, who could tell what his thoughts, or what his ſtyle might be? The letter was held and turned in the hand, and looked at again and again, in every poſſible form, as if the eye wiſhed to penetrate the paper and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loin the contents. At laſt, a ray of light broke in upon the mind of Caroline; ſhe determined to run to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her dear Mamma, open her curtains, fall on her knees, and there, with tears and penitence, make a full confeſſion of all that had paſſed between her and Lindorf.</p>
                  <p>The execution was as prompt as the reſolve; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the run-a-way horſe, the handkerchief, the walk in the garden, every circumſtance was related, even to the avowal of the ſecret reaſons of her ſilence, for which ſhe had been ſo ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>"Judge, Mamma," ſaid Caroline, "what I ſuffered during his viſit! I really thought I ſhould have died! And he to be totally ſilent, as if it had been a plot agreed on between both; while you, Mamma, every moment, unconſciouſly, was piercing my very heart! Can you, can you forgive me for having acted thus? No, load me with your reproaches; I well deſerve them all, and they will be leſs cutting, leſs painful, than thoſe with which I load myſelf."</p>
                  <p>Alas! the good Canoneſs, all emotion, all tenderneſs, and tears at her recital, thought of nothing leſs than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. She had been dreaming all night on her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected marriage, on which the more ſhe thought, the more ſhe was enchanted; her ſole fear had been that Lindorf, ſo long an officer, ſo long in commerce with the gay world, might have formed other engagements; but the hiſtory of Caroline, and the manner in which ſhe had related it, had quieted all her fears; the Baroneſs ſaw, or imagined ſhe ſaw, that ſweet ſympathy of ſouls which re-eſtabliſhed all her hopes, and gave certainty to all her ſchemes; ſhe raiſed Caroline, tenderly kiſſed her, and declared ſhe never, in her life, had heard any thing ſo intereſting.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! if I had but known it!—To be ſure, I ſhould not have ſaid many things I did ſay; for theſe men are
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034126_0057_0FFA56DAB32E8230"/>
ſo ſelf-ſufficient, ſo ready to believe well of themſelves, and that we women are enamoured of them!—However, I muſt do Lindorf the juſtice to ſay he is very different from men in general; his modeſty, his politeneſs"—</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Mamma," ſaid Caroline, ſhaking her head, and interrupting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Baroneſs, "I have but too much cauſe to fear he is like the reſt. Has he not had the audacity to write to me this morning?"</p>
                  <p>"Write to thee child! Quick, quick, quick! Show me the letter, read it, let me hear his ſtyle, his ſentiments; I can imagine all his ardour."</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" ſaid Caroline, taking the packet from her pocket, "here it is; it would not have been proper, Mamma, for me to have opened it. You will do with it what you pleaſe." And the pleaſure of the Baroneſs was, inſtantly, to break the ſeal; for her curioſity was ſtronger even than that of Caroline, which was much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by fears of what might be the contents of the letter. The firſt thing they came to was a polite card, in the uſual ſtyle, in which the Baron of Lindorf "preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpectful compliments to the ladies, inquired after their health, and, in particular, concerning the indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Miſs Lichtfield."</p>
                  <p>But all this was a mere pretext; and, certainly, needed not to have been ſo cloſely ſealed up; wherefore, this laid by, a paper, folded up and placed under the card, was eagerly ſeized and opened. Caroline, trembling as ſhe unfolded it, after ſlightly running it over to herſelf, read aloud as follows:</p>
                  <p>"I am about, Madam, to commit a new impropriety, to aggravate former errors, and, perhaps, increaſe anger which I had but too juſtly raiſed, by a new offence. Now, while I write, I imagine your indignation, feel the effects of your reſentment, behold myſelf puniſhed for my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erity, yet have not the power to forbear. If, Madam, you will but deign to read this letter, and ſurmount that firſt emotion which ſhould bid you tear or ſend it back unopened, you then, at leaſt, will underſtand my motives, and confeſs that to you, alone, could I, with propriety, addreſs myſelf.</p>
                  <p>"You know not all my offences. No, Madam, you know them not; and yet you treat me with as much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity as if you were acquainted with my whole guilt. Since, then, I am not benefited by your ignorance of it,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034126_0058_0FFA57BE9DC060F8"/>
I will make a free confeſſion; hoping that my ſincerity may obtain a generous pardon.</p>
                  <p>"Four times did I, yeſterday, paſs your pavilion, each at a different hour, hoping to find you there and aſk per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to pay my reſpects to you and the Baroneſs: but continually were my hopes deceived; you appeared no more in that pavilion ſo dear to you, and in which you had before that time unceaſingly dwelt; while I, far from ſuſpecting the truth, far from accuſing you as the cauſe of this abſence, caſt the whole blame on Madam the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs; ſhe, thought I, informed of my temerity, not knowing who the perſon was who had dared to obtrude into your aſylum, had forbidden you to go there any more. Vain and weak as I was, I even imagined you might obey with regret; I thought myſelf certain that, when I was known to Madam the Baroneſs, ſhe would no longer lay you under the like reſtraint, and, therefore, did not heſitate to com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and pay her my reſpects in the afternoon. Alas! Madam, how ſeverely, and how juſtly have you puniſhed my preſumption! Your reception of me, ſo very different from hers, inſtantly informed me how much I had been deceived; and that it was you, alone, who thus had renounced the unfortunate ſtranger. You did not permit me to entertain the leaſt doubt, the leaſt hope; the illuſion was wholly deſtroyed; I inſtantly ſaw that Madam the Baroneſs, whom I had imagined ſo ſevere, was ignorant even of my exiſtence, and that the youthful, the ocauteous Caroline, whom I had ſuppoſed obedient to her commands, to the counſels of, perhaps, a too rigid friend, had been ſubject only to her own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, uncommon and unexpected as it was in a lady ſo young. I had been happy had this prudence only been extended to a ſtranger who might himſelf have been an improper perſon, or have had improper deſigns; but, though this doubt was removed, though I was named and known, I could not obtain ſo much as a look of pardon. Your determined ſilence, Madam, your refuſal to ſhew me the pavilion, your apparent anger at the invitation of the Baroneſs, all informed me that I, perſonally, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven irreparable offence. However, Madam, whatever my errors may have been, whatever I may endure, I will not again offend by viſiting at Rindaw without your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; yet ſuffer me to ſupplicate this permiſſion, and be aſſured, Madam, I will endeavour hereafter to deſerve
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:034126_0059_0FFA56E88B2122E8"/>
it. You were a witneſs to the obliging manner in which Madam the Baroneſs was pleaſed to deſire I would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſit at Rindaw. What anſwer am I to make to a requeſt ſo kind, and which I ſo earneſtly wiſh to profit by? You, Madam, muſt decide. On you my conduct muſt depend. Muſt I neglect the civilities of Madam the Baroneſs, and ſubmit to that ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you have ſilently pronounced; or may I dare entreat you to revoke it? I wait your commands, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly vow, whatever they be, to me they ſhall be ſacred. Yet permit me, for a moment, to hope you will not be inexorable; and that he, whom your reſpectable friend has deigned to honour with her protection, may, being thus protected, obtain a pardon which is become abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to the future happineſs of his life."</p>
                  <p>While Caroline was reading this letter, which was da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the chateau of Riſberg, ſhe felt a confuſed mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſenſations ſo oppoſite to each other as to be almoſt indeſinable. At firſt, utter aſtoniſhment at perceiving, without ever ſuſpecting herſelf to be thus conſummately prudent; afterwards, that kind of ſhame which a ſincere mind feels at receiving praiſe it does not merit; and, next joy of the moſt pure and perfect kind to learn that ſhe was ſtill eſteemed and ſtill reſpected. Yet, on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, ſhe was ſomewhat uneaſy concerning the poor young gentleman, the embarraſſment he was under, and the means of removing it, without deſtroying the high opinion he entertained of her.</p>
                  <p>Theſe different affections were alternately viſible in her countenance; pleaſing ſenſations, however were predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant, and her heart felt eaſed of a moſt inſupportable burthen. When ſhe had finiſhed the letter, ſhe could have preſſed it to her lips; but ſhe forbore, laid it on the pillow of the Canoneſs, ſeized one of her hands, and on that beſtowed her kiſſes and her tears. Again the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs took the letter, again deſired Caroline to read it, and again was in raptures.</p>
                  <p>"Did not I tell you this young gentleman did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble other men? I ſaw it inſtantly. What a delicate turn has he given to your ſilence and embarraſſment, which he had underſtood to proceed from anger! Is it poſſible to be more modeſt, or more reſpectful? One of your court fops would have interpreted the whole of

Well, really he is a moſt charming youth, and we muſt inſtantly put him out of pain. Get the pen and ink, my dear, ſit down and write; come, come, make haſte."</p>
                  <p>"I! Mamma," ſaid Caroline, bluſhing. "I thought you would have been kind enough to anſwer his letter."</p>
                  <p>"You know my dear girl, it is with difficulty I can write, at preſent. (The Baroneſs had a diſorder in her eyes, the conſequence of her illneſs, and her ſight daily became worſe.) But no matter; you ſhall write in my name, and I will dictate." Caroline obeyed, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken pen, ink, and paper, the Canoneſs, after conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a moment, thus began:</p>

                  <p>After a ſhort conteſt, the Baroneſs owned Carolin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> right; the paper was torn, another ſheet taken, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs again began to think and to dictate.</p>
                  <p>"Sir,</p>
                  <p>"Miſs Lichtfield is moſt exceedingly glad to find you entertain ſo high an opinion of her, her joy cannot be expreſſed—"</p>
                  <p>"Upon my word, Mamma," ſaid Caroline, throwing down the pen, "this is worſe than the other; let me beg you will neither ſpeak of my joys nor griefs."</p>
                  <p>The Baroneſs was now abſolutely vexed, and ſaid ſhe would have nothing at all to do with her anſwer; and that ſhe might write it herſelf. Caroline began to think this the wiſeſt way, and after conſidering in her turn, and, in her turn, tearing two or three ſheets of paper, ſhe had the good ſenſe, at laſt, to recollect that the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt and moſt unaffected mode is always the beſt; ſhe therefore wrote,</p>
                  <p>"We thank you, Sir, for the concern you are kind enough to take in the health of your neighbours. My indiſpoſition is gone off.

                  <p>Nobody will doubt but that Lindorf was very careful to avail himſelf of the permiſſion granted, and to pay his reſpects in the evening. Caroline had foreſeen this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him with ſomewhat of impatience, ſaw him arrive with joy, and not without emotion. He himſelf was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſconcerted, but a gentle ſmile from Caroline pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſtored him all his former eaſe; they both became perfectly unconſtrained, to which the Baroneſs did not a little contribute; ſhe, with pleaſantry which ſhe highly enjoyed, ran over every incident of the ſtranger, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and the letter; and thus ſaved Caroline explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhe was moſt happy to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Lindorf was cautious and penetrating; he read the feelings of Caroline: they went together to the pavilion, and he ſaid not a word that had the ſlighteſt reference to what had paſſed, except that he entreated Caroline to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

accompanied her on the piano forte; but, though he was an excellent muſician, he was often out of time; and Caroline herſelf made ſeveral miſtakes. Notwithſtanding this, the ſong pleaſed him ſo much that he aſked permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to take and copy it; which granted, Lindorf, on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it, had the courage to kiſs the hand by which it was preſented, and to pronounce, in a half whiſper, "How good, Madam, are you to-day, and how different are my preſent feelings from thoſe of yeſterday!" The ingenuous Caroline was on the point of declaring that ſhe herſelf was much eaſier and happier, but ſhe juſt had the recollection to refrain. They returned to the Canoneſs, and Lindorf, ſhortening his viſit, begged permiſſion to repeat it on the morrow.</p>
                  <p>The morrow and the morrow, and every ſucceeding morrow, each reſembled the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he began to be acquainted, and which, when he came to, he inſtinctively would ſtop at. Every afternoon Lindorf came betimes to Rindaw, where he often remained to ſup; and every night, after he was gone, the Canoneſs, more and more tranſported with his conduct, ſpoke of him with enthuſiaſm. Caroline liſtened, and modeſtly approved, and each went nightly to bed declaring he was the moſt amiable of men: nay, Caroline it is ſaid, would ſometimes repeat it in her ſleep; and as for the Baroneſs, her nocturnal dreams were all concerning the marriage ſhe had imagined, and which ſhe thought nothing could fruſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Well, but Lindorf?—Why Lindorf had his dreams likewiſe; for he loved with an ardour which he ſought not to oppoſe, and with a ſincerity that gave dignity to affection, which every day grew ſtronger. Born with great ſenſibility and ſtrong paſſions, he had not lived till five-and-twenty without a knowledge of love, or, at leaſt, without a ſuppoſed knowledge. But how different were his former tumultuous ſenſations to thoſe he at preſent felt! His thoughts all tender, delicate, and pure, had no other object but Caroline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> happy in her ſight, happy to hear the ſweet ſound of her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034126_0063_0FFA570BEA5E9690"/>
and that ſweet familiarity which country retirement authoriſes, he could not imagine ſuperior bliſs; and if, when alone, which walking, muſic, and the infirmities of the Baroneſs occaſioned them often to be, he ſometimes were like to betray himſelf, and riſk an avowal of his ſentiments: timidity, reſpect, and dread of deſtroying that ſhare of felicity of which he was in preſent poſſeſſion, always made him ſilent. Such ever are the effects of true and ſincere love. Caroline too confided all her thoughts to him with ſuch innocence, ſuch ſecurity, he was ſo perfectly convinced that ſhe no way ſuſpected either what paſſed in his heart or her own, that Lindorf, whoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy equalled his affection, would likewiſe have thought it a crime to diſturb that happy ignorance before the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he himſelf ſhould be at his own diſpoſal, which he could not then be perfectly ſaid to be.</p>

                     </gap> Certainly not; for, though the penetration of man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not that of women in this reſpect, Caroline was ſo frank, and ſo little underſtood the art of diſſembling, of concealing her feelings, that it was impoſſible for him to doubt. She alone was ignorant of them. She ſuppoſed her love for Lindorf was the love of a ſiſter, and her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the affection of friendſhip; ſhe even applauded herſelf for daily finding freſh occaſion to love him more, nor had the ſlighteſt idea that an attachment ſo pure, as ſhe felt hers to be, could, in the leaſt, become injurious to engagements which ſhe held ſacred, but of which ſhe ſeldom thought. How, indeed, could ſhe? Was there time to think on any thing but Lindorf, when Lindorf was preſent? And he was ever preſent, either ideally or really; for, the moment he was gone, either the pleaſure of having ſeen him, impatience to ſee him again, or his image in every attitude, under every aſpect in which it had ſo lately been beheld, occupied her whole thoughts. Lindorf to Caroline was every thing, and, the Baroneſs excepted, ſhe knew not of, thought not of, any other being in the univerſe.</p>
                  <p>This imprudent Baroneſs ſtill added, by her enthuſiaſm, to the faſcination of Caroline. From infancy accuſtomed to think as ſhe thought, and to ſee as ſhe ſaw, her autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would have been fully ſufficient to fix the attachment of Caroline on a perſon for whom the Canoneſs had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:034126_0064_0FFA1B761467D8B0"/>
ſo abſolute, and ſo continually augmenting. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did the Baroneſs, when ſhe could find opportunity by being left for a moment with Lindorf, ſuffer her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret half to eſcape; clearly enough did ſhe give him to underſtand that it depended on him, only, to obtain the hand of Caroline; and that ſhe already looked upon him as her ſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus the happy Lindorf, encouraged by one, adored by the other, and, perhaps, in more full and delicious enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of happineſs than if he had been a declared lover, thought himſelf certain of prevailing the moment he ſhould ſpeak; and for which moment he waited a little impatiently. Engagements he had, by which he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n reſtrained; and from theſe it was neceſſary to be free before he could honeſtly avow his paſſion for Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and make an offer of his hand and heart. He had been very buſily employed in removing theſe obſtacles; and for ſome time paſt, his agitation and ſhort ſymptoms of melancholy betrayed ſomething of his inquietude and fears.</p>
                  <p>One evening, as he left Rindaw, he informed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he was fearful leſt he could not have the pleaſure of ſeeing them on the morrow; he was obliged to go, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, immediately to Berlin, where he expected to find letters that were to him of the utmoſt importance. "But," added he, with a tone of voice more than uſually animated, "I hope, in compenſation for a day thus loſt to life, I ſhall be permitted to return early the morning after."</p>
                  <p>The Canoneſs immediately invited him to breakfaſt, and Caroline accompanied him to the garden, where they took leave of each other as if it were for a long farewell, and ſeparated, impatiently wiſhing the morrow over. The next day, which for two months had been the only one paſſed without Lindorf, appeared exceedingly tedious to both the ladies, The good Baroneſs loved Lindorf ſo entirely, that, had not her friendſhip for Caroline inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, which we muſt do her the juſtice to acknowledge was always predominant, he might, in all probability, if ſo he had pleaſed, have even baniſhed the High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain from her boſom. She acknowledged that Lindorf continually brought him to her recollection, and made her remember the happy days of their former loves. "Yes," ſaid the Baroneſs, "the High Chamberlain was juſt ſo fine, ſo ſweet a youth."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:034126_0065_0FFA57195143D0A8"/>"My father, then, is ſurpriſingly altered," ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! yes, my dear," replied the Baroneſs, "what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may be at preſent, he was then a moſt charming man—If thy mother had not been ſo rich—But, alas! my dear High Chamberlain was ever ambitious."</p>
                  <p>"And is ſtill," mournfully thought Caroline; "he is not altered in that reſpect; his poor child is the victim of that unrelenting ambition, to which every other feeling has been ſacrificed."</p>
                  <p>This converſation, this gloomy retroſpect, naturally led her to think of the Count, and of her union with him. The abſence of Lindorf, and the certainty of not ſeeing him all the long long day, had diſpoſed her mind to languor and melancholy: in the evening ſhe walked in the garden, when theſe ſenſations and gloomy ideas accompanied her: the image of the Count, particularly, tormented her; in ſpite of every effort to remove it from her imagination, and to think on ſomething elſe, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually recurred, and with encreaſing pain and diſguſt. A dry and yellow leaf fell from one of the trees at her feet, and approaching autumn immediately roſe to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; her heart ſhrunk at the thought, and an oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weight, almoſt to ſuffocation, came over her; tears at length began to flow.</p>
                  <p>"And is the ſummer, this happy ſummer, already paſſed? It has endured but a moment, and it will return no more: with it eaſe and content are fled from Caroline. Autumn approaches, it is here, and my father is coming to tear me from theſe beloved haunts, to ſeparate me from my good Mamma; and, if the Count my huſband pleaſes —My huſband!—My huſband!—O Lindorf! friend, brother, every thing that eſteem holds moſt dear, muſt I never ſee thee more!—Alas! poor Caroline, wherefore haſt thou known him if thou muſt ſo ſoon be ſeparate from him!"</p>
                  <p>This was the firſt time ſhe had ever made the reflection, and it was ſo cutting, ſo dreadful, and affected her ſo much, that it abſorbed every other afflicting thought.</p>
                  <p>Intent on this idea, and abſent to every other, ſhe walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till ſhe came to the door of the pavilion that led to the road. It was open: oppoſite it was a wood. Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line was alone: the thick foliage was adapted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper of her mind; it was dark and gloomy, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:034126_0066_0FFA57E202B3D560"/>
almoſt ſhut out day. During the ſummer ſhe had often wiſhed to walk in this wood, but with Lindorf it would have been improper; the recollection of this wiſh ſlightly returned; there was no preſent reſtraint, and ſhe croſſed the road. As ſhe entered the wood, ſhe felt herſelf highly affected by objects which were new to Caroline. It was a glorious evening; the rays of the ſetting ſun with gold and purple beamed over the horizon through an immenſe ſpace of clouds, which ſeemed almoſt on fire, and the red &amp; ardent colours of which were ſeen through the branches of oaks whoſe antiquity appeared almoſt coeval with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The evening ſong of the birds was loud, melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and univerſal; to which the monotonous chirping, of the ſwarming graſs-hopper gave variety.</p>

She took the firſt path ſhe ſaw, and which apparently led through the wood; ſhe followed it, for a conſiderable time, without thinking or perceiving how far ſhe had ſtrayed; at length, ſome noiſe ſuddenly drew her from the profound reverie in which ſhe was plunged; ſhe looked up and ſaw before her, at no great diſtance, a grand and elegant chateau; ſhe had not much time for reflection; there was an avenue that led to that chateau, and in that avenue was—Lindorf.</p>
                  <p>The lover inſtantly leaped the wall that ſeparated them, for he had ſeen Caroline; and already he is by her ſide, already teſtifying, more by looks than words, his aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and joy at finding her almoſt at his own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Caroline, confuſed, amazed, bluſhed even to the finger ends, and durſt not look on Lindorf, but, ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, ſaid ſhe had loſt herſelf!—She was abſolutely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of—She had ſuppoſed Riſberg lay another way!</p>
                  <p>Lindorf ſaw, by her manner, ſhe had ſuppoſed ſo, and, far from preſſing her to ſtay, far from deſiring her to walk into his gardens and repoſe herſelf, he had the delicacy to offer to re-conduct her to Rindaw immediately. The offer was inſtantly accepted, and Lindorf, to vary the walk of Caroline, took another path, ſtill, as he ſaid, more agreeable, ſtill more pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Lindorf, undoubtedly, by the pleaſanteſt underſtood the longeſt, and the diſtance was doubled. Caroline
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:034126_0067_0FFA5721A68E6068"/>
could not but remark it, and was ſo fatigued at laſt as to be obliged to accept an arm ſhe had at firſt refuſed.</p>
                  <p>"This way muſt be greatly round about, Sir?"</p>
                  <p>"It is; I aſk pardon, but I was willing you ſhould know what I do every day."</p>

                  <p>"When I go to Rindaw, I take the ſhorteſt way, through the wood; but when I return home I go this, which is the moſt round about."</p>
                  <p>Caroline bluſhed, and made no reply.</p>
                  <p>Whether it was a continuation of the reflections of the day, or whether it was her e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Lindorf, on the contrary, had, when they firſt met, ſeemed more than uſually pleaſed and contented; joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed enlivened his countenance, and gave animation to every feature and every expreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Caroline ſcarcely could give the ſhorteſt anſwers, ſuch oppreſſion was there at her heart; Lindorf could not help remarking the change; he was ſilent, and obſerved her with eyes alternately expreſſive of tenderneſs, hope, and fear. He appeared as if he had ſomething to ſay which he durſt not utter. The moon roſe, and her ſoft clear beams, glimmering on their ſilent path, ſtill increaſed their mutual emotion.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, Caroline, having recovered herſelf ſufficiently to pronounce a few words, aſked Lindorf if he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the letters he had ſo impatiently expected.</p>
                  <p>"The letters! The letters!" repeated Lindorf, with paſſion in his words and looks, "O, yes! I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them!—You know not, dear Caroline, cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how eſſentially theſe letters may influence my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs!—To morrow morning I will come, will communicate their contents.—Yes, charming Caroline, gentleſt and deareſt friend of my heart," to morrow you ſhall read that heart which burns with impatience to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand, to unburthen itſelf, and pour its moſt ſecret thoughts into your boſom—Every thing I think, every thing I feel,

all I have thought, and all I have felt, to morrow you ſhall know; and my deſtiny ſhall be eternally decided!"</p>
                  <p>Theſe words, and particularly the tone and manner in which they were uttered, rouſed and terrified Caroline: they tore off the veil which had already been half raiſed. Without the power of replying a ſingle word, ſhe ſtill had the force to diſengage her arm, which Lindorf preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ardour, and, looking up, found herſelf preciſely oppoſite the garden door, which ſhe precipitately enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſaying, with words that almoſt choaked her as they obtained paſſage, "Farewell, Lindorf!—To morrow— I will, alſo—tell you ſomething—You ſhall hear"—</p>
                  <p>She could contain no longer; her head fell on her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; her tears, too long withheld, ſtreamed down her cheeks; a univerſal tremor ſeized her, and ſhe was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſit down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> graſs bank.</p>
                  <p>And Lindorf?—Why Lindorf follows. Lindorf is at her feet. Lindorf is preſſing with tranſport her lily hands, and ſtooping to kiſs them, while Caroline is unable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; he dares even claſp her in his arms; and the languid head of Caroline, reclining, droops upon his ſhoulder.</p>
                  <p>"My deareſt, my beſt beloved," ſaid Lindorf; "Oh! ſuffer me to aſſuage, to dry thoſe precious tears, pledges of my approaching happineſs.—Adored lady! Oh calm thyſelf, fear not; 'tis thy friend, thy lover, thy future huſband, who thus conjures thee."</p>
                  <p>This word, this dreadful word, recalled Caroline to animation and herſelf. She roſe, terrified, broke from Lindorf, would have ſpoke, but could not articulate a word, and, ſhuddering at her preſent danger, felt that flight alone could retrieve, could ſave her. Lindorf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, for a moment, half amazed at the terror of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, and doubting to what motives it ought to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted; while ſhe eſcaped, ran to her chamber, threw herſelf into the firſt chair ſhe found, and was ſo affected, for ſome time, that ſhe loſt all coherency of thought.</p>
                  <p>She remained not long in this ſtate; and that which ſucceeded was much more dreadful. Happily for her, the Baroneſs had gone to bed before ſupper, as ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did, and was in a ſound ſleep: her appearance, therefore, was diſpenſed with; and, that ſhe might with freedom yield to her preſent feelings without a witneſs, ſhe likewiſe determined to go to bed and diſmiſs her maid.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as ſhe was ſufficiently collected to reflect, not

The ſentence was indeed moſt ſevere. Virtue pronounced it; but the heart of Virtue herſelf muſt bleed while it was pronounced. Caroline no longer could, in the leaſt, deceive herſelf reſpecting the nature of her feelings. Love ſtood confeſſed, arrayed in all his tyranny; his arm was pitileſs, and his power unbounded. Sorrow ſharpened his arrows, and Deſpair ſhot them; yet Deſpair itſelf only confirmed Caroline in her reſolution; Diſhonour threatened her, and ſhe did not heſitate a moment.</p>
                  <p>But how was ſhe to inform him?—How ſpeak the dreadful tidings?—The ſcene of the evening was too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and too painful to riſk renewin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd ſhe felt it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be herſelf the narrator. A letter was the only means, and ſhe was all night mentally occupied in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it; but a letter, on ſuch an occaſion, and with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations like hers, was not eaſily written; each word, each phraſe, appeared either too cold or too paſſionate. At length, when ſhe had imagined nearly the manner and the turn ſhe ſhould give it, ſhe was impatient for day-break, that ſhe might riſe and write. Every minute did ſhe open her curtains, hoping to diſcover the firſt rays of morning; and no ſooner had ſhe diſcovered them than ſhe left her bed, put on a morning gown, and prepared to begin this moſt painful taſk.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſeen that every thing Caroline moſt delighted in had found the way to the pavilion; and ſo had her ink-ſtand, and writing-deſk, along with the reſt. There was nothing in her chamber wherewith ſhe might trace a ſingle line; patience, therefore, was her laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource, and waiting till the ſervants were up and ſhould open the doors. But, as none of theſe had a lover to diſmiſs, they ſlept a full hour longer. This hour Caroline paſſed at her window, and it depended wholly on her to have enjoyed the moſt ſublime of ſights, and no doubt, for the firſt time in her life. The retiring of darkneſs, the gradual increaſe of light, and the ſun riſing in all its ſplendour and animating great Nature, made no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the wretched heart of Caroline. Lindorf, whom ſhe was forever to forbid her preſence, whom ſhe was to render miſerable; Lindorf, whoſe love ſhe had been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:034126_0070_0FFA57FB0789FE20"/>
of, and ignorant alſo how dear he was to her till the very moment when they muſt ſeparate forever; Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf obſcured every object, ſhe thought of him only, him only ſhe ſaw. The bright colours of the morning, the ſun's rays, and the revival of Nature, were to her, all dark and inanimate.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner could ſhe go out but ſhe ran to the pavilion. It was neceſſary that Lindorf ſhould receive her letter before his arrival at Rindaw; and Caroline had no doubt but he would be there as ſoon as poſſible.—Mournfully, then, ſhe took her way towards the pavilion; but what were her thoughts, what her emotion, when, as ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, ſhe ſaw, or thought ſhe ſaw, Lindorf himſelf, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the far end, pale, dejected, his hair all in diſorder, leaning on his elbow, and apparently plunged in the moſt profound reverie!</p>
                  <p>We ſay thought ſhe ſaw, becauſe, for the moment, ſhe ſuppoſed it to be an illuſion of a mind that had lately been moſt liable to illuſion, and of an imagination that beheld no other object. She looked and ſhrieked, but ſhe could not any longer doubt it was Lindorf himſelf, when, as ſhe ſhrieked, he roſe, flew to catch her, fell at her feet, and uttered with an impetuoſity it was not in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtop, "Oh! pardon, pardon, Caroline, pardon one who adores you! Think not I have forfeited my word. Yeſterday, when I left you, I went home, but, think not I paſſed the night in ſleep; no, at day-break I roſe; hither my wiſhes bore me; the door was open; in ſhort I ſcarcely know how I came in this place, but this place never will I leave, Caroline, no never, by every ſacred power I ſwear, never, till thou haſt told me what my deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny is to be; or, at leaſt, Caroline, till thou haſt ſuffered thy happy lover to interpret thy ſilence and emotion in his own favour. A ſmile will ſuffice. Certain of thy conſent and the conſent of our dear friend the Baroneſs, I will fly to obtain that of thy father.—To-morrow, yes, perhaps, to-morrow, thou mayeſt confeſs, without bluſhing, thou loveſt!"</p>
                  <p>This, no doubt, was the moment to have ſpoken. A word would have been enough, would have inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the lovers deareſt, ſweeteſt hopes, but, oh! how painful was it to pronounce a word like this! It ſtopped ſhort as it roſe to the lips; Caroline wiſhed but could not utter it. Lindorf, prepoſſeſſed by former appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034126_0071_0FFA57374F287E40"/>
interpreted this ſilence in his own favour; it was attributed to modeſty, embarraſſment, timidity; and, wiſhing to oblige her to ſpeak, he precipitately roſe, ran, and ſnatched his hat as it lay on the piano forte.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Caroline," ſaid he, as he ſeized it, "I would not loſe a moment when happineſs ſo ſupreme is in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! I will no longer demand a confeſſion which I ſee diſtreſſes you ſo much to make; I will fly inſtantly to Berlin, and as inſtantly return; I hope, with a better claim to requeſt this confeſſion."</p>
                  <p>Longer delay was now impoſſible. Caroline, terrified, collecting all her force, ſtopped and held Lindorf.— "What are you going to do?" ſaid ſhe. "Alas! you know not—But learn"—</p>
                  <p>Lindorf himſelf no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> partook of the terror of Caroline. "Learn what?" ſaid he.</p>
                  <p>"A ſecret."</p>
                  <p>"What ſecret! Speak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Caroline, releaſe me from this dread."</p>
                  <p>"I—I—I am"—</p>
                  <p>"You are"—</p>
                  <p>"Married."</p>
                  <p>The bolt of thunder could not have ſtruck more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually—"Married!" repeated he, with the accent, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſhriek, of terror.—The moſt profound ſilence followed. Caroline, trembling, ſat down, and hid her face with her handkerchief. Lindorf remained petrified: at laſt, ſtarting wild, and ſtriding about the room, he repeated again, "Married!"</p>
                  <p>Silence again enſued.—And again ſtriking his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, "No, it is impoſſible, abſolutely impoſſible; you deceive me, Caroline, you impoſe upon a wretch whom you have driven mad. Ah! ceaſe, ceaſe a ſport ſo cruel. Say, tell me, you are not married."</p>
                  <p>"It is but too true that I am," replied Caroline, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fainting.</p>
                  <p>"But the Canoneſs?"—</p>
                  <p>"She is ignorant of my marriage, I told you it as a ſecret."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Caroline, Caroline!—Fatal ſecret! And I a confirmed and everlaſting wretch!"</p>
                  <p>For ſome minutes he was in an agony that approached the wildeſt phrenſy; he ſat down, roſe, tore his hair,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:034126_0072_0FFA5804E8998E00"/>
groaned, gnaſhed his teeth; every action denoted the fury and tempeſt within.</p>
                  <p>"Be calm, Lindorf, dear Lindorf, be calm! In the name of Heaven be calm! Do not thus give way to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! Am not I, alſo, ſtill more unhappy?"</p>
                  <p>"You! You unhappy! Caroline?"</p>
                  <p>Affection and tenderneſs roſe at the ſuppoſition, and tears—ay, bitter tears ſcalded the manly cheek, and gave a little eaſe to the heart.—"Caroline," ſaid he in a ſofter tone, "explain this ſecret, the diſcovery of which is thus fatal. Who is this unknown, this inconceivable huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; who thus can leave, thus neglect, the ſupremity of mortal bliſs?"</p>
                  <p>Caroline, who ſcarce could ſpeak, ſomewhat, however, conſoled, to ſee Lindorf more tranquil, gave a ſuccinct relation of her marriage with a nobleman whom ſhe did not name. She reſpected the ſecret of Walſtein, and gave not any indications by which he might be known. She only ſaid that invincible repugnance for a match to which ſhe had ſubmitted, in obedience to her father, had occaſioned her to entreat a ſeparation, at leaſt for ſome time, which had been granted her, under condition of keeping it a ſecret. "Perhaps," ſaid ſhe, "I forfeit one of my duties now by revealing it; but I truſt I ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fulfil every other, whatever pangs it may coſt my heart. Farewell, Lindorf, we muſt ſee each other no more. Fly this fatal place, and if poſſible, forget the unfortunate Caroline."</p>
                  <p>"Fly! Forget you!" replied Lindorf, whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſomewhat changed by a ray of hope during the ſhort recital of Caroline.—"No, never, never!—I ſtill ſee a poſſibility, I ſtill dare hope for happineſs!"</p>
                  <p>"Lindorf!—Be careful what you ſay; grief cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly has diſturbed your reaſon!"</p>
                  <p>"No, if thou wilt deign but to conſent, bliſs may ſtill be mine—My deareſt Caroline, hear me—I know thy heart pleads in my behalf, in vain wouldſt thou forbid it; to me it appertains, by the ardour, the purity of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have I deſerved it, and my rights are far more ſacred than thoſe of a tyrannical huſband, who thus has abuſed paternal authority; grant me but thy permiſſion, and theſe hated bands ſhall be broken; yes, they ſhall; I dare affirm they ſhall. The King is juſt, he loves me, will
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:034126_0073_0FFA5740830BD0D0"/>
liſten to me. Beſide, I have a certain reſource, a friend, a ſupport that cannot fail."</p>
                  <p>"Unhappy Lindorf!" interrupted Caroline; "yield not to theſe chimeras. The King himſelf has forged the chains which no power can break; for who is there whoſe intereſt may, for a moment, outweigh that of the Count of Walſtein?"</p>
                  <p>Again Lindorf ſtood the ſtatue of amazement and dread! Again, the moment he could reſpire, he echoed— "Caroline!—The Count of Walſtein!"</p>
                  <p>"The name has eſcaped my lips," ſaid Caroline, "and my only dependence is on your diſcretion. Judge then, what your hopes muſt be, ſince it is he, Lindorf; yes, it is the Count of Walſtein who is—my huſband!"</p>
                  <p>Lindorf remained with his eyes fixed on the earth, his arms croſſed, his faculties wholly abſorbed, and in thought ſo deep as to ſeem almoſt lifeleſs; long he remained; but recovering, at length, from apparent ſtupor, "Caroline," ſaid he, fetching a deep and almoſt endleſs ſigh, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking at her, "I muſt leave you, Caroline, but I will return to-morrow morning; it is eſſentially neceſſary that I ſhould ſpeak to you once more. To-morrow, here, in this ſame place, at this ſame hour, tell me, will you meet me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," anſwered Caroline, ſcarcely knowing what ſhe ſaid.</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow, then," continued Lindorf, making a ſtep to approach Caroline, but inſtantly recoiling, and ſeizing his hat—"To-morrow"—He could ſay no more, but ſuddenly fled.</p>
                  <p>Imagine what the condition, what the feelings were of Caroline, and what the crowded and confuſed ideas that aſſailed her heart. The firſt, however, was the promiſe that ſhe ſhould ſee him once more. What could he have to ſay which he might not then have ſaid? Wherefore, ſo earneſtly, and with ſuch ſolemnity, entreat an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view to-morrow? She almoſt repented of the conſent ſhe had given; and yet, could ſhe have refuſed? Beſide, it was poſſible he had not abandoned the hope of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a divorce, for he did not ſay he had; it therefore was neceſſary to meet again, that ſhe might diſſuade him from all uſeleſs efforts, which could only end in diſcovering their affection, and in rendering the miſerable Caroline ſtill more miſerable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:034126_0074_0FFA581315E719F8"/>The reflection determined her to be punctual to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, and at the appointed place. She afterwards began to think how difficult it would be longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the truth from the Canoneſs. What would the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Lindorf lead her to ſuppoſe? Caroline felt too how great the conſolation would be of giving her ſorrows vent, and ſhedding her tears in the boſom of a friend ſo tender and ſo indulgent. Yet the promiſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of her had been ſo ſtrong, ſo poſitive, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced puniſhment was ſo terrible, that without permiſſion, ſhe durſt not ſpeak. Her having betrayed it to Lindorf was enough, nay, too much; and nothing but the motives on which ſhe had acted could juſtify her to herſelf. Yet the more ſhe reflected, the more ſhe ſaw the neceſſity of informing the Baroneſs; ſhe therefore determined, be the conſequence what it might, to write to her father, and beg permiſſion to inform her. "It was no longer poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble," ſhe ſaid, "to diſſemble with her dear Mamma, or to conceal her marriage. The ignorance of the Baroneſs, concerning that event, expoſed her to moſt painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and which were continually repeated. Every moment ready to betray herſelf, ſhe moſt humbly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated permiſſion to confeſs a ſecret which ſay too heavy on her heart, and which was an offence to the gratitude and friendſhip ſhe owed the Baroneſs. And what was there to fear? The ill health of the Baroneſs, her love of retirement, her abſence from all ſociety, made diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certain; for to whom could ſhe ſpeak; ſince nobody ſhe ſaw?—Beſide," added Caroline, willing to prevent the viſit and the perſecution ſhe dreaded, "determined as I am not to leave her, ſo long as ſhe lives, is it not a ſhocking thing to be forbidden to ſpeak truth, and to open my heart to the dear friend who has been to me a mother? —Believe me, dear, dear Sir," continued ſhe, "to afflict you will doubly afflict myſelf; or to deprive you of a child, who, if ſo you had pleaſed, never would have forſaken you, but to you would have conſecrated her life, in proof of her affection; but you, Sir, thought proper otherwiſe to ordain: permit me, dear Sir, in my turn, to enjoy that liberty which my huſband and King have granted, which was, that <hi>I might remain at Rindaw as long as I pleaſed;</hi> for ſuch was the ſentence, which I ſhall never forget. My reſolution, Sir, is to remain here ſo long as my only friend ſhall live, to whom my cares and attentions may

be uſeful, and ſo long as my heart and my reaſon ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt at the ties I have formed."</p>
                  <p>Such was the ſubſtance of the letter, which after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving copied and ſent, Caroline found herſelf ſomewhat relieved; her ſecret became leſs burthenſome by the hope of being permitted to reveal it; and the idea of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Count, for years to come, ſomewhat conſoled her for the dreadful one of never beholding Lindorf more. It was, indeed, too much to feel the double torment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nouncing the man ſhe loved, and living with the man ſhe hated; perſuaded that her fortitude would rid her of the latter misfortune, ſhe felt recovering ſtrength to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the former.</p>
                  <p>"I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hall ſee him no more," ſaid ſhe; "but though I ſee not him, I ſhall be troubled with the ſight of no one elſe; and of him I may think unceaſingly, here, in theſe groves, in this pavilion, which his preſence has rendered ſo dear to memory."</p>
                  <p>Thus fortified, Caroline was able to ſupport the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Canoneſs and her queſtions, afflicting as they were; for ſhe every moment was inquiring if Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline did not imagine Lindorf would come to-day, every moment was repeating her aſtoniſhment that he had not been punctual to his promiſe. The diſorder in her eyes, which ſtill increaſed, prevented her from ſeeing the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of her inquiries on the countenance of Caroline, whoſe cheeks were fluſh and pale and continually varying, affected by a continued variety of diſtreſs, but this the Baroneſs ſaw not; ſhe ſpoke of nothing but the dear youth, was fearful leſt ſome misfortune had happened to him, and, in the evening, determined to ſend the next day to make inquiries.</p>
                  <p>At length ſhe retired to her chamber, as did Caroline gladly to hers, in which ſhe paſſed the night as ſhe had done the night before. At the appointed hour ſhe was at the pavilion; but Lindorf was not come. She waited half an hour, which ſeemed half an age, and yet he came not. She opened the window, went out on the road, went to the entrance of the wood, and looked every way as far as ſhe could look; at length, ſhe beheld him co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. She juſt had ſtrength enough to gain the pavilion, where ſhe ſat herſelf down, unable to riſe when he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and could only return his ſalutation by a ſlight incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:034126_0076_0FFA1B671909BAA0"/>Lindorf obſerved her exceſſive paleneſs and dejection: he advanced, tremblingly, and without ſpeaking a ſingle word. When he was near her, he kneeled on one-knee and preſented her a packet, ſealed up, and a box contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a miniature picture. He bowed and, riſing, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient ſtrength to ſay, in a low and half ſuffocated voice, "Accept theſe from a friend.—Farewell! Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, farewell! may you be happy!" Then, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though not without paſſion, twice kiſſing her hand, he roſe, put his handkerchief to his eyes, and left the pavilion.</p>
                  <p>Had not the packet and the box remained, Caroline would have imagined ſhe had ſeen an apparition, ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and ſo ſtrangely had he diſappeared. With wild ſtupor her looks followed Lindorf; and no ſooner was he gone than, her arms inſtinctively extending themſelves towards the door, Caroline exclaimed, "Oh Lindorf! Lindorf!"</p>
                  <p>Lindorf heard her not, Lindorf ſaw her not, Lindorf, alas! was no longer there. She roſe precipitately, let the packet and the box fall from her lap, on which they had been placed, and ran to the window, where ſhe ſaw Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf as if flying from an enemy, or ſtruck with panic fear. He was preſently out of ſight, and the tears of Caroline began abundantly to ſtream down her cheeks. It was well they did; for, in all probability, they prevented fainting, and, perhaps, worſe conſequences.</p>
                  <p>"It is paſt," ſaid ſhe, "I ſhall ſee him no more. To me he is forever loſt."</p>
                  <p>Her ſobs interrupted ſpeech, and almoſt reſpiration; and again her tears began to courſe each other with greater violence. At length ſhe remembered the packet and the box, which Lindorf had left, and which were lying at her feet. In theſe, no doubt, ſhe would find ſomething that might explain this ſingular and myſterious farewell; ſhe took the box up firſt. It is his image, the portrait of Lindorf, thought ſhe, as ſhe was endeavouring to open it. "And thinkeſt thou I have need of ſuch aid to recollect thee, Lindorf?"</p>
                  <p>Yet was it a conſolation to poſſeſs his picture, the value of which ſhe fully felt, and the recollection made her open the box witn eagerneſs.—How great was her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe!—It was the uniform of Lindorf, it was a Captain
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034126_0077_0FFA57520A5241F8"/>
of the guards, it was a moſt handſome man, but it was not her lover; a perſon entirely different from Lindorf, and to her entirely unknown. She inſtantly ſhut the box again, threw it with anger on the table, and took up the packet.</p>
                  <p>"Let us ſee," ſaid ſhe, "if this incomprehenſible man has explained what this may mean. Whoſe is this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait? Wherefore leave, why give it me?" The ſeals of the packet were preſently broken, and in it ſhe found a manuſcript in the hand-writing of Lindorf. Caroline was ſo much affected that ſhe began to read without at all comprehending what ſhe read; at length, however, her ſcattered thoughts were ſomewhat collected, and, ſeating herſelf at the window, ſhe took up the manuſcript, and again began to read.</p>

Two children were the ſole fruits of this union; the firſt a ſon, the preſent Count, and the only remaining male of the family, which, if he dies childleſs, will, with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extinct. This ſon was, therefore, the greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Heaven could beſtow on his parents.

The King, depending wholly on his courage, and neglecting his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was in the utmoſt danger; purſued by ſeveral Auſtrian huſſars, his horſe had been wounded and could not fly, and himſelf ran the riſk of either being taken or killed. General Walſtein was the ſole perſon who ſaw the danger attended by his ſon, then in his ſixteenth year, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his campaign, in the company of his father, as a ſimple volunteer. The general intercepted the huſſars; the young Count flew to the king with his horſe, while his father wounded, or put to flight, the purſuers, and himſelf received the mortal blow which elſe, perhaps, had deſcended on the Monarch.</p>
                              <p>"Some officers came up, among whom my father was, who was the General's moſt intimate friend, and they and young Walſtein bore his father to his tent. The King, in conſternation, followed; and the ſurgeons, having examined the wound, declared he had only a few moments to live. His ſon, kneeling by his bedſide, gave way to grief the moſt unbounded; and inceſſantly repeated, "Oh! my father, my dear father, why was it not me they killed!" The general collected the little remaining ſtrength he poſſeſſed, to conſole and recommend his ſon to the King. "I commit him, Sir," ſaid he, "into your hands; he has partook my peril and my glory; and he, like me, will learn to live and die in the defence of his King and country. You will be to him a father, be faithful to you as I have been, and thus both to you and him I ſhall be replaced.—And for you, young man, weep not; ſhew more fortitude, and envy the glorious death I die. Inſtead of grieving, think of deſerving, by your courage, the auguſt father to whom I dying confide you."</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="80" facs="unknown:034126_0079_0FFA1AD1AE6CCFB8"/>"Yes," ſaid the King, exceedingly affected, claſping the young Count in his arms, "I will be a father to him, and never, ſo long as I live, will forget that for my ſake he loſt his own. He ſhall henceforth be my ſon and friend; and, to prove it, I now, inſtantly, give him a commiſſion in the guards, which will fix his reſidence near me, during his youth, and which is but the beginning of the good I intend."</p>
                              <p>"The young Count, wholly devoted to affliction, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered not; perhaps, did not hear what the King had ſaid. Gratitude and happineſs however again were viſible in the countenance of the expiring General, and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once more to thoſe eyes which the ſhades of death had half obſcured; he ſtretched out one hand to his King and the other to his ſon, and, making a laſt effort, ſaid to the latter—"My ſon—your ſiſter—my dear little Matilda— to you I confide her and the care of her future happineſs —Poor girl!—But you will love, you will be a father."</p>
                              <p>"He could ſay no more. The young Count would have replied, but inceſſant ſobs choaked up utterance; he only could kiſs the General's hand, which he did with ſuch an enthuſiaſm of affliction as might well aſſure the dying fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the love and obedience of the ſon. Alas! that hand was already cold, and the next moment the breath departed from the General, who lay reclined in the arms of <hi>my</hi> father, to whom, likewiſe, expiring, he ſaid, "Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, you love my children. Oh! my King, my ſon, my friend, grieve not for me, for I die the happieſt of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and of fathers."</p>
                              <p>"Perhaps, Madam, theſe affecting incidents are not unknown to you, but, if ſo, I ſtill thought it my duty, on the preſent occaſion, to recall them to your memory. Yet I have reaſon to ſuppoſe you wholly unacquainted with them, and that they will make the ſame impreſſion on you they did on me when my father, a witneſs of this affecting ſcene, has taken pleaſure in recounting it to me.

the young Count of Walſtein to come and paſs ſome months at our houſe!</p>
                              <p>"My father's ill health had obliged him to quit the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice a few years after the death of the General; ſince which time he conſtantly remained at an eſtate which lies in the farther part of Sileſia. Several years were paſſed there before the paſſionate deſire I had to ſee the Count could be gratified; I was too young to appear at court, and being engaged in my ſtudies, theſe could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; nor could my father, notwithſtanding his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſolicitations, prevail on the King to ſuffer his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted ſon out of his ſight, for whom his attachment daily increaſed.</p>
                              <p>"Never, perhaps, was there ſo great a favourite, and never, perhaps, was there ſo deſerving a one. Far from profiting by their partiality of his maſter, and accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wealth and honours to himſelf, he ſought only to make others happy; and, inſtead of being envied, was adored. The name of the young Count of Walſtein was never pronounced without affection and praiſe; every father propoſed him as a model to his ſons, and every mother wiſhed him the huſband of her daughter; though few, indeed, might flatter herſelf with ſuch a hope. The King openly ſaid he himſelf would give him a wife, and the King deſtined the moſt amiable of women for Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein.</p>
                              <p>"Oh, Caroline! Caroline!—Yet, have I a right to murmur?—No, you ought to appertain to the beſt of men; you, only, could reward the virtues of Walſtein, and Walſtein, only, could merit you.</p>
                              <p>"At laſt, the long-wiſhed for moment of meeting the Count arrived. Returning from a moſt fatiguing cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, young Walſtein, having need of reſt, added his entreaties to thoſe of my father, and ſupplicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the King to paſs apart of the ſummer at Rone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, the eſtate at which my father reſided. The King had not the power to refuſe him any thing, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was granted, though reluctantly. I heard the news with tranſport. He came, and I found that Fame, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having exaggerated, was ſtill far beneath the truth. The Count was in the very prime of life; he was then four-and-twenty, and to the moſt dignified figure, and features the moſt beautiful, he added a countenance incredibly expreſſive; his eyes were the very mirror of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034126_0081_0FFA575514E5B758"/>
his mind; in them were painted benevolence and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and, whenever any trait of virtue or of courage was related, they perfectly flaſhed with animation and pleaſure; he was tall, his legs were remarkably handſome, nor is it impoſſible to convey the pleaſing ſenſations that the ſymmetry of his perſon and his whole appearance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</p>
                              <p>"I ſee your ſurpriſe, Caroline—Yes, ſuch was your huſband, and ſuch your huſband would ſtill have been, if—O, Caroline, I implore your pity; never did wretch ſtand in greater need of compaſſion.—You cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the horrible tale I have to tell; you cannot have the moſt diſtant conception of the pangs I fell at recollecting that, perhaps, in a moment, you will deteſt me—Yet, no; the good, the gentle, the tender Caroline will weep over my deſtiny, will pardon, and, I hope, forgive; for, though great have been my crimes, yet, ſurely, great is my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent puniſhment."</p>

The palpitations of her heart were violent, her ideas diſordered, her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation bewildered, and it was neceſſary to recollect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for a moment, ere ſhe could again begin reading.— She ſighed profoundly, dried up her tears, once more glanced at the box, again turned her eyes away, took up the manuſcript, and continued with an emotion that aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented at every line:</p>
                  <p>"I was in my nineteenth year when Walſtein came to Ronebourg, and, notwithſtanding the difference of age and ſituation, his kindneſs outran my hopes by the moſt delicate offers of friendſhip, which, to me, was as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary as it was flattering; for I then ſtood in the utmoſt need of a friend. My heart panted after ſome one who could underſtand it, to whom it could open itſelf, and who could participate its feelings. I was diſtractedly in love—Yet, no, it is profanation ſo to uſe the word. I loved not. I have ſince too well known what love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is, ſo to confound the two ſenſations—But I was ardently, inordinately, deſirous of obtaining a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of abſolutely obſcure birth; yet, whoſe beauty might
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034126_0082_0FFA5839959AFD98"/>
have placed her on a throne. Yes, Caroline, Louiſa was indeed beautiful; ſhe muſt have been, otherwiſe, I could not think her ſo now, could not tell you ſo at this moment."</p>
                  <p>The heart of Caroline had undergone ſuch variety of trials, and ſo ſevere, that it is not wonderful ſhe felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affected at this place. She leaned back, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on her chair; had recourſe to her ſmelling-bottle, and, when ſhe was ſomewhat recovered, again went on:</p>
                  <p>"Louiſa was the daughter of an invalid ſerjeant (my father held it a duty to maintain a certain number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valids) and one of my mother's maids. The old couple lived a quarter of a league from Ronebourg, on a ſmall farm, which my parents had given them as a reward for paſt ſervices. During my childhood I was continually with them, continually in the arms of the good Cicely, who had nurſed me, and who loved me as dearly as ſhe did her own ſon, Fritz; who, in theſe my boyiſh days, was my intimate friend. Louiſa, younger by ſome years than he, was ſtill dearer to me; for I could not quit the farm of the good Joſſelin, her father, nor live ſeparate from her a moment; and when they ſent me to the Univerſity I ſhed as many tears at taking leave of Cicely, Joſſelin, and, particularly, the little Louiſa, as in quitting the houſe of my father.</p>
                  <p>"I obtained permiſſion to take Fritz with me. I was ignorant, then, that this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d was, naturally, as vile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful as his parents were honeſt; or, I ſhould rather ſay, his baſeneſs was not at that time come to maturity. I ſaw him acute, active, faithful, and zealous for my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and my intereſts. He was the ſon of my nurſe, the brother of Louiſa. How many claims, therefore, had he on my confidence and love! They were not forgotten, and he was eſteemed rather as a friend than as a domeſtic.</p>
                  <p>"Some years ſtay at Erlang greatly enfeebled the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the farm, and the pleaſures of childhood; yet were they occaſionally revived by letters that Fritz received from his ſiſter, and ſhewed me. Theſe always contained ſome ſhort article concerning her young maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was ſo tenderly expreſſed, and ſhe recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fritz ſo urgently to love him, to ſerve him faithfully, aſked ſo earneſtly concerning his health and welfare, that I melted while I read them, and felt great impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſee her by whom they were written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:034126_0083_0FFA5767697C6838"/>"Among them came one which informed Fritz of the death of his mother, my good and dear nurſe. The grief of Louiſa was real and affecting, and painted with ſo much ſenſibility, an energy ſo powerful, and ſo native to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, that, at hearing it read, the moſt rugged na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt have been moved. I too, was ſincerely afflicted for her who, ever ſince my birth, had beſtowed the moſt tender attentions on me. I wept her death more than Fritz, and was far leſs eaſily conſoled. I have ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that one day, when I ſpoke of my ſorrow for the death of his mother, a phraſe eſcaped him which I did not then interpret as I do now. "You may ſee Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa with much leſs difficulty," ſaid he. Had age and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience better taught me, this would have ſufficiently unveiled his odious character; but I, at that time, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſweet innocence which ſuffers us not to ſuſpect evil.</p>
                  <p>"A ſhort time after I was recalled home. I returned to Ronebourg, and arrived there ſome months before the viſit of the young Count of Walſtein took place.—The very next day I ran to the farm of Joſſelin, accompanied by Fritz; but, good God! what were my feelings when I beheld Louiſa, and ſaw the amazing change which a few years had made in her perſon! Never before had I beheld a being ſo beauteous. She was in mourning, and her black veſt, while it marked her ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t form and ſhewed her ſlender ſhape more ſlender, gave a fine contraſt to one of the fineſt complexions Nature ever beſtowed. Her cheeks glowed with animation and pleaſure at the return of her brother and young maſter; her large dark eyes were powerfully and affectingly expreſſive; and her hair, black as the ribband by which it was decorated, falling in large treſſes on each ſide, made freſhneſs look more freſh, and added brightheſs to the vivid colours of youth.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, Caroline for thus dwelling on circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which, to you, cannot be very intereſting; and which now, to me, are become only indifferent, except as they may prove ſome alleviation to exceſſes into which a moſt ungovernable paſſion hurried me; for never can my crime find forgiveneſs, unleſs in the ſuperiority of that beauty by which it was inſpired; its effects, alas were the moſt ſudden and the moſt deplorable!</p>
                  <p>"When I ſet out for the farm, I had reſolved, in the gaiety of my heart, to let Louiſa gueſs which of the two
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034126_0084_0FFA5842AB621828"/>
was her brother; and had, therefore, dreſſed myſelf nearly like him; but the ecſtacy, the trouble, the deſires, of my ſoul, preſently betrayed me. Fritz laughed, and ſaw, with joy, the impreſſion his ſiſter had made on me. Louiſa ran with open arms and pleaſure in her eyes; but, ſuddenly ſtopping when ſhe came to me, ſhe made me a ruſtic courteſy, which I thought all grace, and, falling on her brother's neck, melted into tears.</p>
                  <p>"I was as much affected as ſhe, and the good old Joſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelin came to add to our emotion. He received me with tenderneſs and reſpect; we went into the houſe, and there he ſpoke to me of Cicely, the manner of her death, the greatneſs of his affliction, and recited all ſhe had ſaid, in her dying moments, relative to Fritz and me. I wiſhed to anſwer, but I could only behold Louiſa and weep with her. Joſſelin, afterwards, talked of his children, and aſked if I was ſatisfied with his ſon, "As for Louiſa," ſaid he, "ſhe is a good girl; ſhe takes care of me and the houſehold affairs, and ſupplies the place of her mother better than could be expected; ſo long as ſhe continues prudent, and her brother behaves well, I ſhall be eaſy and happy, and, after a while, ſhall, in my turn, again go and meet my dear Cicely. When I am gone, I truſt to God and my Lord the Baron to take care of my ſmall family, in whom, my children, I hope you will find conſolation for the loſs of your poor old father."</p>
                  <p>"Louiſa ran into hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> arms. Fritz, alſo approached, but he appeared to me but feebly moved: or, rather, I beheld Louiſa, the beauteous, the affectionate, the tender Louiſa; and I could have wiſhed, like her, to have kneeled to the old man, to have called him my father alſo, to have taken his hands and have preſſed them to my lips. The father of Louiſa was to me, at that moment, the moſt reſpectable of beings.</p>
                  <p>"It was time that a ſcene ſo affecting ſhould finiſh. My heart was overcharged, and might not contain all theſe thronging ſenſations, and I left the farm, bearing, in this captivated heart, the image of Louiſa and the fever of love. Fritz perceived all this, becauſe he waited and wiſhed it all. A connection between his ſiſter and me made him ſuppoſe my favour certain, and his own fortune made. Perhaps, his ambition went farther ſtill, and flattered him he might become the brother of his maſter. His baſe and intereſted mind regarded not the diſhonour
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034126_0085_0FFA1ADDCB73B788"/>
of his family, or of mine, if he only could receive benefit thereby; he, therefore, took every means in his power to blow up the flame by which I was devoured, and in which he ſucceeded but too well.</p>
                  <p>"Is not Louiſa, well grown and exceedingly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, Sir," ſaid he, "What a pity would it be if ſome ſtupid lout ſhould poſſeſs ſuch a treaſure of charms? For my part, I verily believe I ſhould rather ſee her the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of a great Lord, like you, than the wife of a ruſtic who would never know half her worth."</p>
                  <p>"This, and other ſimilar converſation, diſguſted me not, though it would have done, no doubt, before I had ſeen Louiſa. The dear idea of poſſeſſing her, no matter by what means, tranſported me; and I, every day, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed deeper draughts of the poiſon by which my feeble heart was infected; every day went to the farm, under the pretext of courſing or ſhooting, and was always kindly received by Joſſelin and his daughter, when they were together. As ſoon as I arrived, Louiſa would run to the dairy, fetch me a bowl of milk, cut me ſome brown bread and ſometimes eat with me. The good Joſſelin would recount his ancient exploits and campaigns, while emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying his bottle of beer. I feigned to liſten, while my eyes were continually ſearching Louiſa, and devouring her beauties; and never could I leave the place without an increaſe of paſſion.</p>
                  <p>"If I found her alone, all her former pleaſing atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all that air of friendſhip and ſatisfaction were gone, and a marked embarraſſment was ever apparent. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a ſentence and left it unfiniſhed; ſometimes ſeemed affected, and ready to weep; then, no longer maſter of myſelf, would I approach her with ecſtacy, venture ſome little liberties, and recal to her mind the ſports of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. But ſhe ever rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lled me with ſo firm, ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo decided a tone, that it awed my audacity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired headſtrong paſſion with fear.</p>
                  <p>"When I returned home I would complain to Fritz of his ſiſter's reſerve, conjure him to ſee her, to ſpeak in my favour, and to prevail on her to grant me more of her friendſhip and confidence. He would laugh, and aſſure me I was beloved, paſſionately beloved, that he knew it well from the confuſion in which Louiſa always appeared when we were alone, which was a certain proof. "But
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034126_0086_0FFA1BAFA029CB90"/>
theſe young girls," ſaid he, "who, in fact, only wiſh to yield, wiſh to have ſome excuſe for yielding."</p>
                  <p>"Emboldened by this hope, I would return to the farm. If Joſſelin was preſent I was received with every poſſible kindneſs; if not, the ſame continual embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment took place, and, if I became preſſing, the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. This conduct drove me to deſpair, and my love, at length, knew no bounds.</p>
                  <p>"Such was the trouble and efferveſcence of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions when the Count of Walſtein came to Ronebourg. Louiſa was the whole world to me, for Louiſa only I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted, and 'Louiſa I muſt poſſeſs, or die,' was the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual exclamation of my heart. The very reputation of the Count for prudence was ſufficient to deter me, for ſome days, from making any avowal of my paſſion. At firſt I was afraid of his over powerful reaſon, but the Count knew ſo well how to conceal his own ſuperiority that he himſelf ſeemed unconſcious of it. His mind, while it was ſtrong and ſublime, was ſo gentle and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate, and to a ripened wiſdom of age he ſo naturally added all the graces and vivacity of youth, that after a ſhort acquaintance, all fear and conſtraint were gone.</p>
                  <p>"His indulgent nature was ſo conciliating, ſo winning, that, one day, as we were walking together, and he was rallying me on the abſence, the apparent diſtraction of my thoughts, I ventured to inform him of the cauſe, and to open my whole heart. To him I made a recital much like that you juſt have read; I omitted no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and all was repeated with that warmth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm which well were deſcriptive of the paſſion by which I was devoured, while he ſeemed to liſten with the utmoſt emotion and concern. When I had ended, he took me by the hand, and claſping it with all the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of affection, "O Lindorf," ſaid he, "my too youthful, too tender friend, what a mountain of affliction art thou heaping on thyſelf!"</p>
                  <p>"He was proceeding to give me ſome advice, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him. "It is not advice," ſaid I, "dear Count, that I aſk; it is compaſſion and indulgence, it is your conſent to ſee my Louiſa, and, till you have ſeen her, not to paſs judgment on me." So ſaying, I forcibly drew him towards the farm.</p>
                  <p>"Louiſa was alone, and very melancholy. She appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if ſhe had been weeping, but this only made the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034126_0087_0FFA576E38F5DD08"/>
greater impreſſion on me; the ſurpriſe of ſeeing a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as we entered, ſpread her beautiful face with modeſt bluſhes; and her timidity and embarraſſment heightened her charms. She recovered herſelf, and received us as well as poſſible. I obſerved ſhe often looked at the Count, and that ſighs occaſionally eſcaped her which ſhe endeavoured to repreſs. As for Walſtein, he beheld her with aſtoniſhment, and turned, afterwards, and looked on me with eyes of affliction.</p>
                  <p>"We took a walk round the little kitchen garden of Louiſa. There were a few flowers intermingled, and ſhe gathered each of us a violet. I could not help obſerving ſhe gave the fineſt of them to my friend; but, certainly, this was nothing more than politeneſs, and I could not be jealous of the Count, whom ſhe had never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; no, I was only pleaſed that ſhe behaved ſo as might beſt obtain his good opinion. Nothing, I obſerved, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped him; the good order of her little garden, the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her perſon, and the cleanlineſs of her houſe; he ſaw them all, and felt them all.</p>
                  <p>"We took our leave, and, at a little diſtance from the houſe, met Joſſelin who was returning from the fields. His long white hair and venerable figure ſtruck the Count. "This," ſaid I, "is the father of Louiſa." Joſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelin came up, and ſpoke ſome time with his uſual good ſenſe; after which we parted, and continued our way. I walked beſide the Count without uttering a word, my anxious and inquiſitive eyes endeavoured to penetrate his thoughts, but he likewiſe kept ſilence. At length, I could forbear no longer—"Well, my dear Count, tell me, am I ſo very culpable for adoring Louiſa?"</p>
                  <p>"Not, at preſent," replied he; "you are yet only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate; ſhe deſerves to be adored"—Then tenderly embracing me, "No, you are not culpable," added he, but, perhaps, another day, and you may be—Fly dear Lindorf, fly that dangerous girl; there is no other poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſource. If the moſt ſincere, the moſt tender friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may any way ſoften the pangs of love, mine ſhall be wholly yours. I will not forſake you, will go with you to Berlin, or take you to my own eſtate, or, in fine, wherever you pleaſe, provided it be far enough from Ronebourg."</p>
                  <p>"Fly!" ſaid I, "Fly Louiſa! Live without Louiſa! No, never, never."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="unknown:034126_0088_0FFA584D93B8CC30"/>"And what, in the name of heaven," replied the Count, with ardour, "do you think of doing? What are your hopes? Do you mean to <hi>marry her?</hi>—Remember your parents, and think whether you alſo mean to <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them.</hi>—Do you wiſh to ſeduce her? I cannot ſuppoſe you would entertain an idea ſo diſhonorable, ſo abhorrent. Louiſa is the picture of virtue and innocence. And her reſpectable aged father, who eſteems, who loves, who receives you as if you were his own ſon, would you betray the confidence he repoſes in you by bearing that from him which of all things on earth is to him the moſt precious? No, Lindorf, you never can be guilty of an act ſo atrocious. Lindorf will liſten to the voice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of reaſon, of true friendſhip, and if he ſhed tears, they ſhall not be the diſtracting tears of guilty remorſe."</p>
                  <p>"The features, the voice, the eyes of the Count aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an expreſſion and energy which are impoſſible for me to convey; and with conviction irreſiſtable aſſailed the heart. A Deity ſeemed ſpeaking! A ſupreme intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, deſcended from heaven to enlighten and ſave! Every word he pronounced was ſo different from what I daily heard from Fritz, and I had been ſo little accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to behold my paſſion under ſo criminal a point of view, that I was abſolutely ſtruck ſpeechleſs, and ſtood before him abaſhed. The Count obſerved me, knew what was paſſing in my mind, and, tenderly taking me by the hand, I ſee," ſaid he, "the reaſons I have urged have made ſome impreſſion on you, and that virtue will ſoon regain her empire. Come, my friend, come with me, and aſk your father's permiſſion to travel awhile. We will depart to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow!" cried I, in all the pangs of returning paſſion, "depart to-morrow! From Louiſa! See her no more! Ignorant whether I am beloved, whether I ever may ſee her again! No, Walſtein, no; hope it not; it is too much; it is at once to plunge a dagger to my heart." Then, leaning my head againſt a tree, and ſhedding tears, I added, "I feel the force of what you have ſaid: it is but too true. Ah! wherefore had I not a friend like you in the beginning of this fatal paſſion? But it is now too late, a devouring fire ſcorches me up, and now I feel, too powerfully feel, there is no alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but Louiſa or death—Yet I will endeavour, in part,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034126_0089_0FFA1AEF534C5E60"/>
to follow your advice; to remain ſome days without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, without going to the farm; but let me have the conſolation of being near her.—Alas! dear Sir, I am a ſick man, to whom nurſing and precaution are neceſſary, and whom a remedy too violent would immediately kill."</p>
                  <p>"The Count owned I was right, and mildly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to calm and conſole me. He remained ſatisfied with the promiſe, which I repeated, of not going for ſome days to the farm, and no doubt hoped, by degrees, to bring me to conſent to a longer abſence.</p>
                  <p>"In the evening I complained of not being well, that I might thus impoſe an obligation upon myſelf of keeping my chamber; for I felt, if I ſhould leave it, my feet would, inſtinctively, conduct me to Louiſa; but a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſickneſs would deprive me of the liberty of going. Yet could it not be ſaid to be feigned; for I, for ſeveral days paſt, had had an inward fever, the uſual conſequence of violent paſſions. I ſlept little, and ate leſs; this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive change alarmed my parents, but I aſſured them a few days reſt and proper care would preſently reſtore me. Walſtein failed not highly to praiſe my fortitude, left me but ſeldom, and, while with me, took every means to increaſe and give force to reaſon, and greatly relieved the torment of paſſion; but the moment he left me it as ſuddenly reſumed its empire, to which Fritz, indeed, was continually aiding, by his inſinuations and diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>"He had perceived, from ſome few words he had heard, and even from what had eſcaped me myſelf, that the Count oppoſed my love for Louiſa; and this fellow was, therefore, only the more induſtrious to keep it alive and enflamed. Nor were any great efforts neceſſary; for no ſooner was I ever alone with him than I began, in ſpite of all my endeavours to be ſilent, to ſpeak of his ſiſter. He aſſured me ſhe ſecretly moaned my abſence and my indiſpoſition, and that, for four days, during which ſhe had not ſeen me, ſhe had done nothing but weep. "Poor girl! 'tis quite piteous to ſee her, my Lord; ſhe loves you to diſtraction; and then ſhe keeps it all to herſelf; no ſoul but I <hi>knows</hi> it, but I <hi>does</hi> all I can to comfort her; I <hi>tells</hi> her ſhe is not the firſt country laſs that has loved a great Lord, and I <hi>ſays,</hi> how happy ſhe would be with you; for, to be ſure, you are ſo good, and ſo generous, that, certainly, you would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake her."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:034126_0090_0FFA585584AAC748"/>"Theſe kind of converſations, continually repeated, too potently contributed to increaſe paſſion and enfeeble fortitude. One day, the fifth or ſixth of my retreat, the Count having left me to go a ſhooting, and Fritz having ſpoken for a whole hour of Louiſa and her love for me, unable any longer to reſiſt, I broke looſe, like a child whoſe guardian had left him to himſelf, and flew to the farm, hoping to be back before the return of the Count.</p>
                  <p>"Joſſelin was gone to the field, and Louiſa left alone in the houſe. Her wheel ſtood by her, yet was ſhe not ſpinning, but, leaning on her elbows, ſhe had covered her eyes with her handkerchief. At firſt ſhe did not perceive me, but, hearing the noiſe the ſhutting-to of the door made, ſhe looked up, and exclaimed, bluſhing, "Good God! my Lord, is it you? I was told you were very ill, and am exceedingly glad to ſee that"—</p>
                  <p>"I did not give her time to finiſh her ſentence; the affection which I imagined theſe few words contained, her bluſhes, and her eyes, red and humid with tears, all confirmed me every thing Fritz had told me concerning her love was true. Enchanted, in ecſtacies, at ſeeing her again, and at ſeeing her thus ſoft and tender, I flung myſelf at her feet, and knew not what I ſaid. No long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er maſter of my reaſon, I expreſſed myſelf with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm and fire, that Louiſa was terrified, but ſhe could neither ſtop me nor break from me; I had ſeized both her hands, which, with great agitation and force, I held, while I devoured them with my kiſſes.</p>
                  <p>"Juſt at this inſtant the door opened, and in came the Count—I know not which of the three ſeemed moſt confounded. The ſurpriſe of being thus caught made me quit Louiſa's hands, who, the moment ſhe was free, fled precipitately; I roſe, but durſt not look up at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein—At length, "Are you here, Lindorf?" ſaid he, "I left you in your chamber, and I find you at the feet of Louiſa?"</p>
                  <p>"Then you did not come to ſeek me?" replied I; with amazement ſtill ſuperior to his own.</p>
                  <p>"I know not what paſſed at this inſtant in my mind; I certainly did not ſuſpect the Count; no, I did not; and yet could I no way account for this his unexpected arrival at the farm. I had, at firſt, ſuppoſed that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been home and not finding me in my chamber, he
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:034126_0091_0FFA5777C05C7FB0"/>
had miſtruſted where I was gone; but the ſurpriſe he diſcovered had wholly eradicated that idea.</p>
                  <p>"No," ſaid he, recovering himſelf, "it was not you I came to ſeek; I wanted to ſpeak to Joſſelin; I will tell you on what ſubject." Then taking me by the arm, he brought me away before I could again ſee Louiſa.</p>
                  <p>"As ſoon as we were out of the houſe, he told me his ſerjeant was recruiting at the neighbouring village, that he had juſt been ſpeaking to him, and finding he had enliſted ſeveral young men, with whom he ſuppoſed Joſſelin to be acquainted, he had come to make enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning them. This appeared plauſible, and half diſſipated the vague kind of inquietude, I had invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary felt.</p>
                  <p>"And now," ſaid the Count, "permit me to aſk you, in your turn, what you were doing there; and what ſaying, to Louiſa, in an attitude of ſuch ſupplication, and a tone ſo vehement? Forgive me, Lindorf, but you have granted me your confidence, and of this confidence I ſhould be moſt unworthy if I did not endeavour to protect you from the worſt of dangers. You promiſed me to remain a week without ſeeing Louiſa; what then could be the intention of this ſecret viſit?"</p>
                  <p>"To convince myſelf that I am beloved, and in that caſe"</p>
                  <p>"Well! what then?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, then,—to ſacrifice every thing to Louiſa; to renounce all for her; family, country, fortune, friends: ſhe to me would be all, with her would I fly to the end of the world, if ſo it were neceſſary. I have offered her the choice of a ſecret marriage or an elopement; and I am determined on the one or the other. I aſk not the Count of Walſtein to aſſiſt me in this enterpriſe, but I depend upon his diſcretion."</p>
                  <p>"And has Louiſa conſented?" ſaid he, with emotion.</p>
                  <p>"She has not anſwered me; you ſuddenly, came in; but ſhe was greatly affected; her tears, her manner, every thing ſpoke her tenderneſs; beſide, I am very certain I am beloved."</p>
                  <p>"It is poſſible you may deceive yourſelf," ſaid the Count. "I think I am more certain that Louiſa loves another."</p>
                  <p>"Loves another!" repeated I with phrenſy—"But, no, it cannot be; Louiſa is all innocence; ſhe never is from home, ſhe ſees only her father, brother, and me."</p>
                  <p>"And one more," replied the Count, a young peaſant,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034126_0092_0FFA585FAAEA5400"/>
called Juſtin, as I believe; nay, I am aſſured he and Louiſa have been lovers theſe three years, and that Joſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelin has refuſed his conſent to the marriage only becauſe Juſtin is poor. If, however, he be beloved"—</p>
                  <p>"Unable any longer to liſten, my blood boiling in my veins, and jealouſy maddening in my eyes, I ſeized the Count by the arm, looked ſteadily at him, with wild diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and demanded from whom he had his informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—My countenance was ſo frantic, to which my voice was ſo correſpondent, that Walſtein was alarmed.</p>
                  <p>"In the name of Heaven! Lindorf," ſaid he, taking me by the hand, "be calm; dear Lindorf, recover your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; I may have been miſinformed or deceived; I will inquire, however, and particularly; that I promiſe; ere long I will let you know from whom I received my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and whether it be or be not exact. But, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Lindorf," added he, in a tone of the deepeſt afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "you rend my very heart; there is nothing I would not do, or ſuffer, to reſtore you to yourſelf and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
                  <p>"Happineſs!" ſaid I, in a low voice; happineſs exiſts not without Louiſa."</p>
                  <p>"The friendſhip, however, of the Count, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and tender manner made me ſomewhat more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. I fancied he had been ill informed; I knew this Juſtin, and never had had the leaſt ſuſpicion of him; he was a poor orphan, whoſe ſole advantage ſeemed to be a good perſon hid under a dreſs ſo mean that it was an atteſtation of his extreme poverty. Educated by charity in the pariſh, he had been made ſhepherd to the village. I had often heard ſpeak of the activity, honeſty, zeal, and even courage with which he did the duties of his place; the flocks all proſpered under his care, and he knew how to cure moſt of their diſeaſes; he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, likewiſe, and had, already, killed ſeveral wolves which came to attack them. The country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vaunted of his talents. He worked prettily in oſier, and carved with his knife, for he had no other tool; his voice was fine, and he played exceedingly well on the flageolet, untaught, except by nature, and perhaps love. I had often, while out a-ſhooting, ſtopped to liſten to him; but never had it entered my imagination that the poor ſhepherd, Juſtin, could be my rival. Louiſa had appeared to me ſo very much above him; though, indeed,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:034126_0093_0FFA57855BC69C68"/>
to me, ſhe had appeared above the whole world. Yet, led now to reflect on theſe circumſtances, I could not help remembering their birth was equal, and a trifling dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of wealth the only diſtinction. Juſtin, too, was a handſome lad, and I well recollected that, in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual viſits at the farm, I had often met Juſtin and his flock in the vicinity; but he was always with them, and never had I ſeen him at the farm; nay, I had often ſpoken of his ſongs and flageolet to Louiſa and her father, but they always had appeared not to pay the leaſt attention.</p>
                  <p>"Thus by turns, tortured and relieved, I knew not what to think; though a rival like Juſtin was too humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating not to make me endeavour to doubt. No ſooner was I alone than I called for Fritz, who, intimate with his ſiſter, and very often at his father's, ought to know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this affair. I interrogated him, very ſeriouſly, concerning Juſtin, his intercourſe with Louiſa, their pretended love for each other, and the ſecrecy with which it had been kept from me.</p>
                  <p>"At firſt, he appeared greatly confuſed; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, denied every thing; ſpoke of poor Juſtin with the utmoſt contempt, aſſured me his ſiſter thought like him, and would be exceedingly offended at ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports; and concluded by aſking me from whom I could hear ſuch a falſehood. I had the imprudence to name the Count!</p>
                  <p>"My Lord, the Count," anſwered Fritz, ſhaking his head, "knows very well what he is about; he takes care not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell you it is he himſelf who loves Louiſa; and that this very morning—but one muſt not tell all one knows."</p>
                  <p>"He pretended to be going to leave the room; but I commanded him to ſtay, and, after preſſing him repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, he told me that, ever ſince the firſt day I had brought the Count to the farm, he had become paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in love with Louiſa; that, while I kept my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not a ſingle day had paſſed on which the Count had not come to the farm, and endeavoured to ſeduce her by the moſt flattering and advantageous offers; nay, that very morning, that he, Fritz, had caught him with her, and that the Count had tried to bribe him to ſecrecy. "Perhaps," added Fritz, "I ſhould have ſaid nothing, becauſe, to be ſure, I don't like to vex my Lord: but ſince I ſee he wiſhes to ſcandalize my ſiſter, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to talk of her loving a beggar, like Juſtin, I can no
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034126_0094_0FFA586826C0BEF0"/>
longer hold my tongue. To be ſure, I would wiſh to conſult my Lord thereupon; for, though I know Louiſa is a very virtuous body, and that ſhe loves my Lord too much to love any body elſe, yet who can anſwer for theſe young girls? My Lord the Count is ſo rich and ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and, beſides, he is his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wn maſter; he has neither father nor mother, and theſe are plaguy great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Then, if he ſhould go about to run off with her, for he loves her ſo deſperately that he would do any thing to get her, would it not be better for us to be beforehand with him? If my Lord pleaſes, we will put her out of his reach in a twinkling; for my part, I have always ſaid, and always ſhall ſay, I would rather my Lord had her than any body elſe."</p>
                  <p>"My agitation while Fritz was ſpeaking was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; I walked, or rather ſtrode, about my chamber, not knowing what to think of the Count; my eſteem for him was ſo rooted, that I could not perſuade myſelf he might be guilty of ſuch perfidy. Were what I heard true, his perſuaſive, his affecting, his powerful eloquence, which ſeemed the effuſion of the pureſt friendſhip, would have been nothing more than deceitful artifice to remove me from Louiſa, and ſnatch from me this object of my adoration. I could not ſupport the horrible idea; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared wholly incompatible with the known character of the Count, and, ſternly looking at Fritz, I commanded him to leave my preſence, and no longer inſult my friend by falſehoods totally undeſerving belief.</p>
                  <p>"I did more, I intended to go to Walſtein, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguiſedly inform him of what I had heard; certain that a ſingle word from him would preſently efface every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining trait of ſuſpicion. I went; but I found my father with him, who did not leave us the whole even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and before whom ſuch a converſation was impoſſible. Theirs turned on the duties of ſociety, morality, and true honor. The Count ſaid many things, on theſe ſubjects, ſo ſtrong, with ſuch natural conviction, expreſſed himſelf with ſuch a noble energy of mind, and ſuch a purity of heart, that I inwardly bluſhed for having a moment doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his virtue, and promiſed myſelf never to doubt more. I reſolved, likewiſe, not to ſpeak to him on the ſubject; for to ſuſpect a man lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> him of ſuch an action, I was convinced, was equally fooliſh and diſgraceful. Beſide, to have mentioned it I muſt, in ſome meaſure,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:034126_0095_0FFA57987B467FE0"/>
have made my footman his accuſer, which was too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading; I was, therefore, determined to be ſilent my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to make Fritz ſilent alſo, whom a falſe zeal for my ſervice might have deceived.</p>
                  <p>"But, while repelling from my memory all his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations againſt the Count, I ſtill was reſolved to profit by his aſſiſtance in carrying off his ſiſter. I admired the principles of Walſtein, without the power of imitating them; or, rather, I wilfully ſhut my eyes on the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the act. I imagined my benefactions would conſole the aged Joſſelin. Madman, that I was! as if gold could conſole a father for the loſs of his child; and a child, too, like Louiſa. But I was incapable of reaſon. Fatal and terrible effect of the paſſions, how much are they to be feared, ſince they can lead a naturally upright and virtuous heart thus dreadfully aſtray!</p>
                  <p>"Walſtein came the next morning to my chamber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was up; he was dreſſed and booted. "Lindorf," ſaid he, "I am going to the village to meet my ſerjeant and examine my recruits. I do not aſk you to go with me, becauſe I intend to call at the farm. I want to ſpeak with Joſſelin. After your ſcene of yeſterday, I ſuppoſe both you and Louiſa would be eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"This viſit to the farm, of which he ſpoke ſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ought rather to have removed than confirmed my fears. He could not know what Fritz had been ſaying to me; therefore, there could be no inſidious myſtery; and yet I was very uneaſy; tormented by ſuſpicions of I know not what; ſuſpicions which, notwithſtanding, I could not wholly ſubdue. I rang my bell, Fritz was not to be found, but one of my father's ſervants came i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his ſtead; he was a native of the village, where he went every day, and I aſked him, with all the indifference I could aſſume, whether the ſerjeant of Walſtein was there, recruiting. He anſwered in the affirmative, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that one of his own brothers was enliſted; as, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was that Juſtin, who the Count had pretended was the favoured lover of Louiſa. "My Lord the Count,"
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034126_0096_0FFA1B99E51D7700"/>
ſaid he, "is ſo good a nobleman, and ſo kind an officer, that all the young men wiſh to ſerve under him."</p>
                  <p>"This ſimple panegvric made me bluſh at my own doubts; tranquil, therefore, reſpecting the Count and this Juſtin, I thought of nothing but carrying off Louiſa, and living and dying for her. This idea was for ever fermenting in my head and my heart; and, at twenty, when devoured by a paſſion ſo unconquerable, youth is not apt at imagining reaſons which ſhould counteract it, nor at foreſeeing difficulties; ſeconded by Fritz, all things appeared poſſible, and I waited for him with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, that we might hold conſultation together.— Fritz, however, came not, and the Count returned.— Wholly occupied by my own projects, and held in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint by his preſence, he obſerved the difference of my manner, and very unaffectedly told me ſo. I ſaw he wiſhed to penetrate my thoughts, and, unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him more than neceſſary, I ſpoke as little as poſſible, yet enough to let him underſtand I perſiſted in the deſign I had mentioned the evening before.</p>
                  <p>"After dinner, he left me, as he ſaid, to go to his apartment and write ſome letters; and, after they were finiſhed, we were to ride out together. Anxious to take advantage of the moment, the only one, perhaps, I ſhould have to myſelf, I would have inſtantly flown to Louiſa to have obtained her ſo much deſired conſent to go off with me; but I might find her father with her, and my going would have been fruitleſs. A letter, therefore, which I could privately convey to her, would remove this inconvenience, and I immediately ſat down to write. The diſorder of my mind was viſible in every line. My propoſitions of flight were renewed; eternal love was avowed; promiſes of compliance to all her wiſhes repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſworn to with all the exaggerations of paſſion. I requeſted an anſwer, and referred her to her brother for our mutual arrangement.</p>
                  <p>"I had folded up my letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was got to the door, when Fritz, whom I had not ſeen all day, entered my chamber, haſtily. You, yeſterday, Sir," ſaid he, "treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me as an impoſtor. Where do you ſuppoſe my Lord the Count this moment is?"</p>
                  <p>"My blood inſtantly ran cold—"In his own chamber," anſwered I. "Why that queſtion?"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:034126_0097_0FFA5792088DAAB0"/>"Not in his own chamber, but in my ſiſter's, where I juſt have ſeen him with my own eyes."</p>
                  <p>"Take care what you ſay—Walſtein!—Impoſſible!"</p>
                  <p>"You may convince yourſelf, Sir; only go, and you will find him, either there or in the garden, waiting for Louiſa, for ſhe was not at home, nor my father either. The Count ſent a boy to ſeek Louiſa, inſtantly; I heard him, he did not ſee me, and came, immediately, to tell you Sir, that you may be convinced I am no lyar."</p>
                  <p>"As Fritz proceeded, my rage increaſed, till it was ſoon ungovernable. To be impoſed upon with ſo much perfidy and baſeneſs!—And by whom? By the man I venerated, the man in the world I moſt reſpected, and the friend to whom I had confided the ſecrets of my ſoul!—I ſent Fritz away, and, almoſt mechanically, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my piſtols, loaded them with ball without perceiving they were loaded before, and, putting them in my pocket, went out with a fury that approached madneſs, and was preſently within ſight of the farm.</p>
                  <p>"It was neceſſary to paſs by the far end of the garden, where, the hedge being low, I ſaw the Count, impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walking, and inceſſantly looking towards the garden door, which was oppoſite to where I ſtopped. Before I had time to determine how it was proper for me to act, the garden door opened, and Louiſa, the timid, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Louiſa, from whom I never could obtain the ſmalleſt favour, ran, with open arms to the Count. who opened his to receive her, kiſſed his hands, preſſed them between hers, and on him fixed her fine eyes, ſparkling with love and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>"I ſcarcely know how I recovered, for I felt as if I had received the ſtroke of death. A cold, a mortal cold, froze up my blood; my ſtrength abandoned me, and I was obliged to ſupport myſelf by leaning againſt a tree. Rage preſently again brought me to life; again my eyes were caſt towards the fatal garden; the lovers, for I no longer doubted they were ſo, were expreſſing themſelves with all the warmth of ſenſibility; the countenance of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein ſhone, as it were, with bliſs, and never had I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it ſo illumined. I could not hear their diſcourſe, but, by their geſtures, it ſeemed as if he ardently entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething which Louiſa feebly refuſed. At laſt, the Count took out a purſe, which appeared full of gold,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034126_0098_0FFA587CD2ECF0B0"/>
preſented it, which, after another moment's heſitation, Louiſa received with a half confuſed half tender air.</p>
                  <p>"The Count kiſſed her, and both together re-entered the houſe, juſt at the very moment I was going to leap the hedge, and perhaps immolate two victims to revenge. I was no longer maſter of my actions, and ſhould certainly have taken away my own life, if I had not immediately ſeen the Count leave the farm, with all the tranquillity of innocence and virtue, which I interpreted into the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of ſucceſsful love.</p>
                  <p>"Defend thyſelf," ſaid I, "traitor," running up to him with my piſtols; preſenting him the handle of one and the muzzle of the other to his heart; "Deprive me of the life which thou haſt rendered miſerable, or let me rid the world of a perfidious monſter!"</p>
                  <p>"He would have laid hold of my arm, and have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to me. "I will hear nothing," ſaid I, "defend yourſelf! I am capable of any miſchief!"</p>
                  <p>"So ſaying, I clapped the mouth of my piſtol to my own forehead. Happy, moſt happy, had I been had I drawn the trigger! But the Count prevented me, and, taking the piſtol—"You are determined," ſaid he; then, drawing back a few paces, fired it in the air. Mine was diſcharged at the ſame moment; but mine (for ever curſed be that moment!) took a fatal, an abhorred direction. I ſaw my friend ſtagger, and fall, bathed in his own blood, and ſaying, "Alas! poor Lindorf! when you ſhall know—Ah! how much more will you be to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied than I!"</p>
                  <p>"All my rage inſtantly vaniſhed. I caſt the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous piſtol from me; and, running up to my friend, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, with my handkerchief, to ſtop the blood that bubbled from the wound. One ball had ſtruck him on the face, and, he ſaid, he thought he felt a wound in the knee, but was convinced that neither of them was mortal. I dragged him to the tree, and placed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, where I gave him all the ſuccour in my power; for I was ſo totally beſide myſelf that I had even forgot the farm, which was not forty paces diſtant. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered not ſo much as the cauſe of this miſerable affair; at that moment of horror the danger of Walſtein was all I remembered: I kneeled behind him; he leaned againſt my breaſt, and, notwithſtanding the univerſal tremor of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034126_0099_0FFA917D2DE918F8"/>
my limbs, I bound up his wound with our two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs.</p>

My groans could not find ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance. I hid my face in the duſt, and added nothing but inarticulate cries and exclamations.</p>
                  <p>"Lindorf," ſaid the poor wounded Walſtein, "Dear Lindorf, be calm, liſten to me. There is one way, ſtill, of repairing your wrongs, of preſerving, nay, even of augmenting my friendſhip. Yes, dearer to me ſhall you be than ever, if you will pledge your honour to perform what I am going to requeſt."</p>
                  <p>"I had no doubt but it was to renounce Louiſa; but the atrocious crime I had committed had wrought ſo inſtant a revolution in my feelings that I did not heſitate a moment to promiſe, by the moſt ſacred oaths, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all he ſhould require.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," ſaid the moſt generous of men, "I require, abſolutely, without reſerve, that this affair, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remain a ſecret between you and me; happily, no one has ſeen us; let me tell the ſtory my own way; and beware, Lindorf, how thou contradicteſt me. Thou haſt ſworn, and I repeat, on this condition, only, can I pardon and love thee ſtill. A ſole word will for ever deprive thee of my friendſhip."</p>
                  <p>"I would have ſpoken, but ſobs and groans prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. I could only take his hand and preſs it to my heart, which was rent by the moſt cruel remorſe. In deſpite of all my cares the wound continued to bleed; Walſtein, with my aid, endeavoured to riſe, but he ſoon perceived the wound in his knee was much worſe than he had ſuppoſed. One of the balls had taken a different direction, and, we feared, the knee-pan was wounded, for he could not bear the leaſt weight on it, but again ſunk down on the ground.</p>
                  <p>"I deteſted, I curſed, I prayed, I almoſt ſhrieked with agony, I proſtrated myſelf at the feet of my friend, while he continued to yield me every conſolation.</p>
                  <p>"At laſt ſaid he, "Go to the farm, and endeavour to get aſſiſtance; you will there find a proof that I was not, as you have ſuppoſed, the baſeſt of men. Go, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your oath; if you break it, I never will ſee you more."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:034126_0100_0FFA913565EEA9B0"/>"I could not reply, but ran to the farm, and, as I precipitately entered, immediately beheld in explanation of the conduct of Walſtein, and irrefragable reaſons for holding my own in ſtill more utter, more damnable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence! O! pardon—Mine was the guilt of fiends! The ſhepherd, Juſtin, new clothed, was ſeated beſide Louiſa, holding one of her hands between his, while ſhe was leaning on his ſhoulder, and looking up at him with every ſpeaking ſenſation that tenderneſs and happineſs could inſpire. The old man, Joſſelin, ſat oppoſite to them, contemplating a ſcene ſo affecting to the heart, and holding the purſe the Count had given Louiſa, and which I had ſuppoſed the price of her diſhonour, On the table was another, equally large. Every circumſtance was a dagger to my heart, and, inſenſate as I had been, devoured by paſſion, I can ſolemnly atteſt that remorſe, bitter, inexpreſſible, and almoſt intolerable, was the only feeling of which I was conſcious, or capable.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! my friends," ſaid I, as I entered; "come with me, fly to ſuccour the Count; he is here, juſt by, wounded, come, inſtantly." My ſudden appearance, my paleneſs, the blood on my clothes, and the intelligence I brought, were each a ſubject of terror.—"Good God!" exclaimed Louiſa and Juſtin, "our dear benefactor wounded!"</p>
                  <p>"I led them to the place where I had left the Count. Pain, and the loſs of blood, had ſo enfeebled him that he was almoſt inſenſible. Louiſa ran for water, and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. He came a little to himſelf, and, with difficulty, related that a piſtol, with which he had been amuſing himſelf, having burſt as he fired it, had occaſioned all this diſaſter, and that my coming by was the effect of chance.</p>
                  <p>"It was neceſſary to bear him to the Chateau, and Juſtin ſlew to the farm, and brought back a kind of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and a mattreſs, on which he was laid. Juſtin, in the prime of youth, and animated by gratitude, not, like me, weighed down by guilt, was moſt uſeful and active. Louiſa and her aged father gave us all the aſſiſtance in their power, and we began our march. It was long, and moſt painful; and, as we proceeded, ſeveral things that Juſtin and Louiſa ſaid to each other gave me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand they had long been lovers, and that the Count, that
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034126_0101_0FFA9180E20F7F68"/>
very day, had removed every obſtacle to their union, by giving Juſtin a conſiderable farm, at his eſtate of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the ſole condition that they ſhould marry, immediately depart, and that Joſſelin ſhould go with them.</p>
                  <p>"Criminal, indeed, moſt criminal, did this relation make me; but my paſſion for Louiſa was ſo perfectly cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this dreadful event, that I heard, even with a kind of horrid pleaſure, ſhe was to be gone, and that I ſhould ſee her no more!</p>
                  <p>"We arrived, at length, at the Chateau; and the hurdle being placed in the hall, and ſervants called to aſſiſt, my firſt care was to take a horſe, and ride, with all poſſible ſpeed, to the next town in ſearch of ſurgeons. It was more than three leagues diſtant. I made, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſo much haſte that I returned with them by duſk. I found every perſon in the moſt fearful conſternation. The manner in which my father received me, tenderly embracing me, melting in tears, and praiſing my zeal, proved that he was totally ignorant of the part I had had in this dreadful affair. His deſpair was ſuch that, had he known it, he certainly could not have ſurvived ſuch tenfold addition of miſery. The recollection of this, more than my oath, kept me ſilent; but I may truly ſay the ſilence was a burthen to my heart, and that nothing could ſo effectually have given it eaſe as to have proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my guilt, and thus have rendered me as deteſtable to the whole world as I was to myſelf.</p>
                  <p>"The ſurgeon, after the operation of extracting the balls, and probing the wounds of Walſtein, declared they were not mortal, but that, it was to be feared, he would loſe one eye, and the uſe of his leg; and they even ſpoke of amputation. The Count, who ſomewhat doubted of their ſkill, reſolutely oppoſed this, and ſuſtained, with fortitude, almoſt incredible, the dreſſing of the wounds, and the afflicting intelligence they had communicated. I could not ſupport being preſent; but, when the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons had done, I again entered his chamber, and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwore never to quit it but in company with Walſtein. I know not how it happened that my exceſſive grief did not betray our ſecret. It was, indeed, moſt profound. My tears flowed continually; while the ſuffering victim of my hateful crime unceaſingly endeavoured to calm and comfort me. He ſaid, and proteſted, that he looked on the event as fortunate; that his inclination and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034126_0102_0FFA9138130D1340"/>
had always rather led him to ſtudy than to a military life; that he had devoted himſelf to the latter, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his father and his king; and that he ſhould be exceedingly glad of ſo fair a pretext to forſake it, and yield to his love of literature and political and legiſlative reſearches. "Beſide," added he, "you are now cured of your paſſion; the remedy, it is true, has been ſomewhat violent, but it has had its effect, and I moſt unfeignedly return Heaven thanks for all that has paſſed."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it had had its effects; but I ſhould ill deſerve the ſublime friendſhip of Walſtein if I did not lament and execrate them everlaſtingly. I was cured of my love; for, three weeks after this misfortune had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I heard, without the leaſt emotion, unleſs it were an emotion of joy from the mouth of Juſtin, who came every day to enquire concerning the health of his benefactor, that he had married Louiſa, and that they were ready to depart for their new habitation.</p>
                  <p>"The Count now entered circumſtantially on that ſubject; delicacy had, hitherto, kept him ſilent; but, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by me, he informed me that the morrow after the viſit we had together paid at the farm, alarmed by the violence of my paſſion, he moſt ſeriouſly reflected on the means of avoiding effects ſo fatal; that his ſerjeant brought him a young man whom he had juſt enliſted; this was the poor Juſtin; his handſome perſon, intelligent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and profound melancholy, gained the attention of the Count, and he queſtioned him concerning what induced him to enliſt. The ſincere and ſimple Juſtin did not endeavour to diſguiſe his motives. Paſſionately enamoured of Louiſa, her lover for ſeveral years, but without the leaſt ray of hope, rejected by Joſſelin, mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Fritz, he wiſhed only to die; but he wiſhed to die like a brave fellow, combating the enemies of his King, I ſhould die all the ſame," ſaid he, "with grief at ſeeing Louiſa the wife of another; and this misfortune muſt be mine, for her father has ſworn I ſhall never be her huſband."</p>
                  <p>"The Count aſked him if he were beloved by Louiſa. "To be ſure, I certainly am," anſwered he; "if I were not, I might not, perhaps, have been true to her for ſo long a time. But, poor dear Louiſa! I yeſterday ſaw her never to ſee her again, and we both wept ſo much at parting that we thought we ſhould have died with grief."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="unknown:034126_0103_0FFA91838BD76710"/>"I recollect, dear Lindorf," ſaid the Count, "that when you firſt took me to ſee Louiſa her melancholy ſtruck us both."</p>
                  <p>"But, I hope," continued Juſtin, "that, when I am gone, Louiſa will be leſs unhappy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her father, and her brother in particular, ill treat her every day on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; and that is the reaſon why I am determined to become a ſoldier. I wiſh, indeed indeed I do, ſhe may forget me; but her I ſhall never forget; no never never to my dying day."</p>
                  <p>"Walſtein was extremely affected by the ſincerity; honeſt intentions, and paſſion of Juſtin; and inſtantly conceived the project of rendering two lovers happy, and reſcuing me from the worſt of dangers. He mentioned nothing of his intentions to Juſtin, being firſt deſirous to ſpeak to Louiſa and know if he had told him the exact truth. He went twice to the farm before he could find her alone, but watched his opportunity ſo well that at laſt he ſpoke to her in private. He had little difficulty in bringing her to confeſs her love for Juſtin; her heart was full of nothing elſe; and ſhe had done nothing but weep ſince he had enliſted. She was deſirous of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him to the Count; and, therefore, glad of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone, ſhe told him their love had commenced long before the death of her mother; that ever ſince ſhe bad each day gone to meet him at the paſturage, and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin had taught himſelf to play on the flageolet, purpoſely that he might not only give her the ſignal to come and join him, but accompany her likewiſe when ſhe ſung. To gain her favour, alſo, he had learned to make baſket-work, ſpinning-wheels, bobbins, to twine the oſier, and to carve in wood. Louiſa ſhewed the Count two little groups of his ſculpture exceedingly well carved, the one repreſenting Louiſa and the other Juſtin himſelf ſeated at her feet; both the figures were ſufficiently like to be known. In another carving, ſtill better executed, the young ſhepherd was combating a large wolf; for it was for the ſake of Louiſa, alſo, that he had firſt given proofs of his courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by killing the wolf which was bearing off one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"How might the tender and grateful Louiſa refuſe yielding her heart to him who ſo well had merited the gift! "Yes, my Lord, ſaid ſhe to the Count, with all the enthuſiaſm of legibility, "I love him with my whole

ſoul, and ſhall for ever love him, though I never ſhould ſee him more.—One hope, alas, we had, one ſole hope. I often ſaid to Juſtin, when he bewailed his poverty, "Be comforted, dear Juſtin, only wait till our young maſter returns, he will ſpeak for us to his father, and, I am well perſuaded, will have us married. Our young maſter is returned, but"—</p>
                  <p>"Louiſa ſtopped—"Finiſh what you had to ſay," ſaid the Count.—"I very well perceive," ſaid ſhe, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looking down, "I was wrong; and I ſhould even be very ſorry, at preſent, if he knew I loved Juſtin: for my brother has aſſured me he would kill him, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. When Juſtin is out of his reach, I then will tell him, the firſt time I ſee him; and if he wiſhes to kill one of us, let it be me."</p>
                  <p>"Walſtein comforted Louiſa, promiſed her ſhe ſhould ſoon be happy, that Juſtin belonged to him, at preſent; he might diſpoſe of him, and he would make him the huſband of Louiſa. Scarcely could ſhe believe what ſhe heard, and the very hope appeared but like a dream. Walſtein, however, aſſured her it ſhould be realized im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, for that he had ſpoken to Juſtin, and that he would directly ſpeak to Joſſelin.</p>
                  <p>"It was that very day, dear Lindorf," continued the Count, "when, after having arranged every thing with the young ſhepherd, after having enjoyed the pureſt of pleaſures, and ſpoken to Joſſelin concerning the marriage of his children, that I found you kneeling to Louiſa. The poor girl, conſcious of what I had been doing, and who was waiting for me with all the impatience of love, was exceedingly aſhamed of being ſurpriſed with you in that manner. I confeſs, I alſo was diſconcerted, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that I ſcarcely could conceal my feelings; which, perhaps, firſt gave riſe to your ſuſpicions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I myſelf was not free from them; I was fearful leſt Louiſa had decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both Juſtin and me; leſt you and ſhe underſtood each other; and, anxious to know the truth, queſtioned you. Your anſwer was but half ſatisfactory; it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, convinced me of the great danger you were in, and that, at all events, it was neceſſary to tear from you the object of that paſſion to which you were ready to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice every moral duty. You may remember, Lindorf, I in part informed you of the love of Juſtin for Louiſa; imagining that, perhaps, your paſſion would decreaſe if
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034126_0105_0FFA91864FFCA2D8"/>
you knew the love of Louiſa was divided. Had you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this intelligence with more moderation, I then ſhould have told you all; but your phrenſy was too viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Reaſon had loſt every hold over your mind, and your actions had ſomewhat convulſive about them that made me ſhudder. I ſaw this was not the proper oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to proceed further. I had ſaid too much, and all I had to do was to ſmother the fire I had kindled.</p>
                  <p>"I, therefore, endeavoured to calm your mind, bring you to yourſelf, and promiſed to make farther enquiries; hoping, thereby to gain time for Louiſa and Juſtin to depart, and thus prevent your raſh project of marriage or elopement. In order to haſten the wedding, I went the next morning to Joſſelin; after having told you where I was going, purpoſely that you might not come and interrupt our converſation. I was alone with Louiſa but a moment, but this was enough to convince me of the wrong I had done her, by ſuſpecting any concerted treachery between her and you. The idea had torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her all night, and her inquietude, grief, and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwers removed every remaining doubt.</p>
                  <p>"She left the room as her father entered. I ſpoke firſt of my recruits; and taking out the liſt, read over their names. When I came to that of Juſtin, I ſaw the old man was highly pleaſed.—"Ah!" ſaid he, "is that knave enliſted? Heaven be praiſed! we ſhall now be rid of him."</p>
                  <p>"Knave! what knave, Joſſelin?" ſaid I. "I will have no knaves in my regiment; and I will give him his diſcharge."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! do not do ſo, by any means, my Lord," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Joſſelin. "To be ſure, I ought to ſpeak with more reſpect before you, and not have called him a knave, for there is not an honeſter lad in the whole village, nor is the King himſelf a braver fellow. He will make nothing of killing you a wolf, you may ſuppoſe then what he would do with a man; and you cannot have a better ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; but to tell you the truth," added he, lowering his voice, "he has taken it into his head to fall in love with our Louiſa, and the poor little fool, with conſent or without conſent, would fain marry him; a fellow without a ſhilling, educated by charity; but no, I would rather follow her to the grave. God be praiſed! he muſt now ſoon leave the country, and I hope we ſhall never hear
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:034126_0106_0FFA913BB4A3D098"/>
of him more. And yet, it is a pity too; for he took great care of all our flocks; he ſaved me a fine ſheep; and the lad wants neither courage nor ingenuity—if it was not for that deviliſh love."</p>
                  <p>"And do you not wiſh to marry Louiſa, to conſole her for the abſence of Juſtin?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! would to Heaven ſhe was married! Girls are nothing but torment. I no ſooner find myſelf relieved, on one hand, than I am attacked on the other. Our young Baron is always haunting, now, about the houſe: ſo long as ſhe had her Juſtin ſhe was well guarded. I did not ſtand on ceremony with him; but, at preſent, I do not know what may happen; for I cannot forbid my young maſter my houſe as I did Juſtin; and, then, one cannot always be at home. I ſhould be happy if I could but ſee her once well ſettled, but there is not the leaſt appearance of it. The people of our village are all poor, and Louiſa is not rich."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Joſſelin, if you conſent, I myſelf will mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her to one of my farmers; an honeſt young man and above want. He poſſeſſes a good graſs farm, on my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate at Walſtein; ſome days journey from this place; larger, I believe, than this of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ours; and, as I eſteem him very much, I will give him a purſe of fifty ducats, on the wedding day, and as much to your daughter, to defray the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tence of the nuptials, and begin houſekeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you think this a proper match, ſay ſo, and it is a bargain."</p>
                  <p>"Joſſelin, all amazement, would have fallen proſtrate. "A proper match! my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid he: "I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear weeping with joy and gratitude. All my fear is leſt he ſhould not fancy Louiſa; and if he ſhould hear of her love for Juſtin"—</p>
                  <p>"Fear nothing, he will not be jealous. Juſtin is his friend, and the more Louiſa ſhall love her huſband the happier will Juſtin be."</p>
                  <p>"The good old Joſſelin opened his eyes, ſtaring, as it were, after the meaning of what I had ſaid. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, therefore, was neceſſary; and this threw him into ſtill greater aſtoniſhment. But he the more joyfully confirmed his conſent, becauſe his daughter, by this means, would be happy.</p>
                  <p>"The only thing I ſtipulated for was that they ſhould immediately depart for my farm; and to this there was
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034126_0107_0FFA9187F1BAC238"/>
no objection. Joſſelin propoſed even to remove himſelf, and live with his children. I deſired him to inform Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa of what had paſſed, and left him to go down to the village. I there gave Juſtin his diſcharge, ſigned the gift of the farm, and left him the purſe of fifty ducats which I had promiſed. After this I returned to you. Your air and manner, ſometimes abſent, ſometimes agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, ſentences half pronounced, and the diſappearance of Fritz, who had been away from the caſtle all night and all day; theſe, collectively, made me fear you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed ſome project; the execution of which might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be more prompt than I ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>"I reſolved, therefore, to haſten the marriage, and the departure of the young people, as much as poſſible; and, for this purpoſe, I again returned to the farm. This was the only injunction I had to lay on them, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits already conferred, and the purſe I intended to preſent to Louiſa.</p>
                  <p>"What followed, dear Lindorf, I need not relate. You know how much you were deceived by appearances. Louiſa had been, all the day, at the village with a relation, in order, moſt likely, to avoid another viſit from you. Her father, impatient to inform her of her happineſs, had gone in ſearch of her. They had met the happy Juſtin, who came along with them; he had ſhewn them all his treaſure. A boy, whom I had ſent in ſearch of Louiſa, told her I was waiting for her; ſhe, unable to repreſs the firſt emotions of her joy, ran, out of breath, to teſtify her gratitude in the manner by which you were ſo cruelly deceived.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Lindorf, I can imagine myſelf in your place, during this terrible moment; can ſuppoſe all the dreadful ideas and ſenſations by which you were aſſaulted. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you cannot doubt, then, that I can forgive you. A little more openneſs on my part, a little leſs paſſion on yours, and this misfortune had never happened; and, let me add, it will be no real misfortune to me ſo long as you ſhall remain unſuſpected of being in any manner an acceſſary."</p>
                  <p>"This recital was made at various times, as his ſtrength permitted, and continually excited in my boſom the moſt painful remorſe. I liſtened, and, in my turn, informed the Count how entirely that vile fellow Fritz had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me. I never ſaw him ſince the fatal day on
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:034126_0108_0FFA914089DDB220"/>
which he diſappeared from the chateau, and I learned from his father he had liſted for a ſoldier: ſince when I have never heard of him more.</p>
                  <p>"The day after theſe fearful events, my father thought it his duty to go himſelf to Berlin and inform the King; and, leaving Walſtein to my care, he undertook this melancholy journey. The King was moſt ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he was told, and immediately ſent his own ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to Ronebourg, informing my father he would come himſelf as ſoon as Walſtein ſhould be out of danger.— The ſurgeons of Berlin confirmed all the others had ſaid; except that they hoped the wound of the knee would be leſs prejudicial than had been ſuppoſed, and that the Count might preſerve his leg, though he certainly would become ſomewhat lame.</p>
                  <p>"I had a bed brought into his chamber, never leaving him a moment day or night, and inceſſantly endeavouring, by attention and care, to prove how deeply I repented; Walſtein ſeemed as ſenſible of, and as grateful for, theſe by attentions, as if I had not been the perſon who occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned him to ſtand in need of them. To amuſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his mind I read to him, as ſoon as the ſurgeons would permit me. Till then, my youth, vivacity, want of thought, and the fatal paſſion I had conceived for Louiſa, had prevented my application to ſtudy. I now learned the charms of this occupation, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates knowledge, amends the heart, and ornaments the mind. I could eaſily perceive that, in his choice of books, his purpoſe was rather my inſtruction, and a wiſh to give n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a taſte for reading, than his own amuſement. When I had ended, he made the moſt juſt and profound reflections on what had been read; which, to me, were ſo many rays of light. Whenever the ſubject happened to be the duties of a ſold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, he deſcribed them with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy, proved how they were compatible with morality and true honour, and how far courage might be allied to humanity and ſenſibility.</p>
                  <p>"Excellent Walſtein! If, at preſent, I have any vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to thee am I indebted for them. Thou haſt made me ſuch as I am, and the two months I lived in thy chamber, after a crime for which any other man would have held me in everlaſting abhorrence, and have been appeaſed only by my blood, by thy benolence and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:034126_0109_0FFA918AA546D8C0"/>
I gained more knowledge, and was better taught the duties of man, than by all my preceding education."</p>
                  <p>We have forborne to interrupt a narrative ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any remarks on what the feelings of Caroline were; and our reaſon for this forbearance was, that every reader might judge from his own heart, and imagine the paſſages at which the manuſcript was laid down or taken up; or where it dropt from the hands of the wife of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein; thoſe at which her heart palpitated more or leſs, or where ſome ſtrong exclamation was involuntarily ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. It is very certain, however, that ſhe did not read thus far without interruption; and, moreover, that, at this particular place, an emotion, prompt and inſtinctive, made her ſnatch up the box. She only half opened it, and ſhut it again, with a kind of reſpectful fear, as if it had been profaned by her looks: after which, laying it cloſe to her elbow, ſhe again took up the manuſcript.</p>
                  <p>"A month after the accident, the King, learning that his favourite could riſe, came to Ronebourg, with few attendants. Walſtein, then, preſented me, for the firſt time; and the King gave me aſſurances of his good will and future protection. Alas! what was my confuſion, what my ſhame, when I heard him praiſing me for the proofs of friendſhip I had given, on this melancholy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and the uninterrupted attention I had paid the Count! Had it not been for my father's preſence and the recollection of the pangs he muſt have ſuffered, I really believe, I ſhould have fallen at his feet, have confeſſed how little I deſerved his eulogiums, and have owned the whole enormity of my guilt.</p>
                  <p>"The King, after remaining a few moments in the chamber, deſired to be left alone with the Count. They were together for ſome time. At laſt my father was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; and, preſently afterwards, I alſo. As I entered, I found my father kneeling to the King, and kiſſing his hand. "Come hither my ſon," ſaid he; "come and kneel with me, to thank the beſt of Monarchs, and the moſt generous of friends.—The Count has reſigned his commiſſion in the guards, and, at his entreaty, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has graciouſly beſtowed it on you. Lindorf! my ſon! if it be poſſible, merit this diſtinction, by equalling your predeceſſor!"</p>
                  <p>"To Walſtein I would have kneeled, in his boſom would have hid my confuſion, if I might; and ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:034126_0110_0FFA9143327E7F98"/>
was I affected, that my father, thinking me half diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with my joy, was obliged to recall my attention to the King, who raiſed me with affability, and, like my father, exhorted me to imitate the Count.</p>
                  <p>"Imitate him!" ſaid I, approaching him and ſeizing his hand, which he held out to me. "Is it poſſible for man to acquire virtue ſo ſublime? Can I, wretch!"—</p>
                  <p>"Walſtein looked at me, and immediately put his hand on my mouth.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Caroline! ſuch is the man to whom you are united; ſuch is he to whom, no doubt, you are proud, at preſent, to appertain, and whom you are now wiſhing to make happy—And, oh, how exquiſite muſt be his felicity! So exquiſite, that he alone, I confeſs, can be worthy of it!</p>
                  <p>"The King departed, the ſame day, for Berlin, and ſoon after ſent me my Captain's commiſſion. At length, I found myſelf alone with Walſtein. My heart was full, almoſt to ſuffocation, and I wiſhed to expreſs ſome part of what I felt. But no! Expreſſions could not be found! Words were too feeble! and I could only teſtify my gratitude as to a Deity!</p>
                  <p>His friendſhip for me ſeemed to increaſe every day. "Good young man,"
would he often ſay, when he ſaw me ſtand with my eyes fixed on his wounds, "do not ſuppoſe theſe a misfortune. Believe me, for it is a truth, we both are gainers; and I, eſpecially: a friend, ſuch as thou wilt be, merits well to be purchaſed with the loſs of an eye. Had I a miſtreſs," added he, ſmiling, "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould be leſs a philoſopher; yet, ſuch as I ſhall be, I do not deſpair of finding a woman rational enough to love me. Love has been the cauſe of my misfortune, and love ought to make me reparation."</p>
                  <p>"Behold, how juſt Heaven is, Caroline! Love will make him reparation, and I alone, as I ought, ſhall be unhappy.—Yet, no! I ought not, I ſhall not be, while I am a witneſs of the felicity of two perſons ſo dear to my heart! Oh! that I may but accompliſh the ardent wiſh I have that theſe two perſons, ſo worthy, ſhould be fully known to each other!</p>
                  <p>"As ſoon as he was ſufficiently recovered to travel to Berlin, I joined my regiment, which lay there, and which I found moſt excellently diſciplined. Walſtein, yielding to his inclinations, retired to continual and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034126_0111_0FFA918E576E36F8"/>
ſtudy; which, added to want of exerciſe, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to his health. He became meagre, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant application to reading and writing gave him that ſtoop in the ſhoulders which you, no doubt, have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but he had no longer pretenſion to beauty, and he was become paſſionately fond of ſtudy. The laws and policy of nations, which require knowledge ſo extenſive, were the reſearches to which he was moſt addicted. In two or three years he was capable of undertaking the moſt difficult negociations, and of filling, with the greateſt dignity and ſucceſs, the brilliant employment he now holds.</p>
                  <p>"When we arrived at Berlin, he introduced me to his aunt, the Baroneſs de Zaſtrow, with whom the young Counteſs Matilda, his ſiſter, had been brought up.— Long a widow, and without children, the Baroneſs look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her niece as her daughter, and ſole heireſs. The Count, alſo, was fond of his young ſiſter, and was as careful of her education and future happineſs as the moſt tender father could have been. He had often ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>en of her to me, at Ronebourg, and made it no ſecret that he ſhould behold with pleaſure a probability of our union, and thus add another tie to friendſhip. I thought her charming, but ſhe was ſcarcely thirteen. She was ſtill but a lively girl with whom I could play with pleaſure, but who did not inſpire the ſame ſenſations I had felt from the company of Louiſa.</p>
                  <p>"My heart, however, being perfectly free, and the company I found at the Baroneſs de Zaſtrow's exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable, I went there, regularly, every day; where I was received as the intimate friend of Walſtein. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, particularly, took a thouſand opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me little favours. She called me her brother, and told me, laughing, ſhe hardly ever ſaw her own, ſince he was become ſo ordinary and ſo learned; therefore, ſhe thought it was my duty to come in his ſtead. I, in the ſame kind of ſport, called her my dear little ſiſter, and behaved as if ſhe really had been ſo. Although ſhe was very handſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and daily became more formed, I felt no other ſentiments for her than thoſe of friendſhip, or brotherly affection. The kind of beauty ſhe poſſeſſed, however ſeductive it might be to others, was not, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely, that which I ſhould prefer. It was neither the regular and ſtriking features of Louiſa, nor the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

countenance, the look celeſtial, which penetrates the hidden ſentiments of the ſoul, the lip of innocence, the angelic voice, the—</p>
                  <p>"Another word, Caroline, and you muſt never behold this manuſcript! Let me ſpeak only of the Count, him only ſee, think only of him; let my mind be wholly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by that ſublime idea, and forget every other.</p>
                  <p>"Where was I?—Speaking, I believe, of the young Counteſs Matilda. You, I ſuppoſe, have never ſeen her. She was at Dreſden when you were at Berlin, where ſhe remains, with Madam de Zaſtrow, who has there fixed her reſidence. She no way reſembles what her brother was before his misfortune. Inſtead of his benevolent and dignified preſence, Matilda's features are delicate and ſmall; the character of her countenance is that of mirth and vivacity. The ſymmetry of her perſon is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act; her arm is round; her feet exceedingly pretty; her wait ſmall; her noſe turned up; her eyes blue, and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent; her roſe-coloured lips are always ready to laugh, and add dimples to her cheeks; and her whole form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the idea of what we call ſports and ſmiles; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing of tender ſentiment. She ſeems even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ſuch ſenſations; ſo that one may play with her without the leaſt danger either to her or one's ſelf.</p>
                  <p>"Yet, however, did ſhe, ſenſibly, begin to loſe a part of the thoughtleſs gaiety by which ſhe ſeemed to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized. She ſtill laughed, but the laugh often ſeemed forced, and was ſometimes followed by a ſigh. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhe ceaſed to call me her brother, or let me aſſume the privilege of one. If I offered to kiſs her, ſhe would draw back and bluſh; and, when I called her my dear little ſiſter, ſhe very gravely would reply with a—<hi>Sir;</hi> which, at times, ſhe had ſome difficulty to pronounce. The Count perceived the change ſooner than I did.— "Either I am much deceived," ſaid he, "or the heart of our young ſiſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"I was too ſincere to endeavour to conceal that I had hitherto felt nothing farther than friendſhip; "But certainly," ſaid I to the Count, "my heart, already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, is no longer capable of love, and ſince the charming Matilda fails to inſpire paſſion, I ſhall never
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034126_0113_0FFA9191044717C0"/>
feel it more." Ah, Caroline, how much was I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived!</p>
                  <p>"You are miſtaken," replied he, "Lindorf; at three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and twenty the heart is never ſatiated with love: nor have you ever known love; for your paſſion for Louiſa was rather an efferveſcence of the ſenſes than love itſelf; its exceſs was a proof of my aſſertion, and I deſire no better than your meditated elopement. When a lover, Lindorf, prefers his own enjoyment to the intereſt of the object beloved, you may be certain his heart is but feebly affected. My utmoſt wiſh is, that my ſiſter may make you feel the difference between your paſſion for Louiſa and the delicious ſentiments of refined love. She is ſtill ſufficiently young to give me hope that this may happen; and, perhaps, it is her great youth that retards the deſired event. You think her only a girl; but when this girl ſhall diſcover ſenſibility, there will be but another ſtep to inſpire you with ſimilar ſenſations."</p>
                  <p>"I embraced the Count, and aſſured him I had already love enough for Matilda, to think with pleaſure on the time when I ſhould love her more, and when I might add the name of brother to that of friend; but that I had ſtill many errors to repair and to efface, and that his charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſiſter merited a heart wholly hers, and capable of feeling her worth.</p>
                  <p>"A ſhort time after this converſation happened, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Since the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my crime (for what other name can I give it?) I never could behold the Count without a renewal of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and remorſe. That countenance, ſo beautiful, that walk and figure, ſo noble, that look, which expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much, all inceſſantly haunted me. The Count ſeemed to recollect nothing of this, nor to entertain the leaſt regret. Before we parted, I entreated him to give me his picture, ſuch as it was when he came to Rone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. I knew he had one, and I wiſhed he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath it to me; that my own fault and his generoſity might continually be recalled, and that I might be certain time ſhould not enfeeble the remembrance of them.</p>
                  <p>"This he abſolutely refuſed. "No, dear Lindorf," ſaid he, "you ſhall have no portrait of mine, neither paſt nor preſent. I would have them forgotten as totally by you as they are by me. I never would have them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

more. I wiſh you only to remember our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is, and ever ſhall be inviolable."</p>
                  <p>"I did not perſiſt in my requeſt, becauſe I ſaw him determined, and becauſe I had another reſource. The young Counteſs, Matilda, had a miniature picture in a bracelet; but which, after his accident, ſhe no longer wore; and which, I believe, he himſelf had forgotten. I had no great difficulty in prevailing on her, under a promiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſecrecy, to ſuffer a copy to be taken. It is this which I have now left with you, Caroline, and which I beg you to accept. You are the only perſon to whom I would have given that picture; but you, I am certain, will know its value. Look at it often; and, while you look, remember the beauteous mind which animated that once beauteous form ſtill exiſts, with ſtill improving beauty, and increaſing purity. "Yes, the change of his features gives Walſtein new luſtre, nor ſhould the remaining ſcars make you hold your huſband in horror.—Ah! Caroline, you muſt deteſt his wretched aſſaſſin, but forget not his remorſe; remember his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance! Think on what he ſuffered while he was making this his confeſſion, and conjuring you to love another; baniſhing himſelf for ever from your preſence. An expiation like this ought, almoſt, to make the crime forgotten, and to obtain a generous pardon.</p>
                  <p>"The Count, at parting, promiſed to write to me, as often as the multiplicity of affairs in which he was going to engage would permit. Wholly devoted to his duty, he had little time for a correſpondence of pleaſure, or even friendſhip. Soon after his arrival, however, at Peterſburg, I received the letters which I encloſe in this packet; you will find them numbered according to the order in which they came. Read them, Caroline; your ſpouſe is a much better painter of himſelf than I am."</p>
                  <p>Caroline took the letters, looked for No. I. and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily opened it. The hand-writing recalled to recollection the ſhort penciled billet of the antichamber; the only one ſhe had ever received from Walſtein, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of which had been ſo ſtrong, yet ſo little dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She felt the anguiſh of remorſe; and, for ſome moments, her tears impeded her ſight. At length ſhe began to read. The letter was dated from Peterſburgh, the year before her marriage, and was as follows:

                           <p>'The letter I received, yeſterday, from Matilda, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed what I long ſuſpected. Yes, you are beloved, dear Lindorf: her innocent and pure mind is itſelf aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the new ideas which affect it, and has not had the art to conceal them from the penetrating friendſhip of a brother. Each phraſe, each word, in her letter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays her ſecret; and I think myſelf guilty of no treaſon in revealing it to her huſband—Yes, her huſband, dear Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf!—In vain would your delicacy longer decline what friendſhip ſo ardently deſires; it now ought to yield to what I ſhall ſay, or rather to what I ſhall repeat. I have reflected a good deal on our laſt converſation. Becauſe you do not love my ſiſter with the ſame tranſport, with the ſame burning raptures you felt for Louiſa, you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine yourſelf unworthy of her, and conclude you never ſhall love her. Yet, you acknowledge, and I believe you have the tendereſt friendſhip for Matilda, and that ſhe is the woman you at preſent would moſt prefer, and the only one concerning whom you are any way intereſted. What more is neceſſary, dear Lindorf, to happineſs? Does a ſenſation ſo ſweet to the ſoul leave any thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wiſh? And, when to theſe are added the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude you would feel for the love ſhe bears to you, do you ſuppoſe it poſſible you ſhould not make her perfectly happy? For my part, I think her happineſs much more certain, this way, than if you had a violent paſſion for her, which conſumes itſelf in its own flames, and leaves only regret and a painful void. Ever ſince I have thought of this union, which to ſee accompliſhed, would, I own, be one of the greateſt pleaſures of my life, I have ſtudied the characters of you and Matilda much more attentively than you imagine; and each remark I have made has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and even convinced me you were born for each other. Without perhaps being ſo beauteous as Louiſa, or, even, as many other women, my ſiſter has ſomewhat in her figure which every day pleaſes more, becauſe it every day is gaining ſome additional grace; and becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in that varied and animated play of countenance which is more pleaſing than a regularity of features, that are but too apt, by their ſameneſs, to loſe their charm.— Perhaps, you will tell me ſhe wants ſenſibility, and that
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:034126_0116_0FFA914A61A8BEB8"/>
you have too much. But ſhall I ſurpriſe you, nay, ſhall I not vex you, dear Lindorf, when I ſay I believe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda has at leaſt as much feeling as my friend himſelf? Under the apparent thoughtleſſneſs of childhood, if I miſtake not, I have diſcovered the tendereſt, the moſt affectionate heart, and the moſt capable of a ſtrong and laſting attachment. You ſee, already, this little inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble has underſtanding enough to know your worth, to love you, and, I think, Lindorf, you will never have any complaints to make of her want of tenderneſs. Her mind, likewiſe, has thoſe propenſities which beſt pleaſe and fix the attention of yours. Her amiable vivacity, her uninterrupted gaiety, are qualities that will preſerve you from dulneſs; which, of all the plagues of a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſtate, is one of the worſt. Her gentleneſs and good temper will meliorate that natural warmth which ſo often overpowers you, and, in your own deſpite, carries you beyond the bounds of moderation. I hear your reply, dear Lindorf. "Yes, my own happineſs, I ſee will be certain; but what will become of that of Matilda?" Be not unhappy on that account, my friend, for, once again I tell thee, I am not; and that, when I preſs thee to marry my ſiſter, I foreſee how thy heart, perhaps the moſt excellent I have ever known, will act. Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda muſt be happy, and I defy thee to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Beſides, ſhe loves thee, and therefore without thee, Lindorf, muſt be wretched; and, whatever thou mayeſt ſay, thou haſt more love for her than thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt. Love, my friend, is nothing more than a lively friendſhip founded on reciprocal eſteem, and improved on a difference of ſex. Matilda has inſpired this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip already; and what ſhall it be, when mutual intereſt and children give it additional ſtrength? Lindorf, thou, like me, muſt feel how dear to a man muſt be the mother of his children. Oh! my friend, that kind of ſenſation which you experience when thinking of my ſiſter, will, then, daily increaſe, daily acquire new powers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm you both in happineſs. Renounce, therefore, theſe vain ſcruples, and prepare every thing for this happy u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To be ſure, I did not think that ever the poor Juſtin could have arrived at the honour of being my Lord the Count's ſteward; tho' at preſent I feel, I am ſure, I can do my duty in the diſcharge of that high office, of which I am as proud as if I were a King; and though I be not learned, I am certain I can do any thing to ſerve my good and dear Lord; and I hope, when it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend him back, that he will be ſatisfied, and find every thing in good order.</p>

My dear Louiſa, at firſt, was ſorry to leave the farm; but ſhe tells me, now, ſhe finds as ſhe ſhall be happy every where with me; tho' be this ſaid with all reſpect to my Lord the Count, for I know one ſhould not brag of one's ſelf; but when one is the huſband of Louiſa, and the ſteward of my Lord the Count of Walſtein, one may well be a little proud. Our good old father, too, is as proud as I am, and ſo gay of heart that he ſeems younger by ten years. He calls me nothing but my Lord the Count's ſteward; and he drinks a glaſs of wine more, every meal, to the health and honour of my Lord. All of us, even to our two dear little poppets, are quite overjoyed at being at the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau; and they are ſo pleaſed to play in the gardens of my Lord the Count! The eldeſt can go any where, the ſturdy little rogue; and his young brother, who is not yet weaned, already begins to liſp the name of my Lord the Count, for that is the firſt word we teach them; and when his grandfather drinks the health of my Lord he always takes off his bonnet. To be ſure they are two charming little knaves, and almoſt as beautiful as their mother.</p>
                        <p>'I ſhould never dare to preſume to tell all this to my Lord the Ambaſſador if he had not commanded me to write him word of every thing that concerned our good old father, my dear Louiſa, and our little boys.—I had almoſt forgot the flageolet, but Louiſa, who knows my Lord the Count's letter by heart, made me recollect it; and ſo I continue, as aforetime, to play to Louiſa, to amuſe her while ſhe gives the breaſt to the little one, and ſo the biggeſt dances all the while I play, for this your Lordſhip knows is like the birds in their neſts; the male ſings while the female is ſitting; and ſo my Lord the Count will very well perceive I am the happieſt man this day on God's earth. Every thing goes its gait; all we undertake ſucceeds; and when we are in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow we ſee our four calves, three hens, and their broods of chickens, and I know not how many ſheep, goats, and lambs, without reckoning our little boys, all playing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us; and all this my Lord the Count has given us, and ſo it is my opinion that my Lord the Count is as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or perhaps even happier, than we are, becauſe <hi>he</hi> has done the good, and <hi>we</hi> have only received it: but it

ought to be ſo; he wants nothing but a Louiſa, which may the good and bountiful God give him! We pray every day for my Lord the Count; for truly, my Lord has, after God himſelf, the firſt place in our hearts. Wherefore, may God grant my Lord all his wiſhes and a long life to enjoy them in, which is the moſt ſincere prayer of his moſt humble ſervants and ſuperintendants of his eſtate at Walſtein.</p>

The only thing omitted was love; but the Count had juſt ſhewn me love was not neceſſary to happineſs, but that it would be more certain from that kind of attachment which I felt for his ſiſter. Walſtein had too great an aſcendant over me not to convince, and I was the more eaſy to perſuade from the belief of being beloved, which gave a degree of force to the favourable ſentiments I had for the lovely Matilda. I no longer ſaw her without emotion; and this became ſufficiently ſtrong to make me perfectly eaſy; when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a converſation of ſome length held with her, ſhe gave me permiſſion, though not without deep bluſhes, to aſk her aunt's conſent, and endeavour to gain her over to the views of her brother.</p>
                  <p>"I thought it beſt, however, to wait, before I ſpoke to the Baroneſs, till I had written to the Count, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his promiſed anſwer. This I told Matilda, who thought it very proper; and we no longer endeavoured to conceal an affection thus authorized by fraternal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>"I continued, therefore, my daily viſits at the Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs de Zaſtrow's, and very aſſiduouſly paid her my court, tho' with very little ſucceſs. After the departure of the Count her conduct to me had been wholly changed; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways polite but always diſtant, ſhe affected to receive me
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034126_0120_0FFA914FD31E5150"/>
with great ceremony, and took her meaſures ſo well that I ſeldom had an opportunity of ſpeaking a word in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to Matilda. Theſe impediments and contradictions might natually have been expected to augment love; and, I own, I was ſecretly vexed, which did not paſs unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Matilda, and which conſoled her for her aunt's behaviour by perſuading her ſhe was beloved; and ſo, no doubt, ſhe was; friendſhip, gratitude, attached me to her, and, had I then obtained her hand, I might myſelf have been well perſuaded my affection was much ſtronger than it has proved.</p>
                  <p>"I waited, however, without any violent impatience the effect of the Count's promiſes and letter to his aunt. He wrote me word 'he had not yet been able to gain the conſent of that lady, for ſhe tenaciouſly adhered to her deſign of marrying Matilda to the young Baron de Zaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trow, then on his travels. Yet that he, however, was ſtill more tenacious of his own, which certainly ſhould be effective; for which reaſon he conjured me not to take offence, but to wait with patience. A conſiderable eſtate,' he ſaid, 'depended on this aunt, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome caution; but that, by one means or other, he would obtain his end, and that he already regarded me as his brother.'</p>
                  <p>"I wiſhed to ſhew Matilda this letter, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went to the houſe of the Baroneſs. I found it ſhut up! No porter, not a ſingle ſervant, was there to whom I could ſpeak! This circumſtance appeared extremely ſingular; for, the very evening before, I had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as uſual, without the leaſt mention of a removal. I inquired in the neighbourhood, and was told the coach had ſet off very early in the morning; but could learn nothing more. While I was remaining in the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, I ſaw Matilda's maid coming to me. I ran to meet her, and was going to queſtion, but was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her telling me to aſk nothing, for that nothing ſhe knew. "I cannot tell you where they are," ſaid ſhe. "Yeſterday, as ſoon as you were gone, I heard my lady ſpeaking very loud, and Miſs Matilda weeping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All night long there was nothing but packing up, ſcolding, and crying; and, at laſt, I was paid my wages, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and they ſet off in a coach; but Miſs Matilda, when ſhe bade me farewell, ſlipt this into my hand."</p>

                     <pb n="122" facs="unknown:034126_0121_0FFA919BF77BEF08"/>"The maid then gave me a rumpled paper, addreſſed to me; which, taking, I directly opened, but without at firſt being able to comprehend a word of its contents. It ſeemed an inventory of chairs, tables, and furniture. At laſt, I diſcovered that what regarded myſelf was interlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was as follows:</p>
                  <p>'Oh! Mr. Lindorf, we are going to depart for Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, preſently; and we are to ſtay there a long, long while; perhaps forever. What will you think when you ſhall come to-morrow and find your poor young friend gone? Will you grieve as much as ſhe does? I hope you will be a little ſorry; yet do not afflict yourſelf too much; for I promiſe you my thoughts will be the ſame at Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den as they were at Berlin, and ſo they will forever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be. Beſides, have I not a brother, a dear good brother? Write to him immediately; and, ſhould you wiſh to ſend a word in anſwer to this, let it be under cover to him, for there are no other means of its arriving at me. No, if you write to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your letter; muſt firſt go to Ruſſia. But what of that, if I but get them at laſt?— I wiſh I were as ſure this would come to your hands. I could contrive no means of writing to you, but, luckily, my aunt gave me an inventory to copy. When ſhe looks at me, I ſet down a figure, and the moment ſhe is gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> write a line. When it is done, perhaps, I may give it to poor Nancy, whom my aunt intends to turn away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe might aſſiſt us, and becauſe ſhe loves you. I am ſure ſhe will give it you, faithfully —I am vexed to be obliged to write thus clandeſtinely and deceive my aunt; yet ſhe has had no remorſe at deceiving me. Till this very night I knew not a word of our departure; no, I proteſt to you, I did not know a word of it. Is it not a ſhocking thing to ſet off without ſeeing you? I ſcarcely can write for crying, and I hear my aunt coming. My paper is no more like an inventory, ſo I muſt hide it, and begin another. Farewell, Mr. Lindorf, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you and pray for you continually; and do not forget the poor Matilda, and do not think ill of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe has written to you firſt.'</p>
                  <p>"Such was the letter of Matilda, on reading of which it was impoſſible, without any violent love, not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the native ſimplicity of the niece, and piqued at the behaviour of the aunt.

immediately wrote an account of all that had paſſed to Walſtein, and of the unworthy artifice that had been uſed. I believe anger was ſtronger than regret, for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated to the Count that I looked upon our project as impracticable; and, ſince Madame de Zaſtrow was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, to renounce it appeared to me the wiſeſt way, I encloſed a copy of the letter from Matilda, and my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, deſiring her brother to ſend it to her; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from the Count, by the return of the poſt, as follows."</p>

                        <p>'I am exceedingly angry, dear Lindorf, at the trick out good aunt, de Zaſtrow, has played us; but her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are fruitleſs, Matilda ſhall be yours. I declare, nay, have ſworn, my ſiſter ſhall not become the victim of her obſtinacy. I have nothing to allege againſt the young Baron de Zaſtrow, whom I have not the honour of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to whom I wiſh all manner of happineſs, except that of being the huſband of Matilda. You, Lindorf, has ſhe ſelected, and you, already, doth her young heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. No, that innocent and open heart, which ſpoke all its ſecrets with ſuch ingenuous confidence to me, ſhall not be deceived in its wiſhes; ſhall not have to combat a paſſion to which I myſelf may be ſaid to have given birth; nor ſhall ſhe have to bluſh for having firſt written to any other man than her huſband. Poor dear girl! how much did her billet affect me! I will write immediately, to conſole her, and afford her no very diſtant proſpect of felicity: a little perſeverence and we ſhall conquer. I will encloſe your letter, likewiſe, which, I believe, will be more effectual than mine. By the ſame poſt I will write to my aunt, and, if neceſſary, aſſert the rights a dying father bequeathed to me over my ſiſter. <hi>To you I confide her and the care of her future happineſs;</hi> nor, oh! my father will I betray this truſt. Matilda and Lindorf ſhall be one, and your dear girl, then, cannot fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happy! Take courage, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my friend, and be aſſured our project ſhall ſucceed. Matilda is yet but fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen; in three or four years ſhe will be more formed, more capable of happineſs, more worthy of herſelf and you. My only fear is that, you being ſeparate from her, that heart, ſo ſuddenly become cold, inſenſible, that heart,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034126_0123_0FFA919DCE050CE0"/>
no longer ſuſceptible of love, as you have ſuppoſed, may, in the mean time, ſtand convicted of its error, and find that it never yet knew the paſſion. If, dear Lindorf, this misfortune ſhould happen, promiſe me, ſwear to me, you will neither ſacrifice yourſelf nor my ſiſter to engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which, from that moment, will ceaſe to exiſt. I am deſirous of this union no farther than as I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it will not be a misfortune to either party, and would rather have to comfort Matilda for the loſs of a lover than for the indifference of the huſband of her heart. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Lindorf, the very moment ſhe would no longer be the wife you would prefer to all others, the very moment you are convinced ſome other woman may render you more happy, have the fortitude to inform your friend of this change, and be aſſured that, inſtead of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by this conduct, you will redouble his eſteem. I think violent love no way neceſſary to conjugal felicity. I have ſaid ſo in my former letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I perſiſt in the opinion; but I am ſtill more effectually convinced that a huſband and wife ought, at leaſt, mutually to prefer each other to the whole world, and never know regret at the remembrance of being united for life. I think it neceſſary that that agreement of taſte and feeling, that entire confidence, that bond of affection, ſhould be found which cannot exiſt if one of the two love another, and be obliged to conceal the thoughts by which he or ſhe is moſt occupied.—Theſe conſiderations, I own, have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hindered me from marrying and yielding to the wiſhes and entreaties of my family, which, with me, will become extinct. I dread leſt my preſent rank and favour might engage ſome woman, to whom I might addreſs myſelf, to marry me, though ſhe really loved another. I fear acquiring rights which I ſhall find are uſurpations, and over a heart that has other engagements. I dread being the unconſcious cauſe of miſery to two lovers, and being myſelf ſtill more miſerable when I ſhall have made the diſcovery. You know me too well, dear Lindorf, ever to imagine I can mean to reproach when I thus ſpeak my ſecret ſentiments. You know my manner of thinking relative to the accident that has altered my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; it is ever the ſame; and, I again proteſt, I every day congratulate myſelf on the preſent opportunity I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy of indulging my moſt prevalent inclination, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſtudies in which I moſt delight; happy in
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:034126_0124_0FFA91555BA44758"/>
having had the means, in my former ſtation, of giving thoſe proofs of courage and zeal in the ſervice of my King which I moſt wiſhed; and, in my preſent, of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, as I think, much more effectually. A good miniſter, Lindorf, is ſtill a greater character than a good general. It is my greateſt pleaſure to fulfil the duties of the office to which I am appointed; and this office, I repeat it, is much more agreeable to me than the life of a ſoldier; therefore I <hi>can</hi> have nothing to regret; nothing, nothing—Yet I muſt do myſelf juſtice. I may not now hope to inſpire love, nor do I make any ſuch weak pretences; and, perhaps, it may be for that reaſon I perſuade myſelf that love is not neceſſary to happineſs. But I wiſh, at leaſt, to find a woman who has no partiality for another. I do not even ſhrink from a ſlight repugnance, at firſt; that is natural, and what I ought to expect. My endeavours muſt be to diſpel it by degrees, and make myſelf beloved firſt through gratitude, and afterwards from habit. The eye would ſoon accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate itſelf to my perſon, and my ſole ſtudy ſhould be to make it forgotton by my actions. Is it poſſible that a woman muſt not, at laſt, love him who exiſts but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her happy; who would prevent her wiſhes, to which his own would be ever ſubſervient, and who would be grateful for the ſmalleſt marks of attachment which ſhe might beſtow! Such, my friend, are the loved illuſions of my heart, and which I yet, one day, hope to behold realized. I foreſee all the obſtacles, but they diſcourage me not. I know how difficult it is to find a woman whoſe heart is entirely free, without which my whole ſcheme would be fruſtrated; for compariſons would inceſſantly be made between me and the regretted, the beloved object. I ſhould be looked upon as a monſter. Partiality and bitter remembrance would poiſon life.— But, could I meet ſome young heart, ſuch as I wiſh, and ſuch as I ſhall inceſſantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The remainder of the letter related only to political affairs, and accounts of Ruſſia, which Caroline ſkipped over, or read unconſciouſly; her thoughts had other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and her heart was not capacious enough for her own affairs. She ſeemed as if tranſported into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, of which, till then, ſhe had no idea. This laſt letter particularly ſtruck her. She read it again, and with ſenſations ſomewhat painful. The prediction of the love of Lindorf, the exceſſive fear of Walſtein, leſt he ſhould marry a woman whoſe heart was pre-engaged, made a ſevere impreſſion on her. When ſhe came to
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:034126_0126_0FFA915918A645B0"/>
Walſtein's project of happineſs, and to the motives which had induced him to marry her, ſhe found herſelf, notwithſtanding her repugnance, ſo affected, that, at the moment, ſhe thought ſhe loved him only in the world; or, rather, ſhe did not herſelf underſtand her own feelings. She remained with her eyes fixed on this letter, without remembering that the manuſcript was not ended. Her enthuſiaſm, at length, vaniſhed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; the idea of the Count was effaced, and the image of Lindorf regained a part of its former empire. The letter was laid down, and the manuſcript once more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up.</p>
                  <p>"Time fails, Caroline, and the four-and-twenty hours I have dedicated to this painful work are almoſt ended. I already perceive the firſt rays of day, of that day on which, perhaps, for the laſt time I ſhall behold her, to whom, yeſterday, at the ſame hour, I hoped to devote my life. How happy was I then! How did the ſweet chimeras of hope and love flatter my heart! A ſingle moment has deſtroyed them all, has plunged me into an abyſs of deſpair!—Yet what complaints are theſe? Ought I thus to employ the few remaining minutes in which I would conduct you to happineſs, by pointing out the road? Yes, Caroline, you will be, muſt be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; and the certainty of this will be the ſole conſolation of my future exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>"The whole year paſſed without the leaſt change of circumſtance or ſituation. Matilda remained at Dreſden, the Count in Ruſſia, and I at Berlin. An uninterrupted correſpondence maintained our mutual connections, but that of Dreſden, paſſing firſt by Peterſburg, was neither very frequent nor very animated. Matilda, educated in reſtraint, and even with ſeverity, durſt not indulge her feelings; and, at the utmoſt, expreſſed friendſhip only. My anſwers nearly aſſumed the ſame tone; yet, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eſpouſe her as ſoon as her aunt would conſent, and preferring her to all the women I then knew, I care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided every occaſion of meeting objects who might eradicate theſe ideas, and take place of her in my heart.</p>
                  <p>"To deprive myſelf of the pleaſures of courts coſt me but little. Ever ſince the unfortunate adventure of Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa and the Count I had preſerved an habitual melancholy, which well accorded with my future intentions. Whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to my military occupations and paying my
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034126_0127_0FFA91A42FA9EF50"/>
duty to the King, I employed the remainder of my time in riding, muſic, or reading.</p>
                  <p>"An unfortunate event happened which diſturbed my tranquillity and increaſed my melancholy. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who remained at Ronebourg, had an apoplectic fit; my mother, who had long been in a feeble and ill ſtate of health, ſcarcely could ſupport her grief and terror. I was inſtantly ſent for, and found them both, on my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, in great danger. The ſight of me appeared to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them; my mother eſpecially, who loved me with moſt affectionate tenderneſs, found herſelf ſenſibly bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſhe attributed to my preſence and cares; but the ſtate in which ſhe ſtill remained required every atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could beſtow. I wrote to court to obtain leave of abſence. My motive was too ſacred for me to be refuſed, and I devoted my whole time and faculties to my parents.</p>
                  <p>"It was during this abſence, Caroline, that you came to embelliſh the Court I had quitted; and it was then alſo the Count had that unfortunate ſickneſs which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him ſo long on the road, and which I heard of by accident. At any other moment I ſhould have flown to his aſſiſtance; but I was then detained at Ronebourg, by duties too ſacred, and too dear, to admit even the idea.</p>
                  <p>"Some time after, I had the pleaſure to learn, from himſelf, he had recovered and arrived at Berlin. His letter had an enigmatic and myſterious turn, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked when I read it firſt—'He would have given,' he ſaid, 'the whole world to ſee and ſpeak to me. The cruel event which detained me at Ronebourg, was the more diſtreſſing to him, becauſe he abſolutely could not come thither, on account of the diſtance (Ronebourg is at the farther end of Sileſia, and four long days journey from Berlin) and the little time he had to remain in Pruſſia, during which every moment would be occupied. He then ſpoke of Matilda, was grieved at the perverſity of her aunt, but was determined, he ſaid, the inſtant I ſhould be at liberty to leave Ronebourg, to exert his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and terminate our marriage.—He had a new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for haſtening the affair.—Perhaps he was himſelf on the point of being happy—of obtaining what he ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſired; but he could not enjoy perfect content unleſs I enjoyed it alſo.'</p>
                  <p>"I paid leſs attention to this letter than I ſhould have done at any other time; for ſcarcely had I time to read

it, nor have I, till now, hardly recollected it ſince. I received it on the very day on which my father, after having languiſhed four months, expired in my arms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending my mother to me, and commanding me not to leave her.</p>
                  <p>"Alas! my heart had already fore-run the command, which was itſelf to me a law. Already had ſworn, to the tendereſt of mothers, that her ſon, her only ſon, would not abandon her in the hour of her affliction!</p>
                  <p>"As ſoon as I had rendered my father the laſt duties of humanity, I wrote to the Count to inform him of my loſs, and to entreat he would obtain a renewal of my leave of abſence; and the King not only permitted me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at Ronebourg, but deigned, likewiſe, to approve the motive that made me wiſh to ſtay.</p>
                  <p>"The Count, in his anſwer, wrote in a ſtyle of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy that did not ſurpriſe me. I knew how ſenſibly his heart was affected by, and partook of, the afflictions of his friends; beſide, he himſelf had a ſtrong attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to my father. He made no references to the ſubject of his former letter, which had been miſlaid in the grief of the terrible moment in which it was received, and I had almoſt forgot its contents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He only ſaid he ſhould go immediately to Dreſden, being deſirous to ſee his ſiſter before he returned into Ruſſia; he added that, if it were poſſible, he would alſo come to Ronebourg, but durſt not promiſe; and, in fact, did not come.</p>

                  <p>"Three months more paſſed away, ſtill more ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſtill more painful than the preceding.

                  <p>"After the death of my father, I fled from Ronebourg; it was become a hated place, as well by the double loſs I ſo lately had ſuſtained as by the act of barbarity I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had committed there.

                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, where I paſſed the remainder of the winter, and lived ſtill more retired than the year before. The Count wrote ſeldom, and, when he did, his ſtyle ſeemed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed and gloomy; and, at length, I began to perceive there was ſomething which lay heavy at his heart. I told him ſo, he owned it, but deferred a full explanation till he ſhould ſee me in perſon. This was to be in the following autumn, which was the time, alſo, he had fixed for my marriage with his ſiſter. 'Thy deſtiny and mine,' ſaid he, 'Lindorf, will then be finally determined. Oh! may they be happy! Or, if I myſelf am obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce bliſs, may, at leaſt, the felicity of my ſiſter and my friend ſupply the loſs of what I dare not hope!'</p>
                  <p>"I ſuppoſed he had a paſſion for ſome Ruſſian lady, and that he found inſurmountable obſtacles; but, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſecret, I ceaſed my inquiries. I likewiſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally received ſhort letters from Matilda, which always were firſt ſent to her brother. Her aunt remained fixed in her opinion, and had written for the young Baron de Zaſtrow to return from his travels. Her inheritance was only to be Matilda's on condition this marriage took place; but the generous girl was ready to forego every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and aſked me, with an affecting openneſs of hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it were not a thouſand times better to have leſs riches and more happineſs. For my part, I little regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the loſs of Madam de Zaſtrow's fortune; for my own, by the death of my parents, had become conſiderable, and was very largely increaſed by the deceaſe of the Commander of Riſberg, my maternal uncle. He lived, like a hermit, on the eſtate I at preſent inhabit; would never ſee me while living, and left me all his wealth at his death, under the condition, however, that I ſhould
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:034126_0130_0FFA915CB780FFE8"/>
marry within two years, and give the name of Riſberg to my eldeſt ſon. My engagements with Matilda made the fulfilling of this clauſe apparently eaſy; and, perhaps, to this motive might have contributed to decide Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Zaſtrow in my favour.</p>
                  <p>"Since that time, Caroline, how kind have I thought the obligation laid on me by my uncle's will! How ſweet has the idea been of marrying within much leſs than the time preſcribed! How many future joys did I dare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and how ſincerely did I bleſs my uncle's memory! —At preſent, I renounce, for ever renounce his gift. I pretend not to wealth to which I have no right; and will quit an eſtate, to-morrow, to which I am never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. What to me are riches and eſtates? Or what, alas! can I ſuffer now?—I have nothing to loſe!</p>
                  <p>"Oh pardon! pardon! Caroline! How may the vows of a wretch whom it is your duty to forget affect you? I add to my crimes by continuing to adore you; and the purpoſe of this writing is to make reparation.</p>

It is ſhe who has wholly changed me.

ſo great that I was every moment in fear leſt my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſhould eſcape my lips.

Did not I know Walſtein? How, indeed, unleſs preſaging nature was informing me of my involuntary crime? In fine, my agitation increaſed ſo much that I left the room without opening the letter, reſolved not to read it till I came home. I therefore mounted my horſe, but had ſcarcely got an hundred yards out of town before I ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly alighted, hang my horſe to a gate, and broke the ſeal which encloſed my ſentence, reſolved, had it been ſuch as I feared it might, never to return to Rindaw more.

                        <p>'Love, dear Lindorf, of her and love; think of theſe, and remember not aught elſe the univerſe contains. Or, ſhould Love grant a moment to Friendſhip, employ that moment to aſſure thyſelf that a friend participates thy joys.—Happy Lindorf! Thou loveſt and art beloved! Thou haſt found the mate of thy heart, the ſympathizing mind which the ſupreme Creator modelled after thy own, his fiat formed ye for each other. And feareſt thou then I ſhould oppoſe a decree ſo immutable; that I ſhould tear thee from her who was written thine in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of eternity? Thy letter has removed all doubts; not a phraſe, not a word is there which does not breathe love. It is a paſſion thou knoweſt too well how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, not both to feel it and inſpire. In thee I behold
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:034126_0137_0FFA91AD15984A30"/>
that ſupreme felicity the ſeeds of which have been depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in my own heart, and of which I have ſometimes doubted the actual exiſtence. Something of it I beheld in the loves of Louiſa and Juſtin, but this I attributed to country ſimplicity, and ſuppoſed it impoſſible to be found elſewhere. Oh! how grateful is it to my heart to know that this felicity has been realized by my friend, to have proof it is not wholly baniſhed this earth; and of theſe proofs thy letter is full; even to that ſacrifice which thou with ſuch ſincerity offereſt, but which I ſhould be a barbarian to accept. My affection for my ſiſter, were yours, Lindorf, out of the queſtion, would enſure my refuſal. You are a man of honour, and I know you ſincere, when you aſſure me, you would be careful never to let Matilda perceive ſhe was not the wife of your heart; but how might you keep this fatal ſecret? Alas, my friend, I am convinced it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſo to deceive a woman, and the miſery of both would be the inevitable conſequence of a diſcovery.</p>
                        <p>'No Lindorf, I wiſh your delicacy and conſcience to be wholly at eaſe, reſpecting our dear Matilda. I own ſhe is ſtrongly attached to you, and that you are the firſt and only man who has made any progreſs in her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But, whether it be the effect of character, educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of youth, her ſenſations are not of that profound and determined ſpecies on which the happineſs or miſery of life depends; nor am I certain that we ought to give them the name of love.</p>
                        <p>'It has ſeemed to me that her feelings are rather the effect of a fervid imagination, than of the heart, which, perhaps, have been heightened by oppoſition; and that friendſhip has been miſtaken for love. During my late viſit at Dreſden, I was ſtruck with the levity, and even gaiety, with which ſhe ſupported your abſence and her own chagrin. It is true, ſhe always ſpeaks of you with infinite tenderneſs, but ſhe laughed and cried both in a breath; and a moment after ſhe had vowed eternal love for you, would begin to ſing and dance. I was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy on this account, becauſe, I own, I partly foreſaw what has happened; and, ſuppoſing I had been deceived in this, I, for my part, was well pleaſed with this kind of paſſion; if you were united it might become every thing you wiſhed, and, if not, Matil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

elſewhere. The young Baron de Zaſtrow is returned, and, as I am informed, is a handſome youth. He, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may contribute to her tranquillity; but, be it as it may, make not yourſelf uneaſy; reſt aſſured both bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter will find their happineſs in yours. I, therefore, releaſe you from every obligation, dear Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, and only have to blame you for having ſuppoſed it poſſible I could do otherwiſe. Fly, the moment you have received this letter, and pay your homage to the lady you love, and who, if I may judge from your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, ſo tranſcendantly deſerves to be beloved; nor, have I any cauſe to doubt it, for, with all the enthuſiaſm of paſſion, you ſeem to have preſerved the coolneſs of reaſon. How impatient am I to judge for myſelf! To ſee, hear, and, as you yourſelf ſay, to applaud your choice! Nor will it be long before I ſhall enjoy this pleaſure. Preparations are made for my return to Berlin; you muſt direct no more letters to me at Peterſburg. I ſhall be on the road when you receive this, and ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in your arms. We ſhall then, dear Lindorf, no longer have any thing to conceal from each other, for hitherto we have mutually had ſome reſerve. I ſhall learn who your beloved is, and you will then be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſecret which, hitherto, a combination of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances has obliged me to keep; nay, indeed, to have afflicted you would but have added to my own grief, for my ſorrows were of a kind that admitted not of allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When I return, they, perhaps, may ceaſe, and perhaps, alſo, I may then be deſtined never to enjoy that felicity, which I do not envy you, Lindorf, but which I yet moſt ardently wiſh to partake. Oh! my friend, there is another <hi>She,</hi> another beloved, in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who, when you ſhall know, will not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe you.—But not a word of this till I ſee you. I hope to find you either happy or on the point of becoming ſo. This, at leaſt, is a certain bliſs; and with this, if ſo my deſtiny ſhould decree, I muſt endeavour to reſt content. Farewell! Should you mention your friend to the miſtreſs of your heart, ſhould you tell her ſhe has ſuperſeded his ſiſter, tell her likewiſe ſhe has gained a brother, nay, perhaps, a ſiſter alſo, of whom may ſhe become the friend, and whom may ſhe render as much alive to love as ſhe herſelf is. That ſhe may, however, love you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lindorf, equal to your deſerts, is the ardent prayer of</p>

                  <p>"You know the reſt, Caroline: I have done. It is not for words to tell you either what I felt after reading this letter, or after finding how preſumptuous and culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my hopes had been. I began this manuſcript the moment I got home, yeſterday. The time has been ſhort; my wearied hand and eyes ſcarce have power to trace an adieu which my tears would efface; or to ſupplicate your pardon for an unfortunate man who has diſturbed your future tranquillity. Oh! may he be wholly forgotten by you, and may you recover that pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, that ſerenity of ſoul without which happineſs may not be. Oh! Caroline, believe the friend who knows your heart better, at this moment, than you yourſelf, and who knows, alſo the man to whom, henceforth, it is your duty to conſecrate this your heart, your life; it is with him, only, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as happy as he deſerves, that you can find hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs yourſelf. But you have read, and juſtice and love by this time muſt have paſſed ſentence. This ſentence cannot but be in favour of Walſtein, and I have nothing more to add.</p>
                  <p>"I have not yet come to any determination reſpecting myſelf; I neither know what I ſhall do, or what ſay, to Walſtein. I ought, perhaps, to tell him all; but a word which eſcaped me in my letter, a word I would redeem with my life, has for ever ſealed my lips."</p>
                  <p>"No, Caroline, never ſhall theſe lips, or this heart pronounce your name. I will even deprive myſelf of that conſolation. Farewell Caroline, farewell—for ever! —Ay, for ever; for never more muſt I ſee you, unleſs I could ceaſe to love you. Oh! might this love become ſo ſanctified, that I might only behold, in you, the wife of Walſtein. Oh! might I reſtore each of you a friend

worthy of yourſelves!—This or death is all I have to hope!—Adieu, adieu! I fly to give you this; once more to behold you—No, not to behold. I will not look on Caroline! You are the wife of my friend; the Counteſs of Walſtein. Yes, to the Counteſs of Walſtein I am bringing theſe papers, this picture. Caroline is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in being; not Lindorf's Caroline!—You are now at the pavilion, I fly. Oh! Heaven grant me fortitude, ſuſtain me in this fearful moment!"</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not attempt to deſcribe what were the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Caroline after what ſhe had read. Who may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all that paſſed in a heart divided between love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, admiration, and, perhaps, even a tincture of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy? Louiſa and Matilda, by turns, drew her attention; ſhe read again the paſſages that related to them. What fire, what enthuſiaſm did ſhe find in Lindorf's expreſſion of his paſſion for Louiſa, compared to the feelings ſhe had obſerved when in company with herſelf! She was tempted to believe that the latter were little more than the reſult of tranquil friendſhip. As to the young Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda—how happy was ſhe, who dared love Lindorf and own her paſſion!—Ay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but how much to be pitied; not to be beloved again! Charming Matilda! Generous Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein! Ye merit not ingratitude from others!</p>
                  <p>Caroline well recollected, that during the week pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding her marriage, the Count had mentioned his ſiſter, and the hope that Caroline and ſhe would become friends! but, as ſhe was then wholly abſorbed in meditating on the means of ſeparation, ſhe had paid little attention to his diſcourſe. But ah! how bitter was the remembrance of having injured this Matilda, this ſiſter; injured her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond reparation; robbed her of a heart over which her claims were ſo numerous, and ſo legitimate! It was true ſhe did not ſeem ſufficiently to know the value of this heart, thought Caroline, as ſhe again peruſed the letter of the Count to Lindorf; and though the apparent want of ſenſibility in Matilda was in every reſpect a ſubject of conſolation to Caroline, yet could ſhe ſcarcely pardon her.</p>
                  <p>Deep in thought, on the many and ſtrange events ſhe juſt had read, ſat Caroline, and perceived not that it was noon, when a ſervant came from the Baroneſs to ſeek her. She haſtily gathered up the papers that were ſpread open around her, and locked them up in her bureau; but, as ſhe was going, ſhe perceived the box, containing the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:034126_0141_0FFA91B43215BB48"/>
ſtill on the table; this ſhe ſlipped into her pocket, and ran to the Baroneſs.</p>
                  <p>Caroline found her with a note ſhe had received from Lindorf, which ſhe could not read. Here, my dear, ſaid the Canoneſs, as ſhe entered, open this, and let me hear what our dear young Gentleman ſays, whom we have not ſeen for theſe two days; we ſhall learn why he is abſent; I cannot tell thee how much I miſs him. The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Caroline, expecting what the contents would be, ſighed, raiſed her eyes to Heaven, and took the note. It contained compliments to the ladies; informed them, he, Lindorf, was forced to depart, immediately, on very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential and preſſing buſineſs; could not have the honour of ſeeing them again; aſſured them, however, he never could forget them, and earneſtly hoped a continuance of their eſteem and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>Yes certainly, Caroline, knew, before ſhe read the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this note; it was no ſurpriſe to her; yet was ſhe ſo affected as ſcarcely to be able to pronounce a word. The conviction ſhe ſhould ſee him no more, that all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between them was over, the cold and ſtudied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt of this billet, compared to the manuſcript ſhe juſt had read, the words eſteem and friendſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Might one eaſily ſuppoſe her diſtreſs could ſuffer augmentation?— Scarcely had ſhe finiſhed the note, ſuppreſſing her ſobbs, tho' the tears ran inceſſantly down her cheeks, when tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her handkerchief out of her pocket, the box, which ſhe had juſt put in it, and which was then far from her thoughts, fell at her feet, and, laying open on the ground, preſented that form, and thoſe features which ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feared to look on. The accident was a very trifling one, yet did it make an incredible impreſſion on Caroline; ay, as great as though the Count him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She ſtooped for the box, turned away her eyes, as ſhe picked it up, and haſtily ran from the chamber, without knowing why or from whom ſhe fled—ſhe preſently recovered, returned and found the Canoneſs ſurpriſed at the cry ſhe had uttered, and her ſudden flight; and ſtill more affected at the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

farewell billet of Lindorf, and this his ſo unexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
                  <p>The diſorder in her eyes was a cataract; which, daily increaſing, had too far injured her ſight to ſee the picture. Caroline might ſay what ſhe pleaſed, and it was much more eaſy to avoid an explanation concerning that, than to anſwer the queſtions, ſuppoſitions, and lamentations of the Baroneſs on the departure of Lindorf, which were unceaſing. It broke all her meaſures, diſconcerted all her projects, and abſoutely threw her into deſpair! Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, afflicted as ſhe herſelf was, yet was obliged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt her imagination to comfort her friend. The beſt mode, no doubt, would have been to have proved, by confeſſing her marriage, how chimerical all theſe her projects were. Caroline, who, at laſt, perceived what her views had been, in encouraging the viſits of Lindorf, wiſhed to make this confeſſion; but it was now become ſo painful, ſo difficult, ſhe had not the power. How might ſhe ſo much as pronounce the name of the Count! How relate his wrongs! I am the ſource of miſery to the moſt virtuous of human beings, the moſt ſublime, moſt worthy of felicity; and then, when I ought to have held myſelf bleſt, beyond the lot of women, then did I yield to antipathy, the moſt unreaſonable, the moſt unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus reaſoned Caroline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor was this antipathy the only ſenſation for which ſhe had cauſe to bluſh. The name of Lindorf was as painful to pronounce as that of Walſtein; ſhe reſolved, therefore, to wait the anſwer of her father, and the effect of time, ere ſhe ſpoke, and to ſupport, as well as ſhe was able, the regret of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs, for the abſence of Lindorf. In fact, ſhe regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it too much herſelf not to find her heart in uniſon with that of her friend; and, however painful this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſubject of converſation might ſometimes be, yet was ſhe ſo intereſted in it, that ſhe ſeemed to liſten as though it were faſcination to her ears. She became ſtill more aſſiduous in her attentions to the Baroneſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who, being deprived of ſight, had ſtill more need of her cares. She went no more to the pavilion; her books and treaſures were, one after another, brought back to her apartment! though her muſical inſtruments and painting utenſils were the laſt. The mind muſt be at eaſe before it can wholly devote itſelf to, and coolly

conſider any ſubject. Caroline, whenever alone, was conſtantly reading her manuſcript and letters, rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating on the beauteous Louiſa, the young Matilda, and the Count; ſitting loſt in a multitude of unconnected ideas, which were uſually ſucceeded by a flood of tears. She likewiſe, become ſo familiar with the picture, that at laſt, ſhe was never eaſy but when looking at it, and never beheld it without emotion; nay, even not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pleaſure. Great God; would ſhe ſay with her eyes fixed on the features, if, to ſo many virtues, a perſon ſo noble and a countenance ſo expreſſive were added? what mortal might be worthy of him? If?—Why do I ſay if? Who at preſent is worthy of Walſtein? Am I? Oh! no, no; the beſt of men deſerves the beſt of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; deſerves a heart devoted to him, and him only!</p>

                  <head>CAROLINE OF LICHTFIELD.</head>
                  <p>LEAVE we, for a time, the lovely Caroline to reflect, weep over, and alternately read the manuſcript of Lindorf and the letters of Walſtein; and let us ſee what became of the two friends. Indeed, the profound ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Caroline, the monotony of her preſent life, and the ſtruggles of her heart, would but weary the reader. Not that it was dulneſs by which ſhe was tormented; no, it was a ſtate of continual agitation; the leaſt noiſe ſhe heard made her whole frame tremble and her blood run cold. Her imagination, inceſſantly employed on Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf and the Count, perſuaded her that one of the two would arrive at Rindaw. What! might ſhe think that Lindorf, who had baniſhed himſelf for ever from her preſence, would return? No: when ſhe reaſoned with herſelf, read his manuſcript, and recollected the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he was under to Walſtein, ſhe would exclaim, with conviction, Never, never ſhall I ſee him more. But love and imagination do not always reaſon; and, unconſcious of it herſelf, perhaps ſhe thought, more than once, he would not have the fortitude to keep his reſolution.</p>
                  <p>She was deceived. At the farther part of Sileſia, in his melancholy manſion of Ronebourg, Lindorf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his involuntary crime with tears and groans, and thought the expiation of a life ſcarcely ſufficient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement. Alas! how often was he tempted to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate that life he no longer could conſecrate to Caroline, and which had hitherto been ſo fatal to the beſt of friends! But he knew them both too well not to be certain that ſuch an act would for ever deſtroy their happineſs and tranquillity. He read the Sorrows of Werter, but they produced a very different effect to what might have been expected. The deſpair of Charlotte, of Albert, the friend of Werter, were terrible; and, more generous than the latter, Lindorf would rather live and ſuffer, than empoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the felicity of thoſe he loved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:034126_0146_0FFA91BBDB39E110"/>During the firſt part of his reſidence at Ronebourg, life was become ſo odious to him, and the pain of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it appeared ſo great, that he thought thus, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during this pain, to make ſome reparation for his wrongs, which idea was his only conſolation. We muſt likewiſe obſerve if his paſſions were violent they were the leſs likely to be eternal. Notwithſtanding his ſubtle diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning the different ſpecies of love, he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored Louiſa; and, though he had not the ſame extreme paſſion for Matilda, yet, had ſhe certainly, began to make a conſiderable impreſſion on his heart, when ſhe was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off. We have ſince ſeen to what exceſs he loved Caroline; hope we then that time, or ſome other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, may cure him of this unfortunate love. His heart is too honeſt, his affection for Walſtein too ſincere, to make him endeavour to cheriſh ſentiments he knows to be criminal.</p>
                  <p>He had been a recluſe, more than a month, at Rone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, and his cure was not very far advanced, when, one day, attempting a ſecond time to write to the Count, without well knowing what to ſay, he beheld the Count himſelf, enter his chamber, and run into his arms. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, at his arrival from Peterſburg, not to find Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf at Berlin, and learning from the ſervants he had left there, he was gone to Ronebourg, where he was alone; Walſtein, who dreaded ſome unexpected misfortune, waited only to pay his duty to the King and his good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, the High Chamberlain, and immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to learn what might be the motives of this his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular retreat, at the very moment he ſuppoſed him in the full enjoyment of happineſs. No ſooner were the firſt tranſports of ſurpriſe, emotion, and joy over, than the Count began his interrogations. They were dictated by the fears and affections of friendſhip. "Tell me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, dear Lindorf," ſaid he, "wherefore do I find you here, alone, melancholy, with ſome ſecret malady at your heart, which your countenance but too plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays? Unfold the cruel myſtery, my friend. What is become of the lady you loved? Why is ſhe not with you? Why not united to you? Wherefore is not my friend happy?"</p>
                  <p>The Count might have continued ſpeaking; for Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, ignorant of his coming, unprepared to anſwer queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo terrible as theſe, kept a mournful ſilence. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034126_0147_0FFA917B532FE938"/>
was ſilent alſo; but he preſſed the hand of Lindorf, while his countenance, expreſſive of the feelings of his heart, ſeemed to demand his confidence. At length, "What!" ſaid he, "Lindorf, will you not tell me? Am I no longer your friend; the faithful guardian of your boſom ſecrets, and have I not a right to read what paſſes there?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," cried Lindorf, "you have every imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable right over me; you are my friend, the beſt of friends, and never did I feel it more powerfully than at this moment, in which I am obliged to refuſe you what you aſk." The Count, amazed, fell back ſome paces. Lindorf continued, "Oh! my dear Walſtein, recoil not from your unhappy friend, condemn him not too lightly. Silence is not my choice, but the effect of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and, did you know, you muſt approve my motives. Reſtrained by honour, oaths, every thing moſt ſacred, I may not betray a ſecret which regards not me alone. Aſk no more concerning this unfortunate affair, but pity him who is deprived of the melancholy reſource of dividing his griefs."</p>
                  <p>The Count again went up to Lindorf, again took him by the hand, and his looks proved how much he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. "Reſtrained by honour and oaths!" ſaid he; "my queſtions, then, all are ended; too well, myſelf, I know how far a ſecret promiſe is obligatory, and I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered—Yet is the misfortune without a remedy? Have you no hope?"</p>
                  <p>"None, none," replied Lindorf, with vehemence, "I have forever loſt her whom I adored; ſhe exiſts no more"—Lindorf ſtopped; he was going to have added, <hi>for me,</hi> but was fearful of ſaying too much, and the Count exclaimed, "Good God! Lindorf, exiſts no more! What, has death deprived you of her? Ah! dear and unfortunate Lindorf, how infinitely do I pity you!"</p>
                  <p>Lindorf wiſhed to undeceive him, yet his fears again kept him ſilent; he dreaded leſt Walſtein ſhould divine the truth, and, on conſideration, was not ſorry he had thus miſunderſtood him. His ſilence, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed this idea of death, and would deſtroy every ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that might have alighted on Caroline, Walſtein, however, had none: never had it entered his thoughts that his own wife was the woman ſo much beloved, ſo
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034126_0148_0FFA91BD80BB1E58"/>
much regretted. He had been abſent from Pruſſia, was equally ignorant of the ſituation of Rindaw, where he had never been, and of Riſberg; nor did he even know that Lindorf had lived there, or there had formed the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo fatal to his repoſe. He knew, likewiſe, Caroline was living, and well, and remained perſuaded that ſome tragical event had robbed Lindorf's miſtreſs of life. The gloomy deſpair in which the latter remained, after this converſation, confirmed the idea. Walſtein endeavoured to calm and conſole him, and aſked if he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Berlin.</p>
                  <p>"To Berlin!" cried Lindorf, with terror; "No, no, dear Walſtein, never, never.—I muſt quit this country; I muſt travel for ſome years: oppoſe not a reſolution ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary and fixed. On your friendſhip I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend to obtain permiſſion, and the concluſion of peace makes me hope it will not be difficult to obtain. Should the King refuſe, I muſt reſign my commiſſion; I muſt depart, I muſt leave this country."</p>
                  <p>Ignorant of his real motives, the Count judged he had very urgent reaſons for quitting Pruſſia, and was the leſs ready to ſearch for objections, becauſe he thought a few years travelling might remove his anguiſh. He, therefore, promiſed to obtain the leave he deſired; and, a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after, added, "It is very poſſible, dear Lindorf, I may go with you.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> —"You Walſtein?"—"Yes, I my friend; I, as well as you, perhaps, may have reaſons for wiſhing to quit my country. We will go together, and we ſhall be leſs unhappy."</p>
                  <p>"Unhappy!" cried Lindorf, "may you, may the Count of Walſtein ſpeak of unhappineſs!"</p>
                  <p>"I underſtand your ſurpriſe," ſaid the Count, drawing nearer, "but it is time it ſhould end; time it is that I ſhould reveal a ſecret I have too long kept hidden. Can I, Lindorf, blame you for myſterious conduct, when you ſhall know that I have been married theſe ſix months?"</p>
                  <p>Lindorf affected not ſurpriſe; it was impoſſible, on ſuch an occaſion eſpecially, to feign what he did not feel; but his embarraſſment, the red fluſhings of his countenance, and his real ſenſations, there ſo marked, gave him the appearance of ſurpriſe. The Count continued.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my friend, I am united to the moſt angelic of women; and yet am I far from being happy! I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all my mournful ſtory; at preſent it will be ſome
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034126_0149_0FFA90F2942731E8"/>
conſolation, and may I bring that conviction home to you which I myſelf begin to experience; that in friendſhip, only, man ought to ſeek felicity."</p>
                  <p>Then did the Count enter on a narrative, bitter to the ſoul of Lindorf, which he had foreſeen, and which, of all tortures, he moſt had dreaded. The recital confirmed his misfortunes, his remorſe, and lacerated his heart. What muſt be the impreſſion, on that agitated heart, of the name of Caroline, repeated every inſtant; a name ſo deeply engraven there, and of which he was obliged to diſſemble ignorance? Surely, if Lindorf had been guilty of invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary wrongs, to this the moſt worthy of men; what he now ſuffered was ſufficient to expiate all his errors. The Count began his narrative far back; told Lindorf it was the King, who, knowing the rich inheritance of Caroline, firſt projected this marriage, and had written to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it while in Ruſſia. "The motive," ſaid Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, "and even the will of my Sovereign, who was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry warm on the ſubject, leſs influenced me than the age and the kind of education of the young lady."</p>
                  <p>"Caroline of Lichtfield, ſtill very young, having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved recluſe in the country, and never ſeen any man who had made an impreſſion on her heart, ſeemed exactly the woman I had ſo long deſired. You know my ſyſtem was founded on an ignorance of the world, and of love. I certainly ſhall find means, ſaid I, to allure and attach this young heart; if not by love, at leaſt, by friendſhip ſo powerful, and gratitude ſo tender, that they may well ſupply the want of this paſſion. Firſt appearances will be againſt me; but ſucceeding trials and better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will aſcertain our mutual happineſs. Full of this dear, this flattering idea, I anſwered the King with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, aſſuring him I ſhould eſteem myſelf too happy, might I but obtain the hand of the young Baroneſs of Lichtfield. His Majeſty delayed not to reply that he had obtained the promiſe of the High Chamberlain, and commanded me to return, immediately, and conclude the marriage.</p>
                  <p>"I began my journey, but was obliged to remain at Dantzi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, ill of a violent fever, which brought me to the brink of the grave; while you, dear Lindorf, were then fulfilling the firſt and moſt ſacred of duties to an expiring parent. It was two months before I was well enough to continue my journey. I arrived at Berlin, and had the diſappointment to find you were not there. I heard alſo,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034126_0150_0FFA91BF5F4EDCB0"/>
with anxiety, that my young bride had paſſed the two months of my illneſs at court. Ah! how many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might theſe two months have thrown in the way of happineſs! How might they have deranged my whole plan! I ſtrove not to conceal my fears from my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, who conſoled me with his uſual goodneſs: He had often, himſelf, obſerved Caroline, and had always found the ſame air of innocence and cheerful ſprightlineſs, which ſhewed the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to be at eaſe. "At leaving her retreat, I gave ſufficien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> intimation," added he, "of what my intentions were purpoſely to keep all our young cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers at a reſpectful diſtance; and, though your bride is an angelic young lady, not one of them have attempted to pay her the eaſt attention, more than politeneſs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and Caroline herſelf, without diſtinguiſhing one man above another, has ſought her own amuſement only." The ſame evening I was introduced to the Baron of Lichtfield, my future father, and, on the morrow, to the lovely Caroline."</p>
                  <p>Here the Count related the manner of his firſt viſit, which we have before circumſtantially deſcribed; the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Caroline, which ſhe could not diſſemble; and confeſſed that, no doubt, it would then have been more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, more delicate, to have abandoned his intents, and that he even had thought ſo to have done; "but," added Walſtein, "it is eaſy to delude one's ſelf. Imagine, my friend, that this very flight, this emotion, ſo natural, ſo open, ſo unrepreſſed, which ought perhaps to have ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, gave me, on the contrary, great pleaſure; and, on full reflection, made me more ardent to obtain her. In them I thought I beheld indubitable proof of that candour, that innocence of early youth, which I had feared leſt her reſidence at court might have tainted. Had ſhe been more artful ſhe would certainly have better concealed this firſt ſenſation of terror, and I inwardly thanked her for flying me thus. The moment I beheld her, the moment ſhe entered, led by her father, her ingenuous open, and beautiful countenance, and the graces that were in every motion, and in all her form, made their full impreſſion. She was exactly the perſon whom, had I the beauties of the world aſſembled, I ſhould alone have ſelected."</p>
                  <p>"If I did not abſolutely believe that I no way contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the ſudden fear and flight of Caroline, it was not the fault of the High Chamberlain. I liſtened, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034126_0151_0FFA90F432198020"/>
with pleaſure, to his proteſtations; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he declared, on his word and honour, ſhe had, that very morning, aſſured him her heart was free, and that ſhe was very willing to be mine. "I have laid no conſtraint on her," ſaid he, and confirmed it with an oath; and to-morrow, if her health permit, ſhe herſelf will "tell you ſo."</p>
                  <p>"Alas? my friend, how readily does the heart believe what it ardently deſires! I departed, almoſt convinced; and the morrow, and the future morrows, confirmed the illuſion. I obſerved the young lady; ſhe appeared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly timid, but ſhewed not the leaſt repugnance.— Our marriage was fixed, by the King, for that day week, and ſhe conſented without aſking any delay; nay, once, when delay was mentioned, ſhe begged it might not take place. (The reader will no doubt here recollect the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the High Chamberlain, and the fears of Caroline for her father's life.) I ſhould have employed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate time in endeavouring to gain her confidence and friendſhip; but, during the few viſits I make, the Baron ſuppoſed etiquette required he ſhould not leave us alone. (Here Walſtein likewiſe miſtook the High Chamberlain's motives.) She ſpoke little; but that little had meaning, and was well timed, and diſcovered a mind that made me more and more enraptured with her, till I imagined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt fortunate of men.</p>
                  <p>"The evening before the ceremony was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I thought, however, I perceived marks of grief on her lovely countenance. Her eyes were red, her heart ſeemed heavy, and one might ſee ſhe endeavoured to ſtifle her feelings. I was much affected at obſerving this, and, ſeizing the opportunity of a moment when we were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved, I, tenderly approaching her, ſaid, "Beauteous Caroline, am I any way the cauſe of grief to you? Is it in my power, by any means, to give you eaſe?" She tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idly, looked down, and was ſilent. At laſt ſhe ſoftly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "An engagement for life will occaſion fears; but I believe you, Sir, to be good and generous, and that hope cheers me: on you, alone, my happineſs will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend."</p>
                  <p>"I knew not how to interpret the manner in which ſhe ſaid this, and was going to reply, but her father came up; ſhe then aſſumed her natural tone and manner, and ſeemed no longer to dread the approaching moment.—
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034126_0152_0FFA91C20ACBFE08"/>
How, then, was it poſſible I ſhould divine her meaning; or preſage the dreadful ſtroke that awaited me?"</p>
                  <p>The Count, then, relating all that had paſſed on the day of the marriage, took from his pocket-book the letter which Caroline had given him, and which has before been read. "Here, my friend," ſaid he, to Lindorf, "take this; read, and ſee the dreadful reverſe; behold the fearful traits of the fallen thunderbolt."</p>
                  <p>Lindorf had occaſion for all his fortitude. With a trembling had, and with vague and abſent eyes, he took and run over lines traced by her he adored, in language moſt affecting, natural and eloquent. He would have ſaid ſomething to the Count, as he returned it, but could not articulate a word. He flung himſelf into the arms of Walſtein, preſſed him to his boſom, and a tear, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ould no longer detain, fell down his cheek.</p>
                  <p>Had the Count had the leaſt ſuſpicion of the truth, this exceſſive emotion might well have given it confirmation; but none he had, for none he ſought; his heart was a ſanctuary too holy for a gueſt ſo vile, and he beheld noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſympathetic ſenſibility, heightened, perhaps, by ſympathy of ſituation.</p>

Some explanation, ſome ſtroke equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicting you may have ſuſtained.—I ſee—I ſee I ought to have been ſilent, ought ſtill to have concealed this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſecret; your own pangs are ſufficient, and I did you injuſtice when I ſuppoſed mine might afford you conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. I perceive, on the contrary, they do but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate—Pardon, pardon, dear Lindorf. This proof of thy friendſhip, this too ſtrong ſenſibility of what my feelings are, penetrate me to the very heart."</p>
                  <p>"O Walſtein, Walſtein," exclaimed Lindorf; and, ſinking under the oppreſſive weight of remorſe, hid his face with both his hands. He was going inſtantly to have diſcovered the real cauſe of this his emotion, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered Caroline, and the oath he had made never to reveal what might, to her, have conſequences ſo fatal; this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>The Count, ſeeing him ſo deeply affected, wiſhed to change the ſubject. His feelings, ever delicate, were

ever averſe to give others pain.—"Come, come, my friend," ſaid he, "let us take a walk in your park, and we will ſpeak on theſe matters another time." Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, they went out together, and the Count diſcourſed on the country and the court he had ſo lately left, and entered into the moſt intereſting and curious diſcuſſions; for his genius, naturally penetrating and obſerving, his rank, and the flattering diſtinctions paid him by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who highly reſpected him, gave him the power and the means of ſeeing and of judging.</p>
                  <p>This converſation, which Walſtein prolonged, and gave all the animation to in his power, purpoſely that Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf might recover himſelf, had the effect intended; he inſenſibly became calm, and afterwards highly delighted. No perſon had the art of captivating the ear and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding like the Count of Walſtein; his mild and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive eloquence, the tone of his voice, which ſpoke to the heart, and his happy choice of words, rendered his converſation inexpreſſibly ſweet and agreeable: great knowledge, without pedantry or ſeeming conſciouſneſs that he poſſeſſed it, happy expreſſions, perſpicuity, and connection in all he ſaid, and that kind of honeſt inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which adapts itſelf to, and draws forth, the powers of others, rendered him, indeed, a moſt inſtructive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. No perſon could be in his company without having learnt ſomething, nor without being exceedingly well ſatisfied with himſelf. Since his marriage, the Count had loſt much of the gaiety of early youth, which even his accident had not before robbed him of; but it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed by a ſtrong imagination, an energetic fire, which appertained to him only, and which could only by hearing him be perfectly conceived. While he ſpoke no auditor remembered his perſon, and, more than once, at Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, it was his fault that the ladies did not entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it. Let us add, now we are on the ſubject, that his perſon, ſo ill-treated, was ſo much improved that Lindorf himſelf was ſurpriſed, and Caroline, who had ſeen him after a two months illneſs, would have been ſtill more ſo, had ſhe beheld him now. His hair, which had come off after the fever, had grown again in abundance, was of a fine colour, and well diſpoſed. The ſcar on his face, greatly filled up, was ſcarcely apparent; he was no longer meagre, but had an appearance of youth and health, very different from the yellow and livid tints his malady had
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034126_0154_0FFA91C5B9837708"/>
left, at the time of his marriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a bit of green ſilk, and a ribband, properly diſpoſed, removed that diſguſt which the loſs of an eye might, at firſt fight, have cauſed; and a little attention to himſelf had conſiderably corrected his habit of ſtooping; ſo that his ſhape ſeemed remarkable only by an eaſy and negligent attitude, much preferable to upright formality. It is true, he ſtill limped, but he was oftener ſeated than walking; hence we may well imagine, that with exceeding fine teeth, and infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in his countenance, the Count of Walſtein, then little above thirty, was not much an object of averſion. Had he been the ſame ſome months ſooner, Caroline would not have fled, her letter would not have been written, nor would this hiſtory have exiſted. Every thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is right; let us return to our two friends.</p>
                  <p>Their walk continued till duſk, and Lindorf, highly pleaſed with the company of his friend, and faſcinated by his converſation, preſently recovered himſelf perfectly. Impatient to know what were the reſolutions of Walſtein reſpecting Caroline, he intreated him to finiſh his hiſtory. "It is finiſhed," anſwered the Count; "things remain juſt as they were. You know me too well, dear Lindorf, to imagine I ſhould refuſe a requeſt made in terms ſo ſtrong, ſo affecting, and even ſo reaſonable, as was that of Caroline. I obtained, but not without ſome trouble, permiſſion for her to return and live at Rindaw, with the friend by whom ſhe had been educated. The King, not very well pleaſed, I ſuppoſe, that a match of his making ſhould have this kind of concluſion, exacted the moſt profound ſecrecy."—</p>
                  <p>"But ought not I to have been an exception?" ſaid Lindorf, ſuddenly interrupting the Count—"Have I not cauſe, my friend, to reproach you for this ſecrecy? What! conceal the moſt intereſting event of your whole life from me!"</p>
                  <p>"I own it was wrong, dear Lindorf, and often have I reproached myſelf; but the King had commanded, and both my duties and obligations have given me the habit of paying the moſt ſcrupulous attention to his orders: yet, had we met, I ſhould certainly have told you; but the fear of a letter miſcarrying, and the conviction that my diſtreſs would have grieved you, were additional mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſecrecy; and, in fact, my friend, by your preſent feelings, I find it is happy you were not acquainted with it ſooner."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:034126_0155_0FFA90FAFA0A0C28"/>Lindorf made no reply, though he felt the exact contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moſt forcibly; but he did not expect what was coming.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my friend," added the Count, ſmiling, "you have youth and ſenſibility, and the Counteſs of Walſtein is an angel; you would have aſked permiſſion to viſit her, nay, I myſelf ſhould have requeſted you ſo to do; you have ſince been in love, but your heart, then, was free, and might have been put to trial ſo ſevere that I cannot but be happy to think you have eſcaped it. I own your ſufferings from love may be the ſame; but what, Lindorf, would have been the exceſs of that wretchedneſs, had the object of that love been the wife of your friend? Nay even Caroline herſelf would have been too much expoſed to danger. I own my dear Lindorf," ſaid Walſtein, tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him on the ſhoulder, "though I love you as a friend, I ſhould fear you as a rival."</p>
                  <p>Poor Lindorf!—Happily it was twilight, and in a dark room; nay, perhaps, Lindorf had choſen this ſituation and hour, purpoſely, to renew the converſation. As ſoon as he could recover his ſpeech, "I hope," ſaid he "Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein does not think, cannot imagine, I ever might be his rival. I hope he will do me the juſtice to believe, that the title of his wife would be pledge ſufficient for my faith."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, if any faith might be kept with youth, grace, wit, and beauty," replied the Count. "But do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſeriouſly, dear Lindorf, which is not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly meant; and which I ſhould not have ſaid, had there really been any danger.—At preſent you are but too much out of the power of love; beſides, you are not likely to ſee the Counteſs; nay, perhaps, even I myſelf."—</p>
                  <p>"You yourſelf!"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Lindorf, I know not how to act. Perhaps the impediments I have found m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>y paſſionate; yet do they unceaſingly aſſault me. I more han ever feel my happineſs depends on living with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, for Caroline, and by Caroline to be beloved, as much as a man like me may be beloved; yet never had I leſs hope of attaining theſe my ſo ardent deſires."</p>
                  <p>Lindorf liſtened with downcaſt eyes. "She ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at Rindaw," added the Count, "which, ſince our ſeparation, ſhe has never left; there living in a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found

retreat, unſeeing and unſeen, and debarred of all the pleaſures ſhe has every right to enjoy, and which her ſhort ſtay at court may, moſt probably, have taught her to regret. Indeed, I have been told ſhe ſeemed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fond of dancing; yet, might it be believed, all theſe pleaſures, theſe wiſhes ſo natural at ſixteen, have been leſs powerful with her than the dreadful antipathy ſhe has conceived to me! This has given her force and fortitude incredible, and Caroline, with pleaſure, buries her youth and her charms in ſolitude, to avoid living with a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhe hates!"</p>
                  <p>The generous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the philoſophic, the capacious heart of Walſtein himſelf, ſcarcely, could contain its ſorrows. While thus he ſpoke the deep and lengthened ſigh heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his boſom, and ſilently eſcaped, while the tear was with difficulty detained and repelled.</p>
                  <p>"Have you heard of her ſince your return?" ſaid Lindorf, in a low voice. "Are you certain ſhe perſiſts in this unjuſt ſeparation?"</p>
                  <p>"Too certain," replied the Count, ſeeking among the papers of his pocket-book. "Here is a letter from her to her father; he has lately received, and ſent it incloſed to me. You there will find ſhe declares her determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to continue at Rindaw, and <hi>that her heart and her reaſon ſtill revolt at the ties ſhe has formed.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Lindorf took the letter, read it as be had read the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding one; but remarked the date, ſaw it had been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the very day on which he wrote the manuſcript, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bitterneſs of ſpirit, and gave it back.</p>
                  <p>"The High Chamberlain," continued the Count, "has ſaid, in his letter, that he had written ſuch an anſwer as became him. The phraſe made me tremble; for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, no doubt, was harſh and deſpotic. Caroline, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at this inſtant, drowned in tears, accuſes me anew of tyranny, and her hatred increaſes. My only happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is, that this her hatred is not cauſed by a paſſion for any other man.—Oh, Lindorf! ſpeak, aid, guide me; tell me how I ought to act in a ſituation ſo delicate; from you I hope ſalutary advice."—"Advice," ſaid Lindorf, heſitating; "Walſtein ought to take advice only of his own heart."—"I underſtand thee, my friend," ſaid the Count, "and my heart, already, has dictated what it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me to do."</p>
                  <p>What this was we ſhall know hereafter; at preſent,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034126_0157_0FFA90FDA6553798"/>
leave we Lindorf to breathe, who had ſufficiently ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during this painful converſation; leave we the Count to recover from the fatigues of his journey, and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Caroline.</p>
                  <p>The terrible anſwer of her father ſhe had received. Not only did he permit, but he commanded her to inform the Canoneſs of her marriage; and prepare, immediately, to quit her and return to inhabit Walſtein houſe. "Too long," ſaid he, "has this obliging huſband allowed you to indulge a whim which his abſence only could make me tolerate; 'tis time it ſhould end. The Count is come back, and does not chuſe to be deprived of his wife; he claims his rights, and, for my part, be certain you ſhall for ever remain deprived of thoſe you have to my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and likewiſe to my wealth, if you make the leaſt difficulty about returning. Expect no one to ſupport you: I ſpeak in the name of a King, a Huſband, and a Father equally angered by your long and obſtinate diſobedience."</p>
                  <p>This was not true; the High Chamberlain acted on his own authority, and had neither received the command or the advice of any perſon for this fulminating letter; but he wiſhed to try if he might not obtain from terror, an effect which kindneſs, reaſon and retirement had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. He was, beſide, outrageous at this unforeſeen perſeverance of his daughter. A witneſs of the honours the Count received at returning from his embaſſy of the friendſhip the King had ſo openly teſtified for him, and of the high and unrivalled favour he enjoyed, he impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently burned to proclaim Walſtein his ſon, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate his glory. It was during a ſit of this counteracted paſſion that he had written to his daughter; but Caroline, not ſuſpecting it was poſſible to alter or diſguiſe the truth, underſtood all he wrote litterally: the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r of the King afflicted, and that of her ſpouſe, eſpecially, becauſe ſhe ſaw not the generous Walſtein, whom the manuſcript and letters of Lindorf had ſhewn her in this tyranny; and whom, from being obliged to admire, ſhe began a little to love. But this ſenſation gave place to fear and diſlike, the moment ſhe thought it poſſible he ſhould abuſe his power.</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" ſaid ſhe, while again ſhe read his letters to Lindorf, and opened the box to look at his picture, which ſhe as ſuddenly ſhut again in diſpleaſure, "alas! his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is changed as much as his perſon. If he be already
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034126_0158_0FFA91CB13EB22E8"/>
ſo much irritated at this my reſiſtance, what will he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when he ſhall learn the fatal ſecret of my heart, and that it has yielded wholly to his friend? Of this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long remain ignorant, nor can he but know I love when he ſhall be told I am acquainted with Lindorf."</p>
                  <p>Deſpair redoubled at the thought. The ſuppoſition of living with a huſband already prejudiced againſt her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps jealous, and undoubtedly deſpotic, ſince he had commanded her to return, was revolting. She no longer felt herſelf obliged to his condeſcenſion for ſuffering her to depart, and conſenting that ſhe ſhould remain at Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw all the time he was abſent; "He was no doubt glad I might there remain ſhut up while he was at Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; and proves, but too incontrovertibly, delicacy and mild complaiſance were not his motives.—Ah! Lindorf, friendſhip deceives you; the Count of Walſtein poſſeſſes not thoſe virtues you imagine."</p>
                  <p>To all this anguiſh was added that of having to relate her ſtory to the Canoneſs. As often as ſhe endeavoured to ſpeak expreſſion expired on her lips; never could ſhe determine ſo to afflict that tender and unfortunate friend, ſo at once to excite her anger and her grief, by informing her of the ſecret ſhe ſo long had kept from her, and of the approaching departure of her dear pupil. The loſs of her ſight had rendered the company of Caroline her ſole conſolation; and often did ſhe repeat that the moment ſhe was deprived of that would be the moment of her death; wherefore the idea of being obliged to quit her, added in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of pangs to the affectionate Caroline; nor could ſhe reſolve to plunge the poignard to her heart by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this dreadful ſeparation, though ſhe thought it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable. Yet did ſhe hope it might for a time, be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Her fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ad fixed no day; he only had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to hold herſelf ready againſt he ſhould come to take her away; accompanied, no doubt, by Walſtein, her formidable huſband.</p>
                  <p>To them ſhe left the office of informing the Canoneſs, and daily waited their coming, in trances of deſpair; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other hope but that of dying in the arms of her dear Mamma, with grief of being thus torn from her. In this inquietude, this continual agitation was ſhe, which conſiderably affected her health, when ſhe one day recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a letter. The hand writing and the arms on the ſeal were inſtantly recollected, and cauſed an emotion, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034126_0159_0FFA90FF49BAB518"/>
of the heart, which ſcarcely can be imagined. It was from the Count himſelf. She trembled as ſhe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; and was near fainting when ſhe ſaw at the top, it was dated from the caſtle of Ronebourg, the manſion of Lindorf.—"Merciful God! He is with Lindorf!"— Caroline was obliged to pauſe awhile, and collect all her fortitude, ere ſhe could read what follows.</p>

                  <p>The letter was ended; but what were the ſenſations of Caroline! Surpriſe, admiration, remorſe, affection? Who can anſwer? All! all mingled and together confounded. She herſelf knew not what! Long ſhe remained motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, her eyes rivetted on that paper which had ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reverſed all her opinions, and the contents of which were ſo unexpected. Recovering from this kind of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, her firſt impulſe was to riſe, open her bureau, aſſemble all the papers Lindorf had left, run to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her dear Mamma, and there bring her acquainted with this wonderful man! There inform her of the ties by which they were united, and ſeek, in her friendſhip, that aid of which her heart at preſent ſtood ſo much in need! This huſband who ſo lately had been an object of ſuch dread, aſſumed a form ſo wholly different, diſplayed a mind ſo congenial with her own, that ſhe now could gladly have claſped him to her boſom. Her fetters, ſo heavy half an hour ago, now ſcarcely fetters ſeemed.— "Ah! Walſtein," ſaid ſhe, "generous Walſtein; No; thou ſhalt not go; thou ſhalt not make thyſelf my victim!"</p>
                  <p>She ſtopped ſhort, fearing to engage herſelf too far. Her affections were ſtruggling; her mind was ſtill op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but by idea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> leſs afflicting. When ſhe came to her friend ſhe had not the pain ſhe before felt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the mind of the Baroneſs for the ſecret ſhe was about to diſcloſe; though this preparation was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, ſo infinitely far was ſhe from imagining what
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034126_0162_0FFA6044D8FFFA88"/>
ſhe was about to be told.—Caroline, her dear Caroline, ſo long married, and ſhe never to ſuſpect it! This was ſo ſingular an incident, ſo ſurpriſing and ſo little foreſeen, that all the tragedies, comedies, novels, and romances ſhe had ever read, afforded not one more ſtrange, more aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing.</p>
                  <p>After various preparatives, therefore, and many tender careſſes, her pupil, at laſt, explained all theſe ſeeming myſteries in, as well as the reaſons for, her conduct.— When the good Canoneſs had exhauſted her ſurpriſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and reproach; after ſhe had, by turns, been vexed and affected; after ſhe had plentifully wept and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; after ſhe had a thouſand and a thouſand times repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was abominably monſtrous they ſhould be afraid of truſting her with the ſecret, and ſtill more monſtrous that they had ſacrificed her poor girl; Caroline begged for, and obtained, half an hour's ſilent hearing. This ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to recapitulate every circumſtance that had paſſed with Lindorf; this was the moſt painful part of her taſk, but now ſhe was permitted to tell, ſhe was reſolved to have no reſerve, nothing concealed from her friend.</p>
                  <p>"No, dear Mamma," ſaid ſhe, affectionately, "your Caroline will have no more ſecrets for you; ſhe has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered too much already by thoſe ſhe was obliged to keep. Only for theſe few days have I had the liberty to ſpeak, and but for a few moments the fortitude; for this I am indebted to the Count. Yes, to him do I owe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of daring to open my heart to you, and to have nothing painful to relate. Oh! Madam, when you ſhall know what an angel he is, and how great have been my wrongs, you will not any longer pity your Caroline; ſhe aſks only a little indulgence, and the patience to hear a long recital; for nothing, hereafter, Mamma, will I hide from you; no, nothing, nothing."</p>
                  <p>Caroline kept her word, nor did ſhe ſurpriſe the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by confeſſing her love for Lindorf.—"Alas! I ſaw it well enough," replied the Canoneſs; "and I, poor ſilly woman that I was, congratulated myſelf on the diſcovery. I intended—Yes, yes, I had a great many intentions; had contrived every thing. See what an error your fine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret has led me into! Am not I acquainted with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the paſſions! Amiable people meet, and, becauſe they are amiable, fall in love. We are formed for love, and to love eternally; for firſt impreſſions are never effaced."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:034126_0163_0FFA9104C69B6030"/>"Ah!" exclaimed Caroline, with enthuſiaſm, "I hope, Mamma, you are miſtaken; I hope they ſometimes are effaced; at leaſt it ſhall not be my fault if they are not. No; it ſhall not."—"Fault, poor girl, it would be no fault of thine; but thy ſtruggles will all be in vain.— What! ſurely I know! The more you combat love the more it increaſes. For how is it poſſible to ceaſe to love?"</p>
                  <p>"Very poſſible, Mamma, when love renders us guilty. Oh! dear, dear Madam, you know not, cannot imagine, how guilty we both were; I for offending the beſt of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and Lindorf a friend ſuch as man never had before."</p>
                  <p>Caroline then began to read her manuſcript, and thought ſhe never could have got through it, ſo inceſſantly was ſhe interrupted by the exclamations of the good kind hearted Canoneſs. At firſt ſhe was in raptures with the brave General, who died to ſave the life of his King.— Then too did the young Count intereſt her, but ſtill her dear Lindorf lay at her heart. "How charmingly he writes," ſaid ſhe; "how tender, how feeling his ſtyle! Ah! how ſorry am I! He would have been the huſband for my Caroline." When however they came to Louiſa, her friendſhip ſuffered conſiderable abatement.—"What praiſes does he beſtow on this girl! Is it for a gentleman and a Baron to notice whether or not a village laſs be pretty!"—But when ſhe beheld him ſeriouſly in love with, and deſirous of marrying her, ſhe could contain her anger no longer; nay, ſo great was it that Caroline felt ſomewhat ſorry for having given it birth.—"Speak not a word in his defence," ſaid the Canoneſs. "Oh! how has he deceived me! Love a peaſant's daughter! Intend to marry her! And, after that dare to pay his addreſſes to Miſs Lichtfield! 'Tis abominable! and thou oughteſt to think thyſelf moſt happy for having been married, and not made the ſucceſſor of this his Louiſa. The ſecond love, truly; and the firſt for a poor villager! How have I been deceived in that man; and who hereafter may one confide in!"</p>
                  <p>Caroline, more affected than humbled at having been the object of a ſecond paſſion, made no reply, but ſighed, and again continued to read, as ſoon as the petulant Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs would permit. In proportion as the fickle Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf ſunk in here eſteem, did Walſtein riſe; and he ſoon became her entire hero. His dignity, energy, and noble mind enchanted her. "You are too happy," repeated
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034126_0164_0FFA91D3174B8FE0"/>
ſhe to Caroline, "to be the wife of ſuch a man! What tell you me of his not being handſome? You are wrong; he is as handſome as an Angel, and his ſentiments are the ſentiments of a God!—How did he ſpeak to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive Lindorf? You do not find him in love with a village girl."</p>
                  <p>Yet ſhe knew not what to think, for a while, of his behaviour to Louiſa; but, afterwards, when ſhe came to the dreadful cataſtrophe, when ſhe ſaw the Count wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, disfigured, and heard to what exceſs he had carried his generoſity and friendſhip, ſhe was ſuffocated, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unable to reſtrain herſelf, her tears, or her excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. Lindorf was a monſter and Walſtein a deity, before whom mere mortals ought to fall proſtrate! Her enthuſiaſm increaſed in every line, and his letters to his friend made it aſtoniſhment! She proteſted Heaven had created this man, purpoſely for her Caroline: his ſoul was not of this age, he was a Cyrus, an Oroondates, every thing ſhe had heard, read, or could imagine, of ſublime. "As to your Lindorf, you ſee he merely reſembles the preſent race; you will find he ſtill loves Matilda; nay, that he could love a dozen at a time. To be ſure, as to this Lady, ſhe is a Counteſs, but never will I forgive him his Louiſa. I make no doubt but he will return to Matilda now; but I ſincerely hope ſhe will act towards him as I did to the High Chamberlain, when he came to offer me his hand after the death of thy mother, and that ſhe, like me, with noble pride, will give her refuſal."</p>
                  <p>"I hope not," cried Caroline, and the hope came from the bottom of her heart; even ſhe herſelf was ſurpriſed at it; never before had ſhe truly felt ſo anxious a deſire that Lindorf again might love Matilda, and that to her he might henceforth be no more than a brother. Walſtein, indeed poſſeſſed a ſoul ſo ſuperior, ſo tranſcendant, one to whom it was ſo honourable to be allied, that Caroline actually felt her attachment for Lindorf was not, at this moment, the ſtrongeſt attachment of her heart. It was a moment of enthuſiaſm, we own; and which the ſtrong and ſympathetic feelings of her friend had increaſed; but we may leave the taſk of ſtill increaſing them to the care of this friend.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe came to the laſt letter, which Caroline had received that day; the letter in which the Count ſpoke of her, thought of her, and confirmed her in the hope of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034126_0165_0FFA9108732A1560"/>
for ever living with her dear Caroline; when ſhe heard the phraſe, <hi>You will prevail on your tender and reſpectable friend, whom you wiſh, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d whom, indeed, it is your duty, never to forſake, to come and live with you;</hi> ſhe no longer could moderate her tranſports; ſhe kiſſed Caroline again and again; called her, her dear friend, her lovely Count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs, and while the tears trickled down her cheeks, added, "We muſt not let this angel depart, muſt we, my child? Muſt he go?"—"No certainly," replied Caroline; "I ſhould be the moſt ungrateful of women, were I to give my conſent. Permit me to go and anſwer his letter, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; for the courier returns this evening."</p>
                  <p>Caroline left the good Baroneſs all amazement, all rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at what ſhe had heard; and with matter ſufficient to employ her thoughts without dread of dulneſs from being alone. The very idea of writing to the Count would have petrified Caroline, had it been propoſed the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before; while, at preſent, nothing ſeemed more eaſy; her heart overflowing with gratitude and admiration could not have found an employment more accordant to its feelings; her rapid imagination dictated a thouſand things, and as ſhe entered her apartment, ſhe ran to her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau. The firſt object which preſented itſelf, as ſhe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, was the box containing the miniature picture of her huſband. During her anger againſt him, to which the letter of her father had given birth, ſhe had concealed the box under the manuſcript which ſhe had that day remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; inſtantly ſhe took it up, opened it, and fixed her eyes on thoſe fine features, that countenance ſo noble and ſo mild; and, as ſhe looked, felt a ſenſation which never till then had ſhe known. She forgot how much his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was altered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>magined ſhe really beheld him, and was aſtoniſhed how ſhe could have refuſed her heart to the original of ſuch a portrait. Inſenſibly did ſhe become affected, tears roſe in her eyes, and with great emotion ſhe preſſed the picture to her lips.</p>
                  <p>Thus was ſhe in a moſt excellent diſpoſition to anſwer Walſtein; and, had ſhe written at that moment, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer would have been much more tender than he had dared to hope; but deſirous of confirming theſe her new ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were the more pleaſing becauſe unaccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by remorſe, ſhe would read once more the letter from the Count. Ah! what ungrateful, what cruel idea then ſuddenly entered her mind! It was that he, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034126_0166_0FFA91D5D8E86B48"/>
required this long, and, perhaps, everlaſting ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; he who propoſed it, he who ſeemed to inſiſt on its taking place!—His reaſons were evident; he dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed living with a capricious, unjuſt woman, who ſuffered herſelf to have been ſo eaſily prejudiced; a child, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, wilful, and void of reaſon; for thus, ſaid Caroline, I muſt appear to him; thus have I deſerved to be thought.</p>
                  <p>The phraſe in which he mentioned Lindorf, and which before ſhe had ſcarcely remarked, made alſo an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate impreſſion. "A friend whom an unhappy paſſion obliges to travel. I am determined to go with him."— How might the Count be ignorant of the object of this paſſion? Though Lindorf ſhould not have told him, he muſt, himſelf, have divined it; it was impoſſible to be otherwiſe. Beſide, does he not ſay he is "determined to go with him?"</p>
                  <p>We are alike eaſy to ſuppoſe what moſt we wiſh or moſt we fear ſhould happen, has happened. And now is the active imagination of Caroline buſily labouring to paint every object black; and now, the more ſhe reads that letter, which at firſt appeared ſo tender, ſo flattering, the more is ſhe convinced that the generoſity of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, only, has dictated his expreſſions, and that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſires to live from her. For what probability was there, were not ſuch his motives, that he would thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his country, his employments, the Court, and the favour and friendſhip of his Sovereign? Had he had the leaſt wiſh to live with her, would he not have made the attempt? Would he not firſt have ſeen her and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to find what her preſent thoughts were, before he would make ſo cruel a determination?—"Ah!" ſaid ſhe, mournfully laying down the letter and the picture, "I had a momentary dream of almoſt happineſs, but it is vaniſhed. Happineſs is not for me!—How dearly would he have loved me! But how may I now hope that ſhould ever happen, ſince he wiſhes not to know me, ſince he deſpiſes, nay, perhaps hates me! And, yet, how great is his generoſity, his benevolence! But does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me to abuſe this generoſity, and after having ſinned againſt him ſo unpardonably, muſt I likewiſe baniſh him his country? No, never; I am determined how to act; I will here paſs my life far from him, far from the world; he ſhall be at liberty to remain at court, to benefit his country by his virtues, to make thoſe happy who depend
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034126_0167_0FFA910B2081EE10"/>
on him, and ſhall not himſelf be made miſerable by Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line; he will forget perhaps, that ſhe exiſts.!"</p>
                  <p>In the full perſuaſion that all theſe ſuppoſitions were real, ſhe immediately took pen and paper; and, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, wrote what follows.</p>

                     </gap>ieſced in this ſame kind of ſelf-denial; for while Caroline had been writing, her good Mamma had taken care to ſend for all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and inform them that Caroline was Counteſs of Walſtein, with a ſtrict injunction to call her my Lady, in future. She was punctually obeyed, and, in the ſpace of a few minutes two or three of the maids, and as many footmen, entered, under different pretexts, purpoſely to repeat <hi>my Lady.</hi> "What will <hi>my Lady</hi> pleaſe to have? What are <hi>my Lady's</hi> commands?"</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had <hi>my Lady</hi> ended her letter than ſhe ran to read it to her dear friend. "Yes, Mamma," ſaid ſhe, when ſhe had done reading, "I have taken a firm reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to live and die here, and never love any body but you·" A few months before, this project would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted the tender Canoneſs, but ſhe had now far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent views. Her imagination was at the higheſt pitch of enthuſiaſm in favour of the Count of Walſtein, and his re-union with Caroline, the accompliſhment of which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034126_0169_0FFA910CCCA87698"/>
was how the object of every wiſh. But, as it was a part of her plan to leave the young Counteſs ignorant of the manner in which ſhe was determined to act, ſhe pretended to approve her letter. Nay, perhaps, ſhe took no little pleaſure in retaliation (for there is no age or character that will not indulge revenge which they believe innocent) and, in in her turn, having her ſecret alſo. The letter was, therefore, ſealed and directed to the Count of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, at the Baron of Lindorf's, and ſome have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a ſigh eſcaped Caroline as ſhe wrote the direction, though ſhe, at preſent, proteſts not; and if there did, we may well believe it was the laſt.</p>
                  <p>And now, not only this day, and the next day, and the day after that, but every day, the Count was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent to the imagination of Caroline; and the more ſhe thought of him, the more ſhe delighted to think; all his letters were read, and read again; and ſhe every time thought ſhe diſcovered new proofs, which had not before been remarked, of the ſuperiority of heart and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this excellent man, whom ſhe had known too late ever to be able now to merit. The picture was taken from its box, tied to a ribband, and hung round the neck of Caroline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which it no more quitted. Twenty times a day would ſhe take it from her boſom, gaze on it with tenderneſs, and put it back with a ſigh. But the more ſhe was convinced Walſtein would have made her a moſt happy woman, the more did generoſity, and, perhaps, vanity, applaud the reſolution ſhe had taken, well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded he wiſhed not to live with her. There was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, likewiſe, in her heart, which told her ſhe would much rather have him at Berlin than traverſing diſtant regions with Lindorf. Indeed the ſuppoſition of herſelf being the cauſe of the exile of theſe two friends was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. "Let one, at leaſt," ſaid ſhe, "remain happy in his own country." And thus to ſacrifice, in part, her own felicity to that of the Count was, in part, to expiate her own wrongs, and to obtain her own pardon.</p>
                  <p>While Caroline thus meditated the Canoneſs was not idle. All her reflections tended to find what might be the beſt means of re-uniting the huſband and the wife. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral very natural ones preſented themſelves to her mind, and which might eaſily have been put in execution.— Such, for example, as to have a letter written to the Count, inviting him to come to Rindaw; or to take
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034126_0170_0FFA91DB31792170"/>
Caroline to Berlin, under ſome feigned pretence, and there contrive Walſtein ſhould meet her, or, which might ſtill have been better, to have reaſoned with the young Counteſs, and, by degrees, induced her to a re-union, which ſhe herſelf was too deſirous of long to have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But all this was much too ſimple for the Canoneſs of Rindaw, too trivial for the end of a romance, in which ſhe was quite in raptures to be one of the <hi>dramatis perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae.</hi> Surpriſe! Gratitude! Tears! Faintings! If theſe were wanting the ſcene muſt have been inſipid. Read, therefore, what her prudent head imagined and brought forth.</p>
                  <p>One day (it was within a week after the letter of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline had been ſent) the Canoneſs ſaid ſhe had long had a deſire to viſit her Chapter, and to paſs ſome time there; "A duty," ſays ſhe, "I have too long neglected, and which I wiſh once more to perform before I die. I will therefore ſet off to-morrow morning, and beg, my dear, you will accompany me." Caroline, ſurpriſed at ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected a reſolution, repreſented but in vain that her age, her infirmities, the permiſſion ſhe had long obtained to live at Rindaw, all made this an unneceſſary journey. The Canoneſs was ſo poſitive Caroline could not long contradict her. Beſide that ſhe herſelf really took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in imagining a change of ſcene; it would retard her interview with her father, remove her for a time from a place which brought too many paſt incidents to memory, and thus relieve her melancholy. Another motive was added. Long had ſhe deſired to form an acquaintance with ſome young lady, to whom ſhe could reveal her ſenſations and her thoughts, and who might become her friend. The Baroneſs of Rindaw, it was true, was a friend; but the reſpect ever preſerved for a perſon by whom we have been educated, the great difference of age, and the infirmities which made her in continual dread of her death, and thus of being left in ſolitude, without a friend on earth, all increaſed an ardent deſire to find another, whoſe ſoul and ſentiments were correſpondent to her own, whoſe age was nearly the ſame, and with whom ſhe might freely ſpeak, or to whom ſhe might as freely write all ſhe thought and all ſhe felt.</p>
                  <p>"This," ſaid ſhe, "would give a charm to the retreat in which I am doomed to paſs my life. Ah! had I only ſuch a friend as I can imagine, how ſhould I love her,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034126_0171_0FFCA3D77369BE40"/>
and how would ſhe love me! She ſhould live in my heart, and preſently would I forget othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and ſtronger paſſions; forget that the man to whom, had I known him better, or better known myſelf, this heart would have been wholly devoted, now wiſhes to poſſeſs no place there!"</p>
                  <p>When they ſent her new books from Berlin, in which ſhe found a correſpondence between two friends, ſhe would ſigh, and ſorrowfully ſay, "Poor Caroline, thou haſt no creature, no friend, to whom thou mayeſt write all thou thinkeſt! Thou haſt no letter to receive!" This to Caroline was a real grief, and when the Canoneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the before-mentioned journey, ſhe imagined ſhe might ſurely find, in the cloiſter, young ladies of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome one of whom would be worthy, would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of friendſhip. At length, therefore, ſhe very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly yielded to the project of the good Canoneſs, and prepared for her departure on the morrow.</p>
                  <p>In theſe her ſchemes of future confidence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Caroline did not forget her precious manuſcript and the letters, which were become the daily ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation; and ſtill leſs her dear little picture, which never quitted her boſom, except to be kiſſed, and with which ſhe every day grew more and more enamoured. Till the expected friend was found this picture held the place of one, and was become the confidant of her moſt ſecret thoughts; to this ſhe confeſſed all her regret and grief for having loſt, paſt return, the eſteem and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of its counter-part; while the expreſſive, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive countenance ſeemed, though dumb and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, to hear, underſtand, and anſwer. The happieſt moments ſhe enjoyed were thoſe in which this mute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Early the next morning the Canoneſs, Caroline, and their maids were in the carriage. The former was all cheerfulneſs, ſhe was ready firſt, and ſeemed to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive pleaſure in the journey. As ſhe ſaw nothing, and had, therefore, no outward object to employ her thoughts, ſhe talked much, and wanted a deſcription of every place by which they paſſed. The firſt objects, after leaving the court-yard, were the pavilion, the window where Caroline firſt had ſeen Lindorf, the door through which he firſt had entered, and the road along which he had
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034126_0172_0FFA91DDE011A7E0"/>
paſſed when he departed never to ſee her more. A little further were the turrets of the chateau of Riſberg; they had paſſed the wood in which Caroline had wandered, and came to the park where Lindorf had leaped the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to meet her; the difference between her former and her preſent ſenſations was very great; her heart did not palpitate now, but it felt a painful contraction. Inſtead of fixing her imagination on places that might retrace an obliterated paſſion, or, at leaſt a paſſion remembered only with repentence and ſelf-reproach, ſhe turned her thoughts on the wrongs ſhe had done her huſband, and mournful was the reflection. We may reſt well aſſured, however, Caroline did not lead the communicative Baroneſs to ſpeak on ſuch a ſubject. The journey was performed without any accident, and her friend, infirm as ſhe was, preſerved her cheerfulneſs, though ſhe no longer called her dear Caroline, but dear Counteſs, and that, too, at every inſtant. She often attempted, likewiſe, to ſpeak of the Count; but Caroline, more prudent, and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the preſence of the maids, equally fearing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs might ſay too much or too little, took good care to turn the converſation on other ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>The place to which they were going was ſome days journey from Rindaw. Caroline ſuppoſed they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt there, and was wiſhing to arrive juſt as ſhe ſaw the coachmen drive down an avenue that led to an antique and large chateau, the weather-cocks of which ſhe had perceived at a great diſtance. Caroline was ſurpriſed, and ſo told the Baroneſs, who, with ſignificant ſatisfaction in her countenance, anſwered, "the ſervants had obeyed her orders, for that ſhe meant to call and viſit a friend who lived there." Caroline had not time to aſk queſtions concerning this friend, of whom before ſhe had never heard mention made, for they were already in the court-yard. The Canoneſs called the footman, and bade him inquire if the <hi>Count of Walſtein</hi> was there, and if two ladies <hi>of his acquaintance</hi> might have the pleaſure of ſpeaking with him.</p>
                  <p>Caroline could not believe her ſenſes! "The Count of Walſtein!" echoed ſhe, with a cry ſcarce articulate, "Great God! Mamma! Did I hear you right! Where are we? Whither have you brought me?"</p>
                  <p>"We are at the chateau of Ronebourg," replied the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034126_0173_0FFA910EA5F3A320"/>
Baroneſs, with infinite pleaſure, "and I have brought thee to thy huſband, my dear."</p>
                  <p>Poor Caroline ſcarcely hears the end of the phraſe: ſenſe and feeling have forſaken her, and ſhe droops, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, with her head on the ſhoulder of her imprudent friend! Her maid raiſes and ſuſtains her, informs the Canoneſs of the fearful ſtate into which Caroline is fallen, and calls for ſalts and hartſhorn, which, in their flutter, are not to be found! And now the Canoneſs, in deſpair, repents, too late, of what ſhe has done. Caroline conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues lifeleſs, moves not, breathes not, betrays not the leaſt ſign of exiſtence!</p>
                  <p>All this paſſed in the coach, and in the middle of the court, in the front of the chateau, while the footman was gone to deliver his meſſage, and while the ſervants of the houſe went in ſearch of the Count, who was walking in the park with Lindorf.—Walſtein is found, but cannot imagine who theſe unknown ladies are; for the Canoneſs, always in ſearch of ſurpriſe, forbade the footman to give in her name, and the Count was very far, indeed, from imagining it was her, and his wife, from whom he had ſo lately received a letter. He, therefore, haſtens to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ladies, and, followed by his friend, arrives. The firſt object he beholds is Caroline, ſenſeleſs, with her lace cut, her hair looſe, her boſom bare; they are lifting her out of the coach in which the Baroneſs ſits weeping, and raving, and ſummoning the whole univerſe to the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Caroline, of whoſe death ſhe accuſes herſelf, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to ſurvive her.</p>
                  <p>If a ſpectacle like this well might affect the Count, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable and ſtrange as it muſt be, what effect may it be ſuppoſed to have had on Lindorf, who, the moment he ſaw, knew Caroline? Scarcely could he believe his eyes! Scarcely credit the ſtrong emotions of his heart! "God of wonders!" cried he, as he ran up to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, "can this be?" He could not doubt.</p>
                  <p>The livid paleneſs of Caroline, her cloſed eye-lids, the cries and groans of the Baroneſs perſuaded him ſhe had juſt expired, and he himſelf was preſently almoſt lifeleſs. Walſtein, who comprehended nothing of what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, ſaw Lindorf reel, and juſt had time to catch him in his arms. He revives, and beholding Caroline ſtill the ſame, in all the agonies of deſpair, exclaims, "It is ſhe! It is Caroline! Your Caroline! My Caroline! Her
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034126_0174_0FFA9130A2968DA0"/>
whom I adored, her who now lies breathleſs, and whom I will follow to the grave!"</p>
                  <p>So ſaying he tore himſelf violently from the arms of Walſtein, who ſtood ſpeechleſs and confounded! The exigencies of the moment recovered him from his ſtupor: he made way through the crowd of ſervants, whom the cries of the Baroneſs and the ſtrangeneſs of the ſcene had drawn together, and went to the aſſiſtance of Caroline. Expoſed to the open air, ſhe had begun a little to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; her half-opened eyes endeavoured to move, and her woman, ſeated on the ground, ſupported her till an arm chair was brought, in which ſhe might be placed, and carried more conveniently. The poor diſtracted Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtill in the carriage, paid dear for her imprudence; ſhe wept, exclaimed, called for the Count, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeaſable till they told her he was there, and that Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line was recovering.</p>
                  <p>Too true it was. Walſtein was there; but Walſtein knew not whether all he beheld was or was not a dream. Caroline at Ronebourg, and brought thither with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence! For wherefore ſhould ſhe, elſe, be expiring at her arrival? Lindorf in deſpair, and fled, uttering words of dreadful import, that ſtill reſounded in the ears of Walſtein. <hi>It is ſhe! It is Caroline! Your Caroline! My Caroline! Her whom I adored!</hi> —Ay? Caroline?— Was it Caroline, whom Lindorf loved; and by whom he was again beloved? The Count endeavoured to doubt, to perſuade himſelf that his friend, diſtracted by grief, by the melancholy turn of his mind, had been deceived; but the Count could not ſo elude his fears.</p>
                  <p>Not the change which a year had made in the perſon of Caroline, nor that her preſent illneſs cauſed, could make Walſtein miſtake her. He ſilently fixed his eyes on her for ſome momen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, then, kneeling at her feet, caught her hands, and preſſed them with ardour to his lips. The eyes of Caroline moved, but not as they were wont. They had no intelligence; ſhe knew not where ſhe was, or whom that man might be ſhe beheld proſtrate before her. Unable to articulate a word, ſhe gently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew her hands, joined them together, leaned her face upon them, and ſhed a torrent of tears. The Count, ſtill kneeling by her, endeavoured to calm and convince her ſhe had nothing to dread, but was diſturbed by the repeated cries of the Canoneſs, who inceſſantly called for
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034126_0175_0FFA91125C3ECA08"/>
him, as ſhe ſat in her coach, and who began to be very impatient that he did not come. At laſt ſhe called ſo loud that Walſtein was obliged to leave Caroline and go to her. He went with the hope of learning what might be the meaning of this ſtrange adventure; but the poor lady was ſo affected, ſo agitated, and ſaid ſo many things at once that to underſtand any one of them was impoſſible. The Count, beſide, was himſelf in a reverie. When he came up to the Canoneſs he perceived ſhe was blind, and this was a new incident of information; he inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the blind relation of whom Lindorf had ſpoken, in his letter to Peterſburg, and to whom the lady he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved devoted all her cares. Could he have doubted of the fearful meaning of Lindorf's late exclamations, this would have removed his doubts. Alas! they were certainties.</p>
                  <p>The Count helped the Baroneſs out of her carriage, and led her to Caroline, whom they had now ſeated in a chair; nor could ſhe be convinced ſhe was ſtill alive till the dear girl ſaid, with a feeble voice and a gentle mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of reproach, "Ah! my dear Mamma, what have you done?" By little and little Caroline recovered her ſenſes, but ſhe was ſtill ſo weak, and ſo ill, as to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unable to walk; the Count, therefore, ordered them to bear her gently into the houſe, and, giving his arm to the Baroneſs, followed.</p>
                  <p>They concluded it was proper to put Caroline to bed; as ſhe herſelf, indeed, deſired they would. The Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was determined to remain with her, and Walſtein, after having kiſſed her hand, which ſhe no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, retired from her apartment and haſtened into that of Lindorf, concerning whom he was become very anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious. He entered, but no Lindorf was there; as he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the room, however, he ſaw a letter, lying ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, directed to himſelf. He took it, opened it with emotion, and read what follows, which had been traced by a trembling hand, expreſſive of the great diſorder of the writer.</p>

He had told Varner to follow, with ſuch baggage as was neceſſary, and meet him at a place which he himſelf would take care to indicate; recommended
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034126_0177_0FFA91160DF1D300"/>
every poſſible attention and obedience to the commands of the Count, and his gueſts, and inſtantly diſappeared, forbidding him to follow.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Count found there were no hopes of overtaking him, at preſent, he made Varner promiſe to inform him the firſt intelligence he ſhould receive, where his maſter was; then again peruſed the letter, which brought tears into his eyes. Walſtein now became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to learn what could have been the motive of this ſtrange viſit, and ſent to know if he might ſpeak with the Canoneſs in a private apartment. She came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, with the meſſenger, being as impatient to ſpeak as the Count was to hear. After informing him the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs was fallen aſleep, "though," ſaid ſhe, "the cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe has not happened exactly as I could have wiſhed, are not you exceedingly obliged to me, Sir, for having brought you Lady Walſtein?"</p>

                  <p>"This is very ſtrange; unaccountably ſtrange," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Count; "I imagined her fainting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her tears, what ſhe ſaid to you with a tone of reproach, were all"—</p>
                  <p>"All amazement, at finding herſelf ſo unexpectedly here—The agitation of a firſt meeting—I know not what —young perſons are ſo timid.

And, if ever your hiſtory ſhould be written, this will be the moſt intereſting event in your whole life.</p>
                  <p>The Count, who knew not the romantic turn of the Canoneſs, aſtoniſhed at ſo ſtrange a remark, gazed with wonder, requeſted an explanation, and learnt, at laſt, that, though Caroline was not brought to Ronebourg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her will, it was without her knowledge; which proceeding he was very far from approving, and as frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told the Canoneſs ſo, who excuſed herſelf by her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire to ſee them united, and the fear of not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſo well by any other means. "Yet," ſaid ſhe,

"had I ſuppoſed—But, I confeſs, I had totally forgotten all that."</p>
                  <p>"What! What!" replied the Count.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, nothing—Nothing, nothing—Something I muſt not mention; though it was certainly the cauſe of that fearful emotion and fainting—But, a propos, my Lord: I underſtand we are here at the houſe of the Baron of Lindorf—that this ſeat is his—'Tis true, I ought to have known it; but I miſtook, or forgot, for my memory is become ſo weak lately—I believed, though I know not why, that Ronebourg belonged to you."</p>
                  <p>"No, Madam; but it is the ſame thing; I am at home, here; the Baron of Lindorf is my moſt intimate friend, and begged me, in his abſence, to command his houſe and ſervants."</p>
                  <p>"In his abſence! What, is he abſent then?" "He is," anſwered the Count, who, could he have ſmiled, have ſmiled he muſt, at the prudent Canoneſs, who, with ſuch ſimple cunning, told all ſhe knew.</p>

                  <p>"You mean to ſay, Madam, the Baron has avoided the ceremony of receiving ſtrangers; he not having the pleaſure of being acquainted with you?"</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding ſhe wiſhed to do it, the Canoneſs could not tell a falſehood with that intrepidity the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeemed to require.—"No—Yes—That is—we are not wholly unacquainted; he happened to be one of our country neighbours; his eſtate of Riſberg joins to mine, at Rindaw and we uſed to ſee him every day: nay, indeed, he is, as I may ſay, one of our friends; though I think him a little given to change; a—a rover."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein, who thought the Baroneſs and this conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation very ſingular, was going to defend Lindorf, when repeated cries from Caroline's bed-chamber alarmed him.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034126_0179_0FFA9117C2799F08"/>
ſhe had juſt awaken in a burning and delirious fever; and every ſymptom indicated the beginning of a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and dangerous illneſs. Her maid, whom ſhe did not know, unable to hold her, was obliged to call for help. The Count, deeply affected, went up to her bed, out of which ſhe abſolutely would get. "Let them take me back to Rindaw," ſaid ſhe; "I won't ſee him, he will kill me; I will depart alone on foot; I will fly, to avoid him, to the world's end."</p>
                  <p>Her imagination, at other moments, full of Lindorf, made her take the Count for him; and, puſhing him from her, ſhe conjured him to fly; reproaching him for being the cauſe of all her miſery. Then, again thinking ſhe ſpoke to the Count, ſhe exclaimed, with the utmoſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, "Oh thou whom, for my happineſs, too late I have known, thou whom I love, whom I ſhall forever love, wherefore doſt thou fly me? But I will follow, will ſupplicate, will force thee to ſee and hear me."</p>
                  <p>Knowing only ſo much as Walſtein at preſent knew, it was impoſſible he could ſuppoſe Caroline thought of him while ſhe ſpoke laſt, or of Lindorf in what ſhe had ſaid before. But, afflicted as he was for himſelf, he was ſtill more ſo for Caroline. He would not leave her, but remained in her chamber all night, after having, with much intreaty, prevailed on the Canoneſs to ſleep in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apartment. Caroline continued in the ſame agitation and delirium. The Count, mean time, ſent to the neareſt town for the beſt phyſician the place could afford; and, likewiſe, ſent a courier, poſt, to Berlin, for the firſt men in the profeſſion. He alſo thought it prudent to ſend for the High Chamberlain; but, not wiſhing to alarm him, he only ſaid, in his letter, he intreated him to come immediately, to Ronebourg, on an affair of the utmoſt importance.</p>
                  <p>The Count never quitted his poſt, by the bedſide of Caroline, except when obliged, and then reluctant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. At day-break the country phyſician arrived, and Walſtein was greatly alarmed at perceiving his ignorance. He pronounced it to be the ſmall-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> were paſſed in momentary dread of ſeeing her he adores expire. Her ſickneſs, by increaſing his feelings, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his attachment: the aſſiduous and tender cares he beſtowed on her, the patience and gentleneſs ſhe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at thoſe intervals when ſhe was not delirious, the character her maids gave her, and the real grief they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, certain proofs how deſervedly ſhe was beloved, all ſtrengthened his affection. To the dread of loſing her was added the reproach of being himſelf the cauſe of her ſufferings. He was convinced the ſtratagem made uſe of to bring her thither, which was equivalent to violence, her dread of living with him, her paſſion for Lindorf and the natural ſtruggles of love and duty, had thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered and might rob her of life. In one of theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oments of grief, affection, and remorſe, proſtrate at her bedſide, he took a ſolemn oath, ſhould heaven be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to preſerve her from the grave, be his ſufferings what they might, to make her happy.—"God of mercies!" ſaid he, with hands upraiſed to heaven, "Save this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate victim of tyranny and love! Deign to hear the vow I make of reſigning her to the man who poſſeſſes her heart!"</p>
                  <p>Caroline was incapable of underſtanding, or, perhaps, ſhe would have intreated him to have been leſs ready to yield her to another; but ſhe had lain totally ſenſeleſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt four-and-twenty hours. Happily, the King's firſt phyſician arrived that night. He did not diſſemble the extreme danger in which he found the patient, and his whole dependence was on her youth. He adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, however, ſuch aſſiſtance as had been too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, and ſaid if ſhe outlived the ninth and thirteenth days he then ſhould have ſome hope; but till they were paſt could not pretend to give any.</p>
                  <p>The Count, though a prey to the moſt ſevere affliction, was obliged to diſſemble his feelings; for the Canoneſs ſuffered ſo fearfully that her inquietudes were not the leaſt of his diſtreſſes. The loſs of her ſight made it eaſy for thoſe who had no reſpect for truth to impoſe upon her; but not for Walſtein. Her queſtions were inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034126_0181_0FFA911A74A274F0"/>
and ſhe was never ſatisfied unleſs ſhe heard the moſt exact and circumſtantial account. After he had been carefully attending on Caroline, and, overcome with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, had retired to take a little repoſe, ſhe never failed either to come to him, or ſend to beg he would come to her. When he was abſent it was with the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they could keep her from Caroline, whom ſhe might diſturb but could not aid; the Count was the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who had any power over her, and ſhe was never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied unleſs he was converſing with her. Thus was Walſtein often torn from the pillow of Caroline, though he was wretched if he truſted her but for a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then it was he felt a real gratitude towards the Canoneſs for having brought her; for he ſuppoſed her preſent illneſs had a more remote cauſe than the agitation her arrival had occaſioned; this might have haſtened its criſis, but he attributed it wholly to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Lindorf and her affliction at the ſuppoſed impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of union. In this conjecture every circumſtance confirmed him, and her determination to paſs her whole life in retirement was not the leaſt. Again and again did he read the letter he had received from her, and in it could perceive nothing but a continued ſacrifice of love to duty. <hi>Solitude has nothing fearful for my imagination; on the contrary, it is the boundary of my wiſhes.</hi>—"No, dear Caroline!" ſaid he, "thou deceiveſt thyſelf; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther virtue deceives thee.

                  <p>Neither did he doubt but that her tender exclamation, <hi>Alas!

Oh! no; too well I know the contrary.

Scarcely were they alone a minute before they mutually began to reproach each other.

                  <p>It is poſſible that, at ſome moments, ſuch a ſcene might have been amuſing; but not with Walſtein's preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind. He endeavoured to put an end to it, and re-eſtabliſh harmony, which he could no otherwiſe effect but by recalling to mind their former paſſion, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of which the poor Canoneſs melted. The High Chamberlain was not quite ſo ſoft; but the Count having reminded him of the obligations he had, and <hi>might</hi> ſtill have, to his friend, he was, almoſt immediately, ſo moved that he could not expreſs his feelings; he went up to his dear Baroneſs, and begged her to excuſe his warmth of temper; was ſorry, very ſorry, exceedingly ſorry; while ſhe with dignity and affection gave him her hand to kiſs, telling him he abuſed the power he had over her. After the High Chamberlain had devoutly paid his reſpects to this once fair hand, peace was reſtored, and the Count returned to his beloved patient.</p>
                  <p>Where is the reader who is not by this time acquainted with the character of Walſtein? Who will not eaſily imagine, although it be not circumſtantially related, the deep affliction of theſe his days of incertitude and dread? The more he thought the greater were his terrors; and, during the latter part of this ſevere illneſs, he could not leave his Caroline, day nor night; he never quitted his arm chair, which was placed by her bedſide; and if, at ſome moments, over-wearied nature exacted a ſhort and painful ſleep, he ſoon waked and ſtarted, with the mortal dread of no more finding her who was now become the only object of his thoughts. The thirteenth day at length arrived, which the phyſician declared was to be the cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Count wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſingly to ſupport its horror; he neither told the High Chamberlain nor the Baroneſs that, perhaps, at midnight, their friend and daughter would be no more. He deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſit up alone with her; and oh! how ardent were the prayers he ſent up to Heaven for her relief! With what agonizing affection did he preſs that feeble and burning hand to his lips and to his heart! How often did the tears ſwim in his eyes while fixed on thoſe of Caroline, to which the fever ſtill gave motion, and which, perhaps, ere morning would cloſe eternally!</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:034126_0184_0FFA90DC651489D8"/>This laſt criſis was ſo violent that the alarmed phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſaid nothingleſs than a miracle could make her live over the day. The diſtracted Count, ſunk in grief, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able longer to ſuſtain the ſight, or to tear himſelf from the dying Caroline, had ſtill the farther pang of being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to prepare the father and the friend for the fearful cataſtrophe. He had ſo continually endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, and inſpire hope, that, far from ſuſpecting, they were lulled into a kind of ſecurity which muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the information tenfold horrid. The Count had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to inform them how Caroline was, but, terrified himſelf at what he had to communicate, he ſtopped, for ſome moments, in the anti-chamber, to calm his own mind and collect all his fortitude. "Ah," thought he, "if this unfortunate father feels, as I do, all the weight of remorſe; if to the recollection of having ſacrificed his daughter her death be added, how may he ſupport his ſorrow?—Oh! my Caroline, thy executioners weep, and thou dieſt! Yet wilt thou not die unrevenged; for, ſure, the torments I ſuffer are far worſe than death."</p>
                  <p>While he was thus heſitating, the valet de chambre of Lindorf, ſeeing him, came up haſtily, and told him he wiſhed to ſpeak to him; he had received a letter from his maſter, who was waiting for him at Hamburg, whence he was to embark for England. Varner intended to ſet off that very night, and only waited the commands of the Count. Inſtead of giving an anſwer, Walſtein ſtood ſilent; abſorbed in thoughs little ſhort of diſtraction: at length, ſuddenly ſtarting, he bade him wait, and went into his cloſet, without himſelf knowing what he intended.</p>
                  <p>"Write to Lindorf! And at a moment like this! What ſhall I ſay to him? Shall I take the dagger, reeking from my own heart, and plunge it into my friend's? Shall I deſire him to return, only that I may behold him expire on the tomb of her he adores? Yet," ſaid he, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous recollection, "might not Caroline, might not love work a miracle, which, perhaps, is reſerved for love alone?—Were there but time!—If Lindorf were but preſent!—God of Heaven! who heareſt my prayer, grant yet a few days, and Caroline, perhaps, may be reſtored!"</p>

                  <p>"Merciful providence!" ſaid the Count, as he ended, "muſt every ſenſation that ought to add to my felicity become my torment!"—He deferred anſwering his ſiſter's letter, and reflecting on her ſituation, till he could find a more tranquil moment, if ſuch he might ever find, and once more entered the chamber of Caroline, where all former ideas were effaced at the ſight of what he beheld. The Canoneſs, out of patience that the Count returned not, had obliged them to lead her into the ſick chamber, where, unable to ſee, ſhe had ſeated herſelf at the ſide of Caroline, had taken one of her hands, and was entreating and conjuring her to give ſome ſign of life and recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Caroline, feeble, inanimate, and apparently ſurrounded by the ſhades of death, anſwered not, made not the leaſt motion, while her unhappy friend yielded to all the dreadful ſenſations of horror and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide of the bed ſtood their two maids, weeping, and a little farther, the High Chamberlain, ſunk ſilent in an arm chair, with his hands ſpread over his face, and overwhelmed with grief. For the firſt time in his life, he felt that riches and honours were not ſufficient to make his child happy. The phyſician, in equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, ſat by his ſide, a mournful ſpectator of this ſcene of ſorrow, and without apparent hope of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling Caroline to life.</p>
                  <p>The ſight, as the Count entered, the different attitudes and behaviour at the different perſons, made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all was over, and that the moſt angelic of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was no more. All fortitude and philoſophy no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Count was going to quit the room in all the phrenſy of remorſe and deſpair, which might, perhaps, have induced him to make ſome raſh attempt upon his own life, had he not been intercepted by the High Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain and the phyſician. The latter aſſured him the

Counteſs was not dead, and that he even had not loſt in hope. "She lies at preſent," ſaid he, "in a kind of trance, the natural conſequence of the fearful ſtruggle ſhe juſt has had, and ſhe will paſs from this ſtate into a ſound ſleep, which will decide her fate; for, if ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakes, I can then pronounce her recovery more than probable; but, conſidering her preſent weakneſs, I muſt own I think her awaking very uncertain."</p>
                  <p>"Oh God of benevolence!" exclaimed the Count, looking with fervour up to heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n, and afterwards claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the phyſician's hands, "is it poſſible, Sir! is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible!—May ſhe ſtill live? Can my fortune, can my life ſuffice?"—</p>
                  <p>"At preſent, Sir, my art is uſeleſs, and every other human aid; to nature we muſt leave her, and to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which muſt have been naturally good, or ſhe would have been dead before this. The cares of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and the huſband may be more efficacious than mine; to thoſe we will commit her. Come, Sir," ſaid the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, turning to the High Chamberlain, "go to your apartment, and ſet your ſon an example of fortitude."</p>
                  <p>They were about to quit the room when another ſtrange ſcene of affliction and death drew their attention. Well might they have been ſurpriſed at the ſilence of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs, while all this paſſed; but, alas! the poor lady, whether her powers were too weak to reſiſt the terrors of the moment, or whether heaven had ordained that to be the period of her life and infirmities, a ſudden ſtroke of apoplexy had, unpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To behold, in the ſhort ſpace of ten minutes, his daughter expiring, her huſband ready to attempt his own life, and his friend actually give up the ghoſt, might well terrify an old man who was tenacious of life in proportion to his attachment to his great wealth and high dignities.

                  <p>Walſtein, rouſed by accumulating terror to recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaw the illneſs of the High Chamberlain was not dangerous, yet recommended him to the phyſician's care, left the corps of the Canoneſs to that of her women, and, after having ſhed tears of ſincere affection to the memory of her who had educated Caroline, and whoſe friendſhip for her had apparently brought her to the grave, again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the apartment of his dying lady.

As he ſat beſide her bed, the tears fell from his eyes, unperceived by himſelf; inceſſantly did he place the downy feather on her lips to find whether ſhe ſtill reſpired; and ſo doubtful was it that he raiſed his hands to heaven, and inſtinctively exclaim, "Why, O! why, cannot I die alſo!"

The rays of morning were the meſſengers of terror, the fearful moment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and the ſentence of the phyſician was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually preſent to his imagination; inceſſantly ſounding in his ear, <hi>If ſhe awake, I can then pronounce her recovery more than probable; but, I muſt own, I think her awaking very uncertain.</hi> This dreadful incertitude was every moment increaſing; for her ſleep, while it was lengthened, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every moment more profound, ſo that, at laſt, he no longer had the leaſt hope.</p>
                  <p>While the Count was ſtanding in this ſtate of dread and deſpair, he heard her reſpiration ſuddenly increaſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and ſaw her breaſt begin to heave; and, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, a deep ſigh, almoſt a groan, eſcaped.—Ah! It is her laſt!—So fears Walſtein. The dreadful moment is arrived! He utters an inarticulate cry, throws himſelf on the bed, and claſps her in his arms, as if to ſnatch her from the graſp of death, or himſelf die with her.</p>
                  <p>But Oh! bleſt ſurpriſe! Oh happineſs unhoped! It is not an inanimate corpſe; it is a living creature! that moves and endeavours to aid itſelf!

Caroline breathes, looks around, tries to recollect herſelf, and fixes her attention on the Count, with ſomewhat of aſtoniſhment, but without the leaſt indication of fear; no, it was with a gentle ſmile, ſuch as the awakened infant gives its affectionate mother. She ſtretches out one hand, which he with rapture receives! Oh! who may paint his feelings!—In a moment did he paſs from the pinnacle of diſtraction to the heaven of

bliſs! Bliſs he could ſcarcely conceive real! His whole ſoul in his eyes, that, voracious, devour every motion of Caroline; he preſſes his hand to her heart, kneels at her ſide, and exclaims, again and again, in a delirium of joy, "<hi>If ſhe awake, her recovery is more than probable</hi>—Oh!

                  <p>He was going to ring the bell, but Caroline ſtopped him by laying her hand on his arm.—"Only one word, Sir, and I have done. I promiſe to be docile, but I muſt aſk you—Where is my dear mamma, my friend? Where is the Canoneſs? Is ſhe well?—How unhappy muſt ſhe have been on my account!—And my father? I have ſome confuſed recollection of having ſeen him, ſomewhere, not long ſince."</p>
                  <p>"He is here; and you will ſee him again, as ſoon as it is proper."</p>
                  <p>"But my dear mamma?"</p>
                  <p>"She has left us."</p>
                  <p>"Then ſhe is at Rindaw, I hope?"</p>
                  <p>Infinitely as Walſtein deteſted a falſehood, yet, this was no moment to heſitate; the life of Caroline was at ſtake. "Yes," ſaid he, ſeizing the clue ſhe had given, "ſhe is at Rindaw, undoubtedly; have no fear for her; ſhe is well, ſhe is happy, ſhe is ignorant of your preſent danger.—But, dear Caroline, let me conjure you to think only of your own recovery, and how much the ſafety of all your friends depends on that; I am ſure this, to you, will be a ſufficient motive."</p>
                  <p>He rang, a ſervant came; he gave orders to call the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034126_0192_0FFA90E5C68F0038"/>
phyſician, drew the curtains cloſe, ſat down by the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and, notwithſtanding the exceſs of his joy, was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. And now, even at this happy moment, did the tender and preventive Walſtein begin to revolve how he might beſt execute the melancholy taſk of preparing Caroline for the death of her friend, ſo as to give her the leaſt affliction poſſible. The thing firſt and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary was to conceal it from her till ſhe had fully recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſtrength. While he was thus reflecting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician entered and confirmed all his hopes. The pulſe, though very feeble, was excellent; every unfavourable ſymptom had diſappeared, and recovery was certain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided proper care was taken. This muſt be inceſſant; but could this be wanting while Walſtein was preſent?</p>
                  <p>"Caroline is ſo good, ſo generous," ſaid the Count, that ſhe herſelf, I am ſure, will be wholly obedient to your injunctions. Duty, friendſhip, love, all are ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; certain of being favourably heard by her ſympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and affectionate heart."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," ſaid Caroline, ſoftly, do not fear, I will do every thing I am bid."—A tear that ſtarted to her eye proved how much ſhe was affected by the tenderneſs of Walſtein, and ſhe was going to have added more had not the phyſician impoſed ſilence. The Count and he went out together, and the phyſician inſiſted on the abſolute neceſſity of concealing the death of the Canoneſs from Caroline; for the leaſt emotion, he ſaid, muſt indubitably have the moſt fatal effects. The Count ſhuddered at the ſuppoſition, and immediately went with him to the High Chamberlain to conſult the means of concealing this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. A long ſleep, out of which he had juſt awaked, had ſomewhat diſpelled his late fears of death, and the reſurrection of his daughter gave him ſtill higher hopes; eſpecially when he remembered, which he very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly did, ſhe was certainly left the ſole heireſs of her friend. The Count, fearing ſome imprudence on his part, and no way averſe to rid himſelf of a man whoſe cold and ſelfiſh character gave him continual diſguſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade him that etiquette required he ſhould accompany the corpſe of the Baroneſs to Rindaw, and there ſee the laſt duties of humanity performed. This gloomy ceremony was not at all to his taſte, but Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, deſirous of determining him to go, told him that the will of the Baroneſs was, no doubt, in favour of his
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034126_0193_0FFA91D069A339B8"/>
family, and that his own intereſt required him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at Rindaw, where this will muſt be left, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the lands and wealth bequeathed. This was ſo unanſwerable an argument to the High Chamberlain, that he never attempted to make another objection; he only required to ſee Lady Walſtein, for thus he always called Caroline, before his departure. They therefore conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to tell her that the High Chamberlain was going to Rindaw, to inform the Baroneſs of her recovery; and, when he was there, it would be eaſy to prepare Caroline, by degrees, in his letters, for the melancholy news of her friend's death.</p>
                  <p>Her father, therefore, was introduced into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where he told her, after his manner, how happy he was to ſee her ſo well, and to leave her with a huſband to whom, and for whoſe cares and attentions, ſhe could not be too grateful: on which occaſion he informed her of circumſtances ſhe knew not before; and when he told her the Count had neither undreſſed himſelf nor once quitted her chamber for ſeveral ſucceſſive nights, the tears ſwam in Caroline's eyes, and, with tenderneſs and remorſeful recollection, ſhe ſaid, "Oh my Lord! how ſuperior, how noble is your mind! Ah! what would you do for a wife whom"—</p>
                  <p>She durſt not add "<hi>whom you ſhould love,</hi>" and the Count gave a very different interpretation to her break: he added "<hi>who could love you.</hi>" And thus did two hearts, naturally ſo concordant, miſtake each other, and prepare themſelves new vexations, new torments. Every time that Caroline, uneaſy for the health of the Count, conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to take reſt, and proteſted ſhe did not want aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, he, perſuaded ſhe deſired his abſence, imagined that, to a good and feeling heart, the kind attentions of love it could not return, were each a dagger wounding Gratitude: and this painful, this diſtracting thought, would ſometimes make him abruptly leave her, which ſhe, on her part, attributed to indifference. Each, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately in love and convinced they were not beloved, attributed all thoſe actions to generoſity, or to friendſhip, at the utmoſt, which ſprang from a very different ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But let us not anticipate; return we to the High Chamberlain.</p>
                  <p>We have beforetime ſeen he was not ſcrupulous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, concerning telling the whole truth, and nothing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:034126_0194_0FFA90EA1971F638"/>
but the truth, on certain occaſions: he, therefore, ſo well played his part, that his daughter, very unſuſpectingly, a thouſand times thanked him for his kind attention to her dear Mamma, and a thouſand times intreated he would make haſte to Rindaw. And ſo many affecting expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did ſhe uſe, concerning that dear friend, who no longer exiſted, that Walſtein, unable to ſuppreſs his feelings, intreated her to ſpeak no more, but to recollect the ſevere injunctions of the phyſician.</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, I will be ſilent; only tell her, my dear father, that it is for her, for her alone, and to ſee her, once again, Caroline wiſhes to recover. Tell her, alſo, that the moſt generous of men"—</p>
                  <p>He ſtood by her ſide, and interrupted her by gently laying his hand upon her lips.—She was prompted to have given that dear hand a kiſs; nay, the firſt movement was made, nor do we know by what fear ſhe was reſtrained, nor what her feelings preciſely were. We only know a ſlight tremor ſeized her, and that the Count, perceiving it, was far from imagining its true cauſe. He haſtened the High Chamberlain away, and ſaw him get into the poſt-chaiſe with pleaſure. The corpſe of the Canoneſs was to follow by night, and her women, and the ſervants ſhe had brought, to which were added others by the Count, were to eſcort it: Caroline's maid and footman ſtaid at Ronebourg, to attend on their miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>The phyſician, whoſe affairs required he ſhould not long be abſent from Berlin, was deſirous to return; but the Count, however, by his earneſt entreaties, and the liberality of his preſents, prevailed on him to ſtay a few more days, and not to quit his patient, while the moſt diſtant poſſibility of danger or relapſe remained. Nor was this a diſtant period, each new day beſtowed new ſtrength; already ſhe began to ſit up, and to walk acroſs her room, leaning on the arm of the Count. Her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, at length, could no longer be doubted, and the doctor departed for the capital, rewarded, beyond his hopes, for his ſkill and care.</p>
                  <p>And now behold the Count alone, at Ronebourg, with his Caroline.—His Caroline?—Was ſhe his? Alas! he durſt not regard her but as the ſacred pledge, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit of friendſhip. His laſt ſhort letter to Lindorf was recollected; the lover muſt ſoon arrive, and ſhould he ſend for this unfortunate lover only to make him a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034126_0195_0FFA912CB5232E10"/>
of the woman he adored being in poſſeſſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And muſt Caroline, the tender-hearted Caroline, whom the ſtruggles of paſſion had brought to the brink of the grave, muſt ſhe ſee him again, again to loſe him? No; Walſtein never had ſo cruel a thought. More and more determined not to violate the oath he ſo ſolemnly had pronounced, when he beheld her dying, but to break the arbitrary chains that had bound her his, and unite her to Lindorf, he only waited the arrival of the latter to inform them both of his generous intentions, and the happineſs he was preparing for them. Fearing, however, leſt the exceſs of this happineſs might, at preſent, be too much for Caroline, he would not abruptly tell her what he meant to do; neither would he lay that grateful, that affectionate heart, under obligations which would be too oppreſſive; ſtill leſs would he ſuffer her to ſuſpect the pangs his own heart felt in thus renouncing, thus yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to another. "She believes at preſent," ſaid he, "ſhe owes her life to me, and, I know, would willingly ſacrifice that life to my happineſs; but, no dear Caroline, no, never ſuch ſacrifice will I exact; I, I alone wiſh, I alone ought to ſuffer, nor ſhalt thou ever ſuſpect how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely I ſhould be miſerable; never ſhalt thou imagine how ardently I adore; friendſhip only ſhalt thou ſee, even when affection is the ſtrongeſt; and if I, in return, may obtain thine, if I may make thee and Lindorf happy, ſhall I be ſo wretched as I ſuppoſe?—Oh! Caroline, Caroline; yes, ſtrange parodox! I feel I may be wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even while I am virtuous!—To yield thee to another, and not to die, I muſt no more behold, no more have intercourſe with thee!"</p>
                  <p>And according to ſuch ſuppoſitions did Walſtein form a plan of conduct from which he promiſed never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, till the arrival of Lindorf. Not daring to truſt the health of Caroline with any other, and unable, himſelf, to abſtain from the pleaſure of adminiſtering thoſe aids that might reſtore her to health, he ſtill continued them with all his former aſſiduity; but he took care ſeldom to be alone with her; or, if ſo, by chance, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he took up a book and read, or played on the flute, of which he was a maſter, to amuſe her. And when he read, and when he played, there was ſuch ſenſibility, ſuch paſſion in every tone, in every ſound, that the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034126_0196_0FFA90ECC7B16028"/>
ſoul of Caroline was all rapture. Her mind, more ſuſceptible by her late ſufferings and preſent recovery, which gave a new charm to every object, became each day, each hour, more and more attached to that amiable huſband, ſo kind, ſo complaiſant, ſo deſerving of being beloved. Her inclination for Lindorf had but given la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent paſſions action, had but rouſed ſenſibility and dormant love, of which, till now, ſhe had only felt the ſorrows and the remorſe; but, at preſent, authorized by duty, it had a charm, a faſcination; the words happineſs, love, and huſband, were united, and ſhe could not but hope he loved her, and had granted her pardon. Never did ſhe tire of making her maid repeat the various proofs of affection he had ſhewn, during her illneſs; the nights paſſed in watching over her; the deſpair ſo frequently viſible when he ſuppoſed her recovery impoſſible; while each circumſtance augmented paſſion till love ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, although ſhe durſt not give it an epithet more tender than gratitude.</p>
                  <p>Attentive to the leaſt actions of Walſtein, to every motion, and every word, ſhe was not long before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked the uneaſy conſtraint he laboured under, and the care he took to avoid all private and particular converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion relative to themſelves. At the very beginning of her recovery he had told her his friend Lindorf was on the road, that he would not be long before he would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, and that he, in the mean while, had his houſe and ſervants at his diſpoſal. The beſt of motives was Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein's, when he gave Caroline this information; but ſhe, too weak at that time, to enter into explanations, could not hear the name of Lindorf, and, eſpecially, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended return, without a painful ſenſation, an inquietude ſufficiently evident, which but confirmed the Count in his ſuſpicions and intents. She, on the contrary, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he meant to try her; and, therefore, was the more confuſed. How often did ſhe, afterwards, reproach her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for not having ſeized the opportunity of the moment to open her heart; for not confeſſing her former and her preſent ſentiments! Yet had ſhe a right ſo to do?— When Lindorf fled and ſacrificed himſelf for Caroline, might Caroline be permitted to riſk the loſs of his friend; to rob him of a protector; who, at laſt, might tire of an attachment which, to him, had been ſo fatal?</p>
                  <p>To theſe reflections others were added, by which ſhe
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:034126_0197_0FFA912E6BDF79D0"/>
was reſtrained. How might ſhe be the firſt to tell the Count ſhe loved him, while ſhe doubted of his love for her, and while this doubt every day increaſed? His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conduct was the very reverſe of what it had been, during her illneſs; and ſhe knew not how to account for either the one or the other. If he love me not, thought ſhe, inceſſantly, whence that mortal dread of loſing me? Whence that deſpair which had nearly deprived him of life? Or, wherefore thoſe raptures, ſo affecting and ſo dear to memory, on the hopes of my recovery? Still I behold his tears of joy, ſtill I hear thoſe expreſſions ſo kind, ſo affectionate, which love alone could dictate.— But wherefore are thoſe expreſſions heard no more? Or why, now I am able to hear and anſwer, is he ſilent? Wherefore does he avoid me thus? Alas! it was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which agitated his capacious and benevolent mind, and which I miſinterpreted love, and now, pity gradually decreaſing, reſentments ſucceeds—Oh! my Lord, and huſband, didſt thou but know my heart, my love, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſurely thou wouldſt not remain unmoved; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou wouldſt pardon, nay, perhaps, mighteſt love, and we might ſtill be happy."</p>
                  <p>Then did ſhe beſtow her kiſſes and her tears on the picture which her woman had taken from her neck, when ſhe fainted, on their firſt arrival; and which had been carefully concealed. This picture ſhe had aſked for at the beginning of her recovery, and it was become to her the moſt precious thing on earth. At length, unable any longer to ſupport incertitude ſo diſtreſſing, ſhe reſolved to oblige the Count to come to ſome kind of explanation, by teſtifying her own deſire to quit Ronebourg. Nor was this deſire feigned; with regret ſhe ſaw herſelf in a place ſhe had ſo many reaſons to diſlike, and which ſo continually brought to recollection an error ſhe could not pardon herſelf. What the Count had ſaid, likewiſe, concerning the return of his friend, alarmed her. She could not comprehend the motive of this return, but, be it what it might, to be found at Ronebourg would be equally painful to him and her. She knew not how far the Count's knowledge of former tranſactions extended, for he neither ſpoke of Lindorf, himſelf, the letter he had received, the letters he had written, his deſign to travel, nor of the place where he intended to leave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline. In fact, he was wholly ſilent. Unremittingly

                  <p>Then would Walſtein bury himſelf in the recluſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt covert, or ſhut himſelf up in his cabinet, that he might freely utter his complaints, and vent feelings by which he was oppreſſed. Happy Lindorf! would he ſay; thou knoweſt not all thy bliſs; knoweſt not my loſs. Come, Oh! come, and dry the tears of Caroline, which flow at thy remembrance, that I may behold her happy ere I die!</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he would reproach himſelf for ſuffering her to remain ignorant of her approaching felicity; for not ſaying to her, Lindorf, the regretted, the beloved Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, ſhall be your huſband. But how might he ſay this, unleſs he were more certain he could fulfil his promiſe? Lindorf came not, wrote not; and how if death, ſparing Caroline, had ſtruck his friend! How, if Lindorf was no longer a living being! His blood froze at the thought— Merciful God! ſaid he, thou heareſt my prayers for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline! Oh! hear them, alſo, for my friend! Let him return, let him be happy, and I, only, miſerable!</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of his ſiſter was an additional grief. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by her cheerfulneſs, her levity, which was but the levity of infancy, and miſtaken in the perſeverance of her character, he had ſuppoſed her love for Lindorf very feeble, and that the Baron de Zaſtrow would preſently efface the fleeting ſenſations. But her letter ſhewed him his error, proved her paſſion real and laſting, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the heart for having given it birth, unable as he was, honourably, to give it conſummation. Matilda, like himſelf, was in love, and, like himſelf, was wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he knew he had but to intimate a wiſh and Lindorf would marry her, would thus aſcertain to him the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Caroline; Lindorf would refuſe him nothing, and Caroline was too much attached to her duty for him to doubt ſhe would any longer teſtify her former repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But it was not for Walſtein to ſelfiſhly take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the generoſity of others, and abuſe the power gratitude gave.

would he thus acquire; nor, indeed, was happineſs poſſible, unleſs it were mutual. The ſuppoſition of her being united to a man whoſe heart another poſſeſſed was not to be borne; he, therefore, reſolved, without explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecret which not only required too circumſtanti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Ah! Matilda, your brother's proſpects of happineſs are as few as yours. Yet, if I am not deceived, I hope, by affording each other mutual aid, by uniting our reaſon and our fortitude, we, perhaps, may riſe ſuperior to the misfortunes that threaten us, and create a ſpecies of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for ourſelves, founded on ſelf-approbation, and the grateful remembrance of having ſacrificed our own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to the felicity of our friends.— You underſtand me not.

ſpeak a word, a ſingle word, and the woman I love is mine; but muſt I ſeek my own happineſs at another's expence? Her heart is not mine. The man ſhe loves is worthy of that diſtinction, and his paſſion equals her's. On me, and me only, it depends for ever to ſeparate or unite them. Alas! dear Matilda, how feeble are reaſon and virtue, where the heart is ſubject to the imperious mandates of paſſion! Only imagine that the brother of Matilda is undetermined what to do; yet, I hope, he will not diſgrace his ſiſter. But Oh! my dear, my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der friend, I ſtand in need of your ſupport; to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by your fortitude, nay, perhaps by your example.

                  <p>With this letter he ſent another to his aunt, Madam de Zaſtrow, in which he told her that certain reaſons obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him no more to think of the union of his ſiſter and his friend; and that, therefore, he ſhould be happy could ſhe be induced to favour the Baron de Zaſtrow; but he conjured her not to be precipitate, and by no means to uſe the leaſt violence. He further ſaid he ſhould ſoon come to Dreſden, and intreated his aunt not finally to diſpoſe of his ſiſter till his arrival.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two letters being ſent, and thus being more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, relative to the fate of Matilda, the Count applied himſelf wholly to the plan he had formed, in order to aſcertain the happineſs of Caroline. He had deſired the High Chamberlain to come to Ronebourg, ſo ſoon as his daughter ſhould be informed of the death of the Baroneſs. It could not be long before Lindorf muſt arrive, and the Count was determined to ſet off for Berlin the moment he came; pretending to have received an order from the King, and to leave Lindorf at Ronebourg, with the High Chamberlain, that he might obtain a divorce from his Majeſty, and his conſent, alſo, for the marriage of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf and Caroline. He then intended to write and inform them of their happineſs; and, without ſeeing them, to depart for Dreſden. From Dreſden, he meant to go to England with Matilda; or without her, if ſhe determined to marry the young Baron de Zaſtrow; and to reſide there with his mother's relations. He felt ſufficient fortitude to make Caroline and his friend happy, but not to be a daily witneſs of their loves; and this plan, once fixed, he held to be unalterable.</p>
                  <p>Alas! he knew not yet all the power of love; had yet
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:034126_0202_0FFA91EC58738968"/>
not felt all its vengeful effects. The more he ſtruggled with paſſion, the deeper was it rooted in his heart. How often, when beſide Caroline, unable to reſtrain his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, was he ready to kneel at her feet, confeſs his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his internal ſtruggles, his deſpair; appeal to her generoſity, recall to mind the ſacred bond by which they were united, the vows they had mutually made, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy every reſource, of pity and of paſſion, to ſupplicate her conſent to live and die with the huſband by whom ſhe was adored. By ſlight only could he obtain a victory over himſelf, on theſe occaſions. Once out of her ſight, and virtue, delicacy, and friendſhip, again were aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. Love ceded to duty; and he had the fortitude to imagine Caroline in the arms of another, and not expire at the thought! Then would he remember Lindorf, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from his country, dragging an unhappy being through foreign climates, deprived of his miſtreſs and his friend, without conſolation and without hope; and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, ſhudder and deteſt his weakneſs: again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his oaths to ſubdue it, and, fearing to expoſe himſelf to future dangers, deprive himſelf of the pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caroline; who, ill interpreting the cauſe of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, would, on her part, weep and afflict herſelf at conduct which ſhe ſuppoſed to be the moſt unequivocal proof of indifference.</p>
                  <p>In her moments of vexation and deſpair, ſhe ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened herſelf in the reſolution of returning to Rindaw, and of intreating, nay, of abſolutely requiring his conſent, ſhould he offer any oppoſition. "Alas! would ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this doubt, "far from oppoſing, he will gladly ſeize the means of living ſeparate from Caroline.—Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate!—What, am I no more to ſee him, to hear him no more? And, when I quit this place, muſt a laſting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration enſue? And muſt I aſk it; muſt I myſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the fatal ſentence?

her ſight, which were powerful and ſomewhat dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. He afterwards wrote word her blindneſs was paſt cure, and that it afflicted her ſo much ſhe had fallen ill. Caroline no ſooner heard this than ſhe wiſhed to fly to attend and conſole her; but ſhe herſelf was yet too feeble for the fatigues of ſuch a journey. She wrote the moſt affecting letters, both to her friend and her father; and, every returning courier, hoped to hear of her recovery. At length the letters of the High Chamberlain became ſo alarming, and affirmed ſo poſitively the Baroneſs of Rindaw was in the utmoſt danger, that Caroline immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately determined to ſet off; and ſent to beg the Count would come and ſpeak with her.</p>
                  <p>He found her with her eyes ſwimming in tears, and well divined their cauſe. "Oh! Sir," ſaid ſhe, the moment he entered, "read here what my father has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Count, finding this idea had preſented itſelf to her mind, and that the apprehenſion had had half its effect, thought this the time to inform her of the truth: beſide that her reſolution to depart, immediately, made ſecr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"Yes, any thing, every thing! It is my duty to devote my returning ſtrength to the ſervice of the friend who has been, to me, the beſt and tendereſt of mothers. I feel how much I have neglected this duty, and ſhall, indeed, be moſt happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>She was going to riſe and make preparations, but the Count again detained her. "A moment, dear Caroline, be appeaſed for a moment, I conjure you, and liſten to me—I have alſo received a letter from your father."</p>
                  <p>"Merciful God!" cried ſhe, turning pale, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging what was coming; "a letter to you! Tell me! I
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034126_0204_0FFA91F00A749ED8"/>
beg you, inſtantly, tell me its contents. Has my father concealed any thing?—Oh! Sir,—" Her oppreſſed heart could no longer reſiſt the violence of agitation, and her ſobs interrupted ſpeech. The ſilence of the Count, his downcaſt eyes, the timid compaſſion of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the vague anſwers he returned, confirmed her fears, and her deſpair became exceſſive. "Oh God! Oh God!" exclaimed ſhe, "I perceive, I perceive, I no longer have a friend, no longer have any thing in this world! My dear Mamma no longer exiſts, and I have loſt my all!"</p>
                  <p>"Not ſo, dear Caroline; there ſtill is a friend in the world, who hopes to prove how dear you are to him, and how much he is intereſted in your happineſs."</p>
                  <p>Caroline loved this friend too well herſelf to be wholly inſenſible of that conſolation he wiſhed to impart; and to thoſe new proofs of tenderneſs which ſhe no longer had dared to hope. Her tears ſtill flowed, abundantly flowed, but leſs bitterly. In the aſſaults of violent grief, the feeling and impaſſioned mind experiences relief by the company of a beloved object, and in the alleviations of love. She grieved, but the Count grieved with her, felt as ſhe felt, and partook of her affliction. In theſe their moments of melancholy, their ſouls were in uniſon. Caroline had loſt the tendereſt of friends, but the very moment in which ſhe was informed of this misfortune was that which gave her the ſweet hope of being beloved, by the huſband ſhe adored; for, in this firſt tranſport of deſpair, which ſoftened fortitude and ſhewed Caroline ſtill more lovely, the Count was not able wholly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his paſſion. The ſorrow of Caroline demanded every care and conſolation friendſhip could afford; and Walſtein, while he endeavoured to aſſume the form of friendſhip, had all the tendereſt actions and looks of love. Caroline, thus, in the midſt of affliction, had a glimpſe of a happy futurity, and mourned that her friend was not to be a witneſs of her bliſs.</p>
                  <p>She deſired to be informed circumſtantially of her ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death; but the Count, who underſtood nothing ſo ill as diſſimulation, referred her to the High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, who would ſoon return; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, to quiet her remorſe for having too long delayed going to the aid of her friend, he told her ſhe had died ſome time ſince, and when it was impoſſible for Caroline to have gone to her aſſiſtance.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:034126_0205_0FFA68D574775DB0"/>
No ſooner was the High Chamberlain informed that his daughter knew the truth than he returned to Ronebourg, and told her, himſelf, ſhe was left ſole heireſs to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noneſs. She had made her will anew, afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhe had been informed of her marriage, and it was to the Counteſs of Walſtein ſhe had bequeathed all her poſſeſſions: ſhe had indeed left a legacy to the Count, purpoſely, as ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had worded it, to prove how highly ſhe was ſatisfied at his union with Caroline. She recommended, in moſt affecting terms, the happineſs of this her beloved pupil, to Walſtein; and to Caroline that of the beſt and moſt ſublime of men.</p>
                  <p>The reading of the will drew many tears from Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line; nor was the Count leſs affected. The High Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, alone, read it with perfect ſatisfaction, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended not how an augmentation of fortune could become the ſubject of ſorrow. Caroline, alas! found on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new motives, in theſe benefactions, to regret a friend ſo tender and ſo generous. Walſtein, diſtracted by a thouſand contrary ſenſations, could not hear of union and happineſs, which he ſo ſoon was to renounce, without extreme emotion. When the Baron came to that article, he ſuddenly kneeled to Caroline; "Yes," ſaid he, with vehement tranſport, "yes, by honour, by love, by every thing ſacred, I ſwear, you ſhall be happy, Caroline"— He could not continue; and Caroline, affected to exceſs, tenderly ſtretched out her hand to raiſe him, while ſhe felt, more powerfully than ever, that on him only, of all the world, this her promiſed happineſs depended, and on the ſentiments he ſhould entertain for her.</p>
                  <p>Had they been alone, perhaps ſhe might then have told him what hers really were; perhaps this might have been the happy moment of an explanation too long delayed; but the preſence of the placid High Chamberlain checked ſuch effuſions of the heart. He, with wonderful tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, continued to read his will; which contained nothing farther, except legacies to ſervants and vaſſals. The Count, unable to ſupport the continuance of his preſent emotion and the tears of the compaſſionate Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, left the room and walked into the park, whither all his feelings went with him. He began no longer to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his own proceedings; and, ſometimes, aſked himſelf wherefore he thus ſhould wilfully be forever mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Wherefore ſhould he yield the poſſeſſion of her
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034126_0206_0FFA91F1ABECA100"/>
on whom he had ſo many claims, and without whom it was impoſſible to live? "She begins," thought he, "to be accuſtomed to me; nay, I even think I behold expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of affection in her eyes. Alas! I know it can be but friendſhip, eſteem, gratitude; yet may not theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, in a mind like hers, well ſupply the place of love? Or may I ever hope to inſpire others? Does ſhe not already grant more than I could ever expect?— But, while I know, paſt doubt, her heart wholly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to another, to Lindorf!—Lindorf? Alas! perhaps he no longer is in exiſtence; perhaps he has ſunk under his grief, under the grief of Caroline, by which my own heart has been ſo often wounded, and which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, with ſuch exceſs, ſhould ſhe hear tidings ſo fatal!"</p>
                  <p>The Count ſhuddered while he imagined he himſelf might be the meſſenger to inform Caroline of the death of the man ſhe loved; that he himſelf muſt then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the cauſe of his death. The ſilence of Lindorf after the ſhort letter he could not but have received, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him a certain proof his fears were but too well ſounded; and ſo much did this and ſuch like fears tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, that ſcarcely could reaſon ſuſtain the conflicts of the heart. At one moment he would paſſionately wiſh the return of Lindorf, and dread it worſe than death the next; equally fearing to ſee him arrive, or to hear he was no longer in exiſtence. Thus did a man ſo philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic, ſo ſage, ſo wholly till then maſter of himſelf, at length, feel the empire of paſſion and its tyrannic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and, while thus he felt, terrified at its effects, again ſwore to vanquiſh it, to devote himſelf, if it were not too late, to the felicity of thoſe he loved.</p>
                  <p>From one of theſe tormenting terrors he was, at laſt, relieved. He received a letter from Varner, the valet de chambre of Lindorf, to whom he had given his ſhort and preſſing letter, written to conjure his friend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. "The good Varner entreated his Excellency not to be uneaſy at not having yet received an anſwer to this letter, for that, when he came to Hamburg, his maſter was not there; he had embarked, a few days before, for England, with a Saxon gentleman: and he, Varner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained three weeks at Hamburg by contrary winds, had neither been able to join his maſter, who expected him at London, nor, conſequently, to remit to him the letter his Excellency had confided to his care."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:034126_0207_0FFA68D8737969F8"/>The firſt pleaſure of the Count was to learn that Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf ſtill lived, and by being able to travel, was in good health. Nor was this pleaſure ſingle; Lindorf had not received his letter; his return was therefore deferred; and this ſhort delay, which likewiſe deferred the moment when Walſtein ſhould be obliged to quit Caroline, cede her to another, and live for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ever from her, was to him an age of happineſs. He haſtened therefore to her chamber, that he might not loſe moments ſo precious. Her father was with her. "My dear Count," ſaid the High Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, as he entered, "my daughter here, is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous of quitting Ronebourg, but dares not ſpeak to you on the ſubject. For my part, I can ſee no reaſon in the world why you ſhould remain longer here; for, at preſent, the Counteſs is ſufficiently recovered to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the journey. The King may complain of your long abſence; he commanded me to haſten your return to Berlin, and in a tone that will not admit of longer delay; and I muſt certainly be gone; for my preſence is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary at court. If, therefore, your Excellency ſhall think proper to give orders, we will incontinently depart together."</p>
                  <p>The Count made no reply, but fixed his eyes on Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line; in order to enquire of her countenance what was paſſing in her heart, and whether ſhe really wiſhed to leave Ronebourg. Caroline bluſhed, looked down, and, by her ſilence, ſeemed to approve. Yet was the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſment of the Count beyond deſcription great. He could not be ignorant how much the King deſired his return; for, ſince his arrival from Ruſſia, he had only remained four-and-twenty hours at Berlin; and had had but one ſhort interview with his Majeſty. To the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Sovereign, only, was he indebted for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent long abſence; and frequent couriers brought him preſſing letters from the King; or rather from a man who reclaimed his friend. Walſtein knew, likewiſe, that his marriage with Caroline was then become public. The High Chamberlain, who ſo long had laboured with this ſecret, had told it to the whole world, as ſoon as his daughter was gone to Ronebourg. The King himſelf, knowing the Count and Counteſs were together, had openly ſpoken of their union; wherefore longer myſtery was impoſſible. Yet how might the Count, with his preſent intentions, take Caroline to Berlin as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:034126_0208_0FFA91F459D8CA70"/>
of Walſtein, and there preſent her at court, and to every body, by a name ſhe ſo ſoon was to quit?</p>
                  <p>He then felt how much the delay of his letter to Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf deranged all his projects. He no longer could refuſe the requeſt of the King, which might every moment be changed to a command: he could not think of leaving Caroline, alone, at Ronebourg; and ſtill leſs of taking her to Rindaw, where every thing muſt tend to nouriſh and increaſe affliction. While reflecting, in this dilemma, how he muſt act, Caroline, preſſed by her father to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her deſire to depart immediately, ſaid, "ſhe ſhould, with pleaſure, accompany my lord the Count to Berlin; but that ſhe hoped, both he and the king would have the goodneſs, for ſome time, to diſpenſe with her ſeeing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and that, while ſhe remained in mourning, ſhe might be permitted to live retired."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein eagerly caught the idea; and the health of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, not yet ſufficiently re-eſtabliſhed, together with her deep mourning for a friend whom ſhe had loved as a mother, were, in reality, excellent pretexts for comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her requeſt, and neither receiving nor paying viſits, at Berlin, for ſome months. In leſs time than that Walſtein well might hope his future fate would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. Caroline, mean while, would live almoſt unknown, at Walſtein-houſe, where ſhe would ſee only her father, and himſelf; which, to him, was a moſt pleaſing reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It was ſome alleviation to deſpair not to be obliged to quit her before the dreaded hour of final ſeparation ſhould arrive. The ſage in love is but a man. The Count no longer ſaw impediments. Caroline living in his houſe, and in his ſight, was perfection of bliſs; and, though he ſtill deſtined her for a man he ſuppoſed ſhe loved, though ſtill determined carefully to conceal his own paſſion, he could not refuſe himſelf this intermediate enjoyment of happineſs; which, beſide, would remove every difficulty, relative to where Caroline ſhould remain.</p>
                  <p>The day of departure was, therefore, fixed; and the tender Caroline beheld it arrive with rapture. She ſhould no longer live in the manſion of Lindorf: it was now determined ſhe ſhould for ever paſs her life with the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhe adored, and ſhe thought herſelf certain of ſoon effacing from his memory, by offices of tender affection, the capricious and erroneous conduct which her heart, at preſent, diſclaimed; and which ſhe herſelf could never

                     </gap> Caroline, perceived ſhe went with pleaſure; but this pleaſure he aſcribed to virtue, and to the deſire ſhe had, henceforth, of avoiding every thing that might bring Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf to memory. His eſteem, conſequently, his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were redoubled; but, thinking thus, he was but the more ſtrongly confirmed in his determination of reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the virtue he ſo much admired.</p>
                  <p>Behold them, then, at Berlin, and alighting at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein-houſe; a place of ſo much former terror to Caroline. She entered it with all thoſe gentle ſenſations, thoſe mild hopes, ſo ſweet to the ſoul, and which ſeemed a prelude of the felicity ſhe was about to enjoy. To theſe ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the recollection of her bridal day, her behaviour to the man ſhe now adored, the mixture of hope and fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the real ſentiments of the Count, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflection on the death of her dear friend, whom ſhe wiſhed a witneſs of her preſent happineſs. Theſe, all conſpiring, contributed but to augment that emotion which ſhe no longer could conceal, and which brought the tears into her eyes. The Count ſaw thoſe tears; his heart melted at the ſight; he attributed them to a very different cauſe, and would inſtantly have given her every aſſurance that cauſe ſhould be removed; but we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen the motives by which he was withheld. He would not give her a proſpect of bliſs as yet uncertain; nor would he have to combat with her delicacy and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. Neither, indeed, had he the power to pronounce <hi>I yield Caroline to another.</hi> No, he might have acted; but, on ſuch a ſubject, he could not have ſpoken!</p>
                  <p>The High Chamberlain ſupped with them, and retired inflate with joy at beholding his daughter now eſtabliſhed Lady of Walſtein-houſe. When he was gone, the Count led Caroline to the apartment which had long been deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive her; at the time of his marriage, and while he was far from pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ging the events that were to ſucceed. He had furniſhed it with all poſſible taſte and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, in the dear expectation that his young and beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bride was ſoon to become its inhabitant. This expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, at laſt, was realized. But how? In what manner? And at what moment? How much might he well regret paſt ſuſpenſe, and the hope which, during uncertainty, he had cheriſhed!</p>
                  <p>"This, dear Caroline," ſaid he, as they entered, "i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aw this, but ſaw not the true motive. Eager to deprive her of her fears, "You," ſaid he, reſpectfully kiſſing her hand, "are abſolute here; queen of this apartment, neither I nor any one elſe ſhall enter it, without your free permiſſion."</p>
                  <p>Haſtily the Count retired; had he rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ned a moment longer, he, perhaps, had forgotten Lindorf and all his oaths—"Ye powers of friendſhip!" cried he, as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his own chamber, "ſuſtain my fortitude. Caroline, dear adored Caroline, Lindorf, my friend, appear, be ever preſent to my imagination, there inceſſantly repeat you cannot be happy aſunder!"</p>
                  <p>Thus did the whole night paſs in mourning over and lamenting his deſtiny, and the rigid ſacrifice which virtue, principle, friendſhip, and even love itſelf, loudly demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Caroline, though more tranquil, yet ſlept but little and reflected much. Though her chaſte ſimplicity felt not all the ſingularity of Walſtein's conduct, yet could ſhe not be wholly ignorant that her ſpouſe had a right to partake of her apartment; and ſhe thought her own wrongs too many, and too great, not to attribute his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thus too well-founded reſentment. Succeeding evenings but confirmed the idea; Walſtein, fearing again to encounter dangers he found himſelf ſo near ſinking under before, not only forbore to accompany Caroline to her apartment but began, as he had done at Ronebourg, Before ſhe knew the death of the Baroneſs, to abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as much as poſſible, and never be with her, except in the preſence of her father, or her women; and even then he had an air of conſtraint, of anxiety, ſo viſible, he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much to meet her eyes, or to approach her touch, that ſhe no longer doubted of his indifference; nay ſhe even dreaded it was averſion.—This conduct, far from irritating, ſenſibly affected Caroline.

She recollected his travelling deſign, and doubted not but he ſtill intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſhould take place; ſhe even, for a moment, thought to prevent his being again at the pain of propoſing her return to Rindaw; and thus, by voluntarily abſenting herſelf from the Count and the court, reſtore him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of which ſhe thought him ſo ardently deſirous.— But this propoſal was become much more difficult to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute than when ſhe wrote her letter at Rindaw. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhe loved him, paſſionately loved him; and never could ſhe collect the fortitude to abandon the object of this her moſt tender affection.—Therefore, her deſign was no ſooner formed than forſaken; and to that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſolution to try all poſſible means of regaining the heart of her huſband, and, by love, obliterating the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of former wrongs.

Obſervant of this new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, the Count, far from imagining himſelf beloved, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all the attentions, all the thouſand kindneſſes of Caroline to ſyſtematic gratitude, and duty; which a ſoul ſo feeling, and ſo virtuous, as hers, had impoſed upon it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Momentary appearances confirmed the ſuſpicion. Caroline, young and timid, feeling ſenſations ſhe thought ſhe had not the power to communicate, reproaching her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for, and even exaggerating former errors, fearing by officiouſneſs to diſpleaſe a huſband prejudiced againſt her, often had an air of reſerve and conſtraint, which perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Walſtein her heart was acting contrary to its moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſires. Sorrowful at the ill ſucceſs of her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to inſpire affection, often would ſhe ſuffer melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly to invade her mind; often would retire to her chamber, and on her lovely cheeks leave traces of tears

which the Count imagined to be the bitter tears of duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhed in lamenting the ſeverity of fate, that ſeparated her from the man ſhe loved.</p>
                  <p>Him, day after day did Walſtein wait for; him, the lover and the friend, for whom felicity ſo ſupreme was held in reſerve; nor could he comprehend wherefore he did not return. Beſide the letter he had ſent by Varner, he had alſo written after his arrival at Berlin; and his letter, under cover to, and recommended to the care of Lindorf's banker, at Hamburg, by him to be forwarded to England, muſt have reached him if he were not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the road, coming back. This letter was more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than the former. Without fully expreſſing all he meant, he uſed every argument to haſten his return. "On this his own happineſs, and the happineſs of thoſe he moſt loved, depended; if prayers and entreaties were not ſufficient, he abſolutely exacted a compliance.—Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, dear Lindorf, how often you have given me the right of diſpoſing of your future deſtiny. This right, which I hold from friendſhip, and, perhaps, from grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſomewhat too enthuſiaſtic, I now claim. Yes, I now recall to memory every circumſtance which may make you hold yourſelf my debtor, to tell you the hour is come when it depends on you to cancel them all, and, by one ſingle act, place all obligation to my account. I can only add, if in a month, at fartheſt, I have not the pleaſure to embrace you, at Walſtein-houſe, you will give me reaſon to doubt of an attachment which I think I deſerve, and to ſuppoſe I no longer have a friend!"</p>
                  <p>This letter, ſo ſtrong, ſo preſſing, remaining unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave room to imagine, and even to believe that, in fact, Lindorf had ſet out for Berlin before it arrived at England; and that conſequently he muſt ſoon be there. Dreadful as this moment was, in which a ſeparation from her he adored was to take place, ſtill Walſtein waited for it with a kind of impatience, ariſing from a conviction it would aſcertain the happineſs of Caroline, and from a wiſh of being himſelf freed from that inquietude which ſuffers the ſoul to wander among illuſive chimeras, which an inſtant might deſtroy, and to which miſery itſelf is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preferable.</p>
                  <p>How, indeed, was he to defend himſelf againſt the phantoms of hope, ſeductive and dear as they are to the heart, and whoſe ſpells each day became more irreſiſtable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nothing, indeed, but the modeſty and preſent error of Walſtein could have prevented him from perceiving they were not phantoms, were not illuſive. Far from deſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Caroline was ſtill more affectionate, more attentive, mild and tender. The happineſs of her exiſtence was the prize for which ſhe contended. And how might ſhe perform too much for a huſband like Walſtein, whom ſhe ſo long had offended, by averſion moſt unjuſt; to whom her heart had been unfaithful, and which had ſo many errors, nay, to Carol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſing diffidence, therefore, and hoping every thing from perſeverance and affection, a thouſand kind arts were employed to draw and attach him to her, of which love alone is ſuſceptible, and to which love alone can give ſuch wondrous force.</p>
                  <p>The Count was exceedingly fond of muſic, and Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line was inceſſant in her endeavours to arrive at excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Often did ſhe intreat him to accompany her on the flute or violoncello, which he played equally well; often did ſhe ſing, with all the charms of ſenſibility, the moſt expreſſive and melting airs, and ſuch as moſt were likely to make impreſſion on a ſoul like Walſtein's. The Count had a taſte and talents for drawing, but other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations had prevented him from making any great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the art. Caroline, on the contrary, educated in retirement, had applied herſelf with infinite ſucceſs to that delightful art, which can people ſolitude, and, in deſpite of wintry froſt, retrace nature's beauties, create meads, rivers, mountains, and foreſts, and make perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the fleeting and periſhing beauties of Flora. Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line was particularly ſucceſsful in flowers and landſcapes; which alſo was the ſpecies of painting the Count moſt preferred. She offered to inſtruct him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> direct his eſſays, and correct his errors; in return for which, ſhe entreated him to ſelect books, and ſuperintend ſtudies which ſhe was deſirous to engage in, but which are too generally neglected in the education of women. While he was drawing by her ſide, ſometimes would ſhe read, and her former cuſtom o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Walſtein, when he ſaw her fatigued, would read in his turn; and while her countenance, obedient to the powers of genius, aſſumed the paſſion, or imbibed the wiſdom of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034126_0214_0FFA91FC7B266908"/>
her ſkilful and delicate fingers would knit, or knot, or embroider, the garter, the purſe, or the waiſtcoat; all of which were deſtined pledges of affection for her Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein. Ever deſirous of finding new ſources to give him pleaſure, every action had that for its object. For him only did ſhe exiſt, and continually would ſhe invent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts either to go into his apartment, or invite him into hers. Though ſhe ſaw no perſon but him and the High Chamberlain, who ſupped with them almoſt every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, never was ſhe dull for want of company. Far from that, ſhe continually refuſed the ſolicitations of the Baron to preſent her at court, ſeemed moſt deſirous of prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her retreat, and, with mild and timid eyes turned to Walſtein, ſaid "never before had ſhe been ſo happy!" Yet, notwithſtanding all the thouſand hourly-repeated proofs of love which Caroline no longer ought to hide, ſtill did the Count, faſcinated by fear, and dreading to yield to the ſenſations by which he was continually aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, repel truth, and retain foregone and chimerical concluſions.</p>
                  <p>"Not for me," would he ſay, "is it to be beloved. No: the affectionate, the tender, the adorable Caroline has the art of giving to friendſhip—alas! what did I ſay?

Though ſhe love me not, her preſent actions and manner prove ſhe would not an inſtant heſitate to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her heart and her happineſs to me."</p>

                  <p>One evening, when the High Chamberlain was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at court, the Count ſupped alone with Caroline, who was more tender, more endearing, more enchanting than uſual. If ſhe <hi>ſaid</hi> not I love, it was almoſt impoſſible to miſunderſtand her <hi>actions.</hi> The emotion, the agitation of Walſtein augmented every moment, and he muſt either betray his feelings or fly the danger. He juſt had ſtrength ſufficient to perform this painful taſk, but it was the laſt effort of reaſon. Shut up in his own apartment, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on his preſent ſtate, his love, his claims, and the conduct of Caroline.</p>
                  <p>"No," ſaid he, "it is not, it cannot be illuſive. I am beloved. I no longer have cauſe to doubt. If I touch her hand I feel it tremulous; or if ſhe takes mine ſhe gently holds and preſſes it, unwilling it ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; if I quit her with mournful looks her eyes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me; and, this very evening I beheld them moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her tears. All the animation, all the tenderneſs of affection, were painted in her countenance; and yet I left her; yet I forbore to kneel at her feet; yet I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to tell her how infinitely I adore her; neglect to ſupplicate a confirmation of my happineſs, and of that love which every incident tends but to confirm."</p>
                  <p>Never had the idea preſented itſelf to him with ſo much force and certainty: it enrapt him ſo far that, no longer liſtening to aught but ſweet hope, he determined to return, confeſs his paſſion, and obtain from Caroline an avowal of hers, of which he no longer doubted. All his oaths, reſolutions, and projects diſappeared; all were annihilate; he forgot that Lindorf had exiſtence: Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, only, he beheld! His Caroline! To him united, by him beloved, and him loving; nor was there longer mortal man who ſhould bear away this treaſure of his ſoul!—In an inſtant, Walſtein, again, is in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſees her not, but he hears her guitar, hears the melody of ſounds that vibrate to his heart; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, ſoftly, a door half open, that leads to a ſmall chamber, whither Caroline had retired. It was her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite

apartment; there ſhe paſſed an hour, every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before ſhe went to bed, reading, ſinging, or playing. Caroline was half undreſt, reclining in an arm-chair, and gently touching her guitar as ſhe ſang. The air was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and ſhe ſeemed deeply affected; ſtopped occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, and put her handkerchief up to her eyes; then again continued, with leſs power, but more paſſion in her voice. Walſtein thought he had known all her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſongs, yet this was new to him. He liſtened with mute attention, earneſt to hear the words. Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſang ſo low that he could only catch now and then a a line, one of which, however, ſtruck him, and he liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened ſtill more eagerly. At laſt he diſtinctly heard the following part of a ſtanza:
<q>
                        <l>Ah! wherefore, love, or whither fly,</l>
                        <l>In ſearch of bliſs I'd fain impart?</l>

                  <p>The expreſſion, the marked tenderneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with which ſhe ſang, were ſufficient proofs that Caroline's complaint had reference to a real, not an imaginary lover. But who was this lover? Was it Lindorf? Was it Walſtein? Diffidence and doubt again poſſeſſed his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Too far off to diſtinguiſh the features, he yet could ſee, as ſhe put it to the candle, that it was the uniform of an officer in the Pruſſian guards; it was therefore, the uniform and the portrait of Lindorf! Caroline, at firſt, fixed her eyes upon it, then preſſed it to her heart, and next to her lips, with extreme paſſion. The tears ran down her cheeks, and fell upon the picture; ſhe carefully wiped them off, again looked and ſighed, laid it on the table, took up her guitar and ſang another ſtanza of the ſame ſong, which the Count diſtinctly heard.</p>

The action of riſing, the removal of Caroline, and the darkneſs in which Walſtein was left, awakened him from a kind of ſtupor into which he had ſunk; from a dream of terror, which, as he awoke, inſtead of vaniſhing was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed! All his imagined happineſs was fled, and again he was ingulphed in wretchedneſs at the very inſtant imagination had conducted him to the ultimate of bliſs! Yet, ever generous, even in the horrors of deſpair, his firſt intention was, when he had ſomewhat recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to go immediately to Caroline, not to intercede for himſelf, but to aſſure her Lindorf, her fugitive, her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ſhould return, ſhould be hers. The arrival of the maids, however, prevented him from executing this his deſign, and he preſently afterwards felt he no longer had the fortitude, perſonally, to tell her he would for ever yield her to another. His heart palpitated with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence that ſuch a declaration ſeemed as if it muſt have coſt him his life; and he even ſhuddered leſt, had he ſeen her at that moment, inſtead of acting as friendſhip and juſtice required, he, in his delirium, ſhould ſuffer paſſion to invade the rights of love.</p>
                  <p>No, he would ſee her no more! He might not, could not, durſt not ſee her more! He ſtill found ſufficient virtue to fly, to reſtore her to liberty, but never to bid her an eternal adieu; or again to gaze on thoſe impaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eyes, the danger of which he had ſo recently proved. He returned therefore to his chamber, where he paſſed ſome hours in a ſtate of undeſcribable anguiſh; incapable of determination, of all certitude whether love or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, Lindorf or Walſtein ſhould prevail. He wrote letter after letter to Caroline: in one he claimed his rights and endeavoured to move her compaſſion: deteſting his tyranny, and tearing this, he began another, in which
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:034126_0218_0FFA920325C10230"/>
he bade her for ever farewell, without the leaſt mention of his own excruciating pangs. "What," ſaid he, again, with increaſing agitation, tearing the paper, "ſhall ſhe even remain ignorant of the adoration in which I hold her? Shall I die without ſo much as exciting her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion?" He began once more; once more painted his love in all its enthuſiaſm, and the ſacrifice he was about to make in all its horrors. Still leſs ſatisfied than ever, he tried anew to write with more moderation; and again and again he tried, and was each time alike unſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>At length, however, the fatigued and exhauſted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſank into a gloomy calm, and Walſtein came to a firm and irrevocable determination.—This was to go the King, who never was in bed long after day-break, and to whom he was never denied admittance, to obtain, immediately, without further let or delay, a divorce; to ſend it inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Caroline, and as inſtantly to leave Potſdam, retire to his eſtate at Walſtein, and there make proper preparations for travels which he knew not when he ſhould end. The more he reflected on preſent circumſtances, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary paſſions by which he ſuppoſed himſelf and Caroline tormented, the more did he perſiſt in this project, and deeply regretted not having put it in execution immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after his arrival at Berlin; inſtead of ſuffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be thus ſeduced by the faſcinating pleaſure of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with Caroline. "Long ſince," ſaid he, "would ſhe then have been eaſy, and I myſelf perhaps leſs wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I then ſhould not have known the enchantment of her ſmiles, the irreſiſtable allurement of her friendſhip, and the bewitching influence of her attentions: or, at leaſt, I ſhould have known them but in part; attentions which I interpreted into love, and which might have ſupplied its abſence, had I remained ignorant that ſhe loves another, over whoſe memory ſhe in ſecret mourns. —Mourn! Does Caroline mourn? Caroline! For whom I would ſacrifice a thouſand lives! And ſhall I heſitate then to yield up my happineſs?"</p>
                  <p>The thought was moſt natural and appeaſing to the noble heart of Walſtein.

As he ſuppoſed he was no more to viſit Berlin, he paſſed the reſt of the night in putting his papers in order, and collecting certain of them, which he meant to take with him.

                  <p>How, in the mean time, was poor Caroline employed? —She awoke from a ſweet ſleep, which had calmed her inquietude, and already began to be impatient again to ſee that dear and cruel huſband who thus fled her embraces, and whom ſhe yet had hoped to win by affection and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance. Nay, indeed, ſhe had lately flattered herſelf with ſucceſs, and that there was very little of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in his conduct. He ſeemed pleaſed to be with her, ſeldom left her during the day, and had all thoſe little preventive cares which are ſo peculiar to love; ſhe often caught him looking paſſionately at her, and, once, ſurpriſed him ardently kiſſing a ringlet of her hair. What more was neceſſary to Caroline? Educated in the utmoſt innocence, without friendſhip or other converſation than that of the chaſte Canoneſs, never having read other books than what ſhe recommended, ſhe was moſt happy when in the ſight and hearing of her huſband.—To ſuppoſe herſelf beloved, to paſs her life in his company, was bliſs ſupreme; and when he quitted her, at night, her only chagrin was that of being ſeparated from him till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Theſe, likewiſe, were the only moments in which ſhe no longer doubted of his love; "for," ſaid ſhe, "he might ſtay, if he pleaſed; we ſtill could converſe a little longer; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For why might he not as well ſleep in my chamber as in his own? Oh! that I durſt but tell him ſo!—But he does not love ſo much to be with me as I do to be with him; he pines not as I do when we are aſunder."</p>
                  <p>Then would Caroline weep without knowing why; then would ſhe gaze on her little picture, kiſs it, repeat thoſe tender things ſhe durſt not ſay to the original, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it again to her boſom, go to ſleep with it, and, on the morrow, when ſhe met the Count, no more remember any thing but the pleaſure of being in his preſence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:034126_0220_0FFA9206DA2CB2E8"/>This was nearly her diurnal hiſtory; though, on the evening we have been deſcribing, ſhe was more than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally moved by the emotion of the Count; and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, by his ſudden retreat, which came ſo unexpected, and which, by the manner of it, had produced this effect. She, then, began to reflect there was ſomething extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſingular in the conduct of her huſband; ſuch frequent inequality of behaviour, ſo many contradictions, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhe knew not how to explain, raiſed her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Was ſhe beloved, or was ſhe not? To anſwer this queſtion ſhe endeavoured to recollect every incident that had any relation to Walſtein, from the moment after their arrival at Ronebourg. While thus ruminating, a ſong ſhe had compoſed, at the time the Count endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to avoid her, and when ſhe imagined herſelf hated by him, was recollected, and the recollection affected her; ſhe ſung it, and her tenderneſs was redoubled. Then it was that the Count had overheard her, unfortunately, as ſhe was ending the ſong, which was as follows:

                  <p>As to Caroline, having ſung, wept, and kiſſed her pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe went to bed much relieved and more tranquil. "He loves me," thought ſhe; "I am ſure he loves me; but he believes he is not beloved. He remembers the repugnance which I ſo unjuſtly, ſo unkindly, ſhewed on the day of our marriage. And can he ſuppoſe I ſtill am unjuſt and unkind? But I will undeceive him, will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my fears, will commit all the ſecrets of my heart to the boſom of my huſband, and prove how totally this froward heart is changed. To-morrow, yes, to-morrow I am determined I will tell him all; tell him every day, and every moment that I adore him, and we then ſhall ſee whether he will fly from me thus each evening after ſupper."</p>
                  <p>This reſolution made her perfectly calm; ſhe ſlept in peace, had delightful dreams, awaked with the pureſt ſenſations of pleaſure, and was more than ever determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to execute the project ſhe had conceived on the over night. No more ſhe felt the ſame fears, the ſame diffidence of herſelf. Walſtein loves her; ſhe is convinced he loves her. Doubts and recollections of the paſt are the occaſion of his continued reſerve. Unable any longer to ſupport theſe, ſhe, with a word, will expel them all. Yes, ſhe will, will prove to him, by a thouſand incidents, that he is the ſole object of her affection; that he lives and reigns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ingly and wholly in her heart. Poor Caroline! that heart of thine, ſo innocent, ſo tender, may not contain its tranſports, while, in this delirium of bliſs, thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt it ſhall no longer have a thought concealed from
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034126_0222_0FFA920984761AE8"/>
thy beloved Walſtein; from that noble huſband to whom thou art indebted for thy life, and to whoſe happineſs this life thou meaneſt to conſecrate. But, ah! that heart not yet knows half it has to ſuffer!</p>
                  <p>Timidity is natural to youth, and eſpecially to youth educated as Caroline had been. The ſuperior virtues and wiſdom of Walſtein commanded a reſpect which not even the moſt mild benevolence could wholly obliterate. It was therefore that Caroline had been ſilent ſo long; and even now, determined as ſhe is, ſhe knows not what means are beſt, how to behave, or what to ſay; and the more the moment approaches, the more her embarraſſment is increaſed. Oh! how does ſhe regret her dear mamma, who, had ſhe lived, would, long ſince, have been her faithful interpreter; the voluntary pledge of her truth and tenderneſs! But how might ſhe herſelf explain them? Should ſhe write?—She began, but her emotion was too great, her hand trembled, ſhe could find no expreſſions that could convey her feelings; no words were adequate to her ideas; ſhe could not frame a ſingle phraſe—"No," ſaid ſhe, "it will be better to go, to run to him, to throw myſelf into his arms, to ſay—Perhaps, I may not ſay a word, but ſurely he will underſtand my ſilence; ſurely he will not be able to look at me without imagining what I wiſh to ſay; he will pardon me, will diſpel my fears; reſerve, diffidence, and doubt, ſhall vaniſh all; he ſhall be wholly mine, and I wholly his; the happieſt of wives and of women!"</p>
                  <p>The thought inflames her ardour, ſhe kiſſes her little portrait to increaſe her courage, and flies to the apartment of the moſt beloved of huſbands! She enters—But no huſband is there! He ſeems not even there to have ſlept! —A large trunk, in the midſt of the chamber, in which are various other packets, ſeems to announce a removal, or a journey.—Caroline ſhakes from head to foot! Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly has ſhe ſtrength to ring the bell! A footman appears; tremblingly ſhe aſks—"Where is my Lord the Count?"</p>
                  <p>The footman, ſurpriſed at the queſtion, anſwers, 'I thought my Lady had known'—</p>
                  <p>"Known, what?"</p>
                  <p>'That my Lord ſet off betimes this morning.'</p>
                  <p>"Set off!—God!—"</p>
                  <p>'William, his valet de chambre, has been up all night, making ready. He has left orders that this trunk and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034126_0223_0FFA68FFDAFEDF98"/>
theſe packets ſhould follow. He does not know where my Lord is going, but he believes to England.'</p>
                  <p>"England!—Leave me!"</p>
                  <p>The footman goes, and Caroline ſinks in the firſt chair ſhe can ſtagger to; where, for the ſecond time in her life, ſhe feels all the affliction, all the torture of deſpairing love. A ſecond time ſees the man ſhe loves neglect, abandon, fly from her!—But what a difference between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and the former flight! When, at Rindaw, Lindorf left her, it was neceſſity, it was virtue, it was her own wiſh; the ſeparation was a cruel one, but the reflection that ſhe had done her duty was, indeed, the moſt effective conſolation! Beſide, ſhe knew ſhe was beloved, and that he who fled partook of all her affliction. Far different are her preſent pangs, which every circumſtance but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Not a clandeſtine lover but a beloved huſband flies, in whom every hope of future felicity centres. A huſband that hates her; or could he abandon her in a manner like this?—At what a moment too!</p>
                  <p>"Oh God! Then when I flew to him with open arms, when I imagined how unſpeakable his joy would be; then to depart, without mentioning the leaſt word of his intent, without ſeeing me once again! This muſt be hatred, or a moſt cruel, moſt unconquerable indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! Yet, yeſterday evening, how did he look at me! With what tenderneſs did he take my hand, and preſs it to his heart!—It is true, he repulſed it again with terror, and inſtantly left me!—For ever left me!—No, no; it cannot, it ſhall not be. He is no diſſembler. Walſtein is not the moſt barbarous of all human beings.—It is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.—The ſervant is miſtaken; he will return; yes, he will, he muſt; and here will I wait his return."</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had the poor diſtreſſed Caroline indulged this momentary glimpſe of hope, which ſomewhat recovered her ſunk ſpirits, before the footman re-entered, and brought her a packet of papers ſealed up.—"It comes from my Lord the Count; the courier is this moment ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Caroline had juſt ſufficient ſtrength to receive it, and, by a ſign, bid him retire. And now behold her alone, holding the packet ſhe durſt not open. Life or death lies there ſealed up. It was large, and addreſſed <hi>to the Counteſs Caroline, Baroneſs of Lichtfield, in her Hotel</hi>—It was ſtrange this; moſt ſtrange!—"What! will he not

call me by his name? God of Heaven! Is it poſſible?" Her trembling fingers break the ſeals; and, as the cover is torn, ſhe finds, firſt a parchment deed, next three let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, an unſealed open paper, on which her eyes are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted.</p>
                  <p>Souls of ſympathy, that now with Caroline remain in fearful ſuſpence, imagine a paper, a fatal paper, ſigned by the King, ſealed by the King; imagine a deed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a declaration of divorce, by which <hi>the King conſented to the diſſolution of the marriage of Edmund Auguſtus Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein and Caroline of Lichtfield, decreed it null and void, and the parties free to contract elſewhere!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, the eyes of Caroline were riveted, wild, yet ſhed not a ſingle tear! Thus, a while, ſhe ſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at length, the writings dropped from her hands, a dark cloud enveloped her, a cold ſweat overſpread her pale face; ſhe ſees no more, breathes no more, a univerſal palpitation ſeizes her; her laſt thought is a hope that the hand of death is upon her, and ſhe ſinks into inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity!</p>
                  <p>Thus did ſhe ſome time remain; and, when nature began ſomewhat to revive, ſhe imagined ſhe had been in a fearful dream: but not long did this deception conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; the chamber, the trunks, the letters, the paper were there, witneſſes of the reality of her wretchedneſs. She looks at the direction of thoſe letters. The firſt is to her father, the ſecond to Caroline, and is rejected with horror—"What can he ſay, while thus he murders me, while thus he himſelf diſſolves our union?"</p>
                  <p>She examines the third, and what is her ſurpriſe! It is directed to the Baron of Lindorf, at Walſtein-houſe, Berlin; and at the bottom of the direction is written, <hi>I conjure Caroline to give this letter with her own hand, to my friend, the very moment he arrives, which muſt be ſoon</hi>—"To Lindorf, exclaimed ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Caroline eagerly takes up the rejected letter, addreſſed to her, opens it, begins to read, and hope revives in her heart.—No! not jealouſy, not hatred, not indifference, not reſentment are there; but generoſity, delicacy, love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

He loves me!" ſaid ſhe, "he loves me! and our marriage is not diſſolved! Soon ſhall he know Caroline loves him alſo; will be his, and his only; will exiſt for him, with him, by him, and never, while life endures, will leave him more!" Bleſſed as this letter was, ſcarcely could ſhe end it, ſo eager was ſhe to give orders, inſtantly to prepare the poſt-chariot; but, while it is preparing, again ſhe reads, again ſhe devours its contents.

To poſſeſs the perſon of Caroline and to know that another poſſeſſes her heart, to be equally an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her happineſs and the happineſs of a dear and reſpected friend, this were impoſſible to ſupport! But to be a ſpectator of, or, at leaſt, to imagine, your mutual fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, would ſpread a gleam of comfort over deſponding life. Caroline will owe that felicity to me, will think of me with tenderneſs and gratitude; and thus, while I live, I ſhall live certain of her friendſhip, and when I die ſhe will ſhed a tear on my tomb.—Farewell!—Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, farewell! I fly to merit the friendſhip I ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly covet.</p>

Oh! tell me, tell me, Caroline, that you are happy. Let me have this conſolation—My friend is ignorant of the bliſs that awaits him. I know his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous friendſhip, and the ſame feelings that drove him from Rindaw and his country, may, perhaps, ſtill make him refuſe this felicity. This muſt not be: for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have written a letter, addreſſed to him, which will end all his ſcruples, and prove that he only can contribute

to the ſmall degree of happineſs of which Walſtein is now capable by making himſelf and Caroline happy.</p>
                           <p>"I ſtill have a favour to aſk, and, ſurely, Caroline, in a moment like this, will not by refuſal, increaſe my griefs. No, I know her heart too well.—It is to accept the houſe ſhe at preſent inhabits. You like its ſituation, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline; your apartments pleaſe you; they were deſigned for you, furniſhed for you, and never ſhall any one but you inhabit them—You will not, ſurely you will not, by a cruel denial, make your wretched friend ſtill more wretched.</p>
                           <p>"Again and again, farewell! Dear and adored Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, farewell.—And is it true, then, that you are no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mine, that I no longer have the leaſt right? What talk I of rights? I never had any; thoſe the heart only can accord, and, at preſent, I ſhall be certain of your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and eſteem.

                  <p>Again this dear letter is read till the chariot is ready, except juſt for a moment that Caroline runs into her own apartment to fetch the manuſcript of Lindorf; the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that principal cauſe of miſtake, is warm in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. And now ſhe departs, entreating, conjuring the poſtillions to be expeditious, and, notwithſtanding all

their endeavours to oblige ſo ſweet a petitioner, ſtill ſhe finds they go but ſlowly. The Count was ſome hours before her, and yet, ſo great was the diligence ſhe uſed, he had not been very long at Walſtein before ſhe arrived. Shut up in his cloſet, a prey to the moſt violent grief, inſenſible of every thing but the loſs of Caroline, whom he never was more to behold, dead even to the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of virtue, he there had retired from the world, and the ſight of human being. A momentary gleam of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort had come over him when he firſt was met by his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and ſervants. Louiſa, Juſtin, and the aged Joſſelin, had been at the head of them, had fallen and claſped the knees of their benefactor, had preſented their two litttle boys, and with bleſſings and prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſmiles and tears, had given him ſalutation. Louiſa was pregnant again, "Oh! my Lord," ſaid ſhe, "your arrival is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of happineſs. I ſhall have a little girl, for which ſo often I have prayed; and now my Lord is married, if my Lady the Counteſs will but have the goodneſs to ſtand Godmother, and let my child be chriſtened after her, I ſhall never be thankful enough for the favour."</p>
                  <p>The grateful Louiſa ſpoke daggers! The Count could not ſupport it.—"Alas! child, I am—I am no longer"— Walſtein was obliged to break off abruptly and fly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the burſting efforts of nature.</p>
                  <p>Theſe good people ſtill were aſſembled in the court, and with them ſome of the villagers, who all were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the grief in which they had ſeen their good lord, when Caroline arrived. She opened the door, ſprang from her chariot, and, without ſeeing or hearing perſon or object that ſurrounded her, exclaimed, "Where is he? Where is the Count?"</p>
                  <p>William flew!—"Here is my Lady the Counteſs!"—</p>
                  <p>"Yes dear William, here am I! Where is he? Lead me to him inſtantly!"</p>
                  <p>William ran before her, pointed to his maſter's cloſet door, and retired. Caroline opens it, runs, falls into his arms, and in a broken voice exclaims, "My Lord! My Huſband!—Wherefore haſt thou quitted thus thy Caroline, who adores thee, who loves thee and thee only in all the world, and whom thou wilt kill ſhouldeſt thou abandon her?"</p>
                  <p>The haſte with which ſhe ran, her eagerneſs, her ſobs, all cut ſpeech ſhort and interrupted reſpiration; her head
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034126_0229_0FFA691CAFE92AD0"/>
reclined on the ſhoulder of the Count, her arms hung round his neck, and her tears fell into his boſom. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein was not leſs agitated than herſelf; at laſt, taking her in his arms and placing her on a ſopha, he falls at her feet.</p>
                  <p>"Caroline!—Caroline!—Is it you, Caroline?—Is it, or is it ſome pitying angel who has aſſumed your form? Can what I have heard be poſſible!"</p>
                  <p>"Doubt it not, doubt it not! Here, here, (Caroline untied the ribband and took the portrait from her boſom) look, behold the picture I love; nay, look at it well; ſay whoſe likeneſs it is; behold who thus entirely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes my heart, and for whom alone I would live and die!"</p>
                  <p>Walſtein looked!—with aſtoniſhment looked!—It was he!—Good God! he himſelf! At leaſt ſuch as he himſelf had been; and Caroline proved ſhe ſtill beheld him as he had been, and that, to her, he had undergone no change. True it was, indeed, that he every day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more like his portrait, and that, at preſent, the likeneſs even could not be miſtaken. But by what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic, what miracle could this portrait, of the exiſtence of which the Count himſelf was ignorant, fall into the hands of Caroline, be worn next her heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and become the object of her deareſt her tendereſt careſſes? He looks, he falters; he is ready to ſink under the exceſs, and yet cannot he believe it real! It is a heavenly dream out of which he fears to awake! Few are his words—but thoſe few all are expreſſive of rapture, aſtoniſhment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining doubt. As ſoon as paſſion would permit, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, bluſhing, drew from her pocket all the letters and the manuſcript which Lindorf had left her—"Take theſe," ſaid ſhe, "read, and you will know all. No more will I have any ſecrets for my Walſtein; they have already made me too wretched.—Yes, I loved Lindorf; at leaſt, I had ſenſations that bore ſome reſemblance to thoſe I feel at preſent. What the difference is you yourſelf ſhall judge. When Lindorf left me at Rindaw, I wept; yes, wept; and not a little; but my grief ſoon found alleviation, ſoon ſubſided, and ſoon did this ſmall picture become dearer to my heart than Lindorf. This morning, on the contrary, I wept not, when I received the fearful ſentence of ſeparation. Not a tear eſcaped: but I thought either death or diſtraction muſt have been
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034126_0230_0FFA921439C185C0"/>
the inſtantaneous effect, and ſhould you perſiſt in that your dreadful deſign it would be as though you were to ſay to me <hi>Caroline, I wiſh thee dead</hi>—But, Oh! rather ſay, Caroline, I wiſh thee mine, and mine thou ever ſhalt be—Here—here is the paper! The—the divorce! Look how inſignificant it is at preſent!"</p>
                  <p>It was torn in a thouſand pieces, and Caroline caſt it with indignation into the fire—Walſtein could not utter a word! He gazed, he wept, he took her hand, preſſed it to his lips, to his heart—He gazed again, and excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, without connection, without meaning, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each other. He took up his own picture, and, in his delirium, kiſſed it with tranſport! It was the ſacred proof of the affection of his dear Caroline!</p>
                  <p>Caroline preſſed him once more to read the manuſcript, but this he could not: this would have been to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his eyes off her, and have robbed himſelf of moments the moſt precious, the moſt ecſtatic the human heart knows.—"No, dear Caroline, do not, do not aſk me to read now. I do read, I read your heart, I there find I am beloved; and what farther knowledge can I want?"</p>
                  <p>"But you know not the hiſtory of the portrait." "No matter; I know it dear to you, and that is all I wiſh to know."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, but hear, at leaſt, that it was Lindorf who taught me to eſtimate the worth of Walſtein; who firſt inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed admiration, which was afterwards productive of love."</p>
                  <p>"Lindorf!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, let me do him juſtice; to Lindorf you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the heart of your Caroline."</p>
                  <p>"To Lindorf!—Generous Friend!"</p>
                  <p>"To you he owes every thing."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, I am indebted to him for more than life."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein then took the manuſcript and read, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline preſently ſaw the ſtruggling efforts of ſenſibility; often was he obliged to ſtop, and endeavoured to ſtifle his tears, and as often did he tell Caroline, with a broken and paſſionate voice, that Lindorf moſt merited her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Caroline, with her angel hand, ſtopped his mouth, and obliged him to continue his reading. He paſſed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly over events which were already familiar to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; but when he came to the epocha of the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lindorf and Caroline, his very ſoul ſeemad a part of the paper, each ſyllable, each phraſe was devoured, and
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034126_0231_0FFCA3D3469C6200"/>
he read with his eyes only, for circumſtances like theſe might not be read aloud. Caroline, with fixed looks, continually endeavoured to diſcover the different ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which he was agitated.</p>
                  <p>When he had ended, he gave her back the manuſcript in a manner that ſhewed how much he had been moved. "I ſee," ſaid he, "I have a wife and a friend ſuch as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man had, and that they both have ſacrificed their own felicity to mine—Ah! wherefore, Caroline, did you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to read this manuſcript? Why not leave me in that bleſſed dream into which I ſo lately had been lulled?"</p>
                  <p>"A dream? Unkind Walſtein! Is that an epithet for feelings ſuch as mine? Do you forget that this is your picture?—The word picture, pronounced with the utmoſt affection, was convincing, and reſtored the Count all his confidence and bliſs.—"And now," ſaid ſhe, "that you have read your own ſtory, and that of Lindorf, liſten to the hiſtory of my heart."</p>
                  <p>Caroline, then, circumſtantially, related all that had paſſed from the moment of their marriage: the innocence with which ſhe ſuppoſed ſhe loved Lindorf as a brother, and her terror at firſt imagining a lover; the ſcene of the garden, of the pavilion, her grief, her tears, her regret, her ſtruggles, all were told. She next informed him how, induced by eſteem and admiration at reading his letters to Lindorf, ſhe had begun to think of him, to look at and love his portrait; ſpoke of what ſhe felt on receiving the letter in which he propoſed to leave his country, and of the delicacy, the ſenſations, and the mixture of chagrin that had occaſioned her anſwer. When ſhe came to the court-yard of Ronebourg, "I proteſt, I vow," ſaid ſhe, "it was agitation only at finding myſelf ſo unexpectedly in the preſence of a huſband whom I had ſo cruelly wronged, and by whom I had ſo much cauſe to be hated; it was not Lindorf. No, you long had utterly effaced every impreſſion he had made upon my heart."</p>
                  <p>The Count liſtened in rapture. He was enchanted, and took care not to give her the leaſt interruption. With what enthuſiaſm, what truth, what eloquence, what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, did ſhe ſpeak! How did ſhe dwell on every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of her recovery at Ronebourg, of her hopes and fears ſince their arrival at Berlin, and her continual intention of explaining her feelings; of the timidity by
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034126_0232_0FFA9216E799E8B0"/>
which ſhe was reſtrained; of her deſire to pleaſe him, to win his affection, to attach him wholly to herſelf, and make him happy; of her grief at her ill ſucceſs, her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that very morning, of ſpeaking, and her extreme affliction at finding him gone; of her deſpair at receiving the fatal packet, and of the joy that ſucceeded when ſhe was ſo fully convinced, from his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tter, how dearly ſhe was beloved by her huſband. All was expreſſed with that rapidity, that perſuaſion, that paſſion, which ſo entirely remove doubt—"At preſent," added ſhe, you are as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with Caroline as ſhe is with herſelf; I have nothing more to relate, except to paint how happy I am. Oh! but how? It is wholly impoſſible! I love, am beloved, and may, without a bluſh, receive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all the moſt endearing proofs of love! Yes, my dear Lord, our hearts are now acquainted with each other, and eſtimate mine by your own."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein would have replied, would have entered into explanations concerning his own conduct, but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the arrival of William. He entered, ſaying that the villagers, having heard the beauteous lady they had ſeen was the Counteſs, were very unwilling to go without being permitted to ſee her again, and very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated ſhe would let them pay their duty to her, if it were but for a moment. Caroline, led by Walſtein, deſcended into the court, and was received with redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led cries of <hi>Life! Happineſs and long life, to my Lord and my Lady!</hi>" The Count ordered wine and money to be diſtributed, and Caroline, claſping his hand moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately, whiſpered, "Theſe good people, my Walſtein, know not that they really celebrate our bridal day, the epocha of happineſs confirmed!—Would you but permit—"</p>
                  <p>"Permit, Caroline!—Speak, command."</p>
                  <p>"See what a number of young people here are. Do you not think there are ſome lovers, among them, who wiſh to marry, but whom poverty keeps aſunder? Ah! let us make them as happy as we are ourſelves!"</p>
                  <p>The Count kiſſed her hand with tranſport.—"Dear, adorable Caroline!—Let us do ſtill more; let us perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the memory of this fortunate day, ſince it is the day when Caroline is given to my arms. Let us, here, in this ſcene of bliſs, annually beſtow ſix marriage portions, and do thou, my Caroline, inform the good peaſants of the inſtitution."</p>

                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:034126_0233_0FFA691F97F03838"/>Caroline again preſſed the hand of Walſtein, ſpoke to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Walſtein, perceiving Louiſa and Juſtin in one corner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the court, with their little family, called, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Caroline. "Here, my love," ſaid he, "are ſome good people with whom you are already acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." "Ah!" ſaid Caroline, "this is the beauteous Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa."—Louiſa bluſhed and became more beautiful; for, though childbearing and the duties of her ſtation had ſomewhat faded the roſes on her cheeks, ſhe ſtill was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly handſome.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes, my Lady," ſaid Juſtin, with his open ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive countenance, which at once beſpoke the capacity of his mind and the honeſty of his heart: "You are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right; this is my beauteous Louiſa; there's not a man in the world, it's my opinion, has ſo handſome a wife, except my Lord the Count; and that is but juſt. It is the recompenſe of Heaven for having beſtowed Louiſa on the poor Juſtin."</p>
                  <p>It was now Caroline's turn to bluſh! She careſſed the two boys, who were fine little fellows, and, perceiving the pregnancy of Louiſa, prevented her petition, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, of her own accord, to ſtand god-mother to the child. Louiſa would have knelt at her feet, if Caroline would have ſuffered her: but Juſtin nothing could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain; he kiſſed the hem of her robe, and, riſing, ſaid, "Surely God loves me, for he hears and grants me all my prayers! No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſooner did I aſk him to give me Louiſa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> he put it into the heart of my Lord to make her mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then I again begged a Louiſa for my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he has found one! Well then, I next will pray him to grant my Lady two little boys, as handſome as ours; nay and I have no doubt but they will ſoon be here."</p>
                  <p>Caroline turned away, ſtooped to the children, and gave each of them a kiſs and a ducat, while Walſtein af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſhook Juſtin by the hand, and threw his purſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hat. To eſcape thanks and prevent the efforts of gratitude, which, when beyond expreſſion, are always painful, he aſked Caroline to walk in the garden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he inſtantly agreed. It was then the month of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the air was piercing, the earth covered with ſnow, and the waters with froſt, yet neither froſt nor ſnow were ſeen, nor was the ſharp air felt by Caroline and Walſtein. Never did walk in ſpring appear to them ſo delicious. Long has it been known that love can embelliſh all things, and that, where the beloved object is preſent, their is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther winter nor ſummer, ſpring nor fall. Indeed, the gardens, were remarkable for their beauty, extent, and the taſte with which they were diſpoſed; and, as ſuch, were viſited by travellers. Caroline had ſeen ſomething of them, on her other bridle day, and perhaps more than ſhe ſaw at preſent, though ſhe now walked all over them.— At length, the Count, fearing the effect of the cold, brought her back to the Chateau. Here they found a collation ſuch as the ruſtic hoards of Louiſa could afford. She had been buſy in providing cream, new cheeſe, cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, honeycombs, and a part of the kid that Juſtin had killed. "How fortunate it was," ſaid Louiſa, "that I had it ready dreſſed to regale our good old father!"</p>
                  <p>"What Joſſelin!" cried Caroline; "nay then, Louiſa, you muſt go and bring him to eat with us." Louiſa ran to ſeek him, and in the Sire came, ſupported by Juſtin, and tremulous ſtill more with joy than old age. The Count and Caroline roſe, both went to him, and each tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by an arm placed him in a great chair; after which the Count, filling him a bumper, ſaid, "Drink this, my brave Joſſelin, to the health of the happieſt of mortals!"</p>
                  <p>"And this," ſaid Juſtin, "to him who well deſerves to be the happieſt!"</p>
                  <p>Joſſelin would have ſpoken, but he was ſo much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he could only utter parts of ſentences, and raiſe his hands and eyes to heaven. After, however, having drank a third glaſs to the health of my Lady the Counteſs, and after a long look at her, he ſuddenly exclaimed—"Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God for having made ſo beauteous a Lady purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our good Lord! Oh yes! you are beautiful, madam, and very, very good! I can ſee, I am ſure you are; but you have an angel for a huſband! Did you know what he has done for us, how he preſerved, how he provided for, my Louiſa!"</p>
                  <p>And now the good Joſſelin, animated by wine, and having once begun to ſpeak, was not willing to be ſilent. He recounted the whole hiſtory, to Caroline, of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034126_0235_0FFA6925C40E9EB8"/>
of his daughter; and how he would not hear of Juſtin, and how my Lord the Count came round him, and how he gave them a good farm, and fifty ducats down, and how he had the misfortune to wound him ſelf as he went from their houſe, and how they carried him on hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to the Chateau of Ronebourg; and a thouſand other <hi>hows</hi> which Caroline knew as well as he, yet would ſhe not interrupt him; the pleaſure the old man felt in talking was a pleaſure to Caroline; nay, ſhe even liſtened with delight to this ſimple but natural village eloquence; it flowed pure from the heart, and never thought of well-placed words or ſtudied expreſſions; and particularly to the praiſe of Walſtein which was inceſſantly repeated, and which drew the ſweeteſt tears of ſenſibility to her eyes. She looked up to this dear, this beloved huſband, and ſaw his heart in ſympathy with hers; ſhe ſtretched out her hand to him with a ſoft ſmile, an expreſſion which no words can convey. Love, virtue, and happineſs were united, and this ſingle moment would have been a large compenſation for an age of pain.</p>
                  <p>Joſſelin drank, talked, and became more and more animated. He ſpoke of his houſe, his family, the care his children took of him, of his dear Juſtin, who was the beſt of ſons, of huſbands, and of fathers. "An it were to do again," ſaid he, "I would give him my Louiſa if he were not worth a groat. Not, my Lord, that your bounty has done any harm. And then when I ſee theſe two little urchins, playful, capering round me— Ah! how does it rejoice my very heart! It makes me young again; and if my dear Cicely were ſtill living, I ſhould be happier now than ever—But, pray, my Lord, what is become of our maſter's ſon, the young Baron of Lindorf? I can remember him leſs than either of theſe. Many a time have I had him in my arms: nay, I am his nurſe father, and ſhall always love him. I was told he was going to marry the ſiſter of my Lord, and right glad we were to hear it; for ſuch honourable noble ſouls ought to marry. Is it true, my Lord? Is he your brother?"</p>
                  <p>"Not yet," ſaid Caroline, riſing, and returning Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa's youngeſt boy to his other, whom, till then, ſhe had held in her lap. Juſtin and Louiſa underſtood by this it was time to retire, and Louiſa hinted as much to her father; but the old man was ſo happy, in his arm chair, with the Count, the Counteſs, and the bottle, that he
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:034126_0236_0FFA921C4F211BA0"/>
could by no means reſolve to leave them. "Let me alone, my child," ſaid he, "it is the happieſt day I ever beheld, and, at my time of life, one has not much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to loſe."—"But we are troubleſome, father," ſaid Louiſa, "to my Lord the Count."—"Not in the leaſt, I tell thee; thou art a fooliſh girl; I know him better than thou doſt; why it is his delight to ſee others happy: is it not, my Lord? Am not I right and is not ſhe wrong? But our children, now-a-days, will be wiſer than their fathers."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein ſmiled, and Caroline again ſat down, and made a ſign to Louiſa; while the old man, more happy than a monarch, began to ſing. He could not finiſh his ſong. "So it is," ſaid he, "I am good for nothing now; but I have a heart for all that. Ah! madam, if you had but heard me give the word of command! But come, ſon Juſtin, it is now thy turn. Where is thy flageolet? Play madam a tune. Louiſa ſhall ſing, and the little apes here ſhall dance. Pſhaw, what ſimpletons you are! you think of nothing: an it were not for me, here would you leave my Lord and Lady to yawn themſelves to ſleep."</p>
                  <p>Caroline having ſignified ſhe really ſhould be glad to hear Juſtin play, he took out his flageolet and played ſome allemandes, to which the little ones danced with much more grace and meaning than could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, while their mother watched every motion, and the old man chuckled as he looked at the Count and Counteſs. "Did not I tell you," ſaid he, "it was worth your ſeeing? And now, Louiſa, do thou ſing the ſong thy huſband made a few days ago."</p>
                  <p>"How! cried Caroline; "is Juſtin a poet too!"</p>
                  <p>"No, Madam, no poet," ſaid Juſtin: "I only write a couplet now and then for my Louiſa." He then play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wild pleaſing melody, by way of ſymphony, on his flageolet, and Louiſa, with the timid ſimplicity and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the village voice, ſung as follows.</p>

                  <p>Louiſa ended, and Juſtin laid down his flageolet.

The modeſt and the ſimple Juſtin ſaid it was Louiſa who had taught him every thing, for had it not been for the pleaſure he took in pleaſing her, he ſhould have known nothing. "But," ſaid Caroline, "have you compoſed this laſt ſtanza in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and without having thought on it before?"— "Not entirely," replied Juſtin; "though I do think, my Lady, I could undertake, ay, and perform too, a more difficult thing for my Lord the Count."</p>
                  <p>The heart of Caroline was full, or rather overflowing.

                  <p>"That it is not Matilda, now, who could make Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf happy?"</p>

                  <p>"Becauſe, for ſome months, he was in love with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline of Lichtfield."</p>
                  <p>"But that Caroline no longer exiſts; he will never ſee her more; in her ſtead he will find Caroline of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, who never can inſpire any thing but fraternal friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which cannot any way impede his love for Matilda. Let him but ſee her, once again, and he himſelf will not be able to comprehend how he might, for a moment, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her. I wiſh I were certain that Matilda's affections have undergone no change; there is a word in one of your letters which gave me a little uneaſineſs. Do you ſuſpect ſhe does not love Lindorf, and that the Baron de Zaſtrow"—Walſtein ſmiled, preſſed the hand of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, and interrupted her by taking out his pocket book and giving Caroline the laſt letter he had received from Matilda to read—And Oh! how much affected was ſhe as ſhe read! How often did ſhe repeat, "Dear girl! Charming Matilda! Lovely ſiſter! Yes, thou ſhalt live with us, ſhal regain thy lover, thy brother, and the tendereſt of friends. But why," added ſhe, as ſhe returned the letter to the Count, "did not you, my Lord, immediately fly to Dreſden, to give aid and eaſe to this dear ſiſter?"</p>
                  <p>"I will tell you why, my love—My Caroline was dying, and while ſhe was in danger could I leave her?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, but you anſwered Matilda's letter?"</p>
                  <p>"I did; though at preſent I wiſh I had not; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I begin to be uneaſy at her ſilence."</p>
                  <p>"Good Heaven! How you muſt have grieved her! Dear Matilda!"—Then, ſuddenly riſing, Caroline,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034126_0239_0FFA692A1123E4C8"/>
with claſped hands and ardent impetuoſity, went up to the Count, and, with a tone of moſt earneſt ſupplication, added, "My dear, dear Lord, let me beg, let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you, not to refuſe the favour I am about to aſk. Let us depart to-morrow morning for Dreſden, to relieve Matilda; I burn to be acquainted, to live with her, to give her conſolation, and I hope happineſs. Only read her letter again, and you cannot have the leaſt heſitation. She is now, perhaps, in tears, is this moment in diſtreſs, when I am ſo happy! And have I, then, dear Matilda, have I robbed thee of thy lover, and deprived theeof thy brother? Oh! how many wrongs have I done thee! No, no, never, never ſhall I be truly at eaſe, till I ſee thee as bleſt as myſelf am." Caroline ſpoke with ſo much energy, her eyes and features expreſſed ſo well her ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſhe herſelf was ſo beautiful, that Walſtein fell involuntarily on his Knee before her, where he long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with his lips fixed on her hand, without the power to anſwer a word—"Tell me, my Lord," added ſhe, with earneſtneſs, "ſhall we, are we to depart to-morrow?"</p>
                  <p>"Lovely, adorable Caroline!" cried the Count, "how well thou knoweſt my heart! My abſence from my ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the apprehenſion that ſhe may be unhappy, were the only things that could poſſibly interrupt my preſent felicity; but to leave you, Caroline, or to propoſe a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the depth of winter, and during ſuch ſevere wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was more than I could undertake."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, my Lord, now you ſurely joke. I thought it was always fine weather when one went in ſearch of a friend in the company of a lover. We ſhall paſs through Potſdam; ſhall you ſee the King?"</p>
                  <p>"By all means, my love; it is a duty I cannot neglect; and, if I might venture, I would aſk, in my turn, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caroline would—" Caroline perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Count, and bluſhed; ſhe had not ſeen the King ſince the day of her nuptials, which was now above a year; and, feeling how much cauſe he had to be diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with her conduct, ſhe trembled at the thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſented. While ſhe was laſt at Berlin, her mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and her health were ſufficient pretexts to obtain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and the Count, we have ſeen, had his reaſons for wiſhing to indulge her in this delay. At preſent, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034126_0240_0FFA9222C15BE680"/>
her inquietude, and ſtopped ſhort; but ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recovering herſelf, anſwered with an enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmile, "It is high time my Lord, is it not, I ſhould no longer remain childiſh?—Well, lead me, take me to him; I will kneel at his feet; I ſuppoſe he will ſcold me; he will do very right; for I have well deſerved his anger; but, when he has ended, I, however, will ſcold him in my turn."</p>
                  <p>"You! my angel."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I; and very ſeverely, too, for having ſigned that dreadful paper, this morning."</p>
                  <p>Each word Caroline uttered tranſported the Count with happineſs and love, even to intoxication, diſpelling every ſhadow of remaining doubt, if doubt might remain after the frank and natural manner in which ſhe had ſpoken of Lindorf, and her deſire to ſee him and Matilda united. But, no, Walſtein had no doubts; the ingenuous and affectionate Caroline knew not diſſimulation; ſhe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her feelings too forcibly, and with a conviction that deceit cannot aſſume. Had ſhe been ſilent, indeed, her eyes, her ſmiles, the pleaſure painted in her countenance, would all have ſpoken: her lips knew not falſehood, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> her features were the organs of a pure and angelic ſoul. When Caroline ſaid <hi>I love,</hi> no proteſtations, no vows, were wanting; and this ſhe had ſaid ſo often, during the courſe of that fortunate, that bliſsful day, that the Count might well remain perſuaded of her truth.—They ſupped on the kid that Juſtin had killed ſo a propos; for the Count, when he ſet off for this eſtate, was too deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted to think of food; and this ſimple repaſt was the moſt delicious either of them had ever made. Our hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory does not inform us, whether long habit made the Count, as uſual, leave Caroline's apartment after ſupper; the reader muſt, therefore, ſuppoſe what he pleaſes on the ſubject; but in the morning Caroline made the Count promiſe they ſhould ſoon return to this charming eſtate; for, added ſhe, with a ſoftened voice and downcaſt eyes, "I ſhall love it as long as I live!"</p>
                  <p>In proportion as they drew near to Potſdam, the fears of Caroline augmented: this the Count perceived, and endeavoured to inſpire her with fortitude. He related a thouſand traits of the King's goodneſs to him, "who," ſaid he, "is more than my King, he is my friend. Yes, dear Caroline, it is to my friend I am going to preſent
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034126_0241_0FFA693448BC2520"/>
one who will make life a continued dream of felicity, and one whom I received from himſelf. Had you heard him yeſterday morning, how long he perſiſted to refuſe the cruel favour I came to beg, and when, at laſt, he yielded to my perſecutions and ſigned that fatal paper, had you ſeen him return it to me, you would have no fears.— 'Reflect, think again dear Walſtein,' ſaid he. 'I am truly grieved at your determination. I wiſhed to make you happy, and ſtill I think you might be ſo; it is with infinite regret I have ſigned the paper, and I ſincerely hope you will make no uſe of it.' Such, Caroline, is the monarch who ſoon is to be a witneſs of the felicity of his friend."</p>
                  <p>By this time they were in the court of the palace, and the Count, alighting, leſs Caroline in the carriage. The King, according to his cuſtom, was mounting his horſe to ride round the fort and exerciſe his troops. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Walſtein and ſtopped—"Ah! are you there, Count?" ſaid he; "I am glad to ſee you; I thought of you all day yeſterday, and, though I ſaw the High Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain, did not mention a word of what has paſſed. Do not be raſh, let me, myſelf, ſpeak to Caroline. I ſcarcely can conſent—"</p>
                  <p>"My gracious Sovereign, ſhe is here!"</p>
                  <p>"Who?"</p>
                  <p>"Caroline! My wife! My lovely, my adored wife! The wife your Majeſty beſtowed on me, and who is now more beloved, more dear than ever!"</p>
                  <p>"Are you in your ſenſes, Walſtein?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly, Sir; it was yeſterday morning that I was frantic; but Caroline has reſtored me to reaſon, life, and bliſs! She loves me, wiſhes to be mine, and once more I throw myſelf at your Majeſty's feet to beg her as the greateſt of all bleſſings your royal bounty could grant!"</p>
                  <p>Yes, the Count was kneeling to the King; who, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not perfectly underſtanding how a woman might be the cauſe of all this delirium, laughed, bade him "riſe and explain." The Count obeyed; related the deſpair of Caroline, her arrival at Walſtein, their preſent intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed journey to Dreſden, for which he now aſked the King's permiſſion, and, afterwards, earneſtly entreated his Majeſty's confirmation of their union before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Both were willingly granted, and the Monarch himſelf went up to Caroline, who was ſtill waiting in
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034126_0242_0FFA9224A38CFF78"/>
her carriage till the Count's return. She was a great deal affected at ſeeing the King approach, and would have deſcended from the coach, but the King ſaid to her,— "Stay where you are, Lady Walſtein, ſtay where you are; all is well; forget what is paſt. I am ſatisfied, live happy, and let me have as many ſubjects as poſſible like yourſelves. Walſtein, make no delay, depart, return as ſoon as you can, and bring with you the lovely Matilda." His Majeſty then took the Count by the hand, ſaluted Caroline, and left them both exceedingly moved by this benevolent condeſcenſion, which Kings are ſo ſeldom diſpoſed to beſtow. They ſet off immediately for Berlin, made preparations for their journey, and were ſoon on their road to Dreſden, anticipating, the mutual pleaſure the meeting with Matilda would occaſion. The Count foreſaw many difficulties which might ariſe from his aunt and young De Zaſtrow, but was determined to overcome them all, and bring Matilda to Berlin. He concealed his fears from Caroline, whoſe hopes ran high, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs was great, in thinking ſhe ſhould gain a ſiſter and a friend. We have before related how deſirous ſhe was of a bleſſing ſo neceſſary and ſo precious; and to have the ſiſter of Walſtein for this friend, with whom ſhe might converſe, while he was abſent, of all her paſt and preſent feelings, certain of being heard with an intereſt almoſt equal to her own was to double this bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>To love is not ſufficient; friendſhip, to whom love may unboſom itſelf, is alſo neceſſary: and Caroline, already, felt the delicious tranſports of telling Matilda how dearly ſhe loved her brother. In this their impatience, for the Count was as deſirous as Caroline of being at Dreſden, they travelled the two firſt days with all poſſible ſpeed, making no ſtay, by day, except to change horſes, and at night only taking two or three hours repoſe. But the ſtrength of Caroline by no means equalled her wiſhes, and the ſecond evening ſhe found herſelf ſo fatigued, ſhe was was obliged, when they came to a ſmall village, to entreat the Count would go no farther that night. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, it may well be ſuppoſed, readily conſented; but, ſuſpecting the accomodations would not be very good, he ſent a ſervant before to procure a bed. At laſt they were met, at the end of the village, by the ſervant, with the landlord of a ſmall indifferent inn. Our hoſt, judging by the attendants his gueſts were great people, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034126_0243_0FFA693A84DDA6B8"/>
to loſe the promiſed harveſt, came himſelf, to make it the more ſecure. He had only two bed-chambers, each with two beds, and both theſe were in the poſſeſſion of a young gentleman and his lady, who had arrived the evening before. The huſband had a wound in his arm, which, by the motion of the carriage, had been opened; and this was likely to detain him ſome days longer: for which reaſon, to make certain of the two chambers, he had paid for them beforehand. This, however, did not much embarraſs our hoſt, who was a merry, unpoliſhed, country fellow.</p>
                  <p>"I warrant me." ſaid he, "they will let you have one of the chambers, for what occaſion have they for two? They are ſo loving, and ſo handſome, that they are never aſunder all day; and why may they not as well be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all night? No, no; they will not be vexed at that."</p>
                  <p>The hoſt kept talking till they came to the inn, but the Count, however, thought it neceſſary to go himſelf, and entreat the ſtrangers to ſuffer the Counteſs to lie in one of the beds. Meanwhile the hoſteſs ſhewed Caroline into her own chamber. The Count went up a dark ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe and wanted the landlord to introduce him; but he, little uſed to the forms of good breeding, led him into a kind of entry, at the far end of which was a door open, and, telling the Count he would find them there, left him to introduce himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Walſtein advanced, and ſaw a young lady at the farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the chamber, elegantly dreſſed, and tying a black ſcarf round the neck of a young gentleman, ſo as to ſupport his arm. As her white and charming hand paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his cheek he employed his other arm to ſeize and kiſs it with rapture. The picture was intereſting, and the Count durſt not diſturb the young couple, whom he ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beheld, remembering his own happineſs. Fearing to be thought rude, after ſtanding a moment, he was going to retire; but the young lady, happening to look towards the door, ſaw him, gazed for a moment, flew to him with open arms, and, with aſtoniſhment in her countenance, exclaimed, "It is my brother! my dear dear brother!"</p>
                  <p>Lindorf (Yes! it was Lindorf himſelf!) forgot his wound, and inſtantly roſe—"Heavens! Is it poſſible! Can it be Walſtein?"—Walſtein it was, and Lindorf preſſed him to his boſom; while Matilda, hanging round
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034126_0244_0FFA92274D096AE8"/>
his neck, kiſſed and kiſſed, and knew not whether to weep or dance for joy.</p>
                  <p>Need we ſay the Count was aſtoniſhed?—Matilda and Lindorf! His ſiſter and his friend both in his arms! Had his ſenſes refuſed belief his heart would have convinced him it was truth; and, though unable to comprehend by what miracle he might find two ſuch people in ſuch a place, he, nevertheleſs, yielded to all the tranſport the prodigy inſpired. For ſome time, Lindorf! Matilda! Brother! Siſter! Friend! Interjections, and exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only were uttered, only were heard—The Count ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the name of Caroline, and, at length, ſaid, "She is here, dear Matilda, here, with me, let us go to her."</p>
                  <p>"Here! Caroline here! My ſiſter here!" cried Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda.</p>
                  <p>Light and ſwift as the young greyhound at his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſter's voice, Matilda flies down ſtairs and already is in the arms of Caroline, who, preſently, knew her; more indeed from her affectionate careſſes, and the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed epithet, of "dear dear ſiſter," than from the portrait of Lindorf. The gentlemen followed, and the ſurpriſe of Caroline increaſed; but ſurpriſe and pleaſure of the pureſt nature were her only ſenſations. Lindorf is her brother, and her friend, and ſhe heſitates not to kiſs him with that frank and natural tenderneſs by which true and ſimple friendſhip ſo well is characterized. "And may I, then, call you brother!" ſaid ſhe; "may I tell you I love you! Oh! yes, I know not how much I ſhall love the huſband of my dear Matilda, and the friend of my dear, dear, dear Walſtein!"</p>
                  <p>This open ingenuous manner would have taught Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf, had he himſelf been inſenſible of, his duty. He certainly feared to meet Caroline: the ſcenes that had ſo lately paſſed could not be totally ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iterated from his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; but the manner in which ſhe received him, the tone of voice in which ſhe uttered thoſe few words, in the preſence of Walſtein and Matilda, wholly deprived him of all dread, either of himſelf or her. He was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find that the redoubted Caroline was no more than the wife of his friend and the ſiſter of Matilda; and for whom he felt no ſenſations beyond theſe tranquil and legitimate bounds—"Yes," anſwered he, with fortitude and enthuſiaſm, "yes, Caroline, I am your brother, your friend, the friend of Walſtein, and I feel myſelf worthy
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034126_0245_0FFA91E0A6E7F9E8"/>
of theſe titles, which are become ſo dear, ſo ineſtimable!" Then, ſeizing the hand of Matilda—"Dear Count," ſaid he, "you invited me to return, and promiſed me happineſs. Here, as the ultimate happineſs to which I aſpire, let me receive this hand, which once was promiſed me from my Walſtein, I think my future life will prove I know its value."</p>
                  <p>The Count was not long in conſidering an anſwer, and his reply was accompanied with an earneſt wiſh to hear what ſtrange circumſtances had united them; if they were yet married; what had occaſioned the wound of Lindorf; where they were going, whence they came; and, in fine, the full explanation of what, at preſent, ſeemed ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enigmatical. We are not without our hopes that the reader, in ſome degree, participates the Count's curioſity; and that he now imagines himſelf in the ruſtic chamber of a ruſtic inn, in company with four perſons, the moſt happy the earth contained, feeling all that love and ſweet friendſhip can feel, ſeated round an antique chimney, ſpeaking all at once, and each aſking a thouſand queſtions without yet waiting for a ſingle reply.</p>
                  <p>And now behold the lovely Matilda weeping and laughing both at once, kiſſing her brother, embracing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline, holding out one hand to her dear Lindorf, and then, ſuddenly, with a mighty grave face, and ſerious tone, commanding ſilence! "Yes, ſilence! For one full quarter of an hour, I impoſe ſilence on you all," ſaid ſhe, ſeating herſelf erect; "for, I aſſure you, I am not a little vain of having a ſtory to relate. It is almoſt as ſingular," ſaid ſhe to her brother, "as the fine tales you uſed to tell me when I was a very little, little girl."— Silence being thus obtained, and the eyes of the reſt fixed on Matilda, ſhe, addreſſing herſelf to the Count, thus began:</p>
                  <p>"There was a bird-catcher—"</p>
                  <p>"A bird-catcher!" exclaimed they all at once.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, a bird-catcher," replied ſhe, with great gravity. "Before I begin my hiſtory I firſt intend to relate a little fable and put a queſtion to my brother. Do not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, I ſhall ſoon have done—There was once a bird-catcher who, by his tricks and artifices, enticed a poor little bird into his nets. Ah! how wretched was that poor little bird! How did it beat its wings in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and call all its friends to its aſſiſtance! But
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034126_0246_0FFA9229F4157F00"/>
the bird-catcher took care not one of them ſhould hear its cries. At laſt came a linnet, and flew round the net in which it was entangled. 'Poor little bird,' ſaid the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, 'thou wouldeſt lament ſtill louder if thou kneweſt all the miſchief that awaits thee. To-morrow they will clip thy wings, for ever deprive thee of thy liberty, ſhut thee up in a cage with a bird thou doſt not love, and forever prevent thy meeting the mate thou haſt left at freedom in the groves.' Then did the little bird, at hearing this, cry ſtill louder; and the linnet was ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it ſaid, 'Let us try if there are no means to ſave thee.' Whereupon they both began to peck at the threads of the net, and, crack, by and by one of them was broken; ſo that the little bird got firſt its head out, next one of its wings, at laſt both, ſpread them, vaulted aloft in air and flew, right joyous, again to find its friends and former happineſs.</p>
                  <p>"And now tell me, dear brother, whether was the bird-catcher, who thus tried to deprive the poor little bird of its liberty, or the poor little bird, that endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to regain this liberty, wrong?"</p>
                  <p>"The bird-catcher, my dear girl," cried the Count, enchanted at the art, ſimplicity, and grace ſhe had min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in her apologue. "The charming little bird will never be wrong if it appeals to me; for I am certain my heart will approve what even my reaſon may condemn."</p>
                  <p>Matilda, inſtantly, claſped the neck of Walſtein, and with tears of joy exclaimed, "I have found my brother; he is ſtill the ſame, ever benevolent and ever good, and I no longer dread either his reproaches or my own.— Surely I did right in quitting thoſe malicious people, who made me doubt his friendſhip."</p>
                  <p>"Doubt my friendſhip! Dear Matilda, let me beg you to explain your meaning."—"Yes," continued ſhe, with vivacity, "they have had the cruelty to ſay, nay, even to prove, you no longer loved me, wrote to me no longer, and would ſee me no more: that you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid me to think of Lindorf, commanded me to marry the Baron de Zaſtrow, had departed for Ruſſia, and, in fact, that I had no longer any brother, for it was the ſame thing."</p>
                  <p>Matilda could not proceed, and the tears ran down her lovely roſy cheeks<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; yet, while ſhe wept ſhe ſmiled: it was a ſummer ſhower which refreſhens nature and inſpires new pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:034126_0247_0FFA91E35DD58AF0"/>"What a child am I!" ſaid ſhe; "I knew it was all falſe; I enjoy your company, here you are, you love me, and yet you ſee the ſuppoſition makes me weep: but no, I will laugh; and now—there, now will I relate the full and whole hiſtory of the poor little bird."</p>
                  <p>Before ſhe began, the Count aſked ſeveral queſtions concerning what they had told her againſt him, and found his aunt had intercepted and concealed the letter in which he had promiſed his ſiſter ſoon to come to Dreſden, and ſet her free. She managed ſo as to make Matilda believe the Count had written to her, his aunt. His wiſh that ſhe might marry the Baron de Zaſtrow was changed into a poſitive command, and the voyage of Lindorf into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was a love affair, and a project of marriage with an Engliſh lady. The letter of the Count, inſtead of Rone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, was dated at Peterſburg; and the innocent Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, being ſhewn her brother's hand-writing, was the dupe of all theſe artifices. The arrival of the Count, it is true, would ſoon undeceive her; but they hoped to have Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda married before that happened, and ſince the Count had wiſhed, he certainly would eaſily be brought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the marriage.</p>
                  <p>Had Matilda been of a leſs determined character her aunt would, no doubt, have obtained her end; but ſhe found an oppoſition, a fortitude which nothing could ſhake. It ſeemed inconceivable to young De Zaſtrow; for never, till then, had he ſuppoſed it poſſible to reſiſt the elegance, the graces, and the charms he had acquired in his travels. A year's reſidence at Paris, his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with certain noble and faſhionable gameſters there, and his ſucceſs with actreſſes, who had made moſt heavy demands on his purſe, had ſo convinced him of his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible merit, that he had imagined nothing more was neceſſary, in order to conquer, than to appear. To his aunt he left the care of courtſhip, and thought Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da had every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

no doubt but ſhe would <hi>ſtrike.</hi> All which he ſaid look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at himſelf in the glaſs, admiring his leg, diſplaying the brilliant on his finger, and, occaſionally, interrupting himſelf to expatiate on the merits of certain faſhionable baubles he had brought from France.</p>
                  <p>"Such," ſaid Matilda, "is the being with whom my aunt is ſo enraptured; to whom ſhe was determined to marry me; and of whoſe perſon, wit, and paſſion, ſhe was continually vaunting.

"You ſee," ſaid ſhe, "your brother has changed his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion."—Yes, madam," anſwered I, "but his opinion has not changed my heart."—"Your Lindorf no longer loves you."—"And muſt I puniſh myſelf for his infidelity?" "You will never ſee him again."—"I may love him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, and keep my promiſe."—"But his inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy releaſes you."—"Not in the leaſt; his inconſtancy releaſes himſelf, but if I am not inconſtant is that my fault? Or can he, or you, or I myſelf, or any other being in the world, make me forget to love him and teach me to love another?" (What did Lindorf feel as thus Matilda ſpoke!)</p>
                  <p>"Theſe converſations uſually ended in ill-humour. I was, by turns, ſcolded, careſſed, flattered and menaced: and notwithſtanding all my firmneſs, was almoſt driven to deſpair.

                  <p>"When I arrived at Dreſden, Mademoiſelle de Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teul, an amiable girl, but ſomewhat older than I, had been exceedingly polite to me, and the intimacy of the family at my aunt's occaſioned me to ſee her often. She long had loſt her mother, and lived with an old gouty father and younger brother; therefore, enjoyed a liberty which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her houſe and acquaintance exceedingly agreeable, and ſhe was continually, either with me or inviting me to viſit her.</p>
                  <p>"Flattered by the friendſhip of a young lady of five-and-twenty, I returned her politeneſs, and we became as familiar as circumſtances would permit. Somewhat ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid, on account of the differance of our age, which ſhe, however, endeavoured to make me forget, I, though moſt deſirous of a confidante, durſt not tell her the ſecret of my heart. She had a kind of—of forwardneſs in her manner, owing to her education, and was, likewiſe, moſt intimate with my aunt, to whom ſhe aſſiduouſly paid her court; beſide which ſhe had an evident partiality in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Baron de Zaſtrow, ſo that I feared making an additional enemy, inſtead of a friend. I could with much greater eaſe have confided my thoughts to her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe age was nearer my own, and whoſe mild and manly character might render him more indulgent; but he alſo was the friend of the young Baron, and, indeed, rather ſeemed to avoid than to ſeek being alone with me, and it was not long before he informed us he was going to travel for ſome years.</p>

Gently raiſing, ſhe aſked me what it meant. "Matilda!" ſaid ſhe, "my dear Matilda! Why are you thus overjoyed? What is it that thus can agitate you?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! read, read—read yourſelf," ſaid I, pointing to a certain paſſage in the letter; "this will be my explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;" and while ſhe read, again I hid my face in her boſom.</p>
                  <p>"I have had the happineſs," ſaid M. de Manteul to his ſiſter, "to meet with the Baron of Lindorf, at Hamburgh, a captain of the Pruſſian guards, and hope we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intimate friends.—We have been ſhipmates toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lodge in the ſame houſe. We are ſeldom aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, our tempers and diſpoſitions accord wonderfully, for he, like me, is melancholy, apt to be abſent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets his country. Without being his confidant, I dare pronounce his heart is not more free than mine."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! exclaimed I, raiſing my head and joining my hands, "it is not true, then, that he loves an Engliſh la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or that he has been ſix months married! My heart told me it was not!"</p>
                  <p>"But who, who are you ſpeaking of? Do you know this Baron of Lindorf?"</p>
                  <p>"Do I know him!"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, do you know him? Do you love him?"</p>
                  <p>"Love him! Better than life! Beyond all thought!"</p>
                  <p>"And thus, from queſtion to queſtion, Mademoiſelle de Manteul became the confidante of all my ſecrets, and fully informed of my ſituation. I related your friendſhip, my dear brother, with Lindorf, and your deſire to ſee us united; but, as one muſt always reſerve a little of one's wealth for one's ſelf, I did not tell her that you had changed your opinion; though I let her know my doubts and fears concerning Lindorf, which her ſilence ſeemed to confirm. Yet was it poſſible, and I endeavoured to perſuade myſelf it was true, that the difficulty of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his letters to me was the reaſon why I received none.

                  <p>"But what is Lindorf doing in England?"</p>
                  <p>"Alas! I know not; cannot comprehend. I have not heard from him theſe ſix months!"</p>
                  <p>"And why do you not write?"</p>

                  <p>"Oh! I cannot deceive. I have always told him, and always ſhall tell him, I will love none but Lindorf."</p>
                  <p>"And what is his anſwer?"</p>
                  <p>"That he has no faith in eternal conſtancy."</p>
                  <p>"He has not! I underſtand him. But we will prove what women are capable of; ſhall we not, my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda?"</p>
                  <p>"I moſt ſincerely promiſed we would, and left her, more than ever determined on unſhaken conſtancy and reſiſtance."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein, here, ſmiled; and whiſpered ſomething to Lindorf, which the latter returned with like ſignificance. The ladies, and eſpecially Matilda, deſired to know what they ſaid.—"Oh! I promiſe you, you ſhall know by and by; but go on, my dear girl, with your ſtory. You were telling us of the tender friendſhip of Mademoiſelle de Manteul."—"I was," replied Matilda, with ardour; and never, perhaps, was friendſhip like hers; as you would have ſaid, had you heard her ſpeak, ſeen her eagerneſs, and her zeal. You would have ſuppoſed the ſecret he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I might, perhaps, have ſuſpected myſelf; but my friend was five- and twenty, was therefore prudent, and, certainly, would not give me ill counſel. Determined, therefore, with all poſſible obſtinacy, not to yield, I waited, but not with dread, for the anſwer of Lindorf; perſuaded he would tell me truth, and, if I found I was no longer beloved, my reſolution was taken."</p>
                  <p>"Why, what would you have done?" ſaid Caroline with vivacity.</p>
                  <p>"Every thing I could to have forgotten him; but, at the ſame time, have kept the vow I made, never to marry, never to truſt a perfidious ſex, capable of loving twice."</p>
                  <p>This was very innocently ſaid, but it was a dagger to the feeling heart of Caroline. She bluſhed exceſſively, caſt her fine eyes on the ground, half looked up at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein, and, as inſtantly, again looked down. He ſaw her charming confuſion, enjoyed it for a moment, tenderly, kiſſed her hand, then, addreſſing himſelf to Lindorf, ſaid,

"You, my friend, no doubt, approve Matilda's mode of thinking, and, perhaps, you are right; but each perſon has his opinion. I think nothing can be more flattering than to be the ſecond object of the attachment of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender heart; and I ſhould think this attachment more durable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more certain, than that of a heart that never had occaſion to ſuſpect and be aware of itſelf."</p>
                  <p>"How!" exclaimed Matilda; "does my brother Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein preach inconſtancy?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not think a ſecond paſſion deſerves the name, and I only admit of being twice in love."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! No oftener?"</p>
                  <p>"No, certainly; no oftener," ſaid Caroline, faintly, and preſſing the hand of Walſtein to her boſom.</p>
                  <p>"Well, for my part," replied Matilda, "I find the firſt time once too often, and that women are very ſilly creatures ever to love, ſince love has ſo many pangs for them and ſo few for the men. Here was this good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman amuſing himſelf, in all tranquillity, at London, while I was ſcolded, perſecuted, and deſpairing from morning till night—(Lindorf with a look petitioned mercy; Matilda ſmiled and continued)—I found myſelf, however, much leſs unhappy ſince I had gained a friend, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Nay, ſhe was even complaiſant enough to admit his viſits and endure his converſations, for whole hours, to ſerve me, and adviſed me to invite him to come on thoſe evenings I was to viſit her. "That will be the means of amuſing him and not expoſing yourſelf," ſaid ſhe; "and, likewiſe, of pleaſing your aunt.

                  <p>"My aunt now became very good-humoured, teaſed me no more, and I hoped, thus, to gain time; but it is now three days ſince ſhe brought me two large ſheets of paper, commanded me to read them, ſign which I pleaſed, and left me in utter aſtoniſhment. They ſeemed like two large contracts! And was I then permitted to chooſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lindorf and de Zaſtrow? Such for a moment were my hopes; but I ſoon ſaw they both related to the odious de Zaſtrow, whom I hated more and more. One

How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly did I ſign the conveyance, and run with it, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſkipping, into my aunt's apartment! Her nephew was with her. "There, there, there!" ſaid I; "it is done; I have ſigned it, moſt willingly." Young de Zaſtrow, as vain and ſelf-ſufficient as ever, had not the leaſt doubt but it was the marriage contract, and, kneeling, returned me a thouſand thanks for my condeſcenſion. "I am quite delighted, Sir," ſaid I, laughing, "to ſee you ſo pleaſed, though really, you owe me no thanks, I not having the leaſt merit, for I have only followed my own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."</p>

I ſpoke this with ſo firm a tone that ſhe offered no reply, but aſked me what it was <hi>I juſt had heard.</hi> I then repeated my aunt's converſation; and, ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting me, ſhe exclaimed, "If they have deceived you in one reſpect they may have in another, and, it is my firm opinion, your brother is not in Ruſſia, for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have heard ſomething as well as you— I will go immediately to your aunt, and, if I am not miſtaken, preſently diſcover the truth. We then ſhall know what we have to do."</p>
                  <p>"She went, and it was not long before ſhe returned. Pleaſure ſparkled in her eyes. "I was right in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe entered; "they have impoſed upon you; your brother is at Berlin, married to a lovely lady; his letters have been intercepted, he is ſoon coming to Dreſden, but they are determined to marry you, with or without your conſent, before his arrival. To-morrow you will be forced to ſign the contract; nay, they will even guide your hand, if you will not ſign it willingly, and the day following you are to be married. All this has your aunt told me in ſecrecy."</p>
                  <p>"My niece has promiſed," ſaid ſhe, "and ſhe ſhall keep her promiſe."</p>

                  <p>"Why I really thought it would pleaſe you to hear your brother is at Berlin, and that you may, if you pleaſe, free yourſelf from their tyranny."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps I might—but—"</p>
                  <p>"But—What, and is all your courage gone ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly?—Ah! poor Matilda! I perceive you never will have the reſolution to remain firm.

                  <p>"Cruel friend," replied I, with chagrin; "is this your conſolation?"</p>
                  <p>"What would you have me ſay to a feeble and timid child, who does not know her own mind? Thoſe evils we want the fortitude to rid ourſelves of we muſt endure; and I can aſſure that, in two days, if you are at Dreſden, you will be the Baroneſs de Zaſtrow."</p>
                  <p>"Never, never," anſwered I, with enthuſiaſm— "Never ſhall that hated name be mine. I will prove that this feeble and timid child has more reſolution than you ſuſpect; nay, has enough to face even death itſelf."</p>
                  <p>"Die! pſhaw! Who would die, when they may live, and live happily?"</p>
                  <p>"I ſee no means; it is impoſſible. I cannot go by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Berlin. I ſhould loſe myſelf a thouſand times; neither ſhould I ever have the ſtrength to get thither."</p>
                  <p>"Mademoiſelle de Manteul could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—"Poor girl! And ſo you thought I meant to ſend you to Berlin, alone, and on foot, a fugitive h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, no doubt, would be vaſtly cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and intereſting, but the way I mean to propoſe is much leſs dangerous and more ſimple. One of my former maids is married to the poſt-maſter of the city. She is entirely devoted to me, and her huſband will not only furniſh a chaiſe and horſes but drive you himſelf; will accompany you till you get ſafe to your brother, and, if you pleaſe, you may now eſcape, and wait at their houſe till you ſet off. You have your choice to do this or marry de Zaſtrow; for there is no alternative; you muſt determine for the

                  <p>"My choice is made," ſaid I, inſtantly, "and, ſure, I am moſt fortunate in a friend. I will fly to my brother, who will protect me for my Lindorf—And yet it is a great crime to deceive my aunt."</p>

                  <p>"I will be gone," cried I; neither ſcruples nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe ſhall ſtay me. I am ſhamefully treated, and I have no longer any other inquietude than that which the fear of eſcaping in ſafety gives."</p>

I returned, and Mademoiſelle de Manteul, terrified at ſeeing me, thought I had met ſome one on the ſtairs.— Scarcely had I begun to tell her what brought me back before ſhe interrupted me. "You are mad," ſaid ſhe: "Write a letter! Give your aunt time to come and catch you! She told me ſhe was coming up preſently—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, begone! They are not ſo eaſy to be perſuaded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are going to kill themſelves as you are!"</p>
                  <p>"The fear of being caught made me compliant, and I got out without being perceived. I had not far to go, nor was it long before my friends came to me. "We have a whole hour to take our meaſures in," ſaid ſhe;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034126_0261_0FFA9264DD241158"/>
"they think you are aſleep, and I adviſed them to leave you in peace, at preſent. The firſt thing you have to do, therefore, is to go to the poſt-houſe; for, ſhould they find you abſent, they will come to ſeek you here immediately. You will there remain in ſafety. If you want any money I can aſſiſt you."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks to your goodneſs my brother, I did not want this kind of aſſiſtance. My friend, therefore, went with me to the miſtreſs of the poſt-houſe, who conſented to every thing ſhe propoſed, and with whom ſhe left me. It was very probable they would come to ſeek me at the houſe of Mademoiſelle de Manteul, and, therefore, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhe ſhould be at home to avoid ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>"No ſooner was I alone than I began to be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at the terror of my aunt, when ſhe found me gone and was wholly ignorant what was become of me. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and ſlight were ſufficient offences, and needed not aggravation. I, therefore, reſolved to repair them, as far as was in my power, and, having called for pen, ink, and paper, wrote nearly thus:</p>

                  <p>"I gave this note in charge to one of the landlady's children, and bade him deliver it to the porter, without ſaying who it came from. More at eaſe, now I thought my aunt would be ſo too, I waited with tolerable patience for Mademoiſelle de Manteul, who had promiſed to ſee me again before I ſet off, and who, at length, came.</p>
                  <p>"You have not a moment to loſe," ſaid ſhe, "you muſt depart at day-break; the Baron is ſearching you through

every houſe in town; he has juſt left ours, and I encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him to continue his ſearch, which will give you time to get the ſtart. It was exceedingly lucky you did not write, as your ſilly whim would have made you."— I durſt not confeſs I juſt had wrote, but I now felt my imprudence, and the fear of being purſued was ſo ſtrong that I was unwilling to go. My friend employed all her eloquence to encourage me; ſhe deſcribed the anger of my aunt, the neceſſity I ſhould be under of confeſſing where I had been, and who had aſſiſted me, the aſcendant which my elopement and return would give her over me; told me there would be no poſſibility of appeaſing but by obeying her, and that, if ever I entered her houſe again, ſhe was certain I ſhould be married within two hours—"I will go," ſaid I, "I will go inſtantly: the die is caſt, and, be the event what it will, I will go; and accordingly orders to get the chaiſe and horſes ready were immediately given. Mademoiſelle de Manteul, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I again ſhould relapſe, would not leave me. She was under no apprehenſions about her father, whoſe gout kept him at home; ſhe ſent him word that ſhe ſhould ſup out, and remained with me till the moment of departure. Of de Zaſtrow, of my brother, of Lindorf, of every thing that might encourage me to keep my reſolution, ſhe ſpoke. "Depend on me," ſaid ſhe; "I will go, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to de Zaſtrow, and lead him to ſuſpect you are flown to England. He ſhall not eaſily get away from me, and by that time you will be ſo far on the way to Berlin that all purſuit will be in vain." This gave me a little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; or, rather, it was now too late to liſten to fear. To recede was no longer poſſible, and I beheld the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of departure arrive with pleaſure. Unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs my gratitude, except by my kiſſes and tears, while my friend was enraptured to ſee me, as ſhe ſaid, eſcape ſo many dangers, I got into the chaiſe and—"</p>
                  <p>"Alone!" interrupted the Count.</p>
                  <p>"No; the miſtreſs of the houſe, who is now with me, and who, formerly, as I ſaid, had ſerved Mademoiſelle de Manteul, whoſe huſband conducted us—"</p>
                  <p>"But where is Lindorf?" replied the Count, again ſtopping her ſhort. "It ſeems that Mademoiſelle de Manteul, not he, has carried you off."</p>
                  <p>"And did you think it was Lindorf?"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:034126_0263_0FFA926680E99CB0"/>"I own, I am glad to find it was not; though there ſeems ſomething incomprehenſible in all this!"</p>
                  <p>"A little patience, brother, and you will not hereafter judge of your Matilda from appearances.</p>
                  <p>"And now, behold me in the poſt-chaiſe, with the good Marianne, for that is her name; eſcorted by her huſband, on horſeback, ſtopping only to change horſes, toſſing ducats into the poſtillions' hats, and taking each buſh for the Baron de Zaſtrow. My companion did all ſhe could to inſpire courage. Mademoiſelle de Manteul was her oracle, and ſhe, every minute, repeated "There was nothing to fear, for Mademoiſelle had told her ſo." Theſe aſſurances made me more tranquil: and, having travelled the firſt day without interruption, I thought myſelf in perfect ſafety. Juſt, however, as we came yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday to the poſt-houſe I, very imprudently, put my head out of the carriage, and preſently heard a voice, I thought I knew, cry, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>"De Zaſtrow!" cried the Count and Caroline.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; De Zaſtrow, and without the help of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. What, you ſuppoſe ſome malicious fairy has winged him through the air? Nay, to ſay the truth, I ſuppoſed ſo myſelf, at firſt; but, alas! I ſoon found this good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fairy was neither more nor leſs than my own impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The note I had written had indicated the road I ſhould take, and the Baron had not loſt his time in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch at Dreſden. He ſuppoſed I had, no doubt, written it in the carriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that, by ſetting off immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, he ſhould eaſily overtake and bring me back; and this ſuppoſition made him depart two or three hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. I imagined myſelf purſued while, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I was full ſpeed purſuing, and, unfortunately enough, overtook him at his poſt-houſe, where he was waiting for horſes. How great muſt have been the ſurpriſe of my dear friend, Mademoiſelle de Manteul, when ſhe found, in the morning, he was gone! And how exceſſive her inquietude and fears for me! At preſent, however, I hope ſhe is eaſier."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," ſaid the Count, ſmiling, "ſhe is eaſy enough, never fear. But go on with your ſtory, it is quite romantic."</p>

De Zaſtrow threatened and bade him ſtop, his ſervants came up, and the crowd increaſed. Something muſt be done, and I thought it beſt to ſpeak to the Baron, to aſk him by what right he interrupted me, or pretended to deprive me of my liberty, and to tell him, openly, I would rather die than either marry him or return to Dreſden.

Then, with her head reclining on the ſhoulder of Caroline, ſhe whiſpered, "I hope he will not tell how I ſprang into his arms and claſped him in mine with all my ſtrength."</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye, let me conjure thee, dear Lindorf, to go on," ſaid the Count, impatiently; "p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My being there at this moment was accidental, but I was not in company with the Baron de Zaſtrow. It was chance, or, rather, my guardian genius that brought me to the poſt-houſe juſt then. I was unacquainted with the Baron, but I ſaw a young man of quality, impatient to obtain horſes, and quite furious becauſe none were to be found. He enquired, at the ſame time, if a young lady, whom he endeavoured to deſcribe, had not lately paſſed

that road. They anſwered, No, and he again began to ſwear it was falſe, ſhe muſt have paſſed, and again to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his curſes on the poſtillions and the poſt-maſter. As ſoon as I alighted from my chaiſe, for I was going to Dreſden, he came up and ſaid, "You, certainly, Sir, muſt have met a young lady, alone, driving full ſpeed!"</p>
                  <p>"No, Sir, I aſſure you, I met no ſuch lady; nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, any lady that I remember."</p>
                  <p>"This is very extraordinary!" ſaid he, ſtamping— "Perhaps the note was a new trick!—Excuſe me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, for queſtioning you ſo abruptly. I am purſuing a woman I adore, who promiſed me her hand yeſterday, was to have married me to-day, and who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"The misfortune is the greater," anſwered I, "Sir, becauſe you do not ſeem that kind of perſon the ladies would fly." My compliment ſeemed to pleaſe him, and acquired me his entire confidence. He bowed, and with much ſelf-ſufficiency, which he endeavoured to render modeſt, replied, "I own, Sir, it is not the firſt time I have been told ſo; and there have been ladies who have gone farther than telling; but you ſee how different taſtes are; and, certainly, that of women is very often very capricious. Is it not quite extraordinary that ſhe I am purſuing is not yet eighteen; and that, notwithſtanding, ſhe has a whim of romantic fidelity for a lover who has forſaken her, and whom ſhe will never ſee again? I am unacquainted with him, but ſhould ſuppoſe perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments not infinitely in his favour; and, as to birth and fortune, in theſe I yield to no man."</p>
                  <p>"All this, Sir, I make no doubt, is true; but if your rival has the advantage of being beloved—"</p>
                  <p>"Beloved or not beloved," ſaid he, "it is equal to me; he is abſent, will ſee her no more; if I can overtake her ſhe is mine, and ſhall be obliged to adore me."</p>
                  <p>"This converſation paſſed before the poſt-houſe, and I was amazed at the facility with which this indiſcreet and vain young man ſpoke to a ſtranger, as well as at his total want of delicacy, and ſilently approved the fugitive lady. Juſt then a chaiſe came up, full gallop, from Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and interrupted us. He did not ſeem to have the leaſt ſuſpicion, and looked towards it from mere curioſity, till, the chaiſe ſtopping, a lady looked out. I had but a glimpſe, and did not know it was Matilda, but my gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman inſtantly exclaimed, "It is ſhe! It is ſhe!" While
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:034126_0266_0FFA615B717D99F8"/>
the lady drew back, exclaiming, in her turn, "It is he!" The maid bid the poſtillion drive on, while de Zaſtrow, with uplifted cane, threatened to knock him off his horſe if he moved a ſtep. I heſitated, for a moment, what part I ſhould take. The frankneſs of the youth had, in ſome meaſure, laid me under an obligation; and yet I felt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affected for the unfortunate lady, whom they were going to marry againſt her conſent. My firſt intention was to become a mediator, if poſſible, and to inſpire the terrified lady with fortitude, for which purpoſe I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the chaiſe, far from imagining how deeply I myſelf was intereſted in this adventure. As I came up I heard my own name repeated in an accent of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! The door opened, and out flew Matilda, whom I inſtantly knew, notwithſtanding the finiſhed beauty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and growth of her perſon! The charming Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda placed herſelf by my ſide, took me by the hand, and ſaid, in a voice which terror and joy had rendered faint, "Dear, dear Lindorf! God has ſurely ſent you to the aſſiſtance and defence of your Matilda! They want to rob you of her, but they never, never ſhall! She will be yours, and yours only!"</p>
                  <p>"No ſooner did the Baron hear my name than, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away his cane, drawing his ſword, and arrogantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, he exclaimed, "Lindorf! What treachery is this?" Then addreſſing himſelf to Matilda, ſaid "I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, Mademoiſelle, you will go into my poſt-chaiſe. I have the poſitive commands of your aunt to bring you back to Dreſden, and I dare ſay the Baron of Lindorf will not think proper to oppoſe thoſe commands."</p>
                  <p>"That we ſhall preſently ſee, Sir," anſwered I coldly, while I ſupported Matilda, whom ſo many contending paſſions had occaſioned to faint in my arms. I gently carried her into the poſt-houſe and laid her on the firſt bed I found; then, recommending her to the perſons preſents, telling them they ſhould be anſwerable for her forthcoming, I immediately left her, and went in ſearch of the Baron de Zaſtrow. I found him demanding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and forcibly withheld by two or three men, who let him go the moment I appeared. We walked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſome diſtance, and went into an encloſed garden. "You have accuſed me of treachery, ſir," ſaid I, "and appearances may give ſome ſmall juſtification to the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; but I aſſure you, on my honour, that chance, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:034126_0267_0FFA926C17EAE108"/>
a moſt lucky one it is true, has brought me here.— When I ſpoke to you, I was ignorant both that you were my rival and that Matilda had fled. If you think this ſufficient ſatisfaction, and will leave the young Counteſs of Walſtein abſolute miſtreſs of herſelf, I promiſe you to abide by her deciſion, and here offer you my future friendſhip and eſteem; if not, I will defend my own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions and her liberty at the hazard of my life."</p>
                  <p>"Defend them, then, traitor," replied he, attacking me with ſo much impetuoſity that, being off my guard, I received a wound in the left arm. It was not dangerous, and only rouſed my anger; and the Baron took ſo little care, thinking himſelf certain of victory, when he ſaw me wounded, that I eaſily diſarmed him. His ſword flew out of his hand, and as it fell, I ſet my foot on it—"Your life," ſaid I, "is now in my power; I am wounded and you are not: but, diſregarding this ſmall diſadvantage, I am ready to reſtore your ſword, and, again, put it to the chance of victory, if you do not renounce your pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Matilda, and promiſe to depart for Dreſden, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, without ſeeing her."</p>
                  <p>"He heſitated, and I ſaw, by the change of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, my manner of acting had made ſome impreſſion. Pride ſtill ſtruggled, but honor, at laſt, was conqueror, and he preſented his hand. "Recollect," ſaid he, "ſir, you have, on theſe conditions, offered your eſteem and friendſhip. I feel, at preſent, I ſhall be proud of and will, therefore, endeavour to merit them, by prevailing on my aunt to confirm that happineſs which is juſtly your due. Forget the paſt, and make my peace with Matilda. I pretend only to her friendſhip; though," added he, with a mixture of former ſelf-ſufficiency, "I am not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to diſdain; nor do I know by what faſcination I ſo long have ſupported hers." I embraced him, ſaid ſhe would certainly be the laſt cruel beauty he would find, and that, had not her heart been pre-engag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, ſhe could not poſſibly have reſiſted ſo many accompliſhments and ſo much merit; after which we parted the beſt friends in the world.</p>
                  <p>"As ſoon as I ſaw him get into his chaiſe, I haſtened to Matilda, concerning whom I was very uneaſy. Her fainting, however, was moſt happily timed, ſince it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of the knowledge of a tranſaction that might
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:034126_0268_0FFA615D027A4700"/>
have occaſioned dreadful terrors. She began to recover and, looking round her, aſked where ſhe was, as I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then, reſuming all her accumſtomed grace, "Dear Lindorf," ſaid ſhe, "and is it not a dream? Is it true that I have once more found thee, and that we never ſhall forſake each other again?"</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had Lindorf finiſhed his phraſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re he felt the white hand of Matilda upon his mouth. "Fie, fie, young gentleman," ſaid ſhe, "I ſee no occaſion to repeat all that paſſed ſo literally. My dear brother, and my dear, dear ſiſter, do not believe a word he ſays. For, what if I had thought all that, can you ſuppoſe I would have ſpoken my thoughts? And, even if I did, you know I was fainting. Who can tell what they do after ſo ſtrange a meeting, preſſed by one lover, protected by another, and amongſt rencounters and battles, and all this hurly burly? One may be allowed to be a little extravagant and ſilly, on ſuch occaſions; but, at preſent, I aſſure you, I am as prudent as"—Matilda ſmiled, with malicious pleaſure, on Lindorf; then, ſuddenly claſping his hand, added, "Well then, I ſay again and again, every thing I ſaid yeſterday: And I hope we ſhall never forſake each other more!"</p>
                  <p>Matilda was ſo charming, as ſhe ſaid this, and there was ſuch a mixture of rapture, pleaſantry, and confuſion in her countenance, that Lindorf imagined he loved her dearer than ever he had loved woman, and expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſo much enthuſiaſm and fire that every body thought the ſame. Caroline was tranſported, ſhe kiſſed the Count, and ſaid, "Was I wrong when I told you how dearly he would love her?" Walſtein beheld Lindorf with aſtoniſhment, nor yet could comprehend, perfectly, all he heard and ſaw. To reaſon and friendſhip he had attributed the attachment of Lindorf to Matilda; for well he recollected to what exceſs he had adored Caroline; nor could imagine how a paſſion ſo energetic might ſo ſoon change its object. Yet was there every appearance of ſincerity in his manner, and words; and Lindorf was no hypocrite. Beſide, the Count was ſo accumſtomed to read his thoughts that, had he been under any real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, it could not have eſcaped him, and he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing but ſincerity. Lindorf, on his part, gueſſed what was paſſing in the mind of the Count, and whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "When we are alone, dear Walſtein, you ſhall hear my ſtory, and your ſurpriſe will then not be ſo great. In
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:034126_0269_0FFA926FCB400140"/>
the mean time, do not imagine your friend has acquired a facility at feigning; or that he does not feel all he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes." The Count claſped his hand, and entreated Matilda to finiſh her ſtory. There was not much to ſay, but the leaſt circumſtance was intereſting to the Count and Caroline. Matilda replied, "You forget, brother, that Lindorf is the hiſtorian, at preſent"—Lindorf thus continued:</p>
                  <p>"I found a village ſurgeon to dreſs my wound, and hoped I might have concealed it from Matilda, as well as my conteſt with the Baron. I, therefore, only told her he had liſtened to reaſon, departed for Dreſden, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to appeaſe his aunt. She was moſt happy at the intelligence, and, being equally impatient to ſee our friend and brother, we preſently departed. The motion of the carriage, and, perhaps, the emotion of my heart, ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed my wound, and Matilda was greatly agitated when ſhe ſaw the blood. It was impoſſible any longer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the cauſe, and we were obliged to ſtop here to dreſs it again. It was found deeper than had been imagined, and I was condemned to take four-and-twenty hours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In vain did I ſolicit my lovely partner to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue her journey, and leave me in this wretched inn; no entreaties could gain conſent."</p>
                  <p>"No, to be ſure," interrupted Matilda, with vivacity. "I know my duty better. Who ever heard of a heroine of romance abandoning her wounded knight, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her againſt a ferocious raviſher? I even thought it neceſſary, according to cuſtom, to dreſs that wound myſelf, and bathe it with my tears. Did not I, Lindorf? And I hope you will own I tied the ſcarf with tolerable grace. Were not my attitude and manner affecting, brother?"</p>
                  <p>"The very picture of a princeſs of the age of Amadis."</p>
                  <p>"No; one of the miſtreſſes of the famous Galaor," ſaid ſhe, glancing at Lindorf.</p>
                  <p>"It was the miſtreſs, then, that fixed the rover," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, kiſſing her hand.</p>
                  <p>"So ſaid Galaor to every miſtreſs, and they believed him; but I," continued Matilda, "am not ſo credulous, and mean to put your ſincerity to the proof—In thoſe times, a woman, with vaſt <hi>ſang froid,</hi> commanded her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver not to pronounce a ſingle word for two years, and he obeyed, Oh! happy age! I, though I only ſhall impoſe

reſt and ſilence on my wounded hero till to-morrow, am certain to find him diſobedient!"</p>
                  <p>"Never, never," ſaid Lindorf kneeling; "and there will be ſome merit in my ſubmiſſion, for I have many things to tell my Walſtein."</p>
                  <p>"And ſo you would have paſſed a whole night in chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, mean while the fever and the wound—I reiterate my abſolute command! Silence and reſt till to-morrow!"</p>
                  <p>Exact obedience was promiſed, though not without reluctance. The friends were both impatient to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their ſentiments; and particularly the Count, who was doubly intereſted to find the heart of Lindorf cured of paſſion for Caroline, and capable of making Matilda happy. It was, therefore, agreed that, in recompenſe for this their ſilence; they ſhould travel, on the morrow, in the chaiſe of Lindorf, and leave the coach of the Count to the ladies. This arrangement was equally acceptable to Caroline, who was herſelf moſt deſirous the friends ſhould mutually explain their feelings, that Walſtein might be convinced of the exact truth of all ſhe had told him, and inform Lindorf of her preſent love for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Matilda, perhaps, might have preferred the care of her wounded knight; but, Matilda dared not ſay ſo; and her brother having mentioned ſending his ſervant to Dreſden, with letters for his aunt, ſhe alſo retired to write, both to her and Mademoiſelle de Manteul, to whom ſhe ſent back the ſervants and chaiſe.</p>
                  <p>She preſently returned with her two letters. The Count read that to Madam de Zaſtrow, approved it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a few lines from himſelf, and, perceiving Matilda concealed the one ſhe had written to Mademoiſelle de Manteul, ſaid, ſmiling, "I ſuppoſe you expreſs your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in ſtrong terms to your zealous friend."</p>
                  <p>"I expreſs it as I feel it; and, I think, that is ſaying a great deal. You, who are one of the heroes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ought, certainly, to be delighted to find ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of its effects; eſpecially in a woman."—The Count continued to ſmile.—"And a pray now, what is the meaning of that ironic air? What, you are incredulous? Siſter Caroline, I hope you will take the part of the ſex."</p>
                  <p>"We will both take its part," anſwered Caroline, "and prove how capable women are of frendſhip."</p>
                  <p>"I never doubted it," replied Walſtein; "my, I even believe that pure diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>"Brother!—After ſo many proofs!"</p>
                  <p>"I am almoſt ſorry, dear Matilda, to rob you of that happy credulity which ſo well proves the innocence of your heart; but, I muſt own, I have ſtrong doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe proofs. Mademoiſelle de Manteul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared greatly affected; but was it for you or for herſelf? Was it to ſerve a friend or to get rid of a rival? Every circumſtance, I think, beſpeaks the latter."</p>
                  <p>Matilda was confounded. A thouſand little incidents were recollected, and a thouſand others ruſhed forward to prove her brother was right; yet could ſhe not inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give her up, and replied with vivacity, "Surely you muſt be deceived, ſhe diſlikes, nay, deteſts the Baron; ſhe was always ſpeaking ill of and turning him to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule."</p>
                  <p>"Right, right; to augment your repugnance. This is the very cauſe why I ſay ſhe is not a true friend. Had Mademoiſelle de Manteul, the victim of an involuntary paſſion, opened her heart to you, and given you ſecret for ſecret: had you together concerted the means of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a marriage that muſt render you both unhappy, I ſhould have faith in her friendſhip, and even be far from blaming her; but all this artifice at her age, is odious: ſhe only had herſelf in view, by prompting you to an imprudent ſtep, which the event has juſtified, but which might have been your deſtruction."</p>
                  <p>Lindorf here took up the ſubject.—"You are too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, dear Walſtein; be the motives of Mademoiſelle de Manteul what they may, ſhe has ſerved me ſo eſſentially that it becomes me to undertake her juſtification, and I ſee nothing in all this but artifice which may well be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to love; beſides, while ſhe was ſerving herſelf, ſhe was, alſo, ſaving her friend from inevitable misfortune,"</p>
                  <p>"No doubt," ſaid Matilda, who took courage at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf ſupported; "for, one day longer, and I had been forced to marry that odious Baron."</p>
                  <p>"And do you not perceive, my dear girl, that, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the road, one day longer and you had been for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your only error, dear Matilda, was that of ſuſpecting my friendſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuppoſing, for an inſtant, I could abandon you; and of blindly confiding in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent young lady, tho', I own, ſhe is rather to blame than you."</p>
                  <p>"Dear, dear brother," cried Matilda, all in tears, and running into his arms; pardon us both. Ah! how do I reproach myſelf for having mentioned, for having given you an ill opinion of her! But ſo far w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Lindorf joined Matilda and chid his friend for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. Caroline claſped Matilda to her boſom, and while ſhe dried her tears, wept in concert—"Think not I wiſh ill to Mademoiſelle de Manteul," ſaid the Count, exceedingly affected. "No, to her I owe the happineſs of beholding thoſe I love united. So freely do I pardon her, that I ſincerely hope ſhe may marry de Zaſtrow, and will even ſpeak in her behalf to my aunt. And now, Matilda, do thou pardon me for having afflicted thee, and undeceived thee. It will be a leſſen to thee, my dear, and the laſt I ſhall ever give thee; for, from this moment, I commit thy conduct and thy felicity to Lindorf. Thou knoweſt how ardently I have deſired to ſee thee his.— Oh! Caroline, Oh! my ſiſter, Oh! my friend, ſcarcely can my heart contain its joys, the ſweet ſenſations this happy moment brings!"</p>
                  <p>Matilda a thouſand times thanked her brother for his ſincerity, and for the inſtruction it contained; "though," ſaid ſhe, "I ſcarcely can repent my imprudence, ſince it has made us all happy a day ſooner;" and added that ſhe would, in a poſtcript, let Mademoiſelle de Manteul pleaſantly underſtand tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> at preſent, ſhe was acquainted with her motives.—The Count was not at all deceived in his conjectures, for Mademoiſelle de Manteul had been ſolely prompted by her paſſion for the young Baron de Zaſtrow, who had paid her ſome attentions before he went on his travels, and who, ſhe hoped, would have married her on his return. The arrival of Matilda at Dreſden, the wiſhes of her aunt, the attachment of the young Baron to the amiable ſpouſe deſtined him, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled hopes which the confidence of Matilda once more animated. She had only ſought her friendſhip to have
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:034126_0273_0FFA927426E93A38"/>
an opportunity of ſeeing the Baron revive his former ſentiments, diſcover thoſe of Matilda, and, if poſſible, turn them towards ſome other object. At firſt ſhe had had her brother in view, and, therefore, had ſhewn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda his letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but her joy was exceſſive when ſhe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this lover already exiſted, and that her young rival was determined on the moſt peremptory reſiſtance. This it was her advantage to encourage all in her power; but this alone was not ſufficient; the beſt means of obtaining her own end, ſhe ſuppoſed, would be to remove Matilda from Dreſden. This might beſt be done by engaging her to take ſome ſtep which ſhould abſolutely break off the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended match. She it was who perſuaded Madam de Zaſtrow, and her nephew, that, by terrifying Matilda, they might obtain her conſent; and what the conſequence of this terror and the ſucceſs of her ſchemes were, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſeen. Yet was ſhe but little benefited by her artifice, for the young Baron, recognizing, in the poſt-chaiſe, the former maid of Mademoiſelle de Manteul, and being convinced ſhe had favoured Matilda's flight, was irritated at the perfidious trick that had been played him. But this perfidy was the conſequence of affection! and when the vanity of man is flattered, he is generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent.</p>
                  <p>Return we to our happy travellers. The wound of Lindorf healed apace, ſo excellent a balſamic is happineſs, and they ſet off for Berlin; Caroline and Matilda in one of the carriages, and the two friends in the other. Leave we theſe lovely ladies to ſpeak of thoſe they held moſt dear, to congratulate each other, to form plans of future delight, and to vow eternal friendſhip. Leave we them frequently to look out of the carriage after the poſt-chaiſe that followed, wiſhing impatiently to arrive, and let us examine how Walſtein and Lindorf paſſed their time.</p>
                  <p>They partook of the impatience we have mentioned; but man feels not ſo ſenſibly thoſe ſhort privations which are ſubjects of ſuch real uneaſineſs to the tender heart of woman. Perhaps, on great occaſions, the former may be more ardent, more paſſionate, more capable of riſking every thing for the object of their love; but the daily proofs, the intervening fears, and all the ſhades of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and conſtant paſſion, are much more peculiar to women; few men are ſuſceptible of them, nay, few know their value. Our travellers, indeed, had not time to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034126_0274_0FFA923272903AA8"/>
think of them; yet had they been in the chaiſe ſome time without entering into any converſation. They ſat ſilent, for Lindorf knew not where to begin, or what to ſay to the huſband of Caroline, and the Count feared leſt the moſt trifling queſtion might bear the aſpect of reproach: he, however, was the firſt to ſpeak, and told his friend how much he had been afflicted by reading the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript he had left with Caroline. "I have not the leaſt fear or ſcruple," ſaid he, in confiding the happineſs of a ſiſter to the man to whom I am ſo infinitely indebted, and who, loving and beloved by the moſt angelic woman the world contains, could not only ſacrifice his own paſſion, but endeavoured to inſpire her with the love of another. Ah! dear Lindorf," ſaid he, "while to you I owe the heart of Caroline and the felicity of Matilda, is it poſſible I ever can acquit myſelf of the wondrous debt? Yet ſpeak, explain how this ſudden revolution in your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which yet I underſtand not, has happened. Is not all you teſtify for my ſiſter another ſacrifice of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous friendſhip? Endeavour not to impoſe upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Can Caroline—"</p>
                  <p>"Dear Walſtein," interrupted Lindorf, inſtantly, "I would utter oaths if I did not know the word of your friend were ſufficient. Believe that friend, then, when he aſſures you he is worthy of becoming your brother; and that nothing has he expreſſed that he has not felt. I love Caroline, no doubt, but it is as I love her huſband, with friendſhip as pure and ſtrong as it is durable; but I love my dear Matilda as the ſole woman on earth who now can make me happy—You are ſurpriſed, but hear what I have to ſay. Learn what has paſſed in the heart you yourſelf have formed ſince laſt we parted."</p>
                  <p>The Count was moſt deſirous to hear, and ſat attentive while Lindorf thus continued:

I thought I might, in ſome meaſure, repair the involuntary wrong I had done by ſhewing Caroline who and what the huſband was ſhe fled.

                  <p>"It was thy noble friendſhip," exclaimed the Count, "which alone could draw me with ſuch noble features and ſuch colours as could affect the heart of Caroline. Yes, dear Lindorf, to thee alone I owe that heart and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite felicity I enjoy. No, had it not been for that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with which thou ſo continually reproacheſt thyſelf, Caroline, perhaps, never had loved me. But go on, dear friend, I long to be convinced thou art equally happy, and that thou thinkeſt Matilda a proper recompenſe for the ſublime efforts thou haſt made to conquer a paſſion which could dictate the manuſcript thou lefteſt at Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw and baniſh thee from Caroline."</p>
                  <p>"I left her," replied Lindorf, "determined never to ſee her more, till by wholly ſubduing my fatal paſſion, I were worthy her and you; and far was I from foreſeeing this bliſsful moment was ſo near. The ſolitude of Rone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg augmented my love and gloomy melancholy; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly did fancy tranſport me to the pavilion of Rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daw, inceſſantly was Caroline preſent. I ſaw her, heard her, converſed with her, and when the ſweet illuſion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, deſpair and remorſe acquired additional ſtrength, and they were tried to the utmoſt by your arrival and converſation. You loved Caroline, your happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on being beloved by her, and again I renewed my vow of ſurmounting my paſſion; or, rather, of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my country, and carefully concealing from you I had been your rival. This vow had been held ſacred; never had the name of Caroline eſcaped my lips had not ſhe, like an apparition, appeared at Ronebourg, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of which I yet underſtand not, and deprived me

of reaſon. Excuſe me from deſcribing all I felt while I thought I beheld her dying, but imagine what it muſt be when it could make me betray the ſecret of my heart, and inform you that a friend, towards whom you had acted with ſuch magnanimity, was the guilty lover of your wife!</p>
                  <p>"My determination was to take vengeance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n myſelf, and follow her whom I thought dead; but ſigns of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life prevented me: ſhe was reſtored to you, and I wiſhed not to interrupt your happineſs by the horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of ſuicide. I went into my room, wrote the letter you found, mounted my horſe, and rode full ſpeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing whither I went, or taking ſo much as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſervant with me. The firſt day I ſuffered my horſe to take which road he pleaſed, and, at night, ſtopped at a wretched inn; I endeavoured, however, to collect my ideas, and reſolved to follow my firſt intention, which was to go to England. I had written to court and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permiſſion for that purpoſe, my ſervant and baggage might ſoon follow, and I immediately took the road to Hamburg where I meant to embark. I rode poſt day and night, and this continual change of ſcene correſponded with the agitation of my ſoul to which repoſe was inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. I wiſhed to find a veſſel ready to ſail to Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, and to ſtep into it as I got out of my chaiſe; but, happily, there were none ready. Some hours after my arrival, I was ſeized with a burning fever, which laſted ſeveral days; the phyſician, whom my hoſt called in, had m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> bled ſo abundantly that exceſſive weakneſs was the conſequence, and retarded my departure. Obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at Hamburg till I gathered ſtrength, I wrote to my valet de chambre to come to me there. My ſickneſs was the natural conſequence of my feelings, and the fatigues of my journey, and was certainly a fortunate one. It calmed the violence of my tranſports, and obliged me to follow the plan I myſelf had laid down, as ſoon as I knew you to be the huſband of Caroline.</p>
                  <p>"At preſent, when I no longer feel this weakneſs, I may own that more than twenty times on the road was I tempted to return to Ronebourg, and from your hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Caroline or death. Had I been obliged to remain at Hamburg without falling ill, perhaps, I ſhould have been overcome, and for ever have rendered myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy your eſteem and friendſhip. My fever, and its conſequent weakneſs, ſhewed me objects under a different

point of view; and, whether the organization of the body influences the mind, whether it was the reſult of reflections inceſſantly made, or whether friendſhip really triumphed over love, certain it is my paſſion, each day, became feebler; or, rather, reaſon became ſtronger. I ſtill adored Caroline, but I adored her as a deity, without daring to ſuppoſe I again might ſee her. I ſhuddered even at the idea, and, far from wiſhing to return, I wiſhed to remove farther off, and therefore waited impatiently for Varner.</p>
                  <p>"Such was the temper of my mind when the young Baron de Manteul arrived at Hamburg, and came to lodge in the ſame hotel: my hoſt immediately informed him of my illneſs, exaggerated the danger I had been in, the care he had taken of me, the ſlow recovery of my ſtrength and inſpired him with a wiſh to become acquainted with me. He ſent up his compliments, and, as his was a Saxon family well known, I received him with pleaſure. His appearance gave me a favourable impreſſion, which was confirmed by his converſation. He was equally pleaſed with me, and in a few hours we were old friends. He, likewiſe, was going to England, but could not ſtop more than three days at Hamburg: hearing I intended to croſs the ſea, he earneſtly entreated me to embark on board the ſame ſhip. My health, which daily grew ſtronger, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to depart, and I willingly conſented to a requeſt by which I ſhould gain ſuch an agreeable companion. I left a letter of inſtructions for my valet with the hoſt, and in two days we left Hamburg, mutually congratulating each other on this lucky rencounter: we further agreed to live together, at London, and take lodgings in the ſame houſe.</p>
                  <p>"This young gentleman was the more agreeable to me for being almoſt as melancholy as myſelf, and we often ſighed in ſympathy: he firſt made the remark. During the voyage we were alone on the deck, each abſorbed in his own ideas, and each preſerving the moſt profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Manteul at length ſpoke; "I think," ſaid he, "I have diſcovered another conformity between us. Is it not true, dear Lindorf, that your heart is engaged, and that you deeply regret ſome perſon whom you have left in your own country?" I not chooſing to give a direct anſwer, retorted the queſtion on himſelf, and told him he had made the confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="136" facs="unknown:034126_0278_0FFA9238EDF20A08"/>"I own it," replied he; "and, did you know the perſon I regret, you then would have ſome knowledge of what my feelings are. When I quitted Saxony, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined I fled from the danger of loving the moſt charming woman in the world; but, now I ſee her no more, I feel the miſchief is done, and that I fled too late."</p>
                  <p>"I owned my heart was as much enſlaved as his, but added nothing farther; I rather endeavoured to turn the converſation, by making reflections on the pangs and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of love.</p>
                  <p>"We had a good voyage, and arrived ſafe at London. The novelty of this vaſt city, its riches, the multitude of its inhabitants, and that peculiarity of manners which diſtance and a government ſo different produce, greatly relieved my melancholy; and, as I moſt ſincerely deſired to be wholly cured of it, I myſelf ardently ſought amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I recovered health and ſtrength apace, and even a part of my natural cheerfulneſs, yet did Caroline occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py my heart and thoughts, and, whenever I was alone, I found they turned wholly on her; but, as I dreaded the dangerous recollection, I took every poſſible means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, and remained alone as ſeldom as poſſible. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teul ſeldom left me; he found, each day, his attachment increaſe, and ſeemed to fear we ſhould part too ſoon.— He told me he had received letters from Dreſden, which had lain at his banker's, waiting his arrival at London, that gave him vaſt pleaſure. "My return," ſaid he, "may be much ſooner than I ſuppoſed; but the event that will then call me back will be ſo happy a one I ſhall only have my friend to regret." I could eaſily perceive he wiſhed to open his heart to me, but that would have required a reciprocal confidence, and I was determined never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal my criminal ſecret, nor ever once to pronounce the name of Caroline; I, therefore, forbore to aſk him who the object of his attachment might be, or to put any one queſtion which might lead him to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>"We had been preſented, by our ambaſſador at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to ſeveral Engliſh noblemen; and, among others, we one day dined with the Earl of Saliſbury. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the toaſt went round, as you know, Walſtein, is the cuſtom in England, and the health of the favourite lady given by each gueſt. When the toaſt came to me, my heart named Caroline, and the word roſe to my lips. I forbore, however, and begged they would excuſe my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

the lady whoſe health I drank. They joked me on my great diſcretion, and drank to the health of the fair incognita.</p>
                  <p>"I ſhall not be ſo diſcreet as Lindorf," ſaid Manteul, when it came to his turn; "I am proud to drink the health of Matilda, Counteſs of Walſtein."</p>
                  <p>"The name ſtruck me ſo forcibly that I ſcarcely could believe what I heard real; but it was repeated round the table ſo often that I could no longer doubt it was that ſame Matilda by whom I had been ſo tenderly loved, and whom I had ſo cruelly offended, it is impoſſible I ſhould paint the agitation I was in; though, but a moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſhould not have ſuppoſed any human power could have pronounced a name, except Caroline, that might have made an equal impreſſion. Manteul ſat too far off for me to aſk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it was Matilda whom he loved; yet, how might I doubt when I beheld his animated countenance, as he repeated, himſelf, and heard others repeat her name? I looked and thought him handſomer than uſual; he ſeemed to poſſeſs all the qualities of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and, certainly, ſaid I, he is beloved. The letters which gave him ſuch pleaſure are, certainly, from Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and his quick return to Dreſden, which is to render him ſo happy, is alſo, as certainly the conſequence of her command; he is then to receive her hand whoſe heart he already poſſeſſes!</p>
                  <p>"Theſe ideas ran in my mind all the afternoon, and accompanied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

I there waited the arrival of Manteul with an impatience wholly unaccountable to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It was not long before he came; my going had alarmed him, and ſcarcely did I give him time to tell me ſo, before I aſked if the lady whoſe health he had drank were the lady he loved, and if ſhe were ſiſter to the Count of Walſtein, Ambaſſador in Ruſſia."</p>
                  <p>"Ay, certainly," replied he, with tranſport; "ſhe, ſhe herſelf, your charming countrywoman! Are you acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her? It is ſome time ſince ſhe left Berlin."</p>

                  <p>"Ah! dear Lindorf," ſaid Manteul, embracing me with rapture, "if you are upon theſe terms with the Count of Walſtein, I may owe all my future bliſs to your friendſhip. She has often proteſted that her brother, alone, had a right to diſpoſe of her hand; and to him you may ſpeak for me; you may engage him to favour my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—Say, will you, Lindorf, will you?"</p>
                  <p>"Doubt it not, my friend. Should Matilda, alſo, find this union that which her heart deſires, I then will uſe all the power of my friendſhip with the Count to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in your intereſt. But I thought Matilda, in ſome meaſure, contracted to the Baron de Zaſtrow."</p>
                  <p>"Alas! it was that projected marriage which alone de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to leave Dreſden. I was the friend of de Zaſtrow, and would not become his rival.

ſhe had remarked it before he left Dreſden, and ſhe now had not any doubt. Matilda was very ſorry when ſhe heard he was gone, ſhe had even ſhed tears; her former cheerfulneſs had forſaken her, and what convinces me, ſaid ſhe, your abſence cauſes her melancholy, is, that it redoubles whenever England is mentioned. She yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſaid, in a pet which made her look more lovely, 'I wonder why the men are all ſo eager to run to that good for nothing England!' This brother, I ſhould think a tolerably favourable ſymptom, and, if you want a ſtill ſtronger, I muſt tell you ſhe herſelf has begged me to ſhow her your letters. Profit by this information.

                  <p>"This letter ſeemed to me a clear proof that Matilda loved young Manteul, and I felt a painful ſenſation, a ſpaſm of the heart, which I could not account for, and which I endeavoured to conceal.

                  <p>"This I ſolemnly promiſed, but not without a ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſeemed very like jealouſy, which the deſcription he gave of the lovely Matilda augmented. I could not deny I had often ſeen her before ſhe left Berlin, and he added, "You would not know her Lindorf; no, you would not know her. You cannot imagine how much ſhe is altered, how much improved.

contain: ſhe has every thing that can ſeduce and awe the heart. Her features have not a tame regularity; no, each has an expreſſion peculiar to itſelf; her countenance is continually varying, and is the mirror of a moſt excellent heart, and a moſt amiable mind. Never long the ſame, ſhe is playful, ſportive, forward, cheerful, pretending to take pet, and laughing at the deception ſhe has occaſioned. She inſpires joy and pleaſure in all around her. At other times, mild, fond, and full of ſenſibility, ſhe would melt the coldeſt or the hardeſt heart. Such I beheld her every day; and how might I reſiſt ſo many allurements; or what ſhall be my happineſs ſhould ſhe become mine?"</p>
                  <p>"My ſecret regret for having wilfully caſt this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from me was the anſwer my heart returned to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teul. And had I!—had I been beloved by this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lady! And did it once depend only on me to have made her for ever mine! Oh! how little had I merited a gift the value of which too late I knew!

                  <p>"No ſooner was I alone than I began to inquire what my ſenſations were, and how I might feel this ſtrange emotion concerning an event which I ought to have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen. Since I had not loved Matilda, ſince I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her heart and hand, what were my rights?— Ought I not to be happy that another had been more juſt, and made reparation for my wrongs? Alas! ſo far, was I from being happy, from thinking thus, that it ſeemed as if Manteul bore away a treaſure which appertained to me alone; nay I was inconſiſtant, unjuſt, enough to accuſe Matilda of want of conſtancy, guilty as I myſelf had been! I recollected every circumſtance of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, thoſe tender promiſes, ſo ingenuous, ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:034126_0283_0FFA60A60FD567E0"/>
in her letters, to love me, and me only, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, All women are inconſtant; as if I myſelf had not been an example that men have, at leaſt that I had, very little reaſon for theſe reproaches!</p>
                  <p>"I next reflected on the ſituation in which I ſtood with Manteul, and that folly which, a ſecond time, had made me the rival of a friend. Yet durſt I not allow myſelf to ſay I was his rival, but promiſed, if he were beloved, as every thing gave me reaſon to ſuppoſe, I would ſerve him with all the ardor of friendſhip: this I preſently aſſured him of, and we waited, with equal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, the anſwer of his ſiſter, which was to contain his ſentence."</p>
                  <p>"Well, but Caroline? Is ſhe wholly forgotten; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready effaced from that heart where ſhe had reigned with ſuch unbounded ſway?"</p>
                  <p>"From my own experience, Walſtein, I am convinced the heart, when it abſolutely loſes hope, loſes, in part, its pain; not, perhaps, in every inſtance, but in moſt; and, where love is the paſſion, whenever a new object is found, that, by any concurrence of circumſtances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes intereſting, the former is preſently forgotten; at leaſt, ſo far forgotten as not to be remembered with the ſame reſtleſs and tormenting ſenſations. I thought of Caroline, Counteſs of Walſtein, but not of Caroline of Lichtfield, and was moſt happy to encourage the mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; my imagination no longer wandered in the gardens of Rindaw, or dwelt in the pavilion, but ſaw Caroline at Berlin, there in company with the beſt of huſbands, and enjoying her felicity. Happy was I when thus I might remember her without remorſe, and, whenever her name roſe to memory, the name of my friend was, alſo, preſent; while that of Matilda, which Manteul was inceſſantly repeating, gave me an emotion, the origin of which I, who had had ſo much experience, could not miſtake.— Thus, my friend, you ſee my cure is far advanced; and you ſoon will learn in what manner I was perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
                  <p>"On our firſt arrival in England, we deſigned to have travelled through the different counties; but, ſuppoſing we ſhould remain there all winter, intended to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred our journey till the ſpring.

A journey, I imagined, would be ſome relief, and I willingly conſented. We ſet off, therefore, paſſed through various counties, and a part of Wales, ſtopping to examine what was held moſt curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. This, dear Count, is not the moment to give you a deſcription of a country, where peace and liberty produce abundance, where the productive fields, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by wealthy farmers, are not, like ours, the ſcenes of bloody battles, and all their direful attendants. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of finding them nouriſhment, the inhabitants fear not to marry and beget children. The towns, villages, and cities are extremely populous, and every perſon ſeems happy; and, as the Engliſh nobility paſs one part of the year at their country ſeats, where they contribute to the proſperity of their tenants, thoſe beautiful country ſeats are built with an elegance, and preſerved in a ſtyle of grandeur and taſte, very different from the gloomy mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of our antique chateaus. If we wiſh to form an idea of the beauties of nature, and the inexpreſſible charms of a country life, we muſt go to England."</p>
                  <p>"You augment the wiſh I have to ſee that country," ſaid the Count; "I intend to take my dear Caroline thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but till that happens, ſhall be glad of farther infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation."</p>
                  <p>"I know not whether I am capable of affording you any," replied Lindorf, "for we travelled with too much rapidity, and our hearts and minds were too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied, to remark the numerous things deſerving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I have only juſt mentioned what muſt neceſſarily ſtrike every foreigner who beholds England for the firſt time.</p>
                  <p>"Impatience to receive news from Dreſden made us ſoon turn our faces towards London: I certainly was more uneaſy than Manteul. The hope he had conceived contributed much to his happineſs, which I rather envied than participated; and the more cheerful and animated I ſaw him, the more did my ſecret chagrin and gloom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. I ſpoke to him, however, continually, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matilda, led him to repeat the moſt minute circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and was as inexhauſtible in my queſtions as Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teul was in replies. This was our chief ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and, every moment, grief, regret, jealouſy, and

I may add love, acquired new force. Manteul found no letters when we came to London; but, two days after our arrival, as I was riſing, intending to breakfaſt with him, his ſervant brought me a letter, with my addreſs. Surpriſed at this, I immediately was going to him, but was informed he was gone out, and would not be at home before dinner. My aſtoniſhment increaſed, and I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter, not without emotion, which ſtill became more forcible when I ſaw the cover incloſed a letter that had been opened, addreſſed to Manteul, with the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark of Dreſden, which, by its ſize, ſeemed ſtill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain another. This I ſuppoſed to be the anſwer of his ſiſter, and a letter incloſed from Matilda. But wherefore not bring them himſelf? In ſpite of my impatience to ſee it, I began by reading the few lines Manteul had written in the cover. "Here it is," ſaid Lindorf, taking it from his pocket-book, "and imagine what was my ſurpriſe:"

I could not endure the thought. You, dear Count, are capable of imagining what my feelings were, and the increaſe they ſuffered by recollection. This was the ſecond time love had aſſaulted friendſhip, and a ſecond time was I deſirous friendſhip ſhould be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I would not read the letters till I firſt had juſtified myſelf to Manteul, and till I had his free conſent to read them: I locked them up, and inſtantly went in ſearch of him to the coffee houſe, where he had not yet been, and where the moſt probable way of meeting him would have been to wait: but waiting at this moment was impoſſible. I ran to ſeek him elſewhere. I rather choſe ſpeaking to him than writing a letter long enough to have explained all the reaſons of my conduct, which little ſuited my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; but as we might miſs each other in the ſearch, I left a line at the coffee houſe, ſaying "he did me juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in believing me incapable of perfidy; that, certainly, I had many things to reproach myſelf with, but not that of treachery towards him. Matilda only had a right to complain. I begged him to wait at the coffee-houſe, and pledged myſelf to give him every explanation he could require, aſſuring him I ſhould not take a moment's reſt till he had heard me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had not read, nor would not read, a line in the letters he had ſent me, and hoped to prove how highly I valued his eſteem and friendſhip!"</p>
                  <p>"After giving this note to the waiter I continued my ſearch, went to the Pruſſian Ambaſſador's, into the Park, to all our acquaintances, but miſſed him every where; and returning to the coffee-houſe, found to my great vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he had been there and was gone, but that he had left a note for me, which was this.

I once more read the note of Manteul, and finding he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided me, 'Why,' ſaid I, 'ſhould I force the ſight of a happy rival on him in the firſt paroxyſm of grief?' Was I in reality beloved by the generous Matilda? Manteul, only, yet, had told me ſo, and I longed to ſee the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. I, therefore, returned home, and read the two letters I am going to ſhew you. You will begin by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of Mademoiſelle de Manteul, as I did, tho' moſt impatient to ſee the other, which, addreſſed to me, made my heart palpitate. I trembled to open a paper where each word, traced by the hand of Matilda, muſt be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to this inconſtant heart. She, perhaps, knew not my infidelity; but was I, therefore, leſs culpable?—Ah! when I did read, how did her ingenuous and affectionate ſoul, which infuſed itſelf into the paper, augment my wrongs, and make me more ſelf-odious! "I began with this," ſaid Lindorf, giving it to the Count.</p>
                  <p>"Mademoiſelle de Manteul firſt aſked a thouſand par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of her brother for having given him falſe hopes. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived herſelf, ſhe had believed the thing ſhe wiſhed to be was true, and that he had been the ſecret object of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda's love. It was your letter," added ſhe, "that very letter I requeſted you to write, and from which I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

effects ſo very different, that deſtroyed all my hopes. No, brother, you are not the beloved man. Matilda has long ſince yielded her heart. She refuſes the homage of de Zaſtrow, of you, and of the whole world, for the ſake of your new friend, that very Baron of Lindorf of whom you ſpeak. She ſaw but his name in your letter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly her ſecret was betrayed: yet it can now be no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to you, for, being thus intimate with that gentleman, he, by this, has certainly made you his confidant; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, his told you he has long ſince been contracted to the young Counteſs of Walſtein. Her brother, the moſt intimate friend of Lindorf, promoted this union, and their hearts were accordant to his wiſhes. Matilda declares no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can break this tie but death; for, though Lindorf ſhall prove inconſtant, ſhe never will. Your paſſion, therefore, dear brother, for your own ſake, you will van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, and I think I know you ſufficiently reaſonable and generous to reſt aſſured it will change to friendſhip, and that you will take a pleaſure at once to ſerve Matilda and her lover. This you may do by giving him the incloſed letter, which the poor young lady had no means of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is not ſhe that requeſts this, but I; thinking it the beſt means of effecting your cure. Tell this Lindorf that his miſtreſs is perſecuted by her aunt, who will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige her to wed de Zaſtrow, whom ſhe hates; that this will certainly occaſion her death: prevail on him to depart inſtantly, that he may conſole, deliver, and carry her off, if neceſſary; and, indeed, I ſee no other means. What can he have to fear, ſince he is authorized by her brother? You well may ſuppoſe, Charles, I ſhould have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py had you been the man; but her heart was beſtowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe came to Dreſden. Endeavour, therefore, only to contribute to her happineſs; and, perhaps, to your ſiſter's likewiſe."</p>
                  <p>This latter phraſe, which had eſcaped the obſervation of Lindorf, made the Count ſmile, and confirmed him in his former opinion of Mademoiſelle de Manteul. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the letter to Lindorf, who then gave him that from Matilda—"Read," ſaid he, "and think what muſt be the impreſſion it made on me!"</p>

There are certain moments in life when the heart ſpeaks louder than reaſon, and compels it to ſilence, and my heart ſays ſo many things that I am obliged to liſten and do whatever it pleaſes. It tells me, for example, I ſhall be leſs unhappy when I have related all my ſufferings to my friend; and I already feel it tells me truth.

Have I two hearts that I may beſtow one on de Zaſtrow? And if I had a thouſand, ſhould not I give them all to—to—. Ever ſince I have begun to write this letter, nay, ever ſince I firſt thought of writing it, have I been inceſſantly torturing my imagination for the beſt manner of telling you what I feel, and how I might ſay all I have to ſay; but the more I think the leſs I ſucceed. It will be impoſſible you ſhould underſtand me—I will think no more on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I will ſuffer my hand and my heart to go their own way. I require ſincerity, and have a right to give the example—Yes, M. Lindorf (ſee! ſee! I am ſtill think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the manner). Well then, dear, dear Lindorf! I love you, and ſhall love you as long as I live!—And be aſſured, I will live and die either Matilda Walſtein, or Matilda Lindorf—Do not be terrified at this any eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſtancy. No, dear Lindorf, it does not entail itſelf on <hi>you:</hi> far am I from ſuppoſing you under the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.

                  <p>"Her native innocence is above all ſuſpicion; ſhe loves, herſelf, and thinks it moſt certain ſhe is, herſelf, beloved. Not a year's ſilence, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe ſees me they are all forgotten, and not a ſhadow of doubt remains. Ah! when fainting and feeble ſhe ſunk into my arms, pale, inanimate, and with half cloſed eyes, how intereſting was it to my ſoul! With what ardor did I ſwear to live with her, and her alone! On her lips, as I bore her into the houſe, I pronounced the vow which I never can forget, no more than I can the rapturous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations I tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"My affair with de Zaſtrow, my wound, the tender care ſhe has taken of me, her underſtanding, her grace, her ingenuous mind, all have augmented my paſſion. Yet will I own I felt ſome emotion at the ſight of Caroline; but it was of a very different kind from what I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly known. I ſaw with pleaſure, yes, Walſtein, with
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:034126_0293_0FFA9291621B1828"/>
infinite pleaſure, you were beloved, and Caroline was to me as a ſiſter, the wife of my friend and brother. And now, dear Count, you know my inmoſt heart, and I hope will not delay to beſtow that happineſs I ſo ardently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which preſent conviction tells me I deſerve, and which will make felicity perfect."</p>
                  <p>"My felicity," replied the Count, tenderly embracing him, "will not be perfect till I behold Matilda and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf as happy as I myſelf am; nor ſhall it be long before theſe new bonds of affinity and friendſhip ſhall be formed, which will leave me nothing farther to wiſh."</p>
                  <p>Walſtein then related all his paſt ſcenes with Caroline. Lindorf ſhuddered at the idea of the divorce. "Good God!" ſaid he, "could you ſuppoſe I would be acceſſary, to ſuch a ſacrifice! That I would ſee happy at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Walſtein!"</p>
                  <p>"It was the happineſs of Caroline that was in conteſt, and neither you nor I, Lindorf, ought then to recede. The letters I wrote, and which thou wouldeſt have found on thy arrival, would have removed every ſcruple: friendſhip and delicacy muſt have yielded to motives more deciſive. My reaſons were good, and my meaſures well taken, and thou couldeſt not but have acted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly."</p>
                  <p>"Aſk me not how I ſhould have acted," replied Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf; "I, fortunately, have not been put to the proof. I am proud of being your brother. You only could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Caroline, and ſhe alone could equal your virtues. Matilda, perhaps, is, by temper and nature, better ſuited to your friend Lindorf."</p>
                  <p>"She does not know," ſaid the Count, "that Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line has been her rival?"—She knows every thing," replied Lindorf, with vivacity. "She has a right to know every thing. My heart were unworthy of her had I any ſecrets. In juſtice, I was obliged to account for my coolneſs, my ſilence, my voyage to England. Might I deceive her? No, impoſſible; and had I even ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, no ſuch intention could have been kept. Her noble frankneſs, her open candour, would irreſiſtibly have enſured like confidence and like ſincerity. No ſooner were we alone in the poſt-chaiſe than ſhe ſpoke of you and your marriage; and aſked if I knew her ſiſter. A full confeſſion of all that had paſſed was my anſwer; and, far from feeling jealouſy or vexation, I found, as I

ſpoke, ſhe became attached to Caroline, was deſirous of her friendſhip, and determined to imitate her beſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and virtues.—Oh! how dearly," ſaid ſhe, "ſhall I love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is charming Caroline! How happy will ſhe make my brother! And how gladly ſhall I learn, from her, to reclaim and fix my rover, my Lindorf!"—Since Matilda has ſeen her, ſhe has told me, with a tone of ſincerity that leaves no doubt on the mind, "Ah! Lindorf, how perfectly are you juſtified in your paſſion! I never could have pardoned you had you ſeen Caroline with indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence!" Such, dear Count, is your ſiſter; and judge whether I ought not to adore her."</p>
                  <p>Arrived at Berlin, the firſt care of the Count was to preſent his friend and ſiſter to the King, and requeſt his approbation of their marriage; which obtained, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py family went to the Walſtein eſtate, where Caroline had fled <hi>from</hi> her huſband, on the bridal day, and <hi>to</hi> him on the morning of the projected divorce, and of which Juſtin was ſteward. There, in the Count's chapel, was the marriage celebrated, without other witneſſes than Walſtein, Caroline, the tenants of the Chateau, and ſome of the villagers. As they left the church, Louiſa came to pay her reſpects to Lindorf, to whom ſhe was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Caroline. He beheld both thoſe lovely women, who formerly had raiſed ſuch commotions in his breaſt, with perfect tranquillity; and, preſſing the hand of the Count, who ſtood next him, "I feel at this moment," ſaid he, "I am worthy to be the brother of Walſtein. I was diſtracted for Louiſa, Caroline I adored, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda I love, and ſhall for ever love!"</p>

                     <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
                     <p>TO thoſe who wiſh to be informed of every thing that paſſes we ſhall further ſay, that Lindorf continued thus to think; that he made his lovely lady happy, attained to the higheſt rank in the army, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf on ſeveral occaſions. That Edmund, Count of Walſtein, was a pillar to the throne, a friend of the King, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the people, a ſupporter of the wretched, and that he found, in the conſtant affection of his dear Caroline, and the good conduct of his children, the full recompenſe of his virtues; while Caroline, the adored, the beloved

Caroline, meeting the admiration ſhe merited, was the happieſt as ſhe was the moſt angelic of women.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall likewiſe add that the young Baron de Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrow, admiring his Pariſian graces, engrafted on a German trunk, finding he pleaſed only Mademoiſelle de Manteul, who pleaſed not him, returned to Paris and his gaming friends, purſued his theatrical conqueſts, and made ſuch good uſe of his time, money, and conſtitution that, in leſs than a year, he was ruined, diſeaſed and dead. His aunt, perceiving Matilda had had good reaſon for her refuſal, pardoned, and left her all her wealth.</p>
                     <p>Mademoiſelle de Manteul retired, at firſt, into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; after which ſhe obtained the place of a lady of honor, at court; where, exerciſing that ſpirit of intrigue with which ſhe was ſo liberally endowed, ſhe became perfectly competent to her poſt.</p>
                     <p>Her young brother, the well diſpoſed and amiable Manteul, for whom we have been intereſted, and whom we ſaw ſet off to Newmarket, met with Lady Sophia Seymour, who was couſin german to the Count and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, and who greatly reſembled the latter. Manteul now found he was far from having ſuffered a loſs, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Lady Sophia, no wiſe inferior to her lovely couſin, loved him with all the ardour with which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda loved Lindorf. The Count, in a voyage he made to London, in company with Caroline, had the pleaſure of forming this union, and making two more lovers happy.</p>
