            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. PRESIDENT, GENTLEMEN, FELLOW-STUDENTS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS being the Day, on which their Majeſties, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> were graciouſly pleaſed to grant their Royal Charter for the Eſtabliſhment of an Academy in this infant Colony; you will accept, it is hoped, a ſhort Tribute to the Memory of our illuſtrious Founders.</p>
            <p>The Inſtitution of this Seat of Science is ſufficient of itſelf to win them the Heart of every grateful <hi>Virginian;</hi> but the other Actions of their Lives are ſuch as muſt render their Names, forever, ſacred. If there be any Period in the Annals of Hiſtory, which deſerves the Attention of Poſterity, and which may hold forth to future Ages, a Leſſon, we may confidently affirm it to be the glorious Revolution. During a long Courſe of Years, which preceded this Event, the Scepter of <hi>England</hi> had been ſwayed by arbitrary Hands. The Conſtitution was wrenched from its natural Frame; the Rights of the Subject were invaded by the Sovereign; and Nothing was heard but the Groans of the Oppreſſed. Learning drooped, Trade ſtagnated, and Liberty was exiled. Parliaments, once, the Security of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects, were now ſtript of all their Authority. Through the whole Kingdom not a Patriot was found, who durſt ſtand forth in Defence of his Country. Though every Member of the Community had been repeatedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by the Pride of foreign Enemies; though Dangers threatened from every Quarter; though the Blood of Millions called for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; the Prince, diſſolved in Luxury, and intoxicated with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſtudied Nothing but to protract an inglorious Peace. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the whole, Popery was introduced, Proteſtants perſecuted, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality reviled, and Virtue driven from the Realm. At this Juncture, <hi>William</hi> ſtept in, aſcended the Throne, and <hi>England</hi> no longer lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her baniſhed Freedom. Parliaments were reſtored to their former Influence, the Pride of her Enemies was humbled, and the Poſſeſſions of her Subjects ſecured.</p>
            <p>To all the amiable Qualities which throw a Radiance round a private Station, <hi>William</hi> added thoſe which reflect a Splendor on the Throne. Unlike the preceding Monarchs, he ſacrificed Eaſe, Pleaſure,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012095_0005_0F89C447F6D83CC8"/>and every ſelfiſh Conſideration to the Welfare of the State. As a Soldier, he was prudent, active, and undaunted; as a Sovereign, gracious, intelligent, and penetrating. See him in the Field, and he appears a Being of a ſuperior Order! Behold him in the Cabinet, and you are ſurprized at a Genius, ſo fertile in Reſources! His Hand was always uplifted againſt the Enemies of <hi>England;</hi> and the Subject of his Meditations was the Good of Mankind. Flattery and Fear fled from his Preſence, and none but the honeſt and the brave were admitted to his Councils. His own Happineſs, he conſidered as interwoven with the Happineſs of his People. He was ſenſible that an Inſult to the Subject, was an Inſult to the Sovereign, and that the Poverty of the Nation muſt end in his own Diſgrace. Allegiance and Protection were, with him, reciprocal Ties. Nor did his Care extend only to the civil Intereſts of his Subjects; he was alſo the watchful Guardian of their religious Rights. He knew that, in Things of a ſpiritual Nature, Man is not amenable to Man; that the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Reaſon are the ſole Rules of his Conduct, and the Dictates of Conſcience, the Sanctions of his Maker. He ſaw how abſurd it was to preſcribe to others, a Religion; how unjuſt to puniſh them for not embracing his own. To the Members of the eſtabliſhed Church he gave peculiar Marks of his Friendſhip; while the honeſt Diſſenter partook of his Favors. To aſcribe to Merit its Due, his Virtues as a Man, and his Actions as a Prince, were ſuch as made an aſtoniſhed World gaze on him with Applauſe.</p>
            <p>His Royal Conſort joined him, in all his Efforts, to ſave and to ſerve the Kingdom. While he was at the Head of an Army abroad, ſhe held the Reins of Government at Home: And ſuch was her Conduct, that under her Adminiſtration, all Ranks of People thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy. She was open to Conviction, ruffled by no Paſſion, and free from the leaſt Taint of Vice. Her Sentiments were the Sentiments of a chriſtian Princeſs; of a pious Sovereign, who wept, in ſecret, at the Diſtreſſes of her Subjects, and beheld them, in public, with maternal Affection.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding the many Virtues of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many Bleſſings, from them, derived to the Nation;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012095_0006_0F89C448F05B7888"/>their Characters were wounded by the invenomed Shafts of Detraction and their Perſons expoſed to the cruel Daggers of Conſpiracy. Ingra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>titude ſoon forgot the Hand which reſcued her from Deſtruction and that Hero, who had fought ſo many Battles, retrieved the Glory of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Arms and delivered <hi>Britain</hi> herſelf from Chains, was cenſured for too warm an Attachment to the Country of his Birth. His Memory hath been reviled, by his Enemies, for having embroiled his Kingdom in foreign Connections. But is it not reaſonable to ſuppoſe that he thought the Intereſt of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinent one? It is certain that Nothing but the united Efforts of the allied Armies, could have reduced <hi>France</hi> from the Zenith of her Ambition to a State of Miſery and Deſpair. So that from this, as well as from all the other Actions of his Life, it appears that he had moſt at Heart the Good of <hi>England:</hi> And not to have made the Proſperity of his native Land, the ſecond Object of his Attention, would have argued him highly ungrateful. He is charged with the Crime alſo of depoſing his Uncle and Father-in-Law. But it would have been his Duty to have torn the Tyrant from the Throne, had <hi>James</hi> been his Brother or his Father. The Name of <hi>Timoleon</hi> illumines the Page of <hi>Grecian</hi> Hiſtory. The remoteſt Corners of the World reſound with the Fame of <hi>Brutus:</hi> And ſhall Envy obſcure the Glory of <hi>William?</hi> Forbid it Heaven! The laſt Accuſation is, that he was a ſullen, and imperious Sovereign. Read the Annals of his Reign, and let Juſtice decide. With how much Equity, with how much Lenity did he govern that Kingdom, before diſtracted with civil Commotions? With what Humanity did he treat thoſe whom he knew to be Foes both of his Government, and his Perſon? Even the Rebels of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> felt the kindly Influence of his ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing Heart.</p>
            <p>To return to the Eſtabliſhment of this College: Does this look like the offspring of a ſullen Diſpoſition? No; it "bears the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Stamp of Heaven." And ſo long as Time ſhall endure Here, ſhall "grateful Science ſtill adore her <hi>William</hi>'s holy Shade." Before this Period, our intellectual World was "without Form and void,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012095_0007_0F89C449758BA058"/>and Darkneſs was upon the Face of the Deep." But his Voice ſpake the Chaos into Order: He ſaid, "let there be Light! And there was Light." Education aroſe, its Beams broke forth, diſpelled the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of Error, and gilded the Clouds of Opinion. A thouſand hidden Qualities ſprung up, which without its genial Influence had never been diſinterred. The unrelenting was ſoftened into Pity, and the Barbarian wondered by what Means he became broken into Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. Happy, my Fellow-Students, are we, whoſe good Fortune it was to be born in the golden Age of our Country. We have Advantages which to our Progenitors were not known. Their Knowledge was circumſcribed by the gloomy Woods, which ſurrounded the narrow Spots they had cleared. Ours is unconfined; the Cuſtoms, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Laws of every Nation are open to our View. We can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the ſacred Fountains of Antiquity, inſpect the Policy of Ages paſt, and, from thence, gather the Inſtructions of Wiſdom to guide our future Conduct. It is in our Power, if we be not wanting to ourſelves, to ſupport with Dignity the Cauſe of Religion, to ſuſtain with Firmneſs the Rights of Society, and to interpret with Preciſion the Laws of our Country. But let each of us remember that upon his own Induſtry depends all that can make him an Honor to this Temple of Science, a Bleſſing to the State, and an Ornament to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Nor does a good Education qualify us for public Stations alone. By its Help we are capacitated for diſcharging every Duty, and for reliſhing all the Sweets of private Life. Under its Auſpices we may meet Adverſity, in all her gorgon Terrors, without Diſmay.</p>
            <p>I ſhall treſpaſs on your Patience no longer than to conclude with the following Lines:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Forever, as the circling Years return,</l>
               <l>Grateful VIRGINIANS! crown the Hero's Urn;</l>
               <l>To his juſt Care you every Bleſſing owe,</l>
               <l>Which, or his own, or following Reigns beſtow.</l>
               <l>Tho' his hard Fate a Father's Name deny'd,</l>
               <l>To you a Father, he that Loſs ſupply'd.</l>
