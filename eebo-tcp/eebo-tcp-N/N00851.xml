            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Gracious Preſence of GOD with His People is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their happineſs; it is from thence that they are provided for, that they are protected, that they are healed, and that they do enjoy liberty: this is that which makes them multiply, and makes them rich and victorious. And the taking away of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001026_0003_0FAEF17487D30570"/>Preſence of God, opens a door to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of miſery. Hoſ. 9.12. <hi>And woe alſo unto them, when I ſhall depart from them.</hi> Deut. 31.17. <hi>Are not theſe evils come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, becauſe our God is not amongst us?</hi> This is that which God threatens here. Both <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were grown very Corrupt, and here God doth denounce His wrath againſt them.</p>
            <p>Where mind;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Evil threatned, <hi>I will go and return to my place:</hi> there is another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſame importance, ver. 6. <hi>He hath withdrawn himſelf from them.</hi> The phraſe is figurative; as if He ſhould ſay, I will ſhut up my ſelf in Heaven, and not come near you, to help you: I will abſent my ſelf and leave you deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of my preſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The continuance of this, <hi>Till they acknowledge their Offence.</hi> Hebr. <hi>Till they be Guilty.</hi> They were guilty already, God charges a great deal of guilt upon them: but the meaning is, till they own their Guilt. Their Sin here is called their Offence: ſometimes Sin is called Evil; being denominated from the nature of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001026_0004_0FAEF175953C37E0"/>it. There is no goodneſs in Sin, it is of an evil nature. Sometimes it is called Iniquity, becauſe it is contrary to Equity; there is unrighteouſneſs and inequality in it. Sometimes it is called Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe contrary to the Law. When men ſin, they tranſgreſs the bounds that God has ſet them. Here it is called Offence, becauſe it is provoking and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to God, this is that which they muſt acknowledge, they muſt neither deny their ſins, nor juſtify, or excuſe their ſin, but acknowledge them, and make confeſſion of them.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>God will not be Reconciled to His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, till they acknowledge their Offences.</q>
               <p>Many times a Corrupt people that have provoked God, are very backward to ownf their Offences. Many times inſtead of acknowledging them, they are juſtifying of them, and that under two notions; Either as matter of liberty or duty. Or, if they do not juſtify them, yet they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them: they find many conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001026_0005_0FAEF17866EDCE18"/>to alleviate their Guilt; but God will not be reconciled unto them, till they acknowledge their Offences. When they have offended God, it is very fair and reaſonable that they ſhould acknowledge it. &amp; God will make them do ſo before he Pardons them. There may be ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of wrath &amp; ceſſation of judgment, though they don't, but He will not be re<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>iled till they do. God is not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be reconciled to His People, that have wronged him, but yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects this: Jer. 3.12, 13. <hi>Only aknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thine offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What offences muſt they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The offences of the Land. Not all the offences that are in the Land: many offences are ſecret &amp; they cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them, ſome offences only being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guilt but the offences of the Land, that the People and Countrey are guilty of, are to be acknowledged by them. So in the <hi>Text,</hi> they ſhall acknowledge <hi>Their</hi> offence. And there be many ſins that the Land are guilty of, which muſt be owned.</p>
               <p>As;</p>

1. <hi>Such prevailing ſins as do not fall under the cognizance of Authority.</hi> When ever a people do manifeſt a Corrupt departed heart, an heart gone away from God; they break Covenant and are guilty: and this they may do when their carriages are not Criminal before men, nor Scandalous, as when they do not ſavour of a gracious, humble, believing ſpirit; but they ſavour much of vanity, worldlineſs, pride and unbelief; this is juſtly offenſive to God. Mat. 16.23. <hi>Thou ſavourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</hi> The Land becomes <hi>Guilty</hi> thereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Such ſins that have got ſuch head, that Authority cannot ſuppreſs them.</hi> Sometimes ſins get ſuch head, that it is quite beyond Authority to ſuppreſs them; the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of juſtice is not ſufficient to ſuppreſs them: people are got beyond the reſtraints of Authority, they are ſo over run with wickedneſs, that it is quite beyond the power of Rulers to reduce them; they riſe up againſt their Rulers. In this caſe, God imputes <hi>Iniquity</hi> to the Land, &amp; takes the caſe into his own hand, He judges and puniſhes them himſelf, as <hi>Hum.</hi> 14.10. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.2, 3.</p>

                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001026_0007_0FAEF179FAE61060"/>
3. <hi>Such ſins as are not duly witneſſed againſt.</hi> Sometimes there is a great deal of <hi>Iniquity</hi> in the Land, and yet there is little teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony born againſt it; thoſe that know the thing will not complain: they will talk of it, and blaſt the names of others; but don<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ke care that the thing may be puniſhed. If they know a thing in a man that they are angry with, they will complain: but, if he be a Friend, they won't. Sometimes the man is above them, and they are afraid to do it; ſometimes the man knows as much by them, and they dare not. In this caſe, the ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſin of the Land. So if there be complaint, and Rulers don't bear a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.5. Rev. 2.20. <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezabel.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſins of Rulers.</hi> When thoſe that are in Supream power, carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves corruptly, it is not only their ſin, but the ſin of the Land. A people is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Body politick, they are <hi>Joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> in Covenant with God; and the Sins of Rulers makes the Land <hi>Guilty.</hi> Saul'<hi>s ſlaying of the</hi> Gebeonites <hi>brought a Famine upon</hi> Iſrael. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. David<hi>'s Sin brought</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001026_0008_0FAEF17B18F9D068"/>
                  <hi>the Plague upon</hi> Iſrael. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. If Rulers do acts of injuſtice, carry <hi>Proudly,</hi> or <hi>Prophanely,</hi> it is imputed to the Land: and the Land ſuffers on that account. If other men don't approve of the thing, or connive at it, but in their places witneſs againſt it, yet the Land is <hi>Guilty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Who muſt acknowledge the Sins of the Land?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Rulers. As long as the Rulers carry <hi>Badly,</hi> God will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Countrey. God doth expect that they ſhould acknowledge their own iniquities, and the iniquities of the Countrey; if they do juſtify or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the ſins of the Countrey, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if others do follow their example. However, their impenitency will be imputed; though they be great men, yet it is not beneath them to acknowledge the Sins of the Land: they won't be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, becauſe of their ſtate and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Acknowledging of iniquity is not the work of the common People only, but the work of principal Rulers. <hi>David</hi> did ſo, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. ſo did the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Nineve, Jon.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. ſo did <hi>Joſiah;</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001026_0009_0FAEF17B50878D58"/>the contrary carriage in <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> did greatly provoke God. Jer. 36.24. <hi>Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the King, nor any of his Servants, that heard all theſe words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Body of the People.</hi> It is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by God, that every one of the people ſhould acknowledge there offence; It is a rare caſe, but that there be ſome perverſe people, which will not be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the provocations of the Land; but the body of the people muſt do it. If the generality of the people be obſtinate, &amp; ſtand in the juſtification of themſelves, the anger of God will continue; God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that there ſhould be a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their offence. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there be ſome mourners that are lamenting and bewailing the ſins of the Land, and they ſhall procure mercy for themſelves. Ezek. 9.4. <hi>Set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that Sigh and that Cry for all the abominations, that are done in the midſt thereof.</hi> But in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, there muſt be a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the offence. Judg. 10.10. <hi>The Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>Cryed unto the Lord, ſaying, we have Sinned, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001026_0010_0FAEF17C0B398900"/>
Queſt. 3 <hi>How muſt they acknowledge their Offence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They muſt acknowledge ſome things in <hi>General</hi> and ſome in <hi>Particular.</hi> The things that provoke God are of two ſorts; ſometimes it is a courſe of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:</hi> ſo a way of Pride, Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Superſtition; and then the things are to be acknowledged in the general; it is impoſſible to deſcend to all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acts; but it is fit it ſhould be done as particularly, as the thing will admit. Dan. 9.5, 6. <hi>We have Sinned, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Iniquity, and have Rebelled, neither have we hearkned to thy Servants the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c.</hi> Sometimes the provocation is ſome particular evil; as the making of the Golden <hi>Calf,</hi> the iniquity of <hi>Peor, Davids</hi> numbring of the people: and in this caſe, things ſhould be acknowledged particularly; ſo did <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They muſt acknowledge them to God, and ſometimes to Men.</hi> They are to be acknowledged before God in Prayer; they muſt come before God, and ſpread their iniquities in a way of <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> they muſt fall down before God as <hi>Guilty.</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001026_0011_0FAEF17CD5BFF288"/>32.5. <hi>I acknowledged my Sin unto thee.</hi> Publick ſins ſhould be confeſſed Publickly. And many times alſo they ſhould be Confeſſed unto men; as there is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſometimes men do expoſtulate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with others, and tell them of their ſins; and then they ſhould be ready to acknowledge them 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13 <hi>And</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Nathan, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> They may not ſtand in their juſtification, and plead for their ſin. So many times, there is occaſion to diſcourſe of ſuch practiſes, and then men ſhould teſtify againſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They muſt acknowledge them with Grief and Shame.</hi> Sometimes though men do acknowledge their ſins, yet they have a ſtupid Spirit, and are inſenſible of their vileneſs: this is very offenſive to God; He won't turn away from his Anger when it is thus. Jer. 3.3. <hi>Thou refuſeſt to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> Jer. 6.15. <hi>Were they aſhamed, when they had committed Abomination? Nay they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh.</hi> So God expects they ſhould be ſorry for their ſin. Pſal. 38.18. <hi>I will be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> But when men don't lay the thing to heart, are not ſenſible what they have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001026_0012_0FAEF17DCD164BC8"/>done, the thing don't lie upon their hearts; Gods Anger will not be turned away. Their repentance muſt be at leaſt viſibly ſincere repentance: when there is plain apparent mockery in their repentance &amp; acknowledgments, Gods Anger will not be turned away from them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>Why muſt they acknowledge their Offences, in order to Reconciliation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Till they acknowledge their <hi>Offences,</hi> they will not juſtify God in His <hi>Judgments.</hi> When people do in their hearts acknowledge their iniquities, they are under advantages to ſee the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God in His proceedings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Exod. 9.27. <hi>The Lord is Righteous, and Land my People are wicked.</hi> But if they do not acknowledge their ſins, no wonder if they murmure, and impute hard dealings to God, and think that God deals very rigidly with them. Men will be apt to lay the fault of judgments upon God, and not take it to themſelves. Iſa. 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou ſeeſt us not? Wherefore have we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted our Souls, and thou takeſt no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> They will wonder at the ſeverity of God, at leaſt they won't ſee how much
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001026_0013_0FAEF17E461EA680"/>cauſe they have to juſtify God. If they ſee it is righteouſs that they ſhould be afflicted upon the account of ſome other things, that they do own, vet they don't ſee what abundant cauſe they have given God to be angry with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Till they do this, there is no hope of their Reformation.</hi> Men muſt reform their iniquities, before Gods anger do turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Iſa. 9.12, 13. <hi>For all this, His anger is not turned away, but his Hand is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſtill: For the people turneth not to Him that ſmiteth them.</hi> While ſin is not reformed, the cauſe of judgment does continue: the Breach cannot be made up, while they walk in wayes of prova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and this they will do, till they do acknowledge their offence. A particular perſon may reform, though he does not acknowledge his ſin, he may do it from a ſpirit of compliance, he is loth to make trouble, and grieve others, or becauſe his temptation is changed, now he is Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; or grown Old, and don't deſire to do as formerly he did, or becauſe he is convinced that it is a ſin, yet is aſhamed to confeſs it; but ordinarily there is no hope of bringing a Land to reformation,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001026_0014_0FAEF1817B4D6580"/>if they do not acknowledge their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: acknowledging goes before forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Prov. 28.13. <hi>He that Confeſſeth and Forſaketh ſhall find mercy.</hi>

                  <hi>See hence, it is a very hard thing for a Corrupt People to be reconciled unto God.</hi> When once there is a breach made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his People, it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to have it made up. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſuffer abundance, before the the thing is taken up; they are under frowning diſpenſations for ſeveral Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. When once the wrath of God begins to break out, no man knows when there will be an end.

Iſa. 9.12. <hi>His anger is not turned away, but his Hand is stretched out ſtill.</hi> Scarce a year paſſes but there is wrath. How comes this about, not that people do not deſire reconciliation, they are weary of the wrath of God, &amp; could be glad to be quiet, and be let alone: neither is it that God doth lay any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable terms upon them; for if they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001026_0015_0FAEF1826582E7C0"/>will own their faults and turn to Him, He will pardon them. But they are very backward to own their faults: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are reſtrain'd a little, and held in by Civil Authority, but they are not throughly convinced, nor heartily acknowledge their offences: Sometimes they are reſtrained by the Judgments of God, and appearances of Anger; but they don't acknowledge their offences: if there be ſome reformation, it is a forced thing, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34 32. They are told of their faults and reproved abundantly, but they go on and juſtify themſelves, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.2. Men will ſtand mightily upon the juſtification of themſelves. <hi>Mal.</hi> 6 3.

               <p>To thoſe that are backward to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Offences: <hi>God has taken great Offences at His People here, and has testifyed againſt us by many awful judgments, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe diſpenſations, men run into two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams:</hi> Some out of an over-timerous ſpirit, own guile where there is none; when ſcared they Condemn this and that practice, and then after a while return to it again: but the more general fault is, that men are backward to fall down as guilty before God; but hold up their heads as they, Jer. 2.35. <hi>Thou ſayeſt I have not ſinned.</hi> There is a ſelf juſtifying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they don't fall under reproof. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Ye ſaid, wherein ſhall we return?</hi> They are exceeding backward to acknowledge their offences; they ſhut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light; when conviction is ſet before them, they are rejecting of it.

                  <hi>To acknowledge your Offences.</hi> I have no reaſon to urge you to acknowledge any thing for offences that are not offences, but what is indeed Sin ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged whether it be little or great, whether it be perſonal or Publick: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſtimation others have of it, there is no reaſon that you ſhould bear up your up your ſelves in any thing that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to God: the want of this has been the great Wound of the <hi>Countrey.</hi> Jer. 3.13. <hi>Only acknowledge thine Offence.</hi> This is that which prolongs our ſorrows, let

               <p>Conſider here a few things, that may be uſeful in order to the owning of your Offences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a poor way to defend your ſelves that ſuch things as you do are not in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Evils.</hi> Men ſay, they can't ſee that ſuch and ſuch Practiſes are utterly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: they don't believe that Periwig are unlawful, they are a comely means to ſupply the defects of Nature. And they don't believe that going to a Tavern is unlawful, if it be, why are they allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Authority?</hi> And they don't believe that this and that Dreſs can be proved to be unlawful; but ſuppoſe it be ſo, this is no defence. A great part of the Sin of this Land, lies in the abuſing of lawful Liberties, and doing that which is in it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001026_0030_0FAEF1912CA06C58"/>ſelf lawful, under ſuch circumſtances as render it utterly unlawful. Herein lies their ſin, that to them that do it, and as it is done, it is unlawful. It may be lawful in one caſe, and very ſinful in another. So <hi>Davids</hi> numbring of the People. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is of great advantage toget Holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and an Heart willing to do your Duty.</hi> Many times men ſay, that ſuch and ſuch things don't ſeem to them to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, they ſee no hurt in them: a man may have <hi>Charity</hi> to believe them, though the things be very bad; for they are under the power of ſtrong Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A Covetous man thinks his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous actions to be good Husbandry: and a Proud man thinks his Pride to be ſuitable to his place; their luſts blind their <hi>Eyes.</hi> Iſa. 5.20. <hi>They call good evil, and evil good.</hi> Their Conſciences are darkned: they have ſinned <hi>away</hi> a great deal of the light of Nature; Sin has got power not <hi>only</hi> over their Affections, but their Judgments. Yea, many of them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001026_0031_0FAEF191C75D77B0"/>if <hi>they</hi> knew they were ſins. The <hi>way</hi> for ſuch men is to get <hi>Holy</hi> diſpoſitions, and a <hi>Tender</hi> Conſcience, then <hi>they</hi> wonld more <hi>eaſily</hi> diſcern what is amiſs: as <hi>David,</hi> when his heart ſmote him for cutting off the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> Garment. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is good to conſider whether you could like the thing in other perſons.</hi> Some perſons ſtand upon their juſtification, and <hi>yet they</hi> would utterly diſlike the thing in others: <hi>They</hi> reproach others, and are not ſenſible of any <hi>Irregularity</hi> in it; but if others ſerve them ſo, <hi>they Cry out of it.</hi> They will do damage themſelves but <hi>they</hi> can't bear it in others: <hi>They</hi> lie in other mens debts, and find great fault that others lie in theirs; They wonder what other men do with their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they think they can't anſwer it. This ſhews that whatever theſe men do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, yet their Conſciences do Condemn their Practiſes Rom. 2.1. <hi>Thou art inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable O Man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt, for wherein thou Judgeſt another, thou Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thy ſelf, for thou that judgeſt doeſt the ſame things.</hi>

4. <hi>It is a ſign that you know your are Guilty, when you don't like it that men ſhould ſay thoſe things of you, that you do.</hi> You can't endure that men ſhould ſay of you, that you are a ſhuffling man in your dealings, and that you love ſtrong Drink; that you are a Pot Companion, or a bad Pay-maſter: You are vext and angry with them that ſay ſo: though you know the thing to be true, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe your heart tells you that it is not right, you know in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that it is no commendation, but a diſcommendation. <hi>The Thief is aſhamed when he is taken.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>It is a poor way to juſtify your ſelves from ſuch arguments, as you deſpiſe in other caſes.</hi> Men juſtify themſelves becauſe ſome Good people do allow it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Miniſters think there is no hurt in it; or becauſe thoſe that charge them with ſin, are very faulty themſelves in ſome other things; or becauſe thoſe men were miſtaken in ſome other caſes: but if men ſhould argue thus with you, you would count it a ridiculous way of
