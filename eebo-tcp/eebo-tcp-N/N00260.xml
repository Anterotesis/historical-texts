            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="1">1. To shew that he hath no need of any, he hath forsaken many, and may forsake many more, to shew that he hath no need of any. God would have all the world to take notice, (that though all men have need of him, yet) he hath no need of any man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To testifie his Sanctity, and severity against sin. He will not spare them, that have been near him, if they will not spare their sin for him. He is a holy God, and if they will have their sins, and their lusts, and their wayes and their o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cting this judgement on them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To be a war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing to all that enjoy his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence. That they see that they make much of it, and that they take heed that they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000330_0013_0FA4AD66FB1AFF28"/>
do not sin against him, and forsake him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to forsake them also.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cant.</hi> The point is to be understood of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are visibly and externally near and dear to him, and these may be totally and finally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of God: and yet here it must be noted, that God may exercise a deal of patience, and forbearance toward such as he is about to forsake, he did so with the old world, he did so with the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old, he did so with the seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Asia</hi>: he is not wont suddenly, and at once to forsake a people, that have been near and dear to him; but he is wont to give them warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in patience to bear a while with their frowardness, and wait to see if there be any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him, before he doth inflict this heavy and sharp judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> It serves to admonish us, not to bear our selves too high, upon the account of priviledges. It is a great priviledge to have the Lord near us, and to be near unto him: and some lean upon this though they abide in their sin, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>They build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with ini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. If God hath threatned it as a very sore judgement, then sure it is so. Now when God hath been angry with a people, he hath manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same by menac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. It appears to be a sore judgement, by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and distress, that such have been in, that have been sensible that God hath forsaken them.

Why art thou so far from helping me? and from the words of my roaring? Oh my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not, and in the night season, and am not silent.</hi> Oh how <hi>Saul</hi> roared out his distress! and that on this account especially, that God was departed from him, not so much that the <hi>Philistines</hi> were upon him, had not God been gone, he could have dealt well enough with them; but here was the misery, and the sting of the misery, <hi>God was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him.</hi>
