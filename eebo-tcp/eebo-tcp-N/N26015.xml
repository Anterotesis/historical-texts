            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Introduction,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SOMETIMES human beings are unreaſonably charmed with novelty; and at other times reject that which is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and good without ſufficient trial. What has appeared wrong, on account of ſome adventitious circumſtances, has been rejected, as wrong in its own nature. This has been exactly the caſe with ſchool exhibitions—They are in themſelves exceedingly uſeful—When they are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted they enlarge the ideas and poliſh the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of ſtudents. They ſhow an example of moral precepts repreſented in real life—But by means of ſome injudicious attempts, the public mind ſeems greatly prejudiced againſt them. It is ſaid
<q>they are expenſive, that they encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age profanity and vice; that the feelings of ſtudents are often hurt by the diſtribution of parts—or their parents cruelly mortified—that ſtudents acquire by them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent confidence, and that they intrude upon ſtudies more neceſſary and uſeful than rhetoric—and they are imitations of a theatre, which is always a ſeminary of vice.</q>
Yet we believe, that they may be ſo managed as not to be chargeable with any of theſe evils; but be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a moſt innocent and rational amuſement, and not only improve the outward carriage of the ſtudents; but implant the moſt uſeful morals in them; and in the minds of their friends, who attend their performances. And the deſign of the introduction of this work, is to ſhow how this may be done. For perſpicuity's ſake I ſhall conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er myſelf as ſpeaking to a perſon who wiſhes to know my ſentiments of an exhibition.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION I. OF GUARDING AGAINST PREJUDICES.</head>
               <p>IT is vain for a ſtudent, new from a univerſity, to think of confronting the prejudices of a people by mere aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and confidently reprobating their opinions—Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034600_0005_0FFF10A45BBD5D38"/>
reſent ſuch treatment; and the prejudice is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from that very cauſe. It is beſt to begin with a ſmall exhibition, and only aſk to ſhow a few pieces—Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are afraid of what is done in the dark—for that reaſon get ſome popular perſon or perſons to look over your pieces before exhibition, and ſhow the utmoſt readineſs to have them rejected if thought improper. Then tell thoſe, who inſpect your pieces, by no means to admit ſuch as they diſlike. And if there be a ſingle word, or phraſe, which offends, let it be ſtruck out without mercy. If they ſhould reject all but ſimple dialogues, be content. But exhibit them in the moſt advantageous manner.</p>
               <p>When the audience can bear dialogues, the number of dialogiſts may be increaſed, and ſoon it will be found that dramas, if not in themſelves offenſive to religion and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, will be perfectly harmleſs—Adhere to the ſyſtem of correcting them perfectly before they are given out to the ſtudents, by yourſelf and by others. Women are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally better judges of the delicacy of writings than men. —Apply then to ſome of the moſt ſenſible, and beſt edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ladies, in the town, or diſtrict, where you keep a ſchool; and deſire that they will examine your pieces, and note every paſſage which offends them. Such paſſages muſt all be ſacrificed, and there is no loſs in the caſe —You will probably ſubſtitute better phraſes in the room of thoſe excepted againſt, get a character for modeſty, and acquire a purity of ſtile in your original compoſitions.</p>
               <p>Do not imagine that your pieces in order to pleaſe muſt be calculated, to excite laughter. Thoſe which excite the loudeſt peals of mirth o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ten pleaſe the leaſt on the whole. —People often laugh at buffoonery, and when they go away from the ſcene, where they ſaw it, are angry with, and condemn themſelves for being pleaſed, even for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You may inſert diverting p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ces, and it is generally beſt in the courſe of an exhibition, to have one or two that are laughable, but it is not adviſable to have your pieces moſtly of that caſt. Thoſe which are ſublime, which waken the mind and benevolent affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which excite the ſentiments of piety or ſhew moral principles to advantage, will pleaſe all people who are not ideots or totally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their mental taſte. Moſt of the pieces performed at an exhibition ſhould decidedly be of the uſeful kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thoſe which are more diverting, ſhould be perfectly harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034600_0006_0FFF13F20B9D7AF0"/>
—It is beſt never to deſcend lower than thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote politeneſs and good humor.</p>
               <p>Another thing ſhould be attended to with great care. That none of the pieces be of ſuch a nature as to bear even a plauſible application to any perſon in the town, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where you are, in the way of ridicule—The wounds of ridicule are incurable, and the attempt of taking off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, is never forgiven.—Rather drop a diverting piece, or let vice paſs unpuniſhed, than offer a direct affront to any perſon by an exhibition. And avoid all general ſatire —It can never be juſt—If a married man be a ridiculous character; let it be, becauſe he abuſes his wife or his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren—If an old bachelor, becauſe he is miſchievous and ill-natured—an old maid becauſe ſhe is vicious, and diſturbs the peace of families—a lawyer for knavery—a prieſt for keeping low company—a merchant for cheating—is lawful prize for ridicule. But nothing that is good or uſeful, or even harmleſs ſhould be ridiculed—And good men and women are found in all the lawful employments of life— above all things religion—marriage—and neceſſary and uſeful labor, ſhould be exempted from ridicule.</p>
               <p>Let not exhibitions be too expenſive—People are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hurt by expence, and will not long love that which draws their money from them—In ſome inſtances, bands of muſic have been hired, a great expence has been incurred for dreſſes, decorations for a ſtage, machines, and what not. Exhibitions can never become cuſtomary with all theſe appendages—They would baniſh themſelves by the mere coſt of maintaining them—Only reflect that you are at the head of a ſchool, and are not the manager of a theatre, and you will avoid thoſe extremes—The object of ſpeaking in ſchools is, to uſe the ſtudent to a clear, and judicious mode of expreſſion, and action, on all the occaſions of life, and buſineſs. This may be provided for at a very ſmall expence, as we ſhall ſhow in another place.</p>
               <p>Be very careful that the ſentiments contained in your pieces be juſt and philoſophically true—that they be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purified from all prophane, obſcene and low, black-guardly ſentiments, and phraſes—and that the phraſes which expreſs humor, as thoſe peculiar to clowns, cits, ſailors, ſoldiers &amp;c. be ſuch, as will not offend perſons of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty and good taſte. By theſe means you will avoid hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bad impreſſion on the minds of the audience in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034600_0007_0FFF10A6DBB9D2F8"/>
firſt and moſt ſimple performances of rhetoric, and if they be performed well it will create a deſire to hear thoſe which are more perfect till at laſt you may freely exhibit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is promotive of piety or morals, and be only the more approved as the performances are more complete—But we muſt now deſcribe the apparatus and manner of an exhibition.</p>

               <p>IT is neceſſary in your ſchoolhouſe, to have a ſmall eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planade, or ſtage. If no one be made in the conſtruction of the houſe you may erect a temporary one. It will be very convenient to have a room behind the ſtage, to which the performers can withdraw, when they ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed abſent. About this ſtage, on a frame erected for the purpoſe, you may draw curtains, to conceal the ſtage, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the audience. This will give opportunity to repreſent different ſcenes of action. Then by tables, books, &amp;c. the ſtage may repreſent a ſtudy—by national arms, and emblems &amp;c. a court—by military trophies, an encampment or field of war—by means of ſhackles, chains &amp;c. a priſon—by handſome furniture, a gentleman's parlor—by cheap furniture, of the rural kind, a cottage or ſhepherd's tent &amp;c. Thus on a ſtage of no more than twelve feet by eight—by ſuch judicious alterations, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects may be produced on the imagination, which are truly ſurprizing, if we conſider the cauſe, and it may be done without any extraordinary expenſe.</p>
               <p>Beſide the curtains which are drawn around the ſtage, there ſhould be one drawn acroſs from ſide to ſide, which may totally hide the back-ſcene, and be ſo contrived, as to open at the end, and in the middle. Perſons engaged in oppoſite parties, ſentiments, or intereſts, or who are any way at variance, ſhould enter on oppoſite ſides of the ſtage. If during the repreſentations they be not reconciled they ſhould alſo depart on oppoſite ſides, if they become friends they ſhould go off on the ſame ſide &amp;c. while the others are performing; they, who are to follow, muſt remain concealed behind the back curtain, if there be no drawing

room behind. If there be a drawing room behind, that is properly the place for the performers who are waiting— the curtain opens in the middle to receive ſome grand or auguſt character—Or opening into another room, it may repreſent objects at a diſtance—Or it may repreſent an action which is ſeen from one room into another. As in the "<hi>Orphan of China,</hi>" the opening of the curtain in the middle, and the ladies cloſing the door by ſtanding cloſe together, while the children, threatened to be kil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Maſks, dreſſes arms, emblems, profeſſional implements, may eaſily and occaſionally be procured, as they may be of uſe, by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing them of the owners.</p>

               <p>IT ſhould be a capital maxim in ſelecting the perſons to perform, that they be heartily willing for the enterprize and deſirous of diſtinguiſhing themſelves —Unleſs your ſuperiors or employers require, never take any perſon who expreſſes reluctance to be a ſpeaker. Such will never perform well. And be aſſured that the parents or guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of each ſtudent, approve of his being inſtructed in rhetoric, before you beſtow your pains upon him. By theſe precautions you will not only avoid blame; but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape a derangement of your exhibition after it is formed.</p>

And let them begin with the ſhorter parts, and thoſe which require the leaſt ſkill in ſpeaking—And it may be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

               <p>In this firſt ſelection by theſe means you will have a lively ſpirited corps of volunteers for your exhibition— and you will have no guardian or parent blaming you for compelling his boys or girls to ſpeak againſt their wills and expoſing their weakneſs, in caſe they ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Before you diſtribute the parts other points are to be conſidered—It muſt not be thought that you intend to mark the foibles or vices of any of your performers in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Should you aſſign the part of a clown, to a perſon nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally clumſy and awkward, he, and his parents, might think you meant it as a ſtigma upon him, or the family. Should you aſſign the part of a rogue, to a boy who is known to be ſuch a character; it will give offence. And neither of the parts would be performed well; thro an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy conſciouſneſs which would attend the performance. If you would eſcape the uneaſineſs of relations or diſcontent in your ſchool, all aſſignments which would carry a pointed reflection on individuals or families muſt be avoided—And there are certain principles which may help you out of all difficulty.</p>

               <p>But, as to grave and ſerious characters being good, they muſt be aſſigned to grave and ſerious perſons—Merry or cheerful characters to perſons of the ſame caſt.

               <p>FOR the principal character in each piece you will doubtleſs ſelect a ſpeaker on whom you can depend for ſteadineſs of temper, and complete ſelf command—You
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034600_0011_0FFF13BB5F660660"/>
will do the ſame for any perſons who will perform the ſingle pieces. If you have a ſingle piece to begin your exhibition, let it be given to a perſon of great firmneſs. For complete coolneſs, and ſelfcommand, are in no part of an exhibition, ſo neceſſary as in the firſt piece that is ſpoken. The firſt piece, ſpoken well, gives ſuch a ſpring to the ſpirits of the performers who are to follow; as will carry with it the moſt happy effects, thro the whole exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition—And in fact the firſt performance is the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and moſt trying to the feelings of the performer. If it ſhould fail it will ſink the ſpirits of the other performers, and probably ſpoil the whole exhibition. For performing the laſt piece which ſhould be a ſingle one, and an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue to the whole, you ſhould have that ſpeaker in your ſchool, who has the moſt ſweet and harmonious voice, with the moſt eaſy and gentle manners, and in every view the moſt pleaſing ſpeaker. For this part ſhould make the audience feel intenſely, and as it was ſaid of Pericles the Orator, ſhould leave the ſting of pleaſure in the hearts of the hearers. If you have an intermediate ſingle piece, any good and clear ſpeaker may have it and we ſhall ſhow hereafter of what advantage ſuch a piece may be—The reſt of the parts may be diſpoſed of according to your diſcret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Only due regard ſhould be had to the voice and manner of performing.—A ſlow mournful voice ſuits a melancholy part; a voice hard and ſharp an angry charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a ſoft and ſweet voice and manners agree to a father of a family, a lover, a flatterer &amp;c. a lively ſharp voice to a merry character &amp;c. but a little attention and experience is worth more than a thouſand rules.</p>
               <p>To avoid giving offence by diſtributing the parts; take notice how many performers you have, and let the ſingle pieces be conſidered. Let each ſtudent who deſires it have nearly as many lines to ſpeak, as they who perform the ſingle pieces—the leaſt offenſive way of diſpoſing of the ſingle pieces which are conſidered as moſt <hi>honorary</hi> becauſe in them the whole attention of the audience is turned on the ſpeaker—is to diſpoſe of them in the ſchool by <hi>ballot.</hi> Let the ſtudents ballot for the perſons to perform them— while the precep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

—there is no danger in this way. A ſchool <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill ſeldom chooſe wrong. The preceptor is never conſidered as in the fault. The ſcholars are pleaſed, and eaſy among themſelves. And it is a good exerciſe to train them up to act the part of judicious electors in a free ſtate. If thoſe who muſt take under parts be good ſpeakers, and deſire it, give them a duplicate of parts—that is, two parts, each making up in the whole, nearly as great a number of lines as thoſe have who have ſingle parts or principal parts in dialogues—thoſe who are content with ſhort parts, leave content, and urge no more upon them.</p>
               <p>As to the quality of the parts aſſigned, ſome will ſhow the ſpeaker to advantage, and ſome will not—the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a vicious character is generally bad—to aſſign an immodeſt or profane part to any ſcholar, male, or female, is wrong. There ſhould be no ſuch in ſchool—ſuch par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But it is neceſſary ſometimes to repreſent vicious parts, elſe the virtuous characters would not appear to advantage. Much of the admiration of virtue depends on its being contraſted with vice—ſuch paſſions as jealouſy, diſcontent, ill humor, &amp;c. muſt be repreſented.

               <p>Now as the baſe paſſions give a perſon a diſagreeable appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, if you aſſign only a part which repreſents a ſcholar in a diſagreeable view to the audience, you mortify the ſcholar, and give pain to his relations and friends. For this reaſon the moſt diſagreeable parts ſhould be aſſigned to thoſe who, in the other part of the duplicate, have the moſt agreeable —never aſſign two very agreeable parts, or two very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable once to the ſame ſcholar but treat the parts, as Laban did his daughters; make the good ones put off the bad—two parts of middling length, or goodneſs, may be aſſigned together, or otherwiſe, let a good and a bad, a long and a ſhort one, go together. By this method your ſcholars will be ſatisfied, and you will have the credit of acting impartially.</p>

               <p>BEING ſtored with ſingle pieces, dialogues, dramas, and all legitimate materials of an exhibition—nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane or indecent being admitted—having alſo digeſted righteous principles of aſſigning parts in your mind and compleated that difficult work; it now remains, to arrange thoſe parts ſo, as to conſtitute an agreeable whole—the firſt thing is to determine how many ſingle pieces you will have. You may think it an arbitrary matter, but it is not—there ought to be two, three, or five—one ſingle piece makes the exhibition appear odd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt then have a head without feet, or feet without a head—two ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle pieces convey an idea of a beginning and end, in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar method—but ſuch an exhibition, tho it may not offend, becauſe it is regular, will not pleaſe in the higheſt degree, becauſe it does not excite an idea of variety which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear—five ſingle pieces, unleſs you mean to have a very long exhibition, will be out of all proportion with the other parts—and four exactly divides the exhibition into halves, and annihilates the pleaſing idea of variety in the general arrangement.</p>
               <p>Three ſingle pieces ſeem then to be the number moſt convenient, and we ſhall call them the prologue, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, and the epilogue.—Very much of the eclat of an exhibition depends on theſe—we ſhall therefore deſcribe them in their order with the parts which ſhould come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The PROLOGUE or introductory piece ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be aſſumed from ſome topic which is calculated to waken the tender feelings of the audience, and diſpoſe them to candor—the tender ſenſibility of youth, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pleaſe, their expectations of kindneſs from their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and friends, are ſuitable ideas for a <hi>prologue.</hi> And theſe may be mixed with any other which may prepare the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to receive the exhibition kindly—It ſhould be ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en generally in a rather low pitch of the voice and with the air of diffidence, expreſſive of the modeſty of the ſtudents and the reſpect which they feel for the audience.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034600_0014_0FFF13FB46884590"/>
Nothing is more abſurd than bluſtering, and towering rhetoric in a prologue.</p>
               <p>If there be any ſerious buſineſs of the ſchool, ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of ſcholars in reading, philoſophy, or any branch of ſcience, it beſt comes in immediately after the prologue, and while the attention of the audience is not yet fatigued. But if every thing of this kind has been tranſacted before;-let the moſt ſerious and ſublime pieces follow the prologue. While the attention is not yet fatigued the ſerious and the ſublime ſtrike the mind with much the greateſt advantage. Matters which are weighty and apply to the judgment, are ill introduced after the mind is already overcharged. They cannot be received with the approbation they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and conſequently will be thought to be dull, and inſipid.</p>
               <p>It is a miſtake to ſuppoſe an audience will not reliſh ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matter—Variety is pleaſing to the human mind; and that exhibition will pleaſe moſt, which has ſome pieces ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſome highly argumentative and rational, ſome pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic, ſome merely intereſting, ſome highly diverting.— But moſt exhibitors err in forever aiming to excite a laugh. They are often unſucceſsful, and then it occaſions diſguſt. —And they are in danger of making the whole a ſcene of low buffoonery.</p>
               <p>When the dialogiſts have tranſacted all matters of the moſt ſerious and ſolid kind, it will be beſt to vary the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and bring in the</p>
               <p n="2">2. INTERMEDIATE—a ſingle piece, taken from any top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic which is amuſing. It ſhould be a piece which requires no great attention of the mind to underſtand it; and it ought not by any means to be pathetic or ſublime; but ſome pretty ſpeech, which ſhall relieve the attention, and give the mind opportunity to recruit itſelf for the Dramas which are to follow. The fable of the Two Ladies, the Floriſt and the Bear, is a good example. The character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of this part is that it entertains the mind without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing it, and leaves all the ſtronger paſſions unengaged for the pathetic ſcenes which are to follow. Next after the intermediate ſhould come in the moſt intereſting and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate pieces which you have to exhibit. Theſe will take leſs, if exhibited after the audience have been raiſed to a high pitch of mirth. Then to conclude the dialogiſtic rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation,

A well written Epilogue, in which all the ornament and pomp of verſe may be ſhown, all the graces of the moſt refined elocution ſhould be diſplayed, pronounced in a mixt ſchool by ſome elegant young lady, will give ſuch a finiſhing ſtroke to the whole, as to leave the audience little power or will to criticiſe upon the performances. And they muſt go away pronouncing it a good exhibition. If they find their feelings are not ſhocked, or their reaſon affronted, but with the entertainment they have received good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which remain fixed in their memories, they will not long be enemies to exhibitions.</p>

Let two of four and three of ſix dramatic pieces precede the intermediate, and the ſame numbers follow it: thus you will have either ſeven or nine pieces in the whole; and the odd numbers are beſt, becauſe they remove the idea of uniformity, which is tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome when carried to an exceſs.</p>

                  </gap>heir perſons. See that they be cleanly, and neat in their dreſs, that they be well waſhed and combed every day. This done will give them genteel feelings, which will expreſs themſelves in genteel airs. Allow no ſcholar to affect oddity or to dreſs in an abſurd, and uncouth manner. Uſe them to decent and handſome poſitions in reading—correct them if they hang their heads down on their boſoms or on one ſide, if they ſtoop forward or ſtrut back immoderately. Suffer them not to lounge and loll about, to diſtort their faces, or limbs, to roll their eyes about, or make any awkward or diſagreeable motion, with them.</p>
               <p>Inſtruct them how to come into a room and how to go out—Let a young gentleman always ſtand firmly on his feet to make a bow, and learn to bring up his feet to a firm poſition—without appearing to deſign it—When a man beings up his right foot ſo that the heel of it ſhall be two or three inches diſtant from the buckle or ſhoetye of the left, he ſtands in a good poſition to make a bow—He ſhould take off his hat, raiſing his hand to his head in a ſpiral line —not catching it off, in a direct line, either ſideways, or before. He ſhould bend his body not in one point only, but its flexture ſhould begin from the neck and proceed from thence gradually downward—And a bow to expreſs rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034600_0017_0FFF13C56410A698"/>
ſhould at leaſt be ſo low, that the eyes in their nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural poſition in the head, ſhould be directed to the feet of the perſon to whom the bow is made. However it muſt be varied according to the greater or leſs degree of reſpect to be expreſſed by it—There ſhould be no toſs of the head, no hitch, or jerk in making a bow. But the motion of it, ſhould always be ſmooth and eaſy both in falling and raiſing of the body—The hat ſhould be put on with the hand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a ſpiral line, as in taking it off—and in taking off the hat, and putting it on, you ſhould never bring your hat between your face, and the face of the perſon to whom your ſpeech is directed—The arms ſhould, in entering a room, hang eaſy by the ſides, neither extended in any direction nor hanging exactly parallel to the ſides of the body.</p>
               <p>A young Lady ſhould in general enter a room with a ſteady modeſt countenance. She ſhould bring up her feet to a firm poſition to make a courteſy. Perhaps as good a one for general uſe as any is to have the heel of the left foot at a moderate diſtance from the ſhoetye of the right, and govern her motions with her right foot; or if a lady does not find this eaſy, let her take the reverſe, or any poſition in which ſhe can ſtand firm to command her motions, and her figure not be ungraceful—It is very graceful to bring her clothes forward by a ſmall almoſt imperceptible motion, ſo as to hide the flexure of her limbs, before ſhe lets herſelf down— Then ſhe ſhould appear to ſink with an eaſy motion, as low as intended, and if ſhe can add a very ſmall motion, as if withdrawing thro modeſty from the object to which ſhe addreſſes herſelf, it will make her appear very graceful. She ſhould with an eaſy motion, riſe to her natural mode of ſtanding—Here let it be obſerved that her arms ſhould not be folded on her lap; but hang in an eaſy manner, at the ſides. And the withdrawing motion, ſhould be very ſmall, in all inſtances. And by perſons who naturally ſtoop forward it had better be wholly omitted. Nay it had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be omitted by all who cannot perform it gracefully.</p>
               <p>If your ſcholars have had the advantage of a good dancing ſchool, it will ſave you much attention to theſe matters—but if they have had no inſtruction of this kind, it muſt be given, or you never will have a good exhibition.</p>
               <p>The main difficulty is to get a ſcholar into the habit of entering into and going out of a room with perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and eaſe of mind. For this end it will be uſeful to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034600_0018_0FFF1401130DA3C8"/>
let your ſcholars, taking their turns, go out of the ſchool room, ſpeaking ſomething to the ſtudent, as "ladies, or gentlemen," (as the caſe may be) "we wiſh you a happy day" or in entering— ſaying "gentlemen or ladies I am very happy to ſee you" or any other civil ſentence or phraſe— this ſhould be done while they are conſcious of being obſerved by the ſchool. And when they are able to do this compoſedly, you will ſoon find them able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing with compoſure, which you can wiſh them to perform.</p>
               <p>For the movements of the hands, &amp;c. &amp;c. and how the paſſions are expreſſed— you may look into any of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon books on this ſubject. The "Art of Speaking" ſays as much on that head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as is uſeful, and even more. As to the expreſſion of the paſſions in the countenance, the <hi>Plate of the paſſions</hi> in the Engliſh "Preceptor;" or in <hi>Hogarth's "Analyſis of Beauty,</hi>" will teach more than all the written precepts in the world.</p>
               <p>But the rhetoric of young ladies ſhould be ſuitable to their ſex. It ſhould never be violent. A lady ſhould never extend her arms at full length, or ſtrike her boſom with her hands, or raiſe her hand aloft, above her head — a lady in any violent paſſion ſhould not give it full vent; but appear to be endeavoring to ſuppreſs it.—And never even till death ſhould loſe her care for decency—And a lady ſhould never addreſs an aſſembly at large; but may ſpeak to her parents, her guardian, her ſchool mates, &amp;c. And of all things a lady ſhould never addreſs herſelf to the young men. It ſhould always be conſidered that a young lady in a ſchool is not actreſs but merely a ſcholar. Her object is learning. She ſhould behave exactly as we might rationally ſuppoſe a genteel lady would behave in ſuch a ſituation—except only in burleſque parts, and in them no lady ſhould treſpaſs upon decency.</p>
               <p>All the performers in dialogues ſhould appear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs each other, and to take no kind of notice of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unleſs the parts they are performing requires it —The performers ſhould move about on the ſtage as the action of the piece requires —neither ſhould they ſtand toe to toe like boxers, nor ſhould they move but with reaſon, and to heighten the effect of the piece.</p>
               <p>As much of geſture as can be applied with reaſon; as much motion on the ſtage, as is proper and natural, ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034600_0019_0FFF13C849AA9FE8"/>
be uſed. It makes the pieces lively, and is very intereſting to the audience—But more ſhould not by any means be admitted.</p>
               <p>It is foreign to the purpoſe of a ſchool to overload exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions with muſic and adventitious ornaments; they cover the faults of a bad exhibition but ſpoil a good one by drawing off the attention of the audience from the ſpeaking and manners of the ſtudents to other objects—the elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and polite behavior of the ſtudents are the grand points to be regarded —yet a few muſical pieces may be admmitted if properly applied.</p>
               <p>In their behavior the young ladies ſhould be guarded from mincing fidgetry and all ſilly coquettiſh airs; ſhould uſe no affected graces, nor ſhould they be allowed to uſe any familiarity with the young men, which might offend the niceſt taſte.</p>
               <p>The young gentlemen ſhould behave properly to the ladies, treat them reſpectfully and offer them no rude or even familiar behavior, ſo as in the leaſt to offend perſons of delicacy—A young gentleman acting a rational part ſhould always addreſs a lady ſtanding at her left hand, and bearing his weight on the foot next to her, to give himſelf the air of tenderneſs and reſpect—A young gentleman may kiſs the hand of a lady in token of reſpect; or he may ſupport her with her arm. But proper amorous kiſſing, embracing, are things which nature never meant to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in public.</p>
               <p>And tho the practice of modern theatres may be otherwiſe, it is a rule given by Horace in his "Art of Poetry," that no ſavage murders or peculiarly ſhocking barbarities be rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented on the ſtage—Every thing of that kind if ſuppoſed at all ſhould be imagined to be done at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>The dreſſes ſhould be ſuited to the character, but they need not be expenſive. A ſimple wreath of laurel may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note a conqueror, a diadem a monarch; his badge of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice any magiſtrate. We know ſo little of the dreſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and foreign nations, that any very ſimple device anſwers to convey the idea of office.</p>

               <head>SECTION VIII. OF REHEARSALS; AND HOW TO KNOW WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE FIT FOR EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HIBITION.</head>
               <p>EVERY thing which is abſurd in action or ſpeech ſtrikes any perſon inſtantaneouſly who has but a little knowledge of what is right; let your ſcholars in a great meaſure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect one another. As to entrances and exits, practiſe your ſcholars to go in turns and make their exit and entrance under the obſervance of the ſchool, till, on the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the looks of the ſchool teſtify approbation—For if there be the leaſt awkwardneſs, thoſe who are obſervers will perceive it, and it will affect them very ſtrongly—Tho they mean to be extremely kind to one another, they will not be able to ſuppreſs a laugh. But when all are come to the point that they perform paſſably, they will mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhow their approbation in their countenance—The like may be ſaid of geſture. When one part of the ſchool are ſpectators and the other part performers, thoſe geſtures which affect the ſpectators agreeably, are with very few exceptions good. Thoſe which affect them diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, bad—The principles of theſe affections are properly natural.</p>
               <p>IT is generally beſt, if your ſchool be large, to divide it, and not always have the whole ſchool together at rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. And eſpecially, if you, to ſave the time of your ſcholars and prevent the ſtudy of rhetoric from intruding on other ſtudies, have your rehearſals in the evening; it will be beſt to divide the ſchool, that the ſcholars may not be kept out too late in the evening and incur cenſure on that account.</p>
               <p>In your rehearſals, correct all falſe pronunciation firſt. Make them recite and pronounce the pieces well. Then add gradually the graces of motion, and corporal geſture. And when you find that while one party of your ſcholars is performing, the reſt who make a little audience are prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly affected—you have obtained your aim. If the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel ſcenes produce ſtrong expreſſions of approbation—if the ridiculous parts readily and promptly excite laughter— if the pathetic ones bring tears into the eyes of the audit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034600_0021_0FFF13CAB1A80558"/>
then your pieces are ripe for exhibition. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it longer would be to let the ardor of your ſcholars abate; and, conſequently, to loſe in ſome meaſure, the life of your exhibition.</p>
               <p>It is a great point both at rehearſals, and exhibitions, to keep up the courage of your ſcholars. Always correct them, unleſs they ſhow obſtinacy, in a mild tone of voice. Aſſure them that they will ſoon overcome all difficulties, and do very well—you muſt poſſeſs their confidence elſe you cannot inſpire them with courage—frequently talk with them about ſpeaking, and geſture, and ſhow that you mean never to hurt their feelings if you can poſſibly avoid it. Yet correct every inſtance punctually in which your ſcholars fail; and aſſure them, that it is neceſſary to give them a good appearance, and make them eminent ſpeakers, and in prompting both at rehearſals and exhibitions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeak very diſtinctly, but in a ſoft and encouraging tone of voice, that your ſcholars may not loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of feeling, by apprehenſion of your diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>If any of your ſcholars make an abſolute <hi>ſauxpas</hi> and get entirely out; by a <hi>preconcerted ſign,</hi> let them retire, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing about it —ſay not a word to them of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; but encourage them, and bring them on again in another place—by this device you may in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conceal the fault from the audience, or you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its being very ſenſibly felt.</p>
               <p>Yet the ſcholars ſhould underſtand that they have the utmoſt diſpleaſure of their preceptor to fear, if they wilfully do any thing that is improper at an exhibition. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be able to command the prompt obedience of his ſcholars, it will be abſolutely unjuſt that he ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the event.</p>

               <p>WHEN ſchool exhibitions are regulated by reaſon, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of extreme expenſe, and conducted with propriety they are of very great uſe— they awaken the ambition of ſtudents, and they become deſirous of behaving in a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner. We ſuppoſe in ſaying this, that the parts they
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034600_0022_0FFF140491BBB028"/>
have performed be ſuch as reaſon and religion do not diſapprove. That they are replete with good ſentiments, and promotive of good morals. It has often been obſerved, that where there have been in the ſame town, ſchools on the ſame footing in other reſpects, yet ſome have had exhibitions and others not, that the ſchools in which there have been exhibitions, have not only excelled in the point of exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions but in every other. The rudeſt nymphs or ſwains by practiſing on rhetoric will ſoon acquire polite manners, for they will often perſonate the moſt polite characters. And tho the ſurly majeſty of ſome male deſpots among us, may envy the graces of rhetoric to women, becauſe they find themſelves already outdone by women in every other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence; yet it is certain, that a clear, genteel manner of expreſſing themſelves, is a vaſt advantage to women, in forming that important alliance, which is to laſt for life.—And in the marriage ſtate the mother who has been taught to read and ſpeak with propriety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantage to her children in forming their elocution in early life.

Let ſchool exhibitions conſiſt of laudable materials, and be managed with prudence, they will be of great advantage to both ſexes, and form for all hearers an uſeful and inſtructive entertainment.</p>

            <head>Preface to the Dialogues.</head>
            <p>IN the following dialogues the author has aimed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplify the principal virtues and vices of human beings, ſome times a moral principle, is beſt repreſented affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively; the principle ſtated and the example given. An inſtance of this kind you have in <hi>Lucy,</hi> the principal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the firſt Dialogue—Here the principle is ſet forth, directly in an example of virtue—Sometimes the neceſſity of a virtue is ſhown, by the embarraſſments attending the oppoſite vice—As in the character of Fieldfare in the Foundling, or of Ameſa in Scanderbeg—This reſembles the <hi>Reductio ad abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdum</hi> ſo familiarly known in Logic and Mathematics—The Author thinks that neither of theſe procedures can be objected to on juſt principles, for we may practice virtue directly on its own principles, or may ſet ourſelves right by avoiding that which is wrong.</p>
            <p>It may poſſibly be objected, that ſome of the characters are too high charged and exceed any thing found in real life—The character of <hi>Nelly</hi> in the "Mother of a Family," and of <hi>Butterford</hi> in "The Maid of the groves," and of <hi>Puffpaſte</hi> in the 'Founding,' if any, will be tho't of this kind — But the author had his reaſons for this ſeeming exceſs. In the character of <hi>Nelly</hi> he would repreſent the prodigious diſadvantage, under which even a woman of a good mind may appear, totally deſtitute of proper education—In that of Butterford he would ſhow how extremely diſagreeable a man of fortune is, void of virtue and good breeding—In the character of Puffpaſte he would ſhow that an honeſt well meaning man, will, notwithſtanding the utmoſt diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, with reſpect to external appearances, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing entertaining and agreeable about him, and will in fact appear ſuperior to a man of the greateſt refinement of education who yet neglects virtue—Theſe characters are ſo exaggerated that young perſons, who are always want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in experience, may the better diſcern the intention of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:034600_0025_0FFF13CC96442260"/>It may be ſaid that ſome of the pieces cannot pretend to originality—That there is a reſemblance between "The Triumph of Temper" and Shakeſpear's "Taming of the Shrew;" between the "Father of a Family—and the "Pere de Famille" of Diederot. That the "Little Box" is partly taken from the "Ciſtellaria" and partly from the "Poenus" of Plautus—That the "Captive" ſavours ſtrongly of the "Capteivi of the laſt mentioned author. That the "Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan of China" has been better dramatized by Voltaire and Dr. Murphy. That the "Diſcontented" wife, is but the enlargement of the "UxorMempſigamos" of Eraſmus. The author will deny nothing of this; but ſay that he has given thoſe pieces a caſt better fitted for ſchools than their originals, and they are ſo far new that he believes that there is not a correſpondent page between his book and any other book now in print.</p>
            <p>Should the critics of the age make any remarks upon this; or any of the author's works, he means to profit by it—He will be ready if his work ſhould outlive the preſent edition to alter any ſentiments, word, or phraſe, that proves to be wrong, as his aim is to gain eſteem, if he gains it at all, by fair means—and he would do as much good as he is able in the ſhort ſpace of life allotted to man—Wiſhing, he confeſſes, for ſome degree of approbation for wellmean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WELL what do you think of our Lucy?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                     <p>She is very ſingular, ſhe acts preciſely, and by rule, yet with eaſe—It is the native goodneſs of her heart which guides her, ſhe wiſhes to do right, and that guides her to do it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                     <p>It is ſurpriſing to ſee how ſhe is liked by the young gentlemen. The moſt artful women, who ſometimes pleaſe the men, and ſometimes plague them, are nothing to her for gaining their eſteem.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                     <p>I ſuſpect one reaſon why many women are not pleaſing to men is becauſe all their conduct favors of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and indicates want of good principles—I do not think that men in general are very fond of coquetry in women.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                     <p>Then women are generally miſtaken. And their education is often conducted wrong. Many are brought up to act the coquette from their cradles. Miſs Lizard ſays that to hold a lover long, you muſt hold him <hi>uneaſy.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                     <p>Either her ſyſtem is not good, or ſhe does not uſe it, for ſhe has had ſix new ſuitors in ſix months, and the laſt is ſaid to have left her much againſt her will. But my couſin Fidelia ſays the beſt way to keep a lover is to make him <hi>contented</hi> with his choice, and to <hi>improve</hi> one's ſelf <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi> ſo that the laſt interview ſhall always be the moſt agreeable.</p>

                     <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                     <p>I do not think that againſt her; for ſhe has always kept him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Well this is a pretty affair indeed that ſuch girls as Fidelia and Lucy, who can boaſt of nothing but beauty, good ſenſe, education, and virtue, ſhould gain the confidence of the fineſt gentlemen; and be married juſt when they pleaſe.

                     <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                     <p>We muſt bear it, for the preſent, with patience; and eſtabliſh ſome principles which will cauſe our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to place confidence in us.</p>

                     <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
                     <p>As much as I hate reading, I would ſtudy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyce, Addiſon, and all the moral writers, a twelve month, to get ſuch a name as Lucy has.

There are in the human conſtitution remarkable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable attachments and averſions—The convictions of the mind will not always bear ſway, much leſs take advice from others—What would you do if any perſon ſhould put a cat under your table or under your pillow—What would you ſay?</p>

                     <p>He was in a perfect rage, when he found ſhe talked of ſtaying, he ſwore ſhe ſhould return that minute—he took your horſe with your wife's new hunting ſaddle, put them into the ſtable, and locked them up.</p>

                     <speaker>Rob.</speaker>
                     <p>He took an old horſe out of the plough, whoſe back was ſharp as a pike; and you might have counted his ribs at twenty rods diſtance—then mounted your wife on an old pannel that ſhed feathers—with a girt of red tape and the bridle of twenty pieces of ſheep's leather—the crupper, of the ſtraps of an old knapſack thus he ſet her out on her journey. And the old horſe could not be got out of a ſtep all the way.</p>

                     <p>The dogs barked, the boys halloed, and the feathers flew all the way, and when the old horſe got againſt the great tavern in the middle of the village, the horſe ſtopped, and the mob gathered round, and huzza'd, and it was ſometime before we got him ſtarted again.</p>

                     <p>When we came down the hill by the brook, the old brute ſtumbled, and threw your wife off—and it was a long time before we could pick her up, and tie up her ſtrings again.</p>

I wonder you do not die outright with vexation—You work extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard, and have to pay the ſevereſt attention from night to day, and from day to night—Your children are the moſt diſorderly crew that ever were hatched, when they are out of humor they are always a bawling—There will be half a dozen of them tuning up at once—They are ever fighting and clawing one another—When they are in good humor they play with execeſſive noiſe and violence as if the houſe were going out at the windows—Then they are upſetting every thing thro the whole houſe—They are ever breaking their own ſhins or one anothers noſes—They are ever loſing their hats and their ſhoes—One falls down ſtairs and is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up half dead—One is burnt and another is ſcalded— Another cuts his leg, or his hand, and is bleeding to death. Then you are all in tears—and—</p>

                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>And can you think of nothing farther? You have not told me half of the truth yet. I have ſeen and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ten times as much as you have any idea of; and yet I am not unhappy—I have a very kind huſband.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Keen.</speaker>
                     <p>O, yes, I ſuppoſe that kind huſband makes up for all—He pretends to be fond of you, and flatters you—He is cunning enough for himſelf. You place entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him. Were he to tell you that a bedlam was a palace, you would believe him. After your children had worried you all day, on ſeeing your huſband come home at night I have ſeen you ſhed tears of joy—and you had to wait on him two hours. I really felt aſhamed for you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Good.</speaker>
                     <p>What a ſimplicity you are ſiſter, with all your boaſted ſenſe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Keen</speaker>
                     <p>Simplicity I will be then—your huſband by being ſo obſtinate has brought a lawſuit upon himſelf, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people ſay will ruin him. I expect in a few days to ſee you turned out of houſe and home. I ſee plainly that all this is in conſequence of your marriage, and if any man ever ſees me catched in that trap he ſhall bleſs his eyes for the ſight.

Now girls let me give you one piece of advice. Above all do you avoid being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. It is the worſt of all evils. You ſee what a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation your mother is in. Her eldeſt ſon is going to be expelled from the college—There is one child dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the apoplexy. Another has broke his arm, one girl ſo awkward and ſo vicious that ſhe plagues her heart out. Her huſband abſent, and muſt loſe his eſtate before he comes back. Now young ladies fix the matter in your own minds that you never will be married. Then let the men coax and teaze, and plead, and flatter, and careſs you ever ſo much, be ſteady, let them know you won't, and that's enough.</p>

How many ſweet maidens, the hope of proſperous families, are ſold into ſlavery—how many widows mourn the loſs of their huſbands, cut off, in the very bloom of life. The blood of the fineſt youth fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the fields of Arcadia. As for me, wretched I am, and wretched I muſt be. Since I became ſenſible of the loſs of liberty—every thing looks dark about me. Earth is a dungeon, and the ſky frowns on me from above—bo't and ſold like a beaſt— O wretched, bitter ſlavery—Is there no remedy but death—the generous Philander only makes me wiſh to live. But now I loſe him—O welcome, moſt welcome would be the ſleep of death, to a poor captive who has loſt her liberty—loſt her fortune, loſt her poor broken heart and is weary of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—

Why all theſe hints at Alonzo? Have I a tenderneſs for him? Let me examine my own heart. It never yet deceived me. I admire his virtues. So does every one beſide. Is the whole nation in love? I think his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is elegant. So do all others. I rejoice in his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. They are uſeful to the public. His attentions pleaſe me. So they pleaſe my aunt, old, and grave as ſhe is. His abſence makes me uneaſy—Is this owing to tenderneſs? No—He is valuable to the nation: and it is a pity that ſo fine a youth ſhould be loſt. So, Maria, this heart is ſound yet, and I am glad of that.

                     <p>I have often wondered that a man of your genius ſhould not wiſh to marry. You Bachelors form wild ideas of domeſtic life.</p>

                     <p>It gives juſt as much ſenſe of confinement as the ſoul has in being confined to the body—or as a man has in having an eſtate of <hi>his own,</hi> or living in a houſe, or on a farm, of his own.</p>

price, at a tavern? If you had no houſe, but muſt hire a wretched lodging in a garret—If you had no money but what you borrowed or ſtole, kept no table, but dined where you could, or went without a dinner.</p>

                     <p>Yes, ſuch is exactly the freedom which a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys who refuſes marriage, except that it is neither ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, nor ſo reputable.</p>

                     <p>Much leſs does the acquiſition of valuable friends. All that liberty is worth is that we may gain ſuch poſſeſſions, and ſerve them; but the evil of want of principle, is great. It hurts many perſons who ought to be happy.</p>

                     <p>I think it beſt for you to be married at a proper time. That kind of life has its thorns and its cares—but it is better than lonely, diſmal celibacy—And if you do marry a ſenſible man, a man of good ſound judgment, all other virtues will follow. You do right not to marry, as you are under age, till your father returns. It will be a particular pleaſure to him to have the diſpoſal of you himſelf.</p>

            <p>IT is a very good inſtance of policy in a woman, if ſhe has engaged the affections of any man, with a view to marriage, to avoid the ſmalleſt danger of loſing them. A woman deſerted by a man once engaged to her, is ſubject to many cenſures, and dangerous ſuſpicions. Were it not univerſally known, that there are women, who uſe men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ill, in conſequence of gaining their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the deſertion of a woman, after indications of love, would ruin a man's character. Coquettes injure not themſelves only—but their ſex in general.</p>

                     <p>I chooſe to ſay but little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Long diſcourſes are not apt to be remembered—Let the foundation of your character be plain honeſty and good nature. Depend principally on your virtue for your happineſs—As you both are ſufficiently genteel, affect no uncommon character, but be what nature and common ſenſe have made you. If you have a good offer, I adviſe you to marry; but not ſuddenly—let a polite acquaintance with the perſon whom you are to marry, remain for ſome time, that you may acquire the habit of pleaſing, &amp; being pleaſed with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is to be yours for life. Never trifle with a man who ſeriouſly addreſſes you; but by all means marry a man of ſenſe, and think of no earthly things ſo much as pleaſing him, ſo long as you live.</p>

                  <p>MY dear Lucinda, what a happy girl you are, your company is deſired by all people old and young— and every perſon ſpeaks of you with pleaſure.</p>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſorry for that, the view of too many will be directed to me—It would coſt me much trouble—I ever tho't it an unhappineſs to be too much the object of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lem.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, how can any perſon be loved and admired too much? I ſhould like to be admired by every body.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Your ambition then muſt deſcend very low ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>

                  <speaker>Lem.</speaker>
                  <p>I did not mean exactly ſo neither. But there is a certain claſs whom I ſhould wiſh to be in raptures with me, whenever they ſaw me—I ſhould not care much about old people.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>There you differ from me — The ſentiments of people who are not of our own age may be of great uſe to us. They can give us credit and a good name—But I doubt whether it is right to ſeek the particular admiration of many perſons of our own age at once.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lem.</speaker>
                  <p>You, it ſeems, are very ſcrupulous.</p>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>Were the perſons, from whom attention to young ladies might be expected, diſtributed among us all, there would ſcarcely be one apiece—Were it then poſſible, I ſhould ſuppoſe it unjuſt, to engroſs a number. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoy the beneficial ſociety of one true friend, than be the dupe of twenty flatterers — To flatter a lady that is really deſerving, is very much like painting a diamond to make it ſhine.</p>

                  <speaker>Lem.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not very fond of flattery; but it may do
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:034600_0226_0FFF3442B1CBAE40"/>
when one can get nothing elſe. It is more pleaſing to hear good ſenſe, or what we call good ſenſe; but I had rather men would flatter me than ſay nothing.</p>

                  <speaker>Luc.</speaker>
                  <p>The whole buſineſs is commonly artificial. A man uſes flattery as muſicians do the fa, ſol, la, me, of their gamut, to put their voices into tune. When one knows the artifice, it ſoon becomes tireſome. But tell me, my friend, if you be ſo fond of admiration, by what means you have attempted to ſecure it.</p>

                  <p>I have in various ways tried to accompliſh my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

                     <p>I will give you fifteen hundred, rather than hurt my daughter, in the feelings of her heart—I have a great averſion to croſſing children in their love— I am confident that Maria will prove a very kind and induſtrious wife— and with her I will give you fifteen hundred pounds; which is as much as I can give.</p>

                     <p>No ſir, I thank you.

Marriage obliges, and almoſt neceſſitates, a man and his wife, to be of a mind, in things of great conſequence—Their quarrels ariſe from ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles: a mere momentary humor, or accidental word, and counter paſſions, have more influence in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling them, than their reaſon.

                     <p>I am in deep ſpeculation on a very important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—I wiſh, like thouſands of my fellows in this world, to get money without earning it. But hitherto, I can hit on no expedient for the purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>Sir, I wonder at that very much—I have tho't you had better ſet up for a conjuror.</p>

                     <p>He would know it above the heavens. Aſſoon as he taſtes the Elixir Planetarium he becomes acquainted with the whole circuit of the ſtars—with all ther aſpects and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the earth—and I have often heard him ſay that if a woman truſt her reputation, to the mere word of a man —eight times out of twelve ſhe will repent her confidence.</p>

                     <p>Yes, I think for the future I ſhall be firmly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the intereſt of the farmers; they raiſe the grain; there is proviſion made for bread, pudding and pye-cruſt; they raiſe the graſs and from graſs comes milk, of which we make ſyllabubs, whipt creams, and cuſtards—beef alſo is the produce of the farm—I determine from this time to attach myſelf to the intereſt of the farmers. And why cannot I do ſome thing for the public?—the public ſay I'm lazy. But I can carry news from place to place, and tell all the ſtories of the day; and when the candidates kiſs the freeholders wives with pieces of gold in their mouths I can make as good a ſtory of it as any man. But my little box, my precious treaſure. What future feaſts am I to derive from this little box.

Here's a commiſſion for Capt. Bowling. You muſt not open the papers till you are on board the frigate—and when the meſſenger comes, walk in the utmoſt ſilence and order to the quay.

                     <p>I am, at preſent, peſuaded that it is money.— Whatever is the object of purchaſe, may be procured by money—Money has an amazing influence in deciding the opinions of men.

Money wins the favor of the great; favor which cannot be purchaſed by merit. How eaſily will a rich man, by means of the favors which he confers on the poor, gain admittance to places of profit, and truſt. The poor man's wiſdom, (be he ever ſo wiſe,) is deſpiſed. But the man who has money has credit for every human faculty—He has wit, at leaſt in eſtimation. His pooreſt obſervations are recommended, his flatteſt jeſts are laughed at, and applauded. The ladies love him, and their hearts own the ſovereign power of gold. Lawyers for gold pervert law—Prieſts for gold have perverted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion—In fine, What will not money do?

And what is the object of all learning: and of the curious arts but for the pleaſure either of body, or mind, that they procure? The reputable matron, or honeſt houſeholder, take pleaſure in a beautiful and well ordered family, and in ſincere, and delicious friendſhip, of which virtue alone is capable: from a miſtaken idea of pleaſure alſo, ſome youth of both ſexes plunge themſelves into the moſt infamous exceſſes, and by their miſeries they diſcover how propenſe the human heart is to pleaſure, that it will riſk any thing for the proſpect of it—In fine all happineſs is pleaſure in one ſenſe or another; as the purſuit of all mankind is happineſs, I determine that pleaſure is that which has the greateſt influence in all affairs of men.</p>

It diſpoſeth of perſons and property, of the lives and virtues of citizens, which way ſoever the ſovereign power ſhall turn itſelf; all muſt bend before it—In a ſtate when the ſovereignty is in the people, as it is in our commonwealth, the voice of the people carries every thing: you may as well put a ſtop to the ſwelling of the ocean, as reſiſt the popular will—Hence it is ſaid that the voice of the people is the voice of God, becauſe it comes with irreſiſtible power: in monarchies tho the ſovreignty is ſuppoſed to have been tranferred from the people, to the monarch, and he on account of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power he poſſeſſes is feared, and honored as the vice-general of God—The ſupreme law is the ſafety of the ſtate: this reſpects the whole, and not any particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the commonwealth—Therefore I ſay, the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, has the greateſt influence on the affairs of men.</p>

found—as to matters merely belonging to this world I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm in oppoſition to the opinions already advanced—that women have more influence that money, pleaſure, or the civil power—they compel us to love them, and we cannot help it. We love more than pleaſure would dictate, we behold them with lively admiration, with the moſt intenſe reſpect, we conſider our happineſs as involved in theirs. Have you never heard of the Jewiſh tradition, that man, when firſt formed was placed in a garden beautiful as Elyſian fields; yet would not be content without the ſociety of a woman? Have you not alſo read in the tradition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Greece—that Jupiter being offended with the man, and his wife, for ſtealing golden apples from the Heſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gardens, ſeparated them from each other and placed his eagle between them, with a thunder bolt in his talons —The woman being afraid, fled and hid herſelf in the groves of Arcadia—the man watched the eagle for fifteen ſucceſſive days and nights, till the eagle fell aſleep, thro long watching, and dropped the thunderbolt from his tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—then flew the man to the groves and ſpoke to his wife in the language of love—Jupiter then declared that he would ſuffer their ſociety, ſince there was no way to prevent it; but to ſtrike them out of being.</p>
                     <p>Without ſaying any thing of the actual truth of theſe tranſactions, they prove that the connection of the ſexes on the principles of virtue is natural and inviolable, and that this has ever been the tho't of men—whatever a man gains by ſtudy or labor, the ſpoils of war, and the profits of peace—the reward of genius, and ways of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry—are bro't by him, and freely beſtowed on his wife.

Power founded on falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and perfidy, tumbles violently into ruin—and even women if they forſake the ways of virtue, and act not agreeably to truth and reaſon—ſoon ſink into contempt— truth prevents all wrong, and ſits every thing right—truth therefore is greater and more influential than all things elſe, and the prudent man will always ſubmit to truth.</p>

                  <p>Well now, young gentlemen my worthy pupils, this is my reſult on our queſtion, Xenophon judged righteſt. Of all things external to men's ſelves in this world women have the greateſt influence over men's affairs. Men will give their money freely to their wives, they will ſacrifice all other pleaſures to the happineſs of living with them.

                  <p>By a fair compariſon of facts—You know that women have been abuſed in various parts of the globe. The Chriſtians ſay this was predicted from the time that Eve ſtole the forbidden apples of paradiſe. Except in Greece, which has always been the ſeat of learning and politeneſs; women have been ſubjected to the arbitrary diſpoſal of the men. And even among them they are by no means ſo free, as among the Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>I have done much—and muſt ſtill do more. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Labienus the old Prefect to conduct the thundering legion, who are all Chriſtians, into the avenues, between mount Aventine, and the field of Mars—and to prevent a communication, between different bodies, of the Pagan troops.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ZENOBIA</hi> was Queen of <hi>Palmyra</hi> — a woman of high ſpirit, bordering on pride. She was a perſon of moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime morals, and fond of her huſband to enthuſiaſm—yet ever declared her attachment was ſolely founded on his virtues. She was remarkable for her maternal affection, and ſenſe of gratitude. Her huſband, periſhing in the wars, left her kingdom in a very flouriſhing condition, which ſhe greatly ſtrengthened by an alliance with the Arabians and Perſians. Becoming wealthy and proſperous, ſhe declared herſelf Queen of the Eaſt, and defied the Roman power. The Emperor, after various efforts to gain her to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Rome, ſubdued her in war; led her in triumph in golden chains, and allowed her to reſide a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> one of his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las at <hi>Tibur</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> where ſoon ſhe died of grief and mortification. By the general teſtimony of hiſtorians, AURELIAN had no other cauſe for making war againſt her, but her proſperity and grandeur; and by his conduct to her he brought an indelible ſtain on his memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LONGINUS,</hi> her prime miniſter, was a perſon no leſs remarkable. Acquainted with ſcience in general—Verſed in all the eminent Pagan and Chriſtian writers—An admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Moſes and St. Paul. He wrote the famous treatiſe on the Sublime, which has ever ſince his day been the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of criticiſm, of which POPE gives the following char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter—
<q>
                  <l>Thee, bold Longinus, all the Nine inſpire;</l>
                  <l>And fill the critic with a poet's fire.</l>
                  <l>An ardent judge, who zealous in his truſt,</l>
                  <l>With warmth gives ſentence, yet is alway juſt.</l>
                  <l>His own example ſtrengthens all his laws;</l>

            <head>Preface TO THE SINGLE PIECES.</head>
            <p>THE Editor of this work, having always found it to be one of the moſt difficult things attending an exhibition, to obtain ſuitable occaſional pieces; whether for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, intermediate ſpeech, or concluſion; thought it beſt to inſert in his book a number of theſe kinds—Indeed he publiſhes all that he can collect, at preſent, of thoſe which he has uſed.</p>
            <p>It is as much impoſſible to avoid a ſameneſs in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory and concluding pieces, as in ordination or elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſermons, or commencement orations—the intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates are not liable to this inconvenience. They may be varied without end—but only one or two of the prologues, or epilogues are uſed in a year, the ſameneſs may only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as they ſtand in the book, and not in the public uſe of them.</p>
            <p>He has alſo tho't proper to publiſh the names of the ſtudents to whom ſingle pieces have been aſſigned, becauſe it would be doing them honor, as none can perform them but ſuch as are, in many reſpects, good ſcholars—and none but thoſe of unblemiſhed moral character can have them. The inſertion of their names does homage to their genius, improvements, and virtue; and may give them a degree of celebrity, which one day or another may be of uſe to them. It may alſo excite ambition of ſucceeding ſtudents, whoſe performances <hi>may</hi> be publiſhed in a ſecond volume.</p>
            <p>There will be a ſeeming inequality among the pieces here given—but both ſingle and dramatic compoſitions appear differently, publicly performed, from what they do when read in ſilence—If any do not ſtrike the reader much in private, let him conſider, that public repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the only teſt of their merit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="480" facs="unknown:034600_0469_0FFF36039A8B2698"/>The Editor has taken great gains, and even gained the aſſiſtance of ladies of learning and approved character, to clear his pieces of all offenſive words and paſſages—yet if one word or paſſage of this kind ſhall remain after all, he diſavows it—and deſires every one who ſhall make uſe of his book; to render delicate any paſſage that offends, as in ſo doing he will fulfil the intention of the publiſher.</p>

               <p>IF we do not addreſs you at this time, with extreme timidity, if we do not diſcover that anxiety, which your reſpectability appears ſufficient to inſpire—it is not from any want of reſpect to you. But it is owing to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberality and candor with which you have favored our performances in time paſt, we have hearts full of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards you, ſuch as become the moſt favored children—but we do not fear, that on any trifling fault you will manifeſt the expreſſions of anger or contempt. Yet your ſentiments are by no means indifferent to us—It is one of the greateſt pleaſures of our life to merit your approbation. Our youthful hearts are elate with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that by means of your kind parental care, (Heaven forbid that we ever ſhould abuſe it,) we ſhall ſo conduct ourſelves, as to increaſe your happineſs—that we not only have your approbation in theſe exerciſes, but that you may highly enjoy our behavior in all the ſcenes of life.</p>
               <p>Life indeed is ſweet, and it is pleaſant to the eyes to behold the ſun, and ſurvey the various beauties of nature— hence we freely own that the debt, due to a parent, for mere exiſtence, and early nutrition, is more than any child can pay—But, how immenſe is the obligation to parents

—who take all imaginable pains to make their children happy—who afford them the moſt rational pleaſures; and the moſt ſublime enjoyments of life—Compare my worthy ſeniors, and moſt reſpected ladies, the girl who is the mere child of ſimplicity—of unformed ſentiments and manners, with one who has been favored with a good ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation—compare ſuch an one with thoſe, who lately, in this place, diſplayed a variety of brilliant performances— Who completely ſuſtained the moſt amiable and polite characters—who faſtened your attention, and left you no power to recall it, and gave you the <hi>graces</hi> and the <hi>morals</hi> united in the moſt charming alliance—make the compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſon—then let any one, if he can, deny the advantages of education.</p>
               <p>At preſent indulge us, worthy parents, to ſpeak to thoſe who are delightful to us—This evening we are deprived of your moſt pleaſing company and aſſiſtance in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, yet ſtill you are near to our hearts and live in them—your preſence excites our lively ambition—we ſhall read the expreſſion of your countenances and the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of your eyes with modeſt fear of being unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and with lively joy, if we diſcern your approbation.</p>
               <p>Happy are they, and the happieſt of human kind—who unite the love of virtue and goodneſs with their mutual affections; and form a laſting alliance—to know this we need only conſider the reſpectable lives of the matron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now parents, brethren, ſiſters and friends, favor us with your uſual candor, politeneſs and attention—and we will not only endeavor to eſcape your cenſure, but we ſhall (for our ambition is great) even hope to gain your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>

               <p>PERMIT me, with that modeſty which becomes a youth, to ſtate the plan of our preſent Exhibition—We do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert to excell, in the art of ſpeaking, thoſe who have made it their buſineſs and profeſſion—Nor is the mere entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the audience, our principal object. Thoſe perſons miſtake us extremely who think we mean to be imitators of a theatre—Indeed we ſpeak &amp; have dramatic pieces; ſo they have on the theatre. On the theatre alſo men walk &amp; breathe. But is it a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

ſchool ſhould always be inſtruction. All our performances are intended to illuſtrate certain important principles of morality; and to ſhow what virtue is my means of living examples—While we are doing this, we hope to make ſome progreſs in the art of ſpeaking—Of this we readily allow there is great neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Did you here behold a ſet of actors who profeſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the public, you might have both right and cauſe for criticiſm; but here you have a ſet of modeſt timid ſcholars who have paſſed but little time in the purſuits of learning—Yet they are willing to perform as well as they can; that their friends may be able to diſcern whether they have, or have not, improved their means and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>Bearing this in mind, you will make great allowance for the extreme youth and inexperience of the ſtudents. Our pieces at this time, are not the moſt diverting; but ſuch as beſt illuſtrate the moral ſentiments which we would impreſs upon the young mind, and which may give a proper direction to the movements of the youthful heart.</p>
               <p>We are encouraged in our arduous enterprize by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the characters of which this audience is compoſed. Thoſe reſpectable ladies whom we call by the endeared name of mother, will have no diſpoſition to damp our ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, or fully our performances: kindneſs is the ruling paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of your hearts, and the ſame tender affection will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend us here; which bore with the patience of the ſaints, the cares which attended our infancy &amp; the petulance and follies of our childhood—You will now look with charity on the imperfect performances of our youth, you will be exceedingly pleaſed if we do well; and this encourages the attempt— Not that we can recompenſe you for your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—That muſt he left to Him, whoſe goodneſs is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without bounds.</p>
               <p>Deign, venerable fathers, to ſoften for a moment the gravity of age; and unbend the awful brow of parental authority, that you ſmile on the children of your care—If you ſet the example to all the people of this aſſembly of keeping us in ſpirit and encouraging our endeavors, we hope to perform ſomething that will pleaſe you.</p>

               <p>NO perſon can reaſonably wonder that we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated by your preſence. If you find us fearful and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted in coming before perſons of ſo auguſt an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we truſt you will not blame us—We are as you ſee, many of us young ſcholars, young indeed to pretend to give an exhibition to ſuch an aſſembly—You will find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in our performances which will need excuſe, ſome perhaps which you can only pardon; and yet we hope you will find ſome that will pleaſe you.</p>
               <p>We doubt not, venerable fathers, of your affection—You naturally wiſh to find us doing right—The care which you have ſhewn that your children be educated in a manner becoming to themſelves and uſeful to ſociety, is a pledge of your kind regards to us this moment.</p>
               <p>There is a pleaſure in this idea, that we have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to recommend ourſelves to you; and this pleaſure in good degree takes away the ſenſe of fear. How happy ſhall we be, to hear you ſay hereafter, that your children are leſs a burden than a pleaſure to you; and that you have been the happier, by ſuch bleſſings—as many would willingly refuſe.</p>
               <p>And ſurely we muſt not forget thoſe who are as much intereſted in our being, and happineſs, as you—You, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and amiable ladies, are extremely dear to us—and you command the ſublime reſpect of all who are knowing to your virtues—We have a great reſource for courage—We are aſſured that you will not blame any thing which you can excuſe—the maternal heart will never change—We ſhall find you benevolent, ready to extenuate our failures, and to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify our merits—We hope for the happineſs of being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you.</p>
               <p>You will not oblige us to forget thoſe who are the pride and ornament of your reſpectable families and of this ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of learning—Such as <hi>you</hi> ever have been and ever

will be the delight of human kind. Never ſhall your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be paſſed over in ſilence. Never ſhall your ſmiles or tokens of complacency be deſpiſed, till time ſhall be no more—Beauty united with virtue ſuch as you poſſeſs; and are determined you always will poſſeſs; will have its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till the univerſe ſhall die—Order muſt ceaſe in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and all ſenſe of excellence be loſt, among intelligent beings; before the beauty, and virtues of ſuch as you, ſhall ceaſe to he admired; or any of your brilliant and uſeful qualities be forgotten. I am ſenſible I ſpeak with ardor— Yet ardor becomes a youth in addreſſing himſelf to you. It is even more decent than the cold correctneſs of a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher—but not the moſt correct or coldeſt philoſopher can blame our lively emotions in addreſſing ourſelves to you. To objects, to perſons, ſo worthy of the moſt intereſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards of human kind.</p>
               <p>My fellow ſtudents, we are young, unpractiſed ſcholars —but let us have courage. Theſe perſons come to ſee us with the moſt benevolent deſigns—They wiſh to ſee us perform well—They will I truſt do nothing which ſhall prevent it—They will regard us with the moſt friendly countenances—And let us beſeech you—our friends of the aſſembly; that if you ſhall hear any thing which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall diſpleaſe you; that you would repreſs, for the moment, all viſible tokens of diſlike—and till you have ſeen the whole of the exerciſes, occaſional tokens of contempt ſhown in an audience, damp the firmeſt performer; and put out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance all who come after him; your candor and polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will induce you to refrain. Then, with all our hearts, we will uſe our utmoſt endeavor to pleaſe you.</p>

               <p>IT is not unknown to you, how much wit has been ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on the ſubject of the loquacity of women—and how
<pb n="499" facs="unknown:034600_0488_0FFF36510534BF98"/>
much ſatire expended in ridiculing ladies who have a taſte for learning—but if an eminent faculty of ſpeech be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by women, for once let it be employed to a good purpoſe—let us plead the cauſe of a ſex, who by nature are too feeble to employ force; and by principle too vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to uſe fraud, to accompliſh their deſigns. My apology is for thoſe young ladies, who wiſh to excel in endowments of the mind—will it be thought a crime, or a breach of modeſty to enquire; why ſuch an attempt ſhould be liable to cenſure—eſpecially as it cannot ariſe from mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice to any perſon whatever—if we be expoſed to at leaſt an equal ſhare of the miſeries of life, ought we to be ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated from its moſt ſublime, and moſt conſtant delights? Does not the condition of a lady require, as much as any, the delightful amuſement of elegant eſſays, of poetry and muſic? Has ſhe no need of that firmneſs of mind which philoſophy inſpires? Would not the ſublime conſolations of religion greatly increaſe her happineſs? But theſe are enjoyed in their full force only by an enlightened mind —In a rural retirement, a ſolitary dwelling, and ſilence all around her, her moſt agreeable friends being abroad on buſineſs, to have theſe ideas crowd upon the mind, with which ſhe has been inſpired by the fine arts, by philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and religion, muſt aſſuredly be a great conſolation.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, that it will make all our women diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and idle—how does this apear? Do men who have wives well educated in point of learning proſper in their affairs leſs than others—aſk thoſe gentlemen of this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly whoſe wives have been the beſt educated, whether they find them to be leſs attentive to domeſtic concerns, or worſe economiſts than the others—May not more women be truſted with knowledge, as well as theſe. Or is there any fear that women ſhall gain too much influence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miſtreſſeſs of the world in ſpite of man? When we ſhall quit our domeſtic employments, put on offenſive armor, and become fond of the art of war, then ſuch an event may be feared; and not till then—Power derived from force is denied to women by the God of Nature.</p>
               <p>The graces, the virtues, the art of pleaſing, are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ways by which women can influence the minds and actions of men—the fear of thoſe who hold learning to be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to ladies amounts to this—that they are afraid that they ſhall be too much attracted; that their reaſon
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:034600_0489_0FFF367BCBB25E98"/>
will force them to approve of the conduct of the ladies, and that they ſhall be attached to the ladies, even againſt their own inclination. If the ladies then wiſh to indulge a ſtroke of policy let it be this: to gain the approbation of thoſe who cenſure us; &amp; to make even ſatiriſts confeſs, that we act with propriety—this is perfectly conſiſtent with our principles—and there is nothing more conducive to this purpoſe than the information, which the arts afford—we may ſafely acquire as much knowledge, as our ſituation in life will admit, oppoſing to the geniuſes of the age, who ridicule the ſtudies of women, the ſentiment of Cicero;
<q>While other purſuits ſuit not to all ages, and ſtations; that of learning agrees to all. It ſtrengthens the minds of youth, and gives joy in old age—It adorns proſperity, and comforts us in affliction—at home it is delightful, and it is a help to buſineſs abroad—it attends us in our travels, and is the joy of our rural retirements—and tho we ourſelves were incapable of the arts, we ſhould ſtill admire them, and be captivated with their charms, when we beheld them in others.</q>

               <l>WHAT! then, I ſee your eyes are turned on me—</l>
               <l>And you may wonder well, at what you ſee.</l>
               <l>What means this little fairy—Has ſhe to do</l>
               <l>A dialogue, or make a ſpeech that's new?</l>
               <l>Fine times indeed when ſuch are bro't to view.</l>
               <l>I come indeed to ſpeak; but what to ſay,</l>
               <l>Aye there's the taſk—Suppoſe I talk away</l>
               <l>Of marriage, huſbands, wives, the virtuous joy</l>
               <l>Of hopeful families, which their minds employ—</l>
               <l>Indeed dear Sirs—'tis all beyond my line—</l>
               <l>But if I talk it anſwers my deſign.</l>
               <l>Suppoſe I act the cautious maid; I'll ſay</l>
               <l>The men are dangerous—better keep away</l>
               <l>From ſuch aſſociates—you may harm receive</l>

               <l>On this by rote I any thing can ſay;</l>
               <l>And can believe it too—as much as they—</l>
               <l>Indeed I am a prudent miſtreſs quite,</l>
               <l>For if I think on't, I'll do what is right.</l>
               <l>Be prudent grand ma'am ſays, ſhould be my ſong,</l>
               <l>And if I think on't I ſhall not do wrong.</l>

               <l>'Tis always good to keep one's thoughts about one.</l>

               </l>

               <l>Can turn my noſe up, if a ſwain goes by,</l>
               <l>Yet when he's paſt can caſt an anxious eye.</l>
               <l>Or be a lady quite in love; and then</l>
               <l>Nothing's ſo dear as that ſweet gentleman—</l>
               <l>O happy me! my fortune could I try,</l>
               <l>With ſuch a lovely ſwain to live, and die—</l>
               <l>Ah me, I feel the force of Cupid's dart—</l>
               <l>The charming ſhepherd! O! I've loſt my heart.</l>
               <l>My Papa frowns—What loſt your heart, my dear?</l>
               <l>O no, dear ſir, here 'tis, I feel it here.</l>
               <l>Now for a change, like lady Smart I'll be—</l>
               <l>There's not a ſwain that's good enough for me.</l>
               <l>I'll dance, dreſs fine, and all muſt pleaſe me ſtill,</l>
               <l>In every thing I mean to have my will;</l>
               <l>And if I wed I'll manage to perfection—</l>
               <l>Beſure I'll keep my huſband in ſubjection.</l>
               <l>But to be married, that's an arduous thing,</l>

               <byline>By MR. CHARLES WHEELER.</byline>
               <p>IT becomes my duty now to preſent myſelf before you; and perhaps I cannot do it better than to ſhow the merits of learning—This ſubject has been variouſly treated by others; but I propoſe to myſelf a track, new and untrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before. My deſign is not to prove that learning is a benefit, but that it is neceſſary—I ſhall not pretend to ſhow that we can do very well with it; but we cannot do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it—whatever a man learns is a part of learning—And I leave you to judge whether a man can render himſelf conſpicuous or uſeful without learning any <hi>thing</hi>—For he who learns one thing, to ſay that what another learns is uſeleſs—is judging out of his line, and is, probaby, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong.</p>
               <p>There are two means by which men become conſpicuous in the world: one is by gifts of nature, and the other by ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able education—mere natural qualities without education, have indeed an intrinſic value, but like a diamond, rude from the mine, are rough and unpleaſing, while education without natural powers, is weak and ineffectual—but when to good natural qualities there ſucceeds a good and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er education, that preſents human nature in its brighteſt glory.</p>
               <p>Alas, what is man, diveſted of the ſciences and all thoſe arts for which learning is neceſſary—a ſtupid ſtaring, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth animal, centred in himſelf and ſelfiſh gratifications. Say that he can neither write, nor read, that he knows nothing of numbers, and that he cannot ſpeak without offending the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er—diveſt him alſo of the mechanic arts; for they originate in philoſophy, and ſkill in huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, for that alſo is a branch of learning—what is he? a mere ſavage, a kind of brute, a little handſomer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, than his brother bears in the woods—but as much
<pb n="503" facs="unknown:034600_0492_0FFF116CB4395AB0"/>
without morals, as much a prey to his paſſions; what would diſtinguiſh him chiefly from them, is, that he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of improvement.</p>
               <p>Surely then, the conſequence is obtained by clear reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ought to be improved; and the benefit of making progreſs is as eaſily diſcernible—if one degree of knowledge (ſuppoſing a man's heart innocent) makes him better, another makes him better ſtill; and ſo on to infin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon, that we are ſo unfeeling to each others rights, and ſo often injure each other in ſociety—it is becauſe we are deficient in two points of learning—1ſt we have never learned to govern ourſelves—next becauſe we have never been taught to reſpect one another. There is not a ſingle virtue, but muſt firſt be known before it can be practiſed—nor a ſingle vice which we ſhall avoid unleſs we know how it is done.</p>
               <p>It is a very great error in any perſon to ſuppoſe, that the gratifications of mere corporeal ſenſes are ſuperior to the pleaſures of the mind and imagination—that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſublime delights of intenſe friendſhip, of ſincere and virtuous love, the noble flights of the imagination, the pleaſure of uſeful knowledge, and the heartfelt whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of an approving conſcience—yet this error, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to men in a rude uncultivated ſtate, the groſs indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of appetite, and the unbounded rage of their paſſions, being almoſt the only delights of which they form any idea.</p>
               <p>But, if the ardor for knowledge which at preſent exiſts in our nation ſhall continue—we hope ſoon to ſee the day, when it ſhall be rare to ſee a youth deliver himſelf up to riot, and inebriation—when the inſtance ſhall be ſtill rarer, that under the color of love and good will—he ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce vice and contamination into a once innocent and happy family, and when to get an office, in order, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the public, ſhall be utterly unknown—we hope that education ſhall have ſuch force, that the objects of deſire, ſhall be perfectly innocent and harmleſs enjoyments—that the intention of wealth ſhall be uſefulneſs; when love ſhall bleſs the object of its flame; and ambition ſhall aim at the good of a nation, and at mankind.</p>

               <p>I HOPE to meet with the countenance &amp; encouragement of this aſſembly, while I attempt a theme of which, I truſt, all will confeſs the utility. I would ſpeak the praiſes of a long and heavy purſe—Well ſtuffed with ſubſtantial coin— While Orations are made on all other ſubjects of all kinds

                  </gap>it ſeems quite improper that this ſhould be neglected. The preſent ſcarcity of caſh, muſt give peculiar force to the arguments with which this theme abounds—It is gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the ſcarcity of any thing, which is valuable, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually teaches us to eſteem it—Who then can be more ſenſible than we are of the value of that ready aſſiſtant in all manner of buſineſs? Some have aſſerted that it is in the power of money to do anything—That it can change vice into imaginary virtue, and deformity into beauty—But while we are ſpeaking in this reſpectable aſſembly; we have nothing to ſay of vice, but that it exiſts not here—and while we are addreſſing this lovely choir of ladies, to mention de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity would be ſtraying wide from the purpoſe— It will not be denied, that with the perfection of beauty, it is very well to poſſeſs a handſome intereſt in pecuniary matters—It makes the heart cheerful, and the buſineſs of life eaſy—It is written of Mrs. Primroſe the celebrated wife of the Vicar of Wakefield, that ſhe would have her daughters each carry in her pocket a guinea, without ever changing it, to keep them in ſpirits. If a ſingle guinea has ſuch virtue, what may not be expected from a long and heavy purſe, well ſtuffed with them? It muſt doubtleſs do wonders. There are thoſe who maintain that many evils ariſe from the length, and heavineſs of the purſe—That it makes prodigals of young heirs; and inſtigates them to all manner of exceſſes. But that their purſe is not to be blamed may readily be proved from o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e eaſy ſuppoſition. Money is juſt as willing to do good as to do evil, nay it anſwers its own purpoſe beſt by being the inſtrument of happineſs to human-kind—If it does, a man's money is no more to blame for his crimes than his bodily ſtrength for his committing murder— For my part tho I have never experienced ſo much of the benefit of money, as ſome men have, yet the little I have had has done me ſo much good, that I moſt earneſtly deſire to have more, and I ſhall think it ſtrange if you doubt of my ſincerity in this aſſertion—I have a ſtrong imagination that if I had a great fortune I ſhould do much good with it—And if I could handſomely come to the poſſeſſion of an affluent eſtate—I have ſo much confidence in my own integrity, that I ſhould not be afraid to truſt myſelf with it. And while I am wiſhing for a great plenty of money myſelf, I cannot help wiſhing that my neighbors had more
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:034600_0497_0FFF3688B89F6C20"/>
than they have, and in this reſpect I hope I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of coinciding with their own ideas. I will allow that virtue is of more value than money—for virtue can procure money, but money cannot buy virtue—I will alſo allow health to be better than caſh: becauſe without health we cannot enjoy our money—but money is the third great bleſſing of human life. Therefore, Ladies and gentlemen —that you may all have the conſolations of virtue—the bleſſings of health, and the convenience of a plenty of Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars—and that I may have my full ſhare of each, is the hearty deſire of your very humble Servant.</p>

               <l>THE ſummer's pleaſing ſeaſon now is paſt,</l>
               <l>And autumn chills us with his rigid blaſt;</l>
               <l>Let us reflect what prudence we have learned—</l>
               <l>What wiſdom in the ſummer months diſcerned.</l>
               <l>I've heard a tragic tale—Tho grief remain,</l>
               <l>Yet if we learn diſcretion that is gain.</l>
               <l>Two LILLIES of the faireſt virgin hue,</l>
               <l>In the ſame vale nigh to each other grew;</l>
               <l>One gave her beauties to the blaze of day,</l>
               <l>From the bold gaze the other turned way;</l>
               <l>And if a ſavage figure chanced to paſs,</l>
               <l>Would veil her beauties in ſurrounding graſs;</l>
               <l>Thro this ſame vale one moſt unhappy day,</l>
               <l>A lordly BEAR, ſlow ſauntering, found his way.</l>
               <l>The forward flower, impatient to be ſeen,</l>
               <l>Diſplayed the beauties of her ſhape and mein.</l>
               <l>Turned on her ſtem to meet his haughty eyes,</l>
               <l>And bade the ſweeteſt gales of fragrance riſe.</l>
               <l>A leaf he cropped, but ſcarcely owned 'twas ſweet,</l>
               <l>Then trod the beauteous flower beneath his feet.</l>

               <l>Would cloſe her leaves, and veil her beauties quite.</l>

               <l>True friend to flowers, and guardian of their race.</l>
               <l>She heard his honeſt fame in whiſpering gales,</l>

               <l>Which on the ſweetneſs of his garden fed.</l>
               <l>As gently he drew nigh, with looks ſerene,</l>
               <l>The flower, tho modeſt, ventured to be ſeen.</l>
               <l>With gentle touch, and gentler breath, it's true,</l>
               <l>Partly, her beauties met his raptured view,</l>
               <l>Her lovely colors beaming on his ſight,</l>
               <l>Her fragrance filled his ſenſe with keen delight.</l>
               <l>With gentleſt hand he reared her tender head;</l>

               <l>Where nurſed with all his cares by days and hours,</l>
               <l>She filled his garden with the ſweeteſt flowers.</l>

               <p>THIS band of Brothers, the young gentlemen of the ſchool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now preſent to you their moſt ſincere thanks, for the candid and pleaſing attention with which you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We ſhall believe that you love virtue, and are diſpoſed to encourage learning; by the friendly countenance which you have given to both—It is the intention of the young gentlemen ever to deſerve your approbation. Permit me, my bretheren, to expreſs what I believe to be your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to this aſſembly—You are determined to purſue thoſe methods of life; by which you may be reſpectable in yourſelves, and uſeful to ſociety—We will ever (I truſt you will ſupport me in the aſſertion) maintain a grateful ſenſe of the various means by which our kind parents have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored for our happineſs. The fair advantages for acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful knowledge, the kind inſtructions we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our neareſt relations, and from this ſchool, lead us to virtue, and to real praiſe. We do not place our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, worthy parents and friends, in riot, and debauchery

—We have no imagination, that noiſy revels, gaming par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſcenes of lewdneſs, or low knavery, are calculated to convey joy and happineſs to the ſoul—We do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that to deſpiſe the counſels of parents, to contract habits of impiety and profanity, which are always attended with ſavageneſs of manners, are ways to gain eſteem Nor have we formed any idea of happineſs as exiſting in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient ſenſations of joy, or mirth ſucceeded by the ſevereſt remorſe—No—We ſuppoſe that probity is honor, and that virtue is happineſs.</p>
               <p>Speaking of happineſs, an idea occurs intima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Yet think not, therefore, that thoſe here preſent, whoſe families are illuminated with many of thoſe brighteſt gems of beauty, need ſecure thoſe treaſures from our approach. Need you defend them by bolts, or bars, or brazen walls? We have no idea that there can be love, where there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to deſtroy: we ſuppoſe that it might as truly be ſaid of the hawk that he loves the trembling bird, whom he pierces with his cruel talons—of the wolf that he loves the lamb when he ſucks her reeking blood—as that the perfidious traitor loves the innocent and blooming maiden; when he ſeeks to ruin her beſt intereſts, and to fully her ſpotleſs fame. Let that heart periſh which harbors a ſavave ſelfiſh deſire, burning only to deſtroy. Our idea of love is that of a moſt innocent harmleſs kind affection; ſeeking always the good of its object, like that of the guardian angel over the precious ſaint, by heaven committed to his care— In reſpect to theſe amiable beings, whom we muſt ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and eſteem, you will ever, I truſt, find our conduct to be void of blame.</p>

We will further tell you, and our hearts witneſs it to be true,—that every injury from a man to a woman, proceeds from open, or ſecret contempt; from a mind careleſs of your beſt intereſts, and actuated by mean and ſelfiſh motives—reverence your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ladies, and it will be impoſſible that we ſhould not reſpect and love you.</p>
               <p>But need we become your adviſers—you know theſe things; theſe ſentiments are conformable to your daily practice. What reſpect, what admiration have not your accompliſhments, your graces and virtues, inſpired. All eyes, ranks acd profeſſions, of men, ſpeak of you with pleaſure and ſay—How accompliſhed and how virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the young ladies of theſe days—We hope the time is rapidly advancing, when the parents ſhall no more ſhed bitter tears for the weakneſs of a daughter; nor a brother, by a ſiſter's fault, feel the venomed ſting of infamy in his heart—When there ſhall be no more hurting or deſtroying, in all the land, of innocent and virtuous love.</p>
               <p>FRIENDS OF THE ASSEMBLY, AT LARGE,</p>
               <p>The moral, all the ſocial and virtuous affections, are ſtrengthened by the cultivation of the liberal arts—Nay, by education we may turn the whole force of habit, on the ſide of virtue, and real religion. This matter ſeems to be better underſtood now than formerly, and inſtead of mere language &amp; the more abſtract ſciences, it becomes more generally the practice in ſchools to inſtill into the minds of youth the principles of religion and morals. Inſtead of conſidering religion and virtue as the reſtraints and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the mind—they are regarded as the helm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, to convey us to happineſs, thro the boiſterous ocean of human affairs.

               <p>The politeneſs of our viſiting aſſemblies is a comfort and encouragement to the ſtudents. We feel a delightful ſecurity that thoſe who are our obſervers will receive with pleaſure every thing that is well performed, and with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs

               <p>We feel a diſadvantage by way of compariſon—only a few weeks ago you ſaw on this ſtage, ſuch performances as had a peculiar advantage to attract the attention. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt that the benign countenance of ſo full an audience was greatly owing to the aſſiſtance of thoſe amiable young ladies, who then united the ſublime and beautiful in their performances.</p>
               <p>Animated by your preſence; aſſiſted by all that was amiable; we exceeded our proper ſelves, and ſhone with the reflected rays of genius and beauty. All experiments, ladies, prove that we cannot attain our proper perfection without your ſociety. This day have we been deſtitute of that advantageous aſſiſtance. It made us deeply feel our ſolitude. But the countenance you have maintained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, hath been a delicious conſolation. It is your faculty, ladies, to indulge a kind and benevolent heart, and to make many happy without the leaſt departure from true dignity. Theſe and a thouſand other agreeable qualities, are daily increaſing your influence on our hearts.</p>
               <p>We truſt, reſpected fathers and mothers of families, that you will not blame us for regarding our once charming companions in our ſtudies. You will readily believe, that their ſociety muſt be pleaſing to us: but your wiſdom hath determined, that in ſome inſtances, we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their ſociety; and that they ſhall not mix the common courſe of their ſtudies with ours. But without any impeachment of your wiſdom, we cannot but rejoice, that there is a way, in which we may attain the permanent bleſſings of their ſociety, without injury to them; and we humbly hope, without offence to you.</p>

               <p>THE kind attention with which you have been pleaſed to hear our performances, excites the moſt agreeable ſenſations in our hearts. The countenance of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly has given us courage and enabled us to pleaſe—praiſe to the youthful heart attempting worthy deeds is like dew upon the ſpringing graſs. If thus you cheriſh the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the youthful heart, and fan the riſing ardor of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue—your inſtitutions of learning muſt proſper even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your moſt brilliant expectations.</p>
               <p>The giving of this moſt brilliant part of your exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to a perſon, not an inhabitant of your town—ſhows the liberality of your inſtitutions—and the impartiality reigning in the ſchool—the way to be conſpicuous in any branch, is open to any one who has a paſſion for laudable improvement—I would willingly convince you, that the love of learning flouriſhes in other places, and other towns, as well as yours.
<pb n="529" facs="unknown:034600_0518_0FFF366E2A4EF690"/>
Shall I not in my addreſſes to the ſeveral parts of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly begin with the moſt deſerving? We muſt then pay our devoirs to our reſpectable Matrons here preſent—Our hearts will will not ſuffer us to omit this; which is both our duty and pleaſure—You have done us the honor to think our performances worthy of your attention—And be aſſured, in proportion as our minds expand to receive knowledge; they will increaſe in reſpect to you—That mind muſt be ſtupid which thinks not with gratitude on the painful duties and attentions of a mother—Happy the youth who has one, who delights in his accompliſhments— No means will be left uneſſayed that he may have them in perfection.</p>
               <p>Yet while we remember matronal dignity, &amp; recompence with gratitude maternal care, we cannot forget the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able young ladies, who, tho they ſtudy not with us, are related to us, in the privileges of the ſchool—You hide our faults from them, that they may reſpect us; you diſcipline them not in our preſence, leſt their delicate minds ſhould not ſupport the mortification—Yet in the aſſembly of the dance—or harmleſs evening amuſement—you permit us to have their ſociety. Thus from early life you cheriſh mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſpect and eſteem between the ſexes—Young as we are, our hearts already begin to bleſs you.</p>
               <p>My heart delights to addreſs you, young Ladies, for who can be inſenſible to your approbation—Who be indifferent to your beauties and accompliſhments—The heart which is cheriſhed by you; muſt learn the virtues from your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of life—The mind contemplates your beauties, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires your graces, and prefers your virtues—Nothing could conſole us in leaving your animating preſence, but the hope of being reunited, with our deareſt domeſtic friends.</p>

            <p>THE Author, having completed the plan of his work, would take a decent farewell of his readers. He has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſet in a clear light, in his Dialogues, ſome of the moſt neceſſary and uſeful principles of morality, and religion; and to awaken, and exemplify, thoſe decent and tender affections, which form the felicity of domeſtic life— theſe are more level to the comprehenſion of perſons under twenty years of age—than the ſpeeches of generals at the head of armies, or the high wrought ſatires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which find acceptance in old and corrupted courts: and the author ſuppoſes they have a better effect on the hearts of young perſons of both ſexes. And are more ſuitable to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners generally prevailing in our common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth—He condemns not other men's works however—all may be uſeful in their place.</p>

It may be tho't not ſtrange therefore, that there ſhould be ſome errata in it—the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſuppoſes that half the errors aroſe from his manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. The printer will not then be chargeable, with any great number. The following he thinks ought to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed becauſe they confound the ſenſe of the paſſages in which they are found.</p>

But it is not in the Author's power to give a liſt of the Subſcribers; for not one half of the Papers are returned.
