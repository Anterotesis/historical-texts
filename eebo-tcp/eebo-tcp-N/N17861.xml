            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Act to incorporate the Subscribers to the Bank of the United States.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS it is conceived that the eſtabliſhment of a bank for the United States, upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſufficiently extenſive to anſwer the purpoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thereby, and at the ſame time upon the principles which afford adequate ſecurity for an upright and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent adminiſtration thereof, will be very conducive to the ſucceſsful conducting of the national finances—will tend to give facility to the obtaining of loans for the uſe of the government, in ſudden emergencies—and will be productive of conſiderable advantages to trade and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in general—Therefore,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Be it enacted by the Senate and Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the United States of America, in Congreſs aſſembled,</hi> That a bank of the United States ſhall be eſtabliſhed; the capital ſtock whereof ſhall not exceed ten millions of dollars, divided into twenty-five thouſand ſhares, each ſhare being four hundred dollars; and that ſubſcriptions towards conſtituting the ſaid ſtock, ſhall, on the firſt Monday in April next, be opened at the city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, under the ſuperintendance of ſuch perſons, not leſs than three, as ſhall be appointed for that purpoſe by the Preſident of the United States (who is hereby em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to appoint the ſaid perſons accordingly) which ſubſcriptions ſhall continue open until the whole of the ſaid ſtock ſhall have been ſubſcribed.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>And be it further enacted,</hi> That it ſhall be lawful for any perſon, co-partnerſhip, or body politic, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe for ſuch or ſo many ſhares as he, ſhe or they ſhall think fit, not exceeding one thouſand, except as ſhall be hereafter directed relatively to the United States; and that the ſums reſpectively ſubſcribed, except on behalf of the United States, ſhall be payable one fourth in gold and ſilver, and three fourths in that part of the public
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023146_0003_0FBC75B8543391E0"/>
debt which, according to the loan propoſed in the fourth and fifteenth ſections of the act, entitled, "An act mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proviſion for the debt of the United States," ſhall bear an accruing intereſt, at the time of payment, of ſix per centum per annum; and ſhall alſo be payable in four equal parts, in the aforeſaid ratio of ſpecie to debt, at the diſtance of ſix calendar months from each other; the firſt whereof ſhall be paid at the time of ſubſcription.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>And be it further enacted,</hi> That all thoſe who ſhall become ſubſcribers to the ſaid bank, their ſucceſſors and aſſigns, ſhall be, and are hereby created and made a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration and body politic, by the name and ſtyle of THE PRESIDENT, DIRECTORS AND COMPANY, OF THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES; and ſhall ſo continue until the 4th day of March one thouſand eight hundred and eleven: And by that name, ſhall be, and are hereby made able and capable in law, to have, purchaſe, receive, poſſeſs, enjoy, and retain to them and their ſucceſſors, lands, rents, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and effects of what kind, nature or quality ſoever, to an amount, not exceeding in the whole fifteen millions of dollars, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the amount of the capital ſtock aforeſaid; and the ſame to ſell, grant, demiſe, alien or diſpoſe of; to ſue and be ſued, plead and be impleaded, anſwer and be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatſoever: And alſo to make, have, and uſe a common ſeal, and the ſame to break, alter and renew, at their pleaſure; and alſo to ordain, eſtabliſh, and put in execution, ſuch bye-laws, ordinances and regulations as ſhall ſeem neceſſary and convenient for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid corporation, not being contrary to law, or to the conſtitution thereof (for which purpoſe general meetings of the ſtockholders ſhall and may be called by the directors, and in the manner herein after ſpecified) and generally to do and execute all and ſingular acts, matters and things, which to them it ſhall or may apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to do; ſubject nevertheleſs to the rules, regulations, reſtrictions, limitations, and proviſions, herein after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and declared.</p>

IV. <hi>And be it further enacted,</hi> That for the well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the affairs of the ſaid corporation, there ſhall be twenty-five directors: of whom there ſhall be an election on the firſt Monday of January, in each year, by the ſtockholders or proprietors of the capital ſtock of the ſaid corporation, and by plurality of the votes actually given; and thoſe, who ſhall be duly choſen at any election, ſhall be capable of ſerving as directors, by virtue of ſuch choice, until the end or expiration of the Monday of January next enſuing the time of ſuch election, and no longer. And the ſaid directors, at their firſt meeting after each election, ſhall chooſe one of their number as preſident.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Provided always, and be it further enacted,</hi> That as ſoon as the ſum of four hundred thouſand dollars, in gold and ſilver, ſhall have been actually received on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſubſcriptions to the ſaid ſtock, notice thereof ſhall be given by the perſons under whoſe ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance the ſame ſhall have been made, in at leaſt two pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic gazettes printed in the city of Philadelphia; and the ſaid perſons ſhall, at the ſame time in like manner, notify a time and place within the ſaid city, at the diſtance of ninety days from the time of ſuch notification, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the election of directors; and it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for ſuch election to be then and there made; and the perſons who ſhall then and there be choſen, ſhall be the firſt directors, and ſhall be capable of ſerving, by virtue of ſuch choice, until the end or expiration of the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in January next enſuing the time of making the ſame, and ſhall forthwith thereafter commence the operations of the ſaid bank, at the ſaid city of Philadelphia. <hi>And provided further,</hi> That in caſe it ſhould at any time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that an election of directors ſhould not be made upon any day when purſuant to this act it ought to have been made, the ſaid corporation ſhall not for that cauſe, be deemed to be diſſolved; but it ſhall be lawful on any other day, to hold and make an election of directors, in ſuch manner as ſhall have been regulated by the laws and ordinances of the ſaid corporation. <hi>And provided
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023146_0005_0FBC75BB547E5298"/>
laſtly,</hi> That in caſe of the death, reſignation, abſence from the United States, or removal of a director by the ſtockholders, his place may be filled up by a new choice, for the remainder of the year.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>And be it further enacted,</hi> That the directors for the time being, ſhall have power to appoint ſuch officers, clerks, and ſervants under them, as ſhall be neceſſary for executing the buſineſs of the ſaid corporation, and to allow them ſuch compenſation, for their ſervices reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as ſhall be reaſonable; and ſhall be capable of exerciſing ſuch other powers and authorities, for the well governing and ordering of the affairs of the ſaid corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as ſhall be deſcribed, fixed, and determined by the laws, regulations, and ordinances of the ſame.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>And be it further enacted,</hi> That the following rules, reſtrictions, limitations and proviſions, ſhall form and be fundamental articles of the conſtitution of the ſaid corporation, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The number of votes to which each ſtockholder ſhall be entitled, ſhall be according to the number of ſhares he ſhall hold, in the proportions following: That is to ſay, for one ſhare, and not more than two ſhares, one vote: For every two ſhares above two, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ten, one vote: For every four ſhares above ten, and not exceeding thirty, one vote: For every ſix ſhares above thirty, and not exceeding ſixty, one vote: For every eight ſhares above ſixty, and not exceeding one hundred, one vote: And for every ten ſhares above one hundred, one vote:—But no perſon, co-partnerſhip, or body politic, ſhall be entitled to a greater number than thirty votes. And after the firſt election, no ſhare or ſhares ſhall confer a right of ſuffrage, which ſhall not have been holden three calendar months previous to the day of election. Stockholders actually reſident within the United States, and none other, may vote in elections by proxy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not more than three-fourths of the directors in office, excluſive of the Preſident, ſhall be eligible for the next ſucceeding year: But the director, who ſhall be

Preſident at the time of an election, may always be re-elected.</p>
            <p n="3">3. None but a ſtockholder, being a citizen of the United States, ſhall be eligible as a director.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No director ſhall be entitled to any emolument, unleſs the ſame ſhall have been allowed by the ſtockhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at a general meeting. The ſtockholders ſhall make ſuch compenſation to the Preſident, for his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary attendance at the bank, as ſhall appear to them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Not leſs than ſeven directors ſhall conſtitute a board for the tranſaction of buſineſs, of whom, the Preſident ſhall always be one, except in caſe of ſickneſs, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary abſence; in which caſe, his place may be ſupplied by any other director, whom he, by writing under his hand, ſhall nominate for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Any number of ſtockholders, not leſs than ſixty, who together ſhall be proprietors of two hundred ſhares or upwards, ſhall have power at any time to call a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meeting of the ſtockholders, for purpoſes relative to the inſtitution, giving at leaſt ten weeks notice, in two public gazettes of the place where the bank is kept, and ſpecifying, in ſuch notice, the object or objects of ſuch meeting.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Every caſhier or treaſurer, before he enters upon the duties of his office, ſhall be required to give bond, with two or more ſureties, to the ſatisfaction of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, in a ſum not leſs than fifty thouſand dollars, with condition for his good behaviour.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The lands, tenements, and hereditaments, which it ſhall be lawful for the ſaid corporation to hold, ſhall be only ſuch as ſhall be requiſite for its immediate accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in relation to the convenient tranſacting of its buſineſs, and ſuch as ſhall have been <hi>bona fide</hi> mortgaged to it by way of ſecurity, or conveyed to it in ſatisfaction of debts previouſly contracted in the courſe of its deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or purchaſed at ſales upon judgments which ſhall have been obtained for ſuch debts.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:023146_0007_0FBC75BE38B351E0"/>
9. The total amount of the debts which the ſaid corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhall at any time owe, whether by bond, bill, note, or other contract, ſhall not exceed the ſum of Ten Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Dollars, over and above the monies then actually depoſited in the bank for ſafe-keeping, unleſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of any greater debt ſhall have been previouſly authorized by a law of the United States. In caſe of exceſs, the directors, under whoſe adminiſtration it ſhall happen, ſhall be liable for the ſame, in their natural and private capacities: and an action of debt may in ſuch caſe be brought againſt them, or any of them, their or any of their heirs, executors or adminiſtrators, in any court of record of the United States, or of either of them, by any creditor or creditors of the ſaid corporation, and may be proſecuted to judgment and execution; any condition, covenant, or agreement to the contrary notwithſtanding. But this ſhall not be conſtrued to exempt the ſaid corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or the lands, tenements, goods or chattels of the ſame, from being alſo liable for and chargeable with the ſaid exceſs. Such of the ſaid directors, who may have been abſent when the ſaid exceſs was contracted or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, or who may have diſſented from the reſolution or act whereby the ſame was ſo contracted or created, may reſpectively exonerate themſelves from being ſo liable, by forthwith giving notice of the fact, and of their abſence or diſſent, to the Preſident of the United States, and to the ſtockholders, at a general meeting, which they ſhall have power to call for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The ſaid corporation may ſell any part of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt whereof its ſtock ſhall be compoſed, but ſhall not be at liberty to purchaſe any public debt whatſoever; nor ſhall directly or indirectly deal or trade in any thing, except bills of exchange, gold or ſilver bullion, or in the ſale of goods really and truly pledged for money lent and not redeemed in due time; or of goods which ſhall be the produce of its lands. Neither ſhall the ſaid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration take more than at the rate of ſix per centum per annum, for or upon its loans or diſcounts.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:023146_0008_0FBC75C0F0C9A790"/>
11. No loan ſhall be made by the ſaid corporation, for the uſe or on account of the government of the United States, to an amount exceeding one hundred thouſand dollars, or of any particular ſtate, to an amount exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifty thouſand dollars, or of any foreign prince or ſtate, unleſs previouſly authorized by a law of the United States.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The ſtock of the ſaid corporation ſhall be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and transferable, according to ſuch rules as ſhall be inſtituted in that behalf, by the laws and ordinances of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The bills obligatory and of credit, under the ſeal of the ſaid corporation, which ſhall be made to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons, ſhall be aſſignable by indorſement there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, under the hand or hands of ſuch perſon or perſons, and of his, her, or their aſſignee or aſſignees, and ſo as abſolutely to transfer and veſt the property thereof in each and every aſſignee or aſſignees ſucceſſively, and to enable ſuch aſſignee or aſſignees to bring and maintain an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereupon in his, her, or their own name or names.
