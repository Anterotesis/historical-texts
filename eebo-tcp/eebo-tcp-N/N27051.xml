            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE UNFORTUNATE LOVERS.</head>
            <p>IN the year 1666, Mr. Benjamin Beaumont and Mr. Samuel Gauze, were partners in mercantile concerns in the town of Boſton.—They were not related, but lived in perfect friendſhip. They were men of the firſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in town, and had a rapid run of buſineſs, both the wholeſale and retail, by which they accumulated great property. At length Mr. Beaumont got married, and his partner, Mr. Gauze, in the ſpace of three months afterwards. Notwithſtanding they lived in perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the term of three months, then by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent of both parties, diſſolved partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but ſtill had a good underſtanding. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at the end of nine months, Mr. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont was favored with a handſome boy; and on account of the love and good will <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Mr. Gauze, invited him in (as their houſes were adjoining) to make merry with him on the occaſion. Dinner being over, Mr. Beaumont and Mr. Gauze, retired into a private room for amuſement. After converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon different topics, Mr. Beaumont turns to Mr. Gauze, with a joyful countenance, ſaying, if it was ſo ordered by Deity, that your wife ſhould bring forth a daughter, ſo that their tender minds might be filled with love and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036045_0004_10080B8ACD155D80"/>
gratitude towards each other from their youth up to the age of maturity, and then be joined in the bands of wedlock—with all my heart, replied Mr. Gauze, God grant that to be the caſe. With that they renewed it by a ſolemn vow, that nothing would be wanted on their part, to endear them to each other. And they had their wiſh; for ſcarcely had three months revolved, when Mrs. Gauze was delivered of a handſome daughter. Then Mr. Beaumont was ſent for to make merry on the occaſion; where they renewed their former promiſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it with a ſolemn oath. At the end of a year, the children were baptized. The boy, Samuel Beaumont, and the girl, Nancy Gauze—in memory of Mrs. Beaumont. And when old enough to go to ſchool, were ſent to ſchool together, and all the pains imaginable taken, to endear them to each other: Mr. Beaumont would often ſay, Samuel, if you go any where to day, you muſt go with Miſs Nancy; And Mr. Gauze would frequently ſay, Nancy, be ſure and call for Samuel, when going to ſchool to-day.</p>
            <p>Thus a few days had elapſed, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came attached to each other to ſuch a degree, that it was beyond the art of human reaſon to keep them apart for any length of time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Samuel was ſent to College at the age of fourteen, which proved very grievous to Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and brought her immediately into a ſtate of deſpondent melancholy. But their parents indulged them as much as poſſible, by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of frequent viſits, and by unfolding their minds to each other by letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:036045_0005_10080BA47A90D410"/>
During the time of Samuel's collegiate life, his father (Mr. Beaumont) was deeply engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Eaſt India trade, which proved ſo unfortunate, by ſtorms at ſea, that he loſt all his ſhipping, and in leſs than one month after his ſon took his degree, his creditors called upon him and found him unable to pay ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings on the pound. Notwithſtanding this ſudden and unfortunate change, he bore it with the greateſt fortitude.</p>
            <p>Now let us turn to the young lovers, who were encouraged by indulgent parents.</p>
            <p>By this time their paſſions became more ſtrong. As they increaſed in years, Cupid's arrows were implanted ſtrongly in both their breaſts; and they lived in as much love and unity, ſave the nuptial bed, as tho' bound by the tendereſt ties of a nature. But pride, rank pride, the deſtroyer of peace and happineſs, ſoon made a ſeparation: For Gauze, finding his intended ſon-in-law (Mr. Beaumont, as his age gives him the title) reduced to poverty by the miſfortunes of his honored father, denies him the privilege of coming to his houſe or paying any further reſpects to his daughter. This refuſal was ſo ſudden and unexpected, that he remained ſpeechleſs for ſome minutes. At length he exclaimed, with a loud and bitter cry—In the name of juſtice, from what motives have you altered your mind! This is beyond my conception, to have an open denial of the privileges you always indulged me in, even from my infancy. Oh! Good heavens! is it poſſible for us to part, who have been ſo long, united, and have been taught by indulgent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036045_0006_10080B8C52CA7C60"/>
to accent the firſt words of our utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>love?</hi> By this time his courage began to return, and he addreſſes himſelf to Mr. Gauze in the following manner:—</p>
            <p>Sir, I beſeech you to take a retroſpective view of your paſt conduct reſpecting this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy affair, which appears to be ſo at preſent. Don't you remember the ſolemn promiſes that paſſed between you and my father, that Nancy and I ſhould be bound by the bands of wedlock, provided we were agreed, which you know to be the caſe? And not only ſo, but you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it with an oath. I am not ignorant of this matter. This was not done in a corner; for the loweſt claſs of people in town are well acquainted with it. Now, Sir, pleaſe to let me know what you ever obſerved in me or my conduct, to give you any reaſon to treat me with neglect, and deprive me of the object of my wiſhes, which you ever indulged me in. Mr. Gauze remains ſpeechleſs—at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: I have ever obſerved your conduct to be good, but do not wiſh to have my daughter go to the arms of a beggar. Your father was in good circumſtances when I paſſed my word, which I don't conſider binding, ſince he has been reduced to poverty.</p>
            <p>The young man replied: Your riches periſh with you—and departed with a heavy heart. Miſs Nancy was then in her apartment, and knew nothing of the converſation; but no ſooner had Mr. Beaumont retired, than her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entered the room and ſaid, I'm determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to break up a ſcene that has been long in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036045_0007_10080BA6E251CFF8"/>
agitation, both to your ruin and the diſhonor of your father.</p>
            <p>Nancy replies with a look of wildneſs—good God! Father, what ſcene! what ſcene? The ſcene between you and Beaumont, that has been ſo long brewing. Don't you know that his fortune is not adequate to your's? But ſtill you keep his company to the injury of your credit, as it will throw you into the meaneſt company in town. I look upon him no better than the off<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>couring of humanity—Nancy cries forbear, I pray forbear, with her eyes brim full of tears. She could not utter more—at length recovering, ſays: Father, was not the firſt ſeeds of love ſown in my tender breaſt by your own hand, cheriſhed by your inſinuations, and have budded and bloſſomed, and arrived to ſuch a degree of perfection that they are paſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>? Oh! father, how often have I heard you ſay, be ſure and go with Samuel to ſchool to-day, when I was incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending your meaning: And now I muſt tell you, with tears in my eyes, that nothing can part us but death. On hearing of this, her father interrupted her, and ſaid: You are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my commands, and to them you muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</p>
            <p>Her mother, who remained in tears during the time of their converſation, addreſſed Mr. Gauze in the following manner:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Nancy retires.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know that ſhe is our child who is near <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dear to us, and why will you undertake to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> her ruin by ſeparating her from her <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> held dear. Your conſcience muſt certainly tell
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036045_0008_10080B8ECA7A01C0"/>
you that ſhe is not the aggreſſor, for ſhe has obeyed your commands from her youth up to this day; and why will you ſtifle flame which was your's, and your partner, Mr. Beaumont's concupiſcible motives. With that, Mr. Gauze replied. You talk like one of the fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; you would bring the family under an ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlating diſgrace by joining her to a man that is ſo poor. Then let her be poor, ſays Mrs. Gauze—I would rather ſee her happy than rich; but there is no need of her being poor; your intereſt is great; beſtow a part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her. How often has it been the caſe that there was not equality of property on the ſame occaſion. Do comply with my requeſt; for if there is not ſomething done ſhortly, we muſt follow her in ſorrow to the grave. Mr. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont replies: Enough—I will hear no more—I will go this moment and confine her. He goes immediately, and engaging two maidens to attend her, confines her to the room, ſaying, there is your place of reſidence till you alter your mind—then retires, charging the ſervants not to aſſist her, either by letter, or verbal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, on the penalty of being diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Now the unfortunate lovers are bewailing their unhappy fate in a ſtate of ſeparation and deſpair. At length her lover ſits down and writes in the following manner:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>It is needleſs for me to inform you of the trouble that daily ſurrounds me, as I know you to be under the ſame predicament, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhare in each other's difficulties, unleſs our minds are very much altered from what

they were in our laſt interview. I ſpeak from the bottom of my heart; mine is not altered, nor ever ſhall be till ſeparated by death. I know not what will be the event of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's treating us with ſo much cruelty. Time will not permit me to go into a lengthy detail of things in the paſt tenſe, but muſt mention ſomething of a ſerious nature, which concerns the preſent, which I hope will prove fortunate to us both, and make the remainder of our days happy. Time hangs heavy over my head ſince our laſt converſation. You cannot tell the anxiety I undergo. Sleep is departed from me. Pardon me for writing ſo, for I am ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your heart that I know you ſhare with me in my troubles. My mind is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed that I have dropped the ſubject I meant to treat upon reſpecting our future happineſs. I have taken the matter into ſerious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, and ſee no method we can take to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the object of our wiſhes; and I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved or embark for England to ſeek my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. You muſt not blame me, for you know that our parents are the cauſe of all this—My father's poverty, and your father's pride. It is diſagreeable to part, but we muſt bear it with fortitude—hoping in the courſe of ſix or ſeven years to make each other happy—hoping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in that time, if life is ſpared. My method of conveying this letter is this—I have engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a boy to go this night with the letter on the end of a pole, that you may receive it at your chamber window at twelve o'clock, hoping you will ſend me an anſwer at the ſame hour

                  <p>You know the cauſe of my misfortunes better than I, as you and Mr. Gauze were the origin: Your misfortunes turned the mind of Mr. Gauze againſt me, which I fear will prove my ruin—Now I will inform you what I am about to do: I am reſolved to embark on board the ſhip Good Succeſs, bound for London, and ſeek my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. You know my ſituation here as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and to the anxiety of my mind it is beſt known to myſelf—I am not deſtitute of feelings, and thoſe of the tendereſt nature. It is hard parting with parents who have brought me up ſo tenderly, and have cultivated my mind in the days of my youth, by giving me good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which will remain with me when my property is all exhauſted; which is the caſe with us both: this he ſpeaks with tears, ſaying, it is hard and cutting to human nature, to be once in affluent circumſtances, and then reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            </floatingText>
            <p>His parents, who were in tears all this time, knew not what to ſay. At length his father anſwered: My ſon, I know your ſituation is bad, as well as my own: I have given you a good education, and was under circumſtances to have given you a handſome fortune; but if it was the will of Providence that we ſhould come to poverty, let us not repine, but be content. If it is your determination to go in queſt of a fortune, I will procure money ſufficient of my brother to bear your expences, (which he did) and in the courſe of three days was ready to ſail. Previous to his embarcation, there came three gentlemen merchants to his father's, and talked with him, on the neceſſity of his being very attentive to his buſineſs; and as they were acquainted in London, gave him letters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to the merchants; which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a heart of gratitude and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

            <p>Mr. Gauze hearing of his embarcation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately releaſes his daughter from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, who had the privilege of walking out: Her mind being perplexed, and being confined ſo long, ſhe ran eagerly to unfold her heart to Mrs. Beaumont.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Mr. Beaumont. Mr. Gauze exclaimed with a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036045_0013_10080BAEA53037C8"/>
peremptory tone of voice: Who gave you the liberty of harboring my daughter? Mr. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont anſwered him with a great degree of calmneſs: She is not your daughter, for you have given her to my ſon in her infancy, and confirmed it by a ſolemn oath, which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their ruin. Mr. Gauze anſwers: Would you have my daughter go to the arms of a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar? You have ventured your property and loſt it, and by that means broke up the match. It never was my intention to have them joined unleſs there was an equality of property. Mr. Beaumont replies: Your property periſh with you—it never gave eaſe to a perjured ſoul. Go home and contemplate on the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that paſſed betwixt us, reſpecting the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the young couple you have lately ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. I have ever treated you with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, but you have treated me with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which is the blackeſt of crimes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gauze and his daughter returns very ſolitary. Mr. Beaumont arrives in England, after a tedious paſſage of twelve weeks, and ſuffered every thing but death itſelf. On his arrival in London, one of the firſt characters, who was deeply engaged in the Eaſt and Weſt India trade, employed him as firſt clerk of the counting room. He remained in this ſituation for the term of one year; gave perfect ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and treated every man with politeneſs, but never appeared to ſmile: which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by his employer, who one day took an opportunity to aſk him, ſaying, What is the cauſe of your dejection? Are you not treated handſomely by your fellow clerks? Or have I
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036045_0014_10080B9655861608"/>
given you any reaſon for this heavineſs of heart! Mr. Beaumont replies with tears: You have ever been my friend and brother according to the bonds of ſociety. My ſickneſs is of the mind. I cannot carry ſmiles and ſunſhine in my face when diſcontent ſits heavy on my heart—His employer replies: May I know the cauſe without intruding too far? To you alone I will reveal it, as I know you have a heart that will ever conceal, and a tongue that will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> then gives him a narrative of all his misfortunes. His employer heard him with aſtoniſhment, and with a heart full of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, anſwers him in the following manner: You have paſſed through many ſcenes of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in your youthful days, but I hope it will all terminate for the beſt. My buſineſs is ſuch that I want your aſſiſtance for years to come; but I will not require it any longer than it will terminate for your health and happineſs. I would adviſe you to take a journey to France for your health, as new objects are commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a perſson in your ſituation. I will give you letters of recommendation to ſome of the firſt characters in France, which I preſume will introduce you into buſineſs. Furthermore, I will help you to money to bear your expences. Mr. Beaumont immediately complied with his offer, and in three days from that time, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for France: But misfortune ſeemed to await him: For within a few leagues of the deſired haven, the veſſel was caſtaway, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he and two others had the good fortune to eſcape.</p>
            <p>Now his cup of calamities was entirely full.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036045_0015_10080BB029DA89E0"/>
He was left wholly deſtitute of money. His letters of recommendation were gone, and in fact, every thing but what was on his back. Being caſt on a deſolate iſland, it made his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſtill more deſperate. But his comrades, being endowed with a great ſhare of fortitude, ſet out in queſt of inhabitants; and in twenty four hours came to a coffee houſe, where they told their misfortunes and got ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beaumont thought it unneceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for buſineſs of a public nature, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the loſs of his recommendations, but enquired of the landlord for ſome private em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>Sir, replied his hoſt, you do not appear to me like a man brought up to ſuch buſineſs—Your addreſs and converſation ſpeaketh differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beaumont anſwered with a bluſh: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is the mother of invention.</p>
            <p>His hoſt replied: There is a Nobleman three miles diſtant who employs a great number of ſervants, but is ſomething ſingular in his treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards them. He never gives any abuſe; for when one breaks a law, he is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſmiſſed, and the next loweſt is raiſed to his ſtation.</p>
            <p>His regulations I am pleaſed with, ſaid Mr. Beaumont.</p>
            <p>He will be here this evening replied his hoſt.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he appeared &amp; made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſerved him with all the faithfulneſs and ſtability imaginable, and declared, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036045_0016_10080B98092F5D38"/>
when he was cleaning knives, his mind was moſt at eaſe: For when he was not employed, and no kind of buſineſs called his attention, his thoughts were in Boſton, placed with the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt impreſſion on his beloved. And no ſooner had night ſpread her fable curtain, than his mind was filled with anxiety; and often on his bed he would commune with himſelf, ſaying, The limited time of my abſence will ſhortly be expired, and how ſhall I accompliſh my deſign. I muſt return by the time appointed, or break my vow, and looſe the object of may wiſhes—Unleſs ſome future event takes place, my plans are fruſtrated, as the buſineſs I am in at preſent will not add much to my fortune.</p>
            <p>Next morning he aroſe and went about his buſineſs with great compoſure of mind. In the courſe of the day the Nobleman diſmiſſed his body ſervant, for ſome miſdemeanor, and Mr. Beaumont arrived to his ſtation which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſalary to one hundred ſterling per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</p>
            <p>His buſineſs was now to wait on the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man when he rode out, and inſpect the tables, and ſee that every thing was in order; and likewiſe to ride on errands for the Nobleman's daughter (a little Miſs, aged thirteen years) who was then under the care of a writing maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who attended upon her twice a day, to teach her the definitive part of writing.</p>
            <p>One morning his buſineſs led him into her room, and ſeeing her copy book lying on the table, he took up the pen and careleſsly wrote a line under the copy.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, the writing maſter came in,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036045_0017_10080BB26BBA1780"/>
caſt his eye on the paper, and ſays to the lady, did you write that line? No Sir, replied lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Miſs. Who did write it? I do not know, Sir, unleſs it was Mr. Beaumont, (the ſervant) and I'm ſure it could not be him.</p>
            <p>Call him in, ſaid the teacher. He came forth. Did you write that line, Samuel?</p>
            <p>I did, Sir, but I am very ſorry. I came in and catched hold of the pen, and wrote it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly, without a thought of injuring the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any. Pardon me, Sir, for my inſolence.</p>
            <p>You are quite excuſable, replied the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for it far exceeds the copy.</p>
            <p>The little Miſs informed her father of what had taken place. Mr. Beaumont was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately brought before the Nobleman, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined him in the languages and all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate branches of learning, and found him much preferable to himſelf; then turns to Mr. Beaumont, ſaying: You ſhall no longer be my ſervant. It was never predeſtinated by Deity that a man of your abilities ſhould be a ſervant to any man of any rank or ſtation whatever.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beaumont remained ſpeechleſs ſome time—at length replies: I am contented with my ſituation, and am willing to ſerve you until better buſineſs offers.</p>
            <p>The Nobleman anſwers: I have an old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theman with me who ſerves in the capacity of a clerk, and has been in that employment for many years paſt, but has ſolicited me ſtrongly to releaſe him, as he has accumulated property enough, and wiſhes to live a retired life. If you pleaſe, you may have his birth, which will bring you in two hundred ſterling per annum.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:036045_0018_10080B9B2C752250"/>
Mr. Beaumont thanked him kindly, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his offer.</p>
            <p>He remained in that ſituation for ſeveral years, and gave perfect ſatisfaction. But the change of his condition added great luſtre to his beauty, and being a perſon of handſome addreſs and graceful converſation, united with a moſt agreeable diſpoſition, ſoon drew the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Nobleman's daughter.</p>
            <p>As the increaſed in years, her paſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſtrong; but ſhe never made it known, leſt it ſhould prove diſagreeable to her father.</p>
            <p>The young lady was an only daughter, and her mother had been deed a conſiderable time.</p>
            <p>Her affection was not wholly unnoticed by Mr. Beaumont, who could plainly diſcover that ſhe embraced every opportunity to be in his company; but more particularly when her father was abſent. Her paſſion at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo ſtrong that ſhe could no longer conceal it. Taking an opportunity when her father was abſent, ſhe very deliberately divulged her mind to Mr. Beaumont, in full; telling him that ſhe had harbored a fondneſs for him in her breaſt, which ſhe could no longer conceal.</p>
            <p>If you are endowed (ſaid ſhe) with unanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſufficient to eaſe my troubled mind, anſwer me frankly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beaumont ſtood amazed for ſome time, but recovering, anſwers her in the following manner:</p>

their affections ſo low. My fortune is by no means adequate to your's; neither is my ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in life ſo honourable as many of your ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, which you have denied the privilege of a ſecond interview.

               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>The young lady makes this brief reply:</p>
            <p>Sir, as to your birth and breeding, your conduct proves that to be good; and I find by experience, that money never purchaſed love.</p>
            <p>The Nobleman appears, and breaks up the ſcene—She retires to her own apartment.</p>
            <p>They converſed together every opportunity, until the end of the year, which was the ſixth year of his abſence from home.</p>
            <p>The Nobleman then ſolicited him ſtrongly to continue with him another year; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, knowing that the time of fulfilling his former promiſe was near at hand.</p>
            <p>In the time he was preparing to return, the Nobleman was taken ſick, and died; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him death he appointed Mr. Beaumont to ſettle his eſtate, and for the love and good will he owed him, made him a preſent of five thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pounds ſterling.</p>
            <p>During the time he was ſettling this Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's eſtate, the young woman, recovering the troubles, in ſome meaſure which were cauſed by the death of her father, accoſts Mr. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont in the following manner:</p>
            <p>I have made you an offer of my heart and hand, but you never have given me an anſwer. Now I ſee nothing to hinder our being joined in the bands of wedlock. My fortune is all at your command. If you muſt return to your

place of nativity I am willing to bear you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as I cannot live out of your ſight. She could not utter more for the rapidity of tears which flowed from her eyes, and run gently down her roſy cheeks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beaumont for ſome time ſtood motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs—then burſt forth in tears and ſaid, Good Heavens! What ſhall I do? Shall I break my former promiſes? Can I be ſo cruel?</p>
            <p>On hearing of this, Miſs Betſy ſtarts up with an air of wildneſs—What promiſes?</p>
            <p>Mr. Beaumont now gives her a narrative of all the tranſactions at home—with an account of the treatment he received from Mr. Gauze—how Miſs Nancy was confined—and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of returning at the cloſe of that year.</p>
            <p>On hearing of this, ſhe flew to his arms and embraced him, when they both wept bitterly.</p>
            <p>Miſs Nancy now cries out in the following manner: True genuine love never was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by riches; but may heaven reward you for your conſtancy. I have nothing to lay to your charge. You have ever treated me with reſpect and tenderneſs.—As my days here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are of ſhort duration, and the treaſures of this world are as filthy rags, I impart my portion to you, hoping it may in ſome meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure conſtitute your happineſs in this world of trouble and ſorrow, which I hope to leave ſhortly.</p>
            <p>A heart of adamant would have melted to have ſeen theſe unfortunate lovers in ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly a ſituation. But they did not remain ſo long: For in the courſe of three days, Miſs Betſy languiſhed and died. She willed to Mr.

Beaumont, juſt before her death, thirty thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pounds ſterling, and made him executor of her eſtate, which brought him a handſome ſum; beſide, now finding himſelf clear of a ſcene of trouble and difficulty which he was deeply engaged in for upwards of ſix long years.</p>
            <p>He now ſets out to obtain the object of his wiſhes, by returning to his native country—After furniſhing himſelf and his intended ſpouſe with two ſuits of the beſt clothes France could afford, he takes leave of his beloved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaince, and ſets out of his paſſage home.</p>
            <p>When he arrived at port, he found a veſſel bound for Boſton, and ready to ſail in a few days. After ſtrict examination, he found the veſſel belonged to Mr. Gauze, his intended fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law. On his paſſage, he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the captain, who gave a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the tranſactions at home in the time of his abſence. He alſo informed him that Miſs Nancy was courted by captain Sheldrick, who belonged to the Eaſt India company.</p>
            <p>On his arrival he found it to be in fact the caſe; and that the intended marriage was to be celebrated the next day.</p>
            <p>After ſome refreſhment on board, Mr. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont divulges the whole matter to the crew, begging their aſſiſtance, ſaying, I will dreſs myſelf in ſailors' habit, and go with the hands, and inform Mr. Gauze of the veſſel's arrival.
