            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This, This is the <hi>Evil</hi> that <hi>Purſueth Sinners;</hi> This is <hi>the Heritage appointed unto them of God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. How does <hi>Evil purſue Sinners?</hi> We ſhall find ſomething Obſervable in its <hi>Purſuing</hi> of them. The Notion of a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi> in the Caſe, is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll of Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Evil Purſueth Sinners; It argues, that <hi>Evil</hi> does by <hi>Law</hi> belong to <hi>Sinners.</hi> To <hi>purſue Sinners,</hi> is to Proſecute them at Law. <hi>Sinners</hi> have broken the <hi>Law</hi> of God. By the <hi>Law</hi> of God, there is a <hi>Miſery</hi> moſt juſtly belonging unto
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001175_0018_0FB0E1B28A75D370"/>
them. That <hi>Miſery</hi> is the <hi>Evil purſuing of them.</hi> Hence we are told, Joh. 3. 18 <hi>They are Condemned already.</hi> Sinners are obnoxious to <hi>Evil,</hi> by that <hi>Law,</hi> that is alwayes <hi>Holy &amp; Juſt &amp; Good;</hi> by that <hi>Law,</hi> that God will never balk, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Magnify it, &amp; make it Honourable.</hi> How comes Evil to <hi>purſue Sinners?</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sinners are <hi>Condemned</hi> unto Evil, by the <hi>Law</hi> of that God, of whom it is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; Hab. 1. 13. <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil.</hi> There will be a moſt <hi>ſpotleſs Juſtice</hi> in all the <hi>Evil,</hi> that ſhall come upon <hi>Sinners;</hi> They cannot juſtly Complain of any <hi>Evil</hi> that ſhall come upon them: <hi>Why ſhould a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man Complain? A Sinner for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Sin?</hi> Think, O Sinners, Think with your ſelves; <hi>O wretched man that I am; The Law of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God has Condemned me to Dy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. Evil Purſueth Sinners; And what are <hi>Sinners</hi> then, but <hi>Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes,</hi> but <hi>Malefactors! Purſued</hi> Folks are ſuppoſed ſuch. It ſeems, that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have an <hi>Hue-in-Cry</hi> after them! Sinners are bound unto the <hi>Service</hi> of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001175_0019_0FB0E1B4B85422B0"/>
God: They are in moſt indiſpenſable Bonds to be the <hi>Servants</hi> of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. But what? They come to that vile Reſolution; Pſal. 2. 3. <hi>Let us caſt the Cords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from us.</hi> They refuſe to ſerve the Lord; They will ſerve the World, the Fleſh, the Devil; The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is too good a Maſter for them. The <hi>Fugitives</hi> when they leave that Maſter, they fall into Ten Thouſand Iniquities; They turn <hi>Robbers;</hi> They <hi>Rob</hi> the Great God of His Dues; They are <hi>Murderers, Traitors, Rebels;</hi> They break out into open <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the Great King of Heaven and Earth. Tis for theſe things, that the <hi>Hue-in-Cry</hi> is gone out after them, and <hi>Evil</hi> is <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing</hi> of them. We read of ſome, Job. 30. 5. <hi>They Cryed after them, as after a Theef.</hi> Sinner, ſo, Even ſo, art thou <hi>Cried after;</hi> The Deſtroying Judgments of God are <hi>Crying</hi> after thee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Evil Purſueth Sinners; It ſhows, That tho' <hi>Sinners</hi> cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes eſcape <hi>Evil,</hi> yet they <hi>do</hi> for a while <hi>eſcape</hi> it; and they <hi>dream</hi> that they ſhall <hi>alwayes</hi> eſcape it. <hi>Evil</hi> is for a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001175_0020_0FB0E1B64C07D968"/>
while, it ſeems only upon the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi> of Sinners; it has not yet <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them.</hi> We read, Eccl. 8. 11 <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt an Evil work, is not Executed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le Sinners are yet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Purſued</hi> of <hi>Evil,</hi> Oh! the Security of the Silly ones! They fondly and vainly fancy, that <hi>Evil</hi> ſhall never overtake them. A moſt unreaſonable Fancy! <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi> is no <hi>Payment.</hi> Sinners, it muſt be ſaid unto you, as it was ſaid unto them of old; Num. 32. 23. <hi>Behold, ye have ſinned againſt the Lord; &amp; be ſure your ſin will find you out.</hi> Your Sin; that is to ſay, the Puniſhment of your Sin: This is like a <hi>Blood-hound</hi> upon the Scent, ſwiftly purſuing of you; 'Twill come up with you, Be <hi>Sure</hi> of it! Be <hi>Sure</hi> of it! Sometimes a Remarkable <hi>Evil</hi> does <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> the Sinner before he Dies. There are ſome Sins, that ſeldome go unpuniſhed in <hi>this Life.</hi> Groſs <hi>Wrongs</hi> to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, are in <hi>this Life</hi> uſually paid home unto us. <hi>Cheaters</hi> find it ſo; <hi>Robbers</hi> find it ſo; <hi>Oppreſſors</hi> find it ſo; and ſo do <hi>Relatives</hi> that carry it unkindly to one another. And, I wiſh, that People, whoſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001175_0021_0FB0E1B7B53F0310"/>
Converſation is full of <hi>Reproaches,</hi> or <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt other People would conſider of it. <hi>Abuſive</hi> People are not only Chaſtiſed, by ſtrange Accidents, that bring all their baſe Talk to the Ears of the Innocent perſons, whom they have abuſed, but alſo the Hand of God ſo orders it, that they ſhall be overtaken and overwhelmed, with as heavy loads of Obloquy. <hi>Conſider this, O ye Tongues, whom she Fear of God bridles not; &amp; be afraid of</hi> Sinning <hi>as you uſe to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do!</hi> Again, There are atrocious <hi>Crimes,</hi> the <hi>Crimes</hi> which the Bible calls, <hi>The Crying ones;</hi> thoſe <hi>Crimes</hi> do in <hi>this Life</hi> uſually meet with the Vengeance of God. Men that are <hi>Wicked overmuch,</hi> what becomes of them? Oftentimes, they don't <hi>live out half their Dayes;</hi> oftentimes God brands them with marks of His Vengeauce while they <hi>Live.</hi> The <hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves could expect it concerning Barbarous <hi>Murderers,</hi> That Vengeance would not ſuffer them to live. But be ſure, At his <hi>Death,</hi> Then, Then a Sinner ſhall be overtaken with E<hi>vil</hi> unto the uttermoſt. Then will the Sinner feel the fulfilment
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001175_0022_0FB0E1BB648359E0"/>
of that word; Job 27. 22. <hi>God ſhall cast Plagues upon him, &amp; not ſpare; tho' he would ſain flee out of His Hand.</hi> Oh! what would the Sinner then give, that he could <hi>flee</hi> from the dreadful Hand of God! But, Sinner, The threatned Evil is now come, it is now come! There is no Fleeing from it! The Rocks can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide thee; The Mountains cannot cover thee from the Wrath of God; <hi>Tho' they di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Finally. Evil Purſueth Sinners; It is hinted, That it ſhall be a <hi>Retaliating Evil.</hi> A Sinner being one that <hi>purſues Moral</hi> E<hi>vil,</hi> tis but a <hi>Retaliation,</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>purſued of</hi> E<hi>vil:</hi> And there is oftentimes a moſt Notable <hi>Retaliation</hi> in the very Kind of the E<hi>vil.</hi> The hint is further given in the next Clauſe; <hi>To the Righteous, Good ſhall be repaid.</hi>
