            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Chriſtian Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A<hi>S I have often review'd with Wonder, ſo I take Leave on the preſent Occaſion thus publickly to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Gratitude, the ſignal Conduct of Divine Providence in bringing me at firſt among you, while I was in a manner an utter</hi> Stranger <hi>to you all, and when by reaſon of my young Years, and apprehended</hi> Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>for ſo important a Station, I could not entertain the leaſt Expectation of ſuch a Preferment. And the uncommon</hi> Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity <hi>that (as you may remember) attended your Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Call, was what I have thought a very happy Circumſtance of my Settlement, and do often look back upon with equal Pleaſure and Surprize. This indeed was one peculiar Encouragement I had to give up</hi> my own <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were not to fix in the Miniſtry ſo very early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have Reaſon to admire your Candour toward me, while I have been with many Infirmities ſerving in the Goſpel among you: And I deſire to take a thankful Notice of the Favour of God in continuing us together thus long in ſo much of mutual peace and Satiſfaction; now the</hi> 14<hi>th Year</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Feb. 1716, 17. By Vote of the Church I enter'd on ſtated Preaching.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have ſometimes very anxious Thoughts of Heart upon that of the Apoſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. I knew a man in Chriſt above fourteen years ago.—<hi>Happy the Miniſter, happy the Profeſſor, that hath ſuch Aſſurance of his ſaving Union to Chriſt! And happy the People, who have thoſe to teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of God among them, who are vitally united to Chriſt, and</hi> have the Witneſs in themſelves!</p>
            <p>IT <hi>has always been very affecting to me to conſider what</hi> Men of God <hi>they were, in whoſe place I ſucceed. This Church of Chriſt has been diſtinguiſh'd with a Succeſſion of burning and ſhining Lights; Paſtors and Teachers eminent for their Gifts, and no leſs eminent for their Graces and Experience in all the Myſteries of the Divine Life;</hi> Wilſon, Cotton, Norton, Davenport, <hi>&amp;c. Theſe
<pb facs="unknown:003280_0004_0FF03C7C69393CE8"/>
Venerable Fathers were in their Day very much</hi> New-England'<hi>s Strength and Glory; and in each of them this Church enjoy'd a peculiar Treaſure. I have often bluſh'd and been full of Confuſion within my ſelf, from a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of my own comparative Nothingneſs: Yet I hope the Reflection has ſometimes been a Help to me in my Work, to direct and animate my Miniſtrations among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have taken a ſingular Delight in reading the</hi> Lives <hi>of my excellent Predeceſſors; ſo many of which we ſee in Print: have often thought I cou'd deſire no better Patterns to copy after; and made it my Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God, That I might by the Grace of Chriſt be principl'd and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they were; that I might have the like Preſence of Chriſt with me, as they had; that the Work they ſo happily began, might not miſcarry in my hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALAS! <hi>there is among us a viſible</hi> Decline <hi>of Religion in the power and practice of it, and not the ancient Succeſs of Goſpel-Ordinances. Sure I am, It becomes us all, both Miniſters and People, humbly to inquire into the Grounds and Cauſes hereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I readily take to my ſelf</hi> my <hi>part of the Blame, as being ſadly ſenſible of many Defects in me, with regard both to thoſe Abilities and Graces, which form the Character, and direct the wiſe and holy Management, that is neceſſary in thoſe that wou'd by their Example, as well as Preaching, win Souls to Chriſt, and</hi> lead the Way <hi>in ſeeking the Kingdom of Heaven. Verily the beſt of us all need mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Allowances, before we can claim the Character and Reward of good and faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt. O for the Application of the Blood of Sprinkling, that I may be made accepted in the</hi> BELOVED! <hi>And for the Supply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, that I may watch in all things and make full Proof of my Miniſtry! I earneſtly ask the Help of your fervent Prayers for me (as alſo for my worthy Brother and Collegue) that the Sins of my Miniſtry may be done away by the Blood of Chriſt, and that the Succeſs of it may be ſecured by his powerful Bleſſing: that Chriſt our Maſter may be with us continually, in the Study and in the Pulpit, and in all our Converſation, Viſits, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Labours among you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>we beſeech you (Brethren) in the fear of God to conſider what Defects there are on</hi> your <hi>part, that may be a further Obſtruction to the Succeſs of the Goſpel in this once flouriſhing Church. "Let your Miniſters have their
<pb facs="unknown:003280_0005_0FF03C7E28F90768"/>
juſt Share of Cenſure: Nevertheleſs we are perſuaded, you do not think the whole Blame lies at our Doors. Even the</hi> SON <hi>of</hi> GOD <hi>himſelf, of whom it was witneſſed, That</hi> never man ſpake <hi>or liv'd</hi> like him; <hi>yet meets with little Succeſs, and finds himſelf conſtrained to throw back Men's juſt Condemnation on their own Heads,</hi> Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life".</p>
            <p>BE <hi>much in ſerious Self-Examination, to know what on your part hinders the Goſpel; and be much in Prayer, and in the Uſe of all proper Methods, that the Power of Godlineſs may be revived among us. Let Goſpel-Truths, Goſpel Order, and Goſpel-Worſhip be precious in your Eyes. Stand faſt in the Liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made you free: and keep the Ordinances as they have been delivered to you, in their primitive Purity, without ſuffering any Alloy of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inventions. If ſome from an Antichriſtian Spirit wou'd impoſe upon you in Matters of Religion, remember theſe are ſacred to God and Conſcience; and</hi> be not the Servants of Men. <hi>As we are a ſpiritual Corporation, let us take Care to exerciſe and reverence the holy Diſcipline that Chriſt hath inſtituted; Charitable to receive all viſible Saints, cautious to admit only ſuch, and faithful to expel ſcandalous Sinners from our Communion. Purge out the old Leaven, that ye may be a new Lump. O let the Duty of Brotherly Admonition, ſo much neglected in this Day of Degeneracy, be reſtored to a ſerious and univerſal Practice; and yet let none, under a ſpecious pretence of lamenting others Sins, act the</hi> Buſy-Body, <hi>as the manner of ſome is, whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things which they ought not, to the prejudice of their Neighbours Reputation, the great Hurt of Religion, and the manifeſt Forfeiture of all Pretenſions to a Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Brotherly Kindneſs. Watch over one another, for good, and not Evil. Provoke one another to Love and good Works. Exhort one another daily, left any of you be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the Deceitfulneſs of Sin. Be not Partakers of other Men's Sins: but by bearing due Teſtimony againſt them, deliver your own Souls. Such as are Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, O take a religious Care of the Youth committed to your Charge: And Children, ſee that you obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT'<hi>s a day abounding with Temptations, to our young People in ſpecial, to deſert the Intereſt of pure Religion, and betray the Cauſe of God, in which our Forefathers were engag'd. O let us do all we can to fortify and fix
<pb facs="unknown:003280_0006_0FF03C800A552058"/>
them, and to recover ſuch as are fallen from their Stedfaſtneſs. What greater Joy than to ſee our Children walking in the Truth! Let us labour their early Converſion to God, and uſe all poſſible Means to form them to Virtue, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and diſpoſe them to be active Bleſſings to their Generation. And thou</hi> Solomon, <hi>my Son, know thou the God of thy Father, &amp; ſerve him with a perfect Heart &amp; with a willing Mind: for the Lord ſearcheth all Hearts. If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him, tremble leſt be caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN <hi>a word, let us glorify God for his ſignal Appearances in the days of our Forefathers; and conſider them as Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations on us, who reap the happy fruits thereof, to adhere with Steadineſs and Zeal to the ſpiritual and exalted</hi> Ends <hi>of that great Undertaking, which brought them over to</hi> America. <hi>Let us always maintain a peculiar Eſteem for the Memory of our pious Progenitors, and train up our Children in the ſame Veneration: be often telling them of the excellent Character and Spirit of our Forefathers, their Errand into this Wilderneſs, the Covenant wherein they've bound their Poſterity to the Lord, and their many ardent Prayers for ſucceeding Generations. As we are building on the Foundations they have laid for us, and rejoycing in many deſirable Reſults of their Pains and Prayers, ſurely it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us never to mention their Names but with Diſtinctions of Reſpect, as the Fathers of</hi> New-England. <hi>And let us ſee to it that we act and behave worthily of our noble Deſcent: Elſe this will turn for a Teſtimony againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>STAND <hi>ye in the Ways, and ſee, and ask for the old 'Paths, the good Way, and walk therein: and ye ſhall find Reſt for your Souls Remember them that have had the Rule over you, who have ſpoken to you the good Word of God. And be ye Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi> promote theſe excellent Purpoſes, is my Aim in the following Diſcourſe: which I now put into your Hand for your ſerious Peruſal, and commend to the Bleſſing of</hi> GOD <hi>for the deſired Succeſs.

was what the <hi>Jews</hi> had always been accuſtom'd to: and our Lord in the uſe of this Method condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Capacity and Genius of the People of that day. His Parables are all the moſt wiſely choſen, to ſerve their reſpective purpoſes. 'Tis both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and profitable to meditate upon them.</p>
            <p>THE ſcope of this Parable of the <hi>Grain of Muſtard-Seed</hi> is to ſhew how the Goſpel-Church (to which the Stile of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is here and often elſewhere given) ſhould from very low and ſmall Beginnings, gradually increaſe and grow, and at length riſe up to an admirable Degree of Strength, Extent and Glory.</p>

            <p>Now as it has fallen out in the Courſe of our publick reading the Scriptures, that ſo ſutable a Text ſhou'd occur for the preſent Occaſion, I have been ready to interpret this as an Intimation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to me, to take ſome ſpecial Notice of the remarkable Period before us, and lead you into ſome Meditations adapted thereto. The Language of Heaven to us at this day ſeems to be as in Iſa. 51. 1, 2. <hi>Hearken to me, ye that follow after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ye that ſeek the Lord: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you; for I called him alone, and bleſſed him, and increaſed him.</hi> And when I reflect ſeriouſly on the Wonder-working Providence of God, which planted our <hi>Zion</hi> and has eſtabliſh'd it hitherto, I have thought She might very fitly take up the Language of Pſal. 40th.—<hi>He brought me
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003280_0010_0FF03C8866BA2F40"/>
up out of an horrible Pit, and ſet my Feet upon a Rock: and he hath put a new Song in my Mouth.—Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful Works which thou haſt done, and thy Thoughts to us-ward, they cannot be reckoned up in Order unto thee; if I would declare and ſpeak of them, they are more than can be number'd.</hi> A Train of marvellous Operations of Divine Power and Grace prepar'd the Way to the Plantation of the Kingdom of GOD in this place; and a Succeſſion of illuſtrious Events attended the Progreſs thereof. <hi>O ſing unto the Lord a new Song: He hath made known his ſalvation; his Righteouſneſs hath he openly ſhewed in the ſight of the Heathen: all the Ends of the Earth have ſeen the Salvation of our GOD. One Generation ſhall praiſe thy Works to another: I will ſpeak of the Glory of thy Kingdom, and declare thy loving kindneſs, O God, in the midſt of thy Temple. Thy Saints ſhall bleſs thee; they ſhall abundantly utter the Memory of thy great Goodneſs, and ſing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs. My Mouth ſhall ſpeak the Praiſe of the Lord: and let all Fleſh bleſs his holy Name for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not pretend to critically trace the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Improvement of this Work of GOD in all its ſeveral ſteps; for that were to write a Volume of Hiſtory: But ſhall only give you the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hints, proper to have place in a Sermon, to the End I may excite your Gratitude and encourage your Confidence toward GOD, the Hope of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>OUR Text points out the Method I propoſe to my ſelf in treating this Subject, which is—</p>
            <p n="1">1. To call your Thoughts back to the <hi>Original</hi> of this religious Settlement, and ſhew the <hi>Smallneſs</hi> of our Beginning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider the <hi>Means</hi> of its Progreſs and Eſtabliſhment.</p>

LIKE a Grain of <hi>Muſtard-Seed,</hi> it made but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and unpromiſing Figure at firſt: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it ſtrangely came on, improv'd &amp; flouriſh'd, until at length it became as a <hi>Tree,</hi> in whoſe extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Branches the Fowl of the Air ſeek for Shade and Repoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I ſhall ſay ſomething as to the Riſe and</hi> Occaſion <hi>of this religious Settlement, and make ſome remarks on the ſmallneſs of our Beginning.</hi>

            <p>ABOUT two hundred Years ſince, began the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Reformation;</hi> when after a long Night of Popiſh Darkneſs GOD cauſed the Light of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel to break forth in many parts of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian World, overſpread with thick Clouds of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Hereſy, and falſe Worſhip. Several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, mov'd by the Spirit of GOD, nobly attempted to throw off the yoke of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and deliver themſelves from the Superſtitions and Tyrannies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hierarchy.</p>
            <p>BY the grace of GOD ſuch Proſperity attended thoſe glorious Attempts, that in a few years the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation made its progreſs thro' a great part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> About the year 1526 ſeveral States in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> that were zealous for the reforming Intereſt, united in a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt the Decrees of a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Diet; and upon that account the Reformers have ever ſince gone under the Name of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>

            <p>THE caſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church had ſomething very peculiar in it. For our firſt Reformers were acted by Principles vaſtly different.</p>
            <p>ONE Set of Men were govern'd by <hi>Political Views</hi> &amp; ſiniſter Conſiderations. Many were Papiſts in <hi>Diſguiſe,</hi> "who (as one expreſſes it<note n="*" place="bottom">Pref. to Abridgment of Bp. <hi>Burnet'</hi>s 3d. Vol. <hi>Miſt. Reformation</hi>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003280_0013_0FF03C8F964ED0C0"/>
for the continuance of many of thoſe ancient Rites &amp; Cuſtoms, they were bred up in the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of: they hoped by this to recommend themſelves to the eſteem of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and thought it a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Method to make an eaſy Conqueſt of them, to remove their Prejudices, and bring over Multitudes of them to a Compliance with the Reformation.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, (as an <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> writer obſerves<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Burnet,</hi> ubi ſupra</note>) "Many at that day were for complying with the Laws, &amp; bearing with ſeveral things which they did not approve of, in hopes of getting them afterwards amended.—Influenc'd by falſe Notions of Policy, this Circumſtance of Affairs (he adds) kept them from reforming many things which they <hi>dislik'd,</hi> and alſo (no doubt) from examining more thro'ly into ſeveral other things"—</p>
            <p>'TIS a very good Paragraph that follows, which I beg leave to digreſs ſo far as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to you, from the ſame Hand,—"Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (ſays he) <hi>our</hi> Reformation, as happy as we are in what we enjoy of it, was never yet perfected; nor ever can be till we all come openly to <hi>acknowledge,</hi> and to <hi>act</hi> conſiſtently with, that <hi>Principle,</hi> which was the only Ground upon which the Reformation did, or could, ſtand; <abbr>

I come now to obſerve, There was in the very Infancy of the Reformation<note n="†" place="bottom">"In an ancient Book call'd <hi>The Regiſter of memorable Matters touching Reformation</hi> (mention'd by Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his <hi>Way of Congregational Churches cleared</hi>) there is a Story of <hi>an hundred</hi> Perſons, who refuſed the common Liturgy, and the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions attending thereunto, and uſed Prayers and Preachings &amp;.

They aſſerted the Sovereignty of the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the ſole Lord of Conſcience; and took his written Word for the only Canon of their Faith and Practice.</p>
            <p>THEY were Enemies to Magnificence and Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in Worſhip, &amp; to coercive Power &amp; Tyranny in Diſcipline; as things the Scriptures were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſtrangers to. "They remembred how theſe things had miniſter'd to the Corruptions, the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and Enormities of Popery: and they tho't it beſt, in conformity to the laudable Example of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who brake in pieces the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> (tho' of divine Appointment) when the People <hi>abus'd</hi> it to Idolatry, to lay aſide human Inventions which had been ſo abus'd". They thought it the Wiſdom of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> their Duty and Safety, to reduce every Circumſtance of Diſcipline &amp; Worſhip
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003280_0015_0FF03C9437105428"/>
as nigh as poſſible to their profeſs'd <hi>Rule;</hi> to avoid all Reſemblances of <hi>Popery</hi> as much as might be, and ſo ſettle the wideſt Diſtance between <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Papal</hi> Churches; which wou'd be a happy Method to clog any future attempts of a Return to <hi>Romiſh</hi> Fopperies and Uſurpations.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, in the beginning of the Reign of the Popiſh Queen <hi>Mary</hi> (ſo irrecoverably devoted to that cruel Church, which has been often drunk with the Blood of the Saintſ) when they foreſaw a furious ſtorm of Perſecution coming on, many of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers fled abroad for Safety, and having Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to obſerve the Worſhip and Diſcipline of the <hi>foreign</hi> Proteſtant Churches, they were (not a few of them) <hi>pleas'd</hi> with their Practice; who, they thought, had gone the furtheſt in reviving of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtianity, and reſtoring the Order of the Goſpel. And hence, after their Return home, at the happy Acceſſion of the Proteſtant Queen ELISA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, which made another Revolution in Religion, and gave new Life to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe, thoſe Men retaining a delightful Remembrance of what they had ſeen in the reform'd Churches abroad, &amp; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more ſubſervient to the Intereſt of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, to ſtudy a Harmony with the foreign Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, in Worſhip &amp; Diſcipline, as well as in Doctrine, than to Symbolize with their avow'd Adverſaries, the idolatrous Papiſts; they became zealous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders for a more perfect Reformation in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> advancing and urging thoſe three great Principles, The Limitation of <hi>Church Power</hi> to Matters of <hi>Divine Commandment,</hi> the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of <hi>Biſhops</hi> to a <hi>particular</hi> Congregation, and the Limitation of <hi>Church-Fellowſhip</hi> to viſible <hi>Saints.</hi> They were for having the Rule of Chriſtianity to be the Rule of Conformity. This is the Party, who were at firſt diſtinguiſh'd by the Name of <hi>Puritans;</hi> afterwards by that of <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> or <hi>Diſciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>

and now uſually of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> or <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> the Glory of the Engliſh Reformation.</p>
            <p>THESE good Men, tho' diſſatiſfy'd at the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Conſtitution of things, yet conſidering the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Times, in the beginning, labour'd to ſuppreſs their Reſentments and Complaints as much as poſſible for the preſent, and tarry'd in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the eſtabliſh'd Church many of them; waiting for better Days, and encouraging a Hope that the Reformation might proceed in due time unto greater Purity. But (as One obſerves<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> in his <hi>Eleutheria,</hi> or Hiſtory of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and of Nonconformity.</note>) they that found their ſecular Intereſts accommodated in that Conſtitution, employ'd the Power which they had in their hands, not only to retard the progreſs of the Reformation, but even with innumerable Vexations to haraſs ſuch as were the moſt zealous Friends unto it; to <hi>cenſure, fine, ſilence, deprive,</hi> and <hi>impriſon</hi> thoſe that were diſſatiſfy'd and cou'd not conform, being (as is moſt remarkable) Men for the moſt part <hi>of the ſame Spirit and Principle</hi> with thoſe Proteſtants, who ſuffer'd under the Prelates in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Day. For a conſiderable time theſe perſecuted Puritans remain'd very much in Privacy under their Sufferings, waiting ſtill for more of Reformation, or for more of Liberty and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to conſcientious Diſſenters. But after ſome years of fruitleſs Expectation, Severities being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd upon them, and the increaſing Tyranny of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts deſtroying all Hope of a religious Pacification, it drove many to a more open <hi>Separation</hi> from the Things that were by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd.</p>

            <p>IN like manner our Forefathers were a deſpis'd Handful of Men; look'd upon with Contempt by proud and haughty Scorners; and at the ſame time when the Adverſary ſaid, <hi>Let us cauſe the Work to ceaſe,</hi> the Builders themſelves almoſt ſinking under the weight of many Diſcouragements, were ready to ſay, E'en let it fall, we are not able to go thorow with it. They were in a Wilderneſs-Condition; ſeeing nothing round them but uncultivated Wilds and ſavage Creatures; diſtant a thouſand Leagues from their native Country, capable of being but little ſerv'd by foreign Amities, and for a while without any Vicinity of chriſtian habitation among themſelves; enduring various Hardſhips, Wants and Straights; meeting with ſore Loſſes, grievous Sickneſſes, many Deaths, and lamentable Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome that ſeemed to be Pillars in the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>INNUMERABLE Evils compaſſed them about: They were in perils on every ſide, in perils of Robbers, in perils by their own Countrymen, in perils of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003280_0020_0FF03CA0A80BDC90"/>
Heathen, in perils by falſe Brethren, in perils in the Sea, and in perils in the Wilderneſs: in Wearineſs and Painfulneſs, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirſt, in Faſtings often, in Cold &amp; Nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>THEY dearly purchas'd (with many Tears, Prayers, Mortifications &amp; Self-denialſ) thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Goſpel-Privileges and religious Liberties, which too many among us at this day are ſo ready to make light of, and the <hi>Royal Charter</hi> for which was the grand Inducement to our Forefathers, to come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into this Wilderneſs and plant the ſame at their own Charge. They did not aim at a worldly, but ſpiritual Intereſt: Nor had they any temporal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives to bring them hither. They cou'd not come (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old into <hi>Canaan</hi>) with hopes to enter into other Men's Labours and build on Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations already laid. No! They came expecting, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities and Houſes prepar'd for their Reception, nor Gardens, Fields, and Orchards for their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment: but a great and terrible Wilderneſs, a Land of Deſerts, and of Pits, and of the ſhadow of Death. Here they expected they muſt (like the Builders of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) work with one hand, and hold a Weapon in the other; and looked to get their Bread not only with the Sweat of their Brows, but even with the Peril of their Lives. And it was not without indefatigable Application, much La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and great Expence, that they ſubdu'd this deſert Land, for a Dwelling place and Inheritance.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed now</p>
            <p>II. <hi>To make ſome Reflections on the</hi> Growth <hi>and</hi> Progreſs <hi>of this religious Settlement, and the</hi> Means <hi>thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE little inconſiderable Seed, ſown in this Place, quickly took Root, ſprung up, and grew, increas'd and flouriſh'd, in an admirable and almoſt unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampl'd manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003280_0021_0FF03CA244C71560"/>
THE <hi>Country</hi> flouriſh'd, under the Protection of the Royal Charter, a mild and equal Adminiſtration of civil Government, and the Smiles of Heaven, very remarkably; that ſcarce any Hiſtory affords a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Town</hi> filled very faſt with People, and waxed rich, and made an eminent Figure among the Tribes of our Iſrael. A waſte howling Wilderneſs became a pleaſant Habitation, like the Garden of God, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfy'd with Favour, and full with the Bleſſing of the Lord.</p>
            <p>ALSO the <hi>Church</hi> here had added to it daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; Multitudes, both Men and Women. As it is ſaid, Act. 6. 7. <hi>The Word of God increaſed, and the Number of the Diſciples mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>greatly.</hi> And as it is ſaid of the Church at <hi>Rome</hi> in its firſt days, Rom. 1. 8. <hi>Their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole World.</hi> In this Reſpect our Land might once be called the Glory of all Lands; this Town, the golden City, and this Church a fruitful Field, which the Lord hath bleſſed. Glorious Things have been ſpoken of thee, O City of GOD, Beautiful for Situation, the Joy of the whole Earth, and Heaven's Delight, as <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>AND now if the REASONS of their Proſperity and Growth be inquir'd into, it may be ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE muſt reſolve all into the gracious <hi>Preſence</hi> of CHRIST with them, as the <hi>principal</hi> Cauſe, the fundamental Ground.</p>
            <p>THE Preſence of Chriſt with our Forefathers was the Fountain of all their <hi>temporal</hi> Proſperity, Safety and Increaſe. It is remarkable, that ſeveral repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Attempts for the Settlement of an Engliſh Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Bay of <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> upon <hi>worldly</hi> Views, prov'd abortive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' undertaken by Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of conſiderable Powers &amp; Eſtates; attended

with a multitude of Servants: <q>The Difficulties of a Wilderneſs were too hard for them; they met with ſuch croſs Providences, as did quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage; and at laſt diſſipate them.</q>

The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt therefore was concern'd in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their Undertaking, and engag'd his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preſence to diſtinguiſh them.

They found here a ſure Refuge and a Reſting place: and had a Table prepared before them in the preſence of their Enemies. They experienc'd the Fulfilling of that Word, Job 8. 6, 7. <hi>If thou wouldſt ſeek unto God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and make thy ſupplication to the Almighty; If thou wert pure and upright; ſurely now he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs proſperous.</hi> The <hi>Errand</hi> of our Forefathers into a waſte Wilderneſs was not to ſeek this World's Good, but to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs: Nevertheleſs they by the Bounty of Providence receiv'd an Increaſe of earthly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, as additional Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>GOD had Compaſſion on them for his Covenant's ſake, and permitted not the Sword of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to devour, or Cold and Hunger to deſtroy them, or fatal Sickneſs to make the Land deſolate.

Appearance<note n="‖" place="bottom">'Twas a wonderful Providence of GOD particularly that <hi>reſtrain'd</hi> the Fury of the <hi>Heathen</hi> in our firſt Times. "It is to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, (ſays one of our Hiſtorianſ) that the Church in <hi>Plimouth</hi> ſhou'd be preſerv'd, when other Engliſh Plantations cou'd not ſubſiſt in this Country, but either the Indians or the Lord's own Hand brought them to a ſudden End from time to time. But GOD, who ſaw that they deſigned ſomething better than the World, in their planting here, watched over them.—"Some of the ancient Planters have told us, that the Indians being poſſeſſed with fears leſt the Engliſh ſhou'd in time take their Country from them, did early conſpire to deſtroy them: And the ſmall handful of Chriſtians then in <hi>Salem</hi> (lately arriv'd) were alarm'd with the Report of no leſs than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand barbarous Natives, coming to cut them off, and that upon a Lord's-Day; whereupon they diſcharged ſeveral great Guns, loaden with ſmall Shot, which made ſuch a terrible Rattling among the Trees afar off, that the amazed Indians return'd, without putting their bloody Deſign in Execution.—Dr. <hi>I. Mather,</hi> ubi ſupra.</note>. In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them: in his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carry'd them all the days of old. The Righteous ſaw it and rejoyced: and all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſtopped her Mouth, or every Curſe was turn'd into a Bleſſing: the Wrath of Man praiſed him; and the Remainder thereof he did reſtrain.</p>
            <p>THE Beauty of the Lord our GOD was upon his People, and he eſtabliſhed the Work of their Hands. He inſtructed the Huſbandman to Diſcretion, and ſatiſfy'd the Earth with the fruit of his Works: Cauſing the Graſs to grow for the Cattel, and Herb for the Service of Man, furniſhing Seed to the Sower and Bread to the Eater.</p>
            <p>HE bleſſed them alſo in the City, as well as Field. <hi>Boſton,</hi> tho' originally a Plantation for Religion, not Trade, yet hath been a proſperous Town. GOD has been pleas'd to ſmile on our Merchandize and Navigation, Trade and Buſineſs, in years paſt; ſo that <hi>Zabulon</hi> rejoyced in his goings forth, as well as <hi>Iſſachar</hi> in his Tents.</p>

WHOSO is wiſe and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the <hi>Lovingkindneſs of the Lord</hi> in a very remarkable Inſtance. The Preſence of GOD with our Fathers was their Strength and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and the Source of all their Victories, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and external Tranquillity and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>WE may ſing very properly on this Occaſion in the Language of Pſal. 107. <hi>O give Thanks unto the Lord: for he is good.

They wandred in the wilderneſs in a ſolitary way, they found no city to dwell in. Hungry &amp; thirſty, their ſoul fainted in them. Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their diſtreſſes. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works to the children of men!</hi> And ſo in the Language of Pſal. 105.—<hi>Glory in his holy Name, O ye Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>his Servant, ye Children of</hi> Jacob <hi>his Choſen When they were but a few men in number, yea a very few &amp; Strangers; when they went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdom to another People, He ſuffer'd no man to do them wrong; yea, he reproved Kings for their ſakes.

He ſent</hi> Moſes <hi>his Servant, and</hi> Aaron <hi>whom he had choſen,</hi> to lead them forth by a right way: <hi>and gave them the Lands of the Heathen, that they might obſerve his Statutes and keep his Laws,</hi> pure and intire, without the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of human Mixtures, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi>

BUT to proceed,—</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The <hi>Preſence</hi> of Chriſt with our Fathers in this Land was the Fountain of all their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> Happineſs and Excellence. It was a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effuſion of the HOLY SPIRIT, that turn'd this Wilderneſs into a fruitful Field, and gave it a Glory above that of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and above the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>Carmel</hi> and <hi>Sharon.</hi> He appointed it for a Fold of Flocks; and here as the Lord their Shepherd, he cauſed them to lie down in green Paſtures, reſtored their Souls, and led them in the Paths of Righteouſneſs for his Name's ſake. 'Twas the Preſence of the Spirit of Chriſt with them, in their Families, Courts, Schools, and Churches, that ſo gloriouſly ſucceeded the Means for increaſing of Knowledge, and promoting of Order, Peace, Juſtice, Sobriety, and Religion. Then that word was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Pſal. 72. 6, 7. <hi>He ſhall come down like Rain upon the mowen Graſs, as Showres that water the Ground—There ſhall be a handful of Corn in the Earth upon the top of the Mountains, the fruit thereof ſhall ſhake like</hi> Lebanon, <hi>and they of the City ſhall flouriſh like Graſs of the Field.</hi> The influxive Preſence of Chriſt gave an admirable Energy to the Seed of the Goſpel here ſown; that an handful of it produc'd a mighty Harveſt to the Glory of Chriſt. 'Twas the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit;</hi> intirely owing to his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Influences: without whoſe powerful Bleſſing all human Inſtruments and ſecond Cauſes have no Significance.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' all their Proſperity is to be reſolv'd ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately into the Power of the Lord preſent with them: Yet it may be obſerv'd,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE were <hi>ſubordinate</hi> Cauſes, <hi>ſecondary</hi> Grounds and Reaſons, which in their place &amp; order challenge ſome Regard with us.</p>
            <p>IT might be premis'd here, The Flouriſhing of Religion among our Fathers had a powerful Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003280_0027_0FF03CB2D08C5400"/>
as the beſt <hi>natural</hi> Means, to promote their univerſal Proſperity, Peace, and external Glory. For as the Wiſe Man obſerves, Prov. 14. <hi>The Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life:—Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation.</hi>—And let me ſpeak freely, without offence to any, The firſt Beginners of this Plantation, as to the Body of them, were an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Set of real and living Chriſtians, who felt the power of vital Religion in their Hearts; and not ſuch as deſir'd only to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>DOUBTLESS indeed they had a Mixture of <hi>falſe</hi> Profeſſors among them: but theſe being aw'd by the prevailing Example of ſerious Godlineſs and the common Zeal againſt Sin, were generally careful to preſerve an Appearance of Religion in their Lives; ſo that in the firſt days of <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> all Iniquity was forc'd to hide its head: it fled the open Light, it ſought for Shelter in Darkneſs, and lurk'd privily in ſecret places: while Virtue was triumphant, and Religion reign'd every where, in the Converſation, Language and Actions of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality.—It muſt further be obſerv'd, as to the worthieſt of our Fathers, they were <hi>but Men;</hi> in a State of Imperfection; and therefore ſubject to Temptations and ſinful Infirmities: And <hi>ſome</hi> in our beſt times might be of too rigid and ſevere a Temper, have leſs Candour and more Heat with relation to certain Modalities and minute points of Church-Order, than became them; and as one might be of too levelling Principles, ſo another of too cloſe and narrow a Spirit, and not liberally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough diſpos'd towards the Servants of the Publick. <hi>Some</hi> I ſay, among the firſt and beſt Generation of this People, I readily concede, might be deficient and reprovable on ſuch heads as theſe: Yet even <hi>they</hi> were in general Men of an excellent Spirit, and in other regards appear'd with ſhining Characters of the Divine Image upon them. But many otherſ

there were, who poſſeſſed their Graces and Virtues, without thoſe their Diſtemper'd Frames.</p>
            <p>THERE were among them many Plants of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, Trees of Righteouſneſs, ſome of the choiceſt in the whole Garden of Chriſt: and their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation from <hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>New-England</hi> did but add to their Beauty, Verdure and Refinement. They flouriſh'd in this Soil, and multiply'd and brought forth abundantly the Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the Praiſe of GOD. Here the glorious <hi>Jeſus</hi> (and GOD in him) had the ſincereſt Honours, the pureſt Love and moſt faithful Obedience paid to him:—which engag'd his <hi>Covenant-Preſence,</hi> and drew down his Bleſſing on this People.</p>
            <p>AND then the excellent Virtues, which in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing State of Religion, were continually and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally in Practice, contributed by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and powerful Influence (<hi>in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>) to the good Regulation of all kinds of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, to the Happineſs of Converſation, to the Security and Succeſs of Commerce, and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally proſperous State of Externals. By their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Sobriety, Temperance, Mortification and Self-denial, Juſtice, Integrity, and the like, they took a moſt effectual Method to ſecure the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſocial Life, and prevented abundance of ſuch Miſchiefs and Diſorders, as are the natural Reſults of thoſe Vices, which have been the Ruine of many a People.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be inquir'd,</p>
            <p>WHAT <hi>were the peculiar inſtrumental</hi> Cauſes, <hi>and more immediate</hi> Reaſons <hi>and</hi> Occaſions <hi>of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Flouriſhing of Religion in that day?</hi> What the <hi>Means</hi> under GOD, the <hi>ſpecial</hi> Means?</p>
            <p>As to the Goſpel, the great Inſtrument of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that's in it ſelf the ſame at all times, and the Power and Grace of Chriſt in themſelves the ſame.

We have juſt Ground then to think there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Men and the Circumſtances of that Age or Generation, which might have ſome Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality, and conduce as a Means, to the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Succeſs of the Goſpel, and Flouriſhing of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity among them.</p>
            <p>I will give you my Thoughts under a few diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct heads. Let it be conſider'd,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>initial Generation of</hi> New-England <hi>was very much a</hi> Select <hi>&amp; a</hi> Puritanical <hi>People, in the proper ſenſe of the Word.</hi> They were not (as to the Body of them) a promiſcuous and heterogeneous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage: but in general of an uniform Character, agreeing in the moſt excellent Qualities, Principles and Tempers; Chriſtians very much of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Stamp. As one of our Worthies of the ſecond Generation<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Stoughton</hi> in his Election-Sermon.</note> has aptly expreſſed it, "GOD <hi>ſifted</hi> a whole Nation that he might ſend a <hi>choice Grain</hi> over into this Wilderneſs":—Seeking a godly Seed to ſerve him, which ſhould be counted before him for a Generation, even a Generation of his Praiſe.</p>
            <p>IT was as little of a mixed Generation, in regard of their moral Character and religious Profeſſion, that came over firſt to <hi>New-England,</hi> as perhaps was ever known in the Earth. We read, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went up out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſuch Pomp &amp; Glory, there went a <hi>mixt Multitude</hi> with them, who were a Snare and Diſgrace to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and by a profane and vicious Example ſpred Infection among them. But now the firſt Generation of this People were very much a <hi>choſen</hi> Generation: collected from a Variety of Places, and by a ſtrange Conduct of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence agreeing in the ſame Enterprize, to form a Plantation for Religion in this diſtant Part of the World, where they might worſhip GOD according
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003280_0030_0FF03CB9ADF7B340"/>
to the Light of their own Conſciences, without the depraving Intermixture of human Inventions, and without Hazard of Perſecution from the Bigots for papiſtical Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>THE Genius or Spirit of the Age was ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed the Generality to this ſort of Men, I mean the <hi>Puritans,</hi> who were deſpiſed as hypocritical or ignorant Preciſians; like the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>a Sect every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering like things of their own Countrymen, even as they did of the</hi> Jews. And then the Remoteneſs of theſe Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Shores, the Dangers of the Voyage, the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a Settlement in an hideous Waſte, and the former Defeat of ſeveral Eſſays for a Plantation here; theſe were Conſiderations that tended to ſtrike Terror upon the <hi>Worldly minded;</hi> inſomuch that few Men of that Complexion had Spirit enough to joyn in ſo arduous and expenceful an Adventure. Few had the Heart and the Courage to leave their native Land, and pleaſant Habitations, Friends and Relatives, and exchange them for the Society of Strangers, and for Hardſhips, Straights &amp; Diſtreſſes in a foreign rude and wild Country; but thoſe who felt the power of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which worketh by Love, which over cometh the World, and is the Evidence of Things not ſeen, the Subſtance of Things hoped for.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THERE being a Royal Patent for the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets</hi> Government, many out of <hi>England</hi> flocked into this Country almoſt every year, chiefly on the Account of <hi>Religion.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now being ſuch a ſelect and unmix'd Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this was one Reaſon of the extraordinary Flouriſhing and bright Appearance of Religion in that day. It was in the general a ſhining Collection of ſincere Profeſſors; who enliven'd and animated one another, in following after Holineſs, by the reciprocal Influences of an alluring Example.</p>
            <p>LET it further be obſerv'd,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY <hi>were, for the Generality, ſuch as had been trained up in the School of</hi> Patience.</p>
            <p>THE Body of the firſt Comers were Men in their middle age or declining days; who had been inured to Sufferings for Righteouſneſs-ſake: being among thoſe Puritan Reformers, who had for many years been witneſſing againſt the Relicts of Popiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions in Proteſtant Worſhip, and had been perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for their Zeal in the Cauſe of a further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my Youth, might</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now their Afflictions being ſanctify'd to 'em, they ſerv'd to their Eſtabliſhment and Growth in Grace: which made them the more meet and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to conflict with the Difficulties of this new Settlement, to encounter Oppoſitions, and triumph over Diſcouragements. They learnt Obedience by the things which they had ſuffer'd; were purify'd in the Furnace of Affliction, and came forth as Gold out of the Fire refin'd. They were not like him in the Parable of the <hi>Sower,</hi> that receiv'd Seed into
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003280_0032_0FF03CBE2B250370"/>
               <hi>ſtony</hi> places; who heareth the Word and entertains it with Joy, yet <hi>hath he not Root</hi> in himſelf, and therefore continues <hi>but a while;</hi> for when <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Perſecution</hi> ariſeth becauſe of the Word, by and by he is <hi>offended,</hi> diſcouraged and falls away. No, but they were like him, that received Seed into <hi>good</hi> Ground, which brought forth Fruit <hi>to Perfection.</hi> They were ſomething in the Apoſtle's Caſe, who had long been ſerving the Lord, with many Tears, and Temptations, which befel him by the laying in wait of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Trial of their Faith (like hiſ) wrought Patience: ſo that altho' Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions awaited them continually, yet none of theſe things moved them, neither counted they their Life dear unto them, if ſo be they might finiſh their Courſe with Joy, and the Work which GOD had committed to them. They ſtagger'd not at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thro' Unbelief, but in ſome ſort like <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, were ſtrong in Faith, giving Glory to GOD. Tho' in ſome days of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they might ſeem almoſt <hi>ſhaken in Mind,</hi> and ready to give up their Undertaking as deſperate: yet they were enabled to overcome at the laſt, and their <hi>Faith failed not.</hi> They confeſſed they were Pilgrims and Strangers upon Earth; had a Spirit in ſome ſingular meaſure wean'd from this vain World by the Afflictions and Trials they had met with; and looked for a City to come, that hath Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whoſe Maker and Builder is GOD. Hence laying aſide every Weight, they cou'd run with Patience the Race ſet before them.</p>
            <p>HAVING <hi>receiv'd the Word in much Affliction</hi> all their days from their Youth up, it was the leſs a Diſcouragement to them now, that they muſt <hi>thro' much Tribulation</hi> (tho' of another nature) <hi>enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God.</hi> Nay, the proſpect of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties might ſeveral ways be of Service to the Work in hand; particularly by keeping them humble, by
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003280_0033_0FF03CC1C5960208"/>
putting an Edge on their Zeal, by exciting them to Diligence and Diſpatch, by diſpoſing them to ſtudy Union, and (like the Builders of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) to ſtrengthen one anothers Hands for this good Work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THEY <hi>had</hi> newly <hi>experienc'd the Goodneſs of God in eminent Works done for their</hi> Salvation: <hi>which had its</hi> ſanctifying <hi>Effects upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Goodneſs of GOD ſerv'd to lead them to Repentance, and engage them to Obedience. The Impreſſion of their Deliverances, and of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements given them by a gracious Providence, was now freſh upon their Minds, and had doubtleſs a holy Influence into their Lives. So it was with the firſt Generation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that ſettled in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Judg. 2. 7. <hi>And the People ſerved the Lord all the days of Joſhua, and all the days of the Elders that outlived Joſhua, who had ſeen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for Iſrael.</hi> "They that ſaw thoſe Wonders, which GOD wrought for his People, had ſo much Senſe as to believe their own Eyes, and ſo much Reaſon as to ſerve that GOD, who had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſo gloriouſly on their behalf." The ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generation indeed forgot the Works of the Lord, the great things he did for their Fathers in bringing them out of Egypt, and planting them in a good Land; and ſo had very little Value for the Religion of their Fathers, but corrupted their ways, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Lord. Whereas the firſt Generation, who had the great Actions of Providence done for them freſh in Remembrance, theſe were by a Principle of in genuous Gratitude excited to a zealous ſerving the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of Iſrael. So in the firſt times of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEIR religious Liberties and Privileges being <hi>new</hi> to them, increaſed their Value with them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd their Zeal, and made them more diligent in employing aright the happy Opportunities and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Grace they enjoy'd; and which were eſteem'd by them a plentiful Reward of all the Hazards they
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003280_0034_0FF03CC4250F6188"/>
had expos'd themſelves to, and Difficulties they were ſtruggling with.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE Buſineſs <hi>and</hi> Occaſion <hi>of that Day were extraordinary, and ſuch as might conduce to the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of Religion among the firſt Generation of this People.</hi>

THE Succeſs of their Undertaking depended very much on the exemplary Piety, Reputation and good Conduct of the firſt Engagers.</p>
            <p>THEY were (as they hoped) laying the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of many Generations;</hi> the Foundation for a glorious Superſtructure: and in this Work they were to be made <hi>a Spectacle</hi> to the World, Angels, and Men. Therefore as they needed GOD to be with them now in a peculiar manner, they were very careful not to forfeit the Divine Preſence by any provoking Evils: but did all they cou'd to ſecure that Bleſſing of Heaven, which was neceſſary to give Proſperity to the Work in Hand. "It was needful that the <hi>firſt Advances</hi> of ſuch a Work ſhould be great and conſiderable, and that ſome very notable Progreſs ſhould be made in the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> as the Church and Intereſt of Chriſt here lay now more expos'd, and liable to be inſulted and cruſh'd in its infant-ſtate".—Upon this account, as they needed they therefore ſollicitouſly ſought, to have the Hand of GOD more remarkably with them at that critical Juncture.</p>
            <p>THEY made it their Care to avoid every thing, that might open the Mouths of envious Enemies, to ſpeak Evil of the way of Truth on their account, and it was their Concern that their Light might ſo ſhine before others, as that they might glorify GOD in them, and acknowledge the Work they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in was <hi>of the Lord.</hi> In a word, the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of <hi>Zion's</hi> Adverſaries, did but quicken them in their Work, ſo that they took the greater Pains and made the more Haſte in building the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

            <p>THUS, in ſuch Regards as theſe, the extraordinary Nature and Seaſon and peculiar Circumſtances of their pious Undertaking, had a natural Influence to the eminent Proſperity it met with.</p>

            <p>A faithful Magiſtracy and Miniſtry are two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Articles of the publick Happineſs, and contribute as much as any at all to the Proſperity of Virtue and Religion in a place.

            <p>THEIR <hi>civil</hi> Leaders were in general Men of the beſt Character, for governing Abilities and Virtues. The <hi>Righteous</hi> were in Authority: which made the People rejoyce, and gave Reputation to Religion. There was much of the Kingdom of Chriſt in the civil Conſtitution and Laws of the Country, and in the Spirit and Conduct of our primitive Rulers.

They were tender of the Credit and Honour of the ſacred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; taught the People by their own Example to reverence faithful Meſſengers of the Lord, and were ready to ſcreen ſuch from the Injuries of the Malevolent. They were Members of the Churches themſelves, and by ſetting a beautiful Pattern of Order, Peaceableneſs, and Submiſſion to the Elders, to their Power and Rule in the Lord, they much contributed to a regular and quiet State of things therein. They were ardent Lovers of the Word and Ordinances of Chriſt, and Aſſembly of the Saints; and gave their conſtant Attendence both in Seaſon and out of Seaſon. Like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Honour of the holy Sabbath, and did many good Deeds for the Houſe of their GOD and the Offices thereof.

The Bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon them: and they cauſed the Widows heart to ſing.

both by their holy Adminiſtrations, and by their exemplary Deportments. Their Hearts and Lips were toucht by a lively Coal from the Altar: and their Faces ſhone, as <hi>Moſes</hi> juſt come down from the Mount, where he had been admitted to glorious Intimacies with Heaven. In a word, they were Men ſingularly well accompliſh'd, and full of a flaming Zeal for the Intereſt and Honour of Chriſt and for the Salvation of Souls.—And now theſe things, as Means, operated not a little to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Miniſtry, and ſo to the Flouriſhing of Religion. We read concerning <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts 11. 24. <hi>For he was a good man, and full of the holy Ghoſt, and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</hi> 
               <q>His excellent Character was that which contributed to his Succeſs. It's granted, that Succeſs is neither of <hi>Paul</hi> that planteth, nor of <hi>Apollos</hi> that watereth, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

However we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that GOD owns Men of extraordinary Grace and Faith and Holineſs above other Men, and uſually does greater Things by <hi>Such</hi> than by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</q> And then their lovely Character gives a ſingular Repute to their Profeſſion, and their bright Example by a natural Efficacy adds a peculiar Weight and Force to their Preaching. This acquires a mighty Intereſt in the Hearts of all that know and ſee them: and in Conſequence thereof gives them a powerful Influence. It was one happy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our firſt Days, that the Churches of Chriſt here were illuminated with a godly and learned Miniſtry: and their Eminency in ſacred Knowledge, and in Grace and Goodneſs, did ſubſerve very much to the bleſſed Ends of the Paſtoral Care, and abundantly conduce to the Proſperity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in this Place.<note n="*" place="bottom">For the Confirmation of theſe Characters and my other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, I refer the Reader to the HISTORIES of <hi>New-England,</hi> and in particular to that of the late Rev.

            <p>IN chief, the Plantation was carry'd on, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upheld &amp; promoted, by the power of Prayer: yet at the ſame time, they were found in the uſe of the moſt excellent Means.

THE APPLICATION remains: and here ſhall only offer a few Hints by way of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Uſe I. LET <hi>us frequently look back to our</hi> Original, <hi>and conſider the</hi> Beginning <hi>and</hi> Progreſs <hi>of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhould do this, to keep us <hi>humble:</hi> by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Meanneſs of our Beginning as to Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and yet the Glory thereof as to Spirituals; which ſpiritual Glory is now ſo very much loſt in the Increaſe of temporal Comforts.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, we ſhould make Reflections on our firſt Beginnings and Improvements, to ſtir up ourſelves to <hi>give</hi> GOD <hi>the Glory</hi> of his wonderful Works in the days of our Fathers, when he laid the Foundations of our Earth and ſtretched our Heavens over us; when he brought a Vine (as of old out of <hi>Egypt</hi>) and planted it here, and prepared Room for it, and cauſed it to take Root, to ſtand and grow and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, notwithſtanding all the Oppoſition made thereto by Men and Devils. "Thoſe Works belong to the <hi>Hiſtory of Providence,</hi> which GOD would have known and red of all Men".</p>
            <p>AGAIN, We muſt make thoſe Reflections in order to encourage our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in GOD; who is ſtill the ſame powerful and gracious GOD as ever, loves all them that ſeek him, and loves the Poſterity of his People the more <hi>for their Fathers ſake,</hi> when they truly ſeek him.</p>
            <p>IN a word, We ſhould make thoſe Reflections in order to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> ourſelves in ſeeking and ſerving our Fathers GOD.</p>
            <p>SUCH Reflections may be <hi>directive</hi> to us by a View of the <hi>Example</hi> of our godly Progenitors, who have left us an admirable Pattern of Orthodoxy in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Purity of Worſhip, Strictneſs of Diſcipline and Government in the Family, School, Church,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003280_0045_0FF03CDDFAF3EF28"/>
and Common-wealth, virtuous Manners, modeſt Apparel, grave and uſeful Converſation.</p>
            <p>AND then ſuch Reflections will tend to <hi>excite</hi> in us a Care of <hi>imitating</hi> them; by a Senſe of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Obligations lying on us, as we are the near Deſcendents of ſuch holy Anceſtors, whoſe Names will be a Reproach to us, if we do not alſo inherit their Virtues; by a Senſe of the Bonds of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant upon us, and of the Bonds of Gratitude we are under, both with relation to GOD and our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; by a Senſe of the many Prayers they have put up for us, and of the ſolemn Charges they have left us, enforced by a very attractive Example, the Example of ſuch as we've the higheſt Reaſon to love and venerate the Memory of, all which will but ſerve to aggravate the Guilt of our Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and will riſe up in Judgment againſt us, if we forſake the GOD of our Fathers:—In fine, by a Senſe of the Awefulneſs of our ſtanding in GOD's Vineyard, by the Conſideration that the Axe is laid to the root of the Trees, that every Plant which is not of GOD's planting, ſhall be rooted up, and every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit ſhall be cut down.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee, thoſe Reflections are many ways of uſeful Tendency to the Ends of Holineſs and the Chriſtian Life; which ſhould ſtrongly recommend them to our frequent and affectionate Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Uſe II. LET <hi>us alſo reflect ſeriouſly on our</hi> preſent State, <hi>and lay to heart the Apoſtaſies of this degenerate Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALASS! Are we not become as an Oak, whoſe Leaf fadeth, and the Stock thereof is ready to die in the Ground! May not <hi>Iſrael</hi> be call'd an empty Vine; bringing forth fruit unto himſelf! How is the faithful City become an Harlot! The Silver

become Droſs, and the moſt fine Gold changed! This is for a Lamentation, and ſhall be for a Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>MAY it not be complain'd, that Strangers having devour'd our Strength, grey Hairs are upon us! We are now become a very mixt Generation: and may I not add in Conſequence thereof, a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate one? May there not juſtly be exhibited againſt us a Complaint in the Language of <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>And alſo all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there aroſe another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Iſrael.</hi> Has not that Word been fulfilled in our Day? Act. 20. 30. <hi>Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW many in this Land have early corrupted their Ways, and forſaken the Lord GOD of their Fathers! Have not ſome renounced the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Truth, and others the Rules of Practice, in the Worſhip of GOD, in the Diſcipline of his Houſe &amp;c. which a humble ſearch into the holy Scriptures brought their pious Anceſtors to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with and Profeſſion of! Have not many renounced the Covenant of their Fathers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Enemies to the Work of GOD in this Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a Plantation for the Purpoſes of Religion!</p>
            <p>AND among thoſe who profeſs in general an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Cauſe of GOD, which brought our Forefathers over to <hi>New-England,</hi> how many are there who practically pour Contempt upon it, by a Coldneſs in the Defence of it, and by Lives diſagreable to it!</p>
            <p>SURE I am, we have Reaſon to take Shame to our ſelves; all of us, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and People. We have many Defects, Neglects, and Miſcarriages to bewail, by which our Profeſſion has been ſtained, the Goſpel hinder'd, and the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing

If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ourſelves with our Forefathers (and this let us often do, to humble and quicken ourſelveſ) how vaſtly ſhort do we come of their bright Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple!

We want their Capacity, their Character, and their Conduct very much: and therefore no Wonder, if we likewiſe want their Succeſs. Alaſs! we want their eminent Gifts and Graces. We want their ardent Love to GOD, his Truths and Ways. We want their peaceable healing Spirit. We want their diſintereſted Humility and Self-denial. We want their generous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this <hi>preſent World:</hi> We want their ſtrong Faith and affecting Views of <hi>another.</hi> And how many Defects are there in the manner of our Conduct! In the Seriouſneſs of our Deportment; the Prudence, the Faithfulneſs, the Diligence, the Application and Zeal of our Management, in Affairs ſpiritual and moral.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN a word, we want very much the Spirit of Prayer, religious Conference, brotherly Watch, and Communion of Saints; the Family-Government, the Church-Diſcipline, the exemplary Sanctification of the Lord's Day, the Value for Goſpel-Liberties, and Affection to the Houſe and Ordinances of GOD, the Zeal for Reformation,—which ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd our pious Anceſtors.

And is it not to be fear'd, that many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the glorious Maſk of Chriſtian Charity hide a cold Indifference to all Religion!

O that it may come with a powerful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon our Hearts, and produce agreable Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in our Lives!

            <p>BUT now to conclude,</p>
            <p>Uſe III. LET <hi>us all have a holy Concern upon our Minds, as we would have the Lord Jehovah to be</hi> NEW-ENGLAND's <hi>Saviour, that we may anſwer his juſt

            </p>
            <p>WE have Reaſon to admire the Divine Patience towards a ſinning People, That we have not long ſince been cut down as Cumberers of the Ground, but enjoy as yet a Standing in GOD's Vineyard. It is of the Mercy of the Lord, we are not conſum'd. O that the ſparing Goodneſs of GOD may lead us to Repentance! Let us adore the Grace and Power of Chriſt in continuing us a People yet before him; that the Root is not dried up from beneath, nor the Branches cut off from above; but there's yet Life in the Root, and ſtill <hi>from Him is our Fruit found.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">It is worthy a particular Notice, the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> which our gracious Head and Lord has put upon <hi>theſe Churches,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing them for ſo long a Tract of Time on their original Foundations; keeping them in poſſeſſion of the ſame Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles, Modes of Worſhip, Government &amp; Order (with ſo much of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>) which our Forefathers profeſs'd and practis'd, and maintaining vital Godlineſs among Profeſſors ſo conſpicuouſly in a Number of Inſtances, from Generation to Generation.

            <p>WE are weak indeed this day, by the plucking ſo many Corner-Stones out of our Walls, and by the frowning Aſpects of Providence in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards. But ſtill let us not give way to unbelieving Thoughts and Diſcouragements, as if the Lord meant to utterly caſt us off.

There's ſtill a Remnant of praying Saints and righteous Ones; ſuch as are of the ſame excellent Principles
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003280_0050_0FF03CEBDB5C68E8"/>
and of the ſame excellent Tempers, that our holy Fathers were under the Dominion of; Men, who ſtand in the Gap, Repairers of Breaches, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorers of Paths to dwell in. And then the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Clouds, which gather over us ſo thick and faſt in theſe ſhaking Times, they may be meant unto Good; to humble and reform and do us Good in the Iſſue. Wherefore lift up the Hands that hang down, and ſtrengthen the feeble Knees.</p>
            <p>LET us encourage our ſelves in the Lord, who by his Power created the World out of Nothing, who brought up <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egyptian Bondage, and who form'd and rais'd this his People from low Beginnings. With him is the Reſidue of the Spirit. He <hi>hath</hi> been mindful of us, and he <hi>will</hi> bleſs us: He will bleſs the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> He will bleſs the Houſe of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Is it not an applicable Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to <hi>New-England,</hi> that in Iſa. 66. 5. <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my name's ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified: but he ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us be ſollicitous to do all we can to ſecure the Continuance of the gracious Preſence of GOD among us. To this end, let us be concern'd to get every provoking Evil reform'd: let us be inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into the Cauſes of the preſent decay of Piety, and Unſucceſsfulneſs of the Goſpel; labour to repair all our Defects, rectify all our Miſmanagements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve our Characters. Let us unite all our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, Cares, and Prayers, for the Recovery of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Religion, for the building up Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and carrying on the Work of the Lord, that we may ſee the Return of good Days. That's the Call of Chriſt to his People here, Rev. 3. 2, 3. <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God. Remember therefore how thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003280_0051_0FF03CED5FD1A528"/>
and heard, and hold faſt, and repent.</hi> And as in ver. II. <hi>Behold I come quickly: hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown.</hi> He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</p>
            <p>LET us often recollect the Errand of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers into this Land, and purſue that great Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which brought them hither, when it was a Land not ſown, an inhoſpitable Wilderneſs, where (as they were wont to ſay) they eſteem'd—<hi>brown Bread and the Goſpel good Fair.</hi> Let us be mindful of the holy Covenant, wherein they have bound us to be the Lord's, and teach it our Children, who ſhall tell it to the Generation to come, that they alſo may ſet their Hope in the Lord, and that our little Ones may know the Covenant-Care and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the GOD of Iſrael, under whoſe Wings their Forefathers came hither to dwell in Safety. Let us attend to the Words of <hi>David'</hi>s dying Charge to the Rulers and People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 8. <hi>Now therefore in the ſight of all Iſrael the congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and ſeek for all the commandments of the Lord your God: that ye may poſſeſs this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us imitate our godly Anceſtors in the wiſe Methods and indefatigable Pains they took for the Security &amp; Advancement of the Kingdom of Chriſt in <hi>New-England.</hi> Let us cheriſh the ſame excellent Spirit and Principles, which were ſo much their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction &amp; Glory. Let us be earneſt at the Throne of Grace for a more plentiful Effuſion of the Holy Spirit, in order to a happy Revival of the Work of GOD; that we may hear many inquiring the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, and that true and effectual Converſions may be more frequently ſeen among us. We are propheſying as in the midſt of a Valley full of Bones, dead Men's Bones, very
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003280_0052_0FF03CEEEB872C58"/>
dry: But if God cauſe Breath to enter into them, they ſhall live, and renew their Strength, and the dry Bones ſhall flouriſh like an Herb. O that we might ſee it, and our Heart ſhall rejoyce! May this ancient Church be like a Tree that ſpreadeth out her Roots by the River whoſe leaf withereth not, neither ceaſeth ſhe from yielding Fruit. May this Town be as a water'd Garden, that ſeeth not when Heat cometh, abounding with Fruits of Righteouſneſs: and let our Beloved come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Garden, and eat of his pleaſant Fruits! May Salvation be nigh to us, and Glory dwell in our Land! Return, O Lord, for thy ſervants ſake, the tribes of thine inheritance: The people of thy holineſs have poſſeſſed it but a little while. The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers; and let theſe my words, wherewith I have made Supplication before the Lord, be nigh unto the Lord our God day and night, that he may maintain the Cauſe of his People at all times as the matter ſhall require; that all the People of the Earth may know that the Lord he is God, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and our God, our Fathers God, and the God of our Children. And let us all now agree in making that Reſolution, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. I. <hi>For Zion's ſake will I not hold my peace, and for</hi> Jeruſalem's <hi>ſake I will not reſt, until the righteouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs, and the Salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</hi>
