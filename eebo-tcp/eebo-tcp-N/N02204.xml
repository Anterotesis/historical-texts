            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THEY that firſt ſet up, as the Spreaders of the Goſpel, and to give their teſtimony to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Doctrine, had ſeen little beſide Boats and Men: a few illiterate <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> with a <hi>Publican</hi> and <hi>Tent maker;</hi> a ſtrange under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, for ſuch unaccompliſhed Orators, to try to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the World to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to ſubject the powerful, learned and wiſe, to the foot of a crucified Perſon! but they forgot not Chriſt's parting Promiſe, Mat. 28.20. <hi>Go ye therefore &amp; teach all nations; — and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</hi> And fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to lean on <hi>Divine Aids and Aſſiſtance;</hi> which brought the matter on to a wonderful Perſection, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time; tho' they met with not only cold entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but damping repulſe, and harſh treatment, when they firſt preached Chriſt, to an ignorant, depraved, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical and infidel World; as the Text intimates; which ſets forth, the bitter charge lay'd upon <hi>Paul &amp; Silas,</hi> for only Scripture reaſoning concerning Chriſt, and his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The charge lay'd upon them, by the implacable outragious <hi>Jews,</hi> was, as if they went about only upon a ſeditious Deſign, &amp; as <hi>State troublers;</hi> when they ſought <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> worſe thing, than to perſuade the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002627_0003_0FDB80233AB42708"/>(where the preaching now was) <hi>to turn from dumb idols to ſerve the living God.</hi> The <hi>Rabble</hi> counted it very criminal, for <hi>Jaſon</hi> their <hi>Host</hi> to harbour them, and took Bail belike of him for their appearance, when they ſhould be call'd for to Examination.</p>
            <p>The Words may be conſider'd as a bitter, cauſeleſs Charge. Where obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi>The Perſons charged; Paul, &amp; Silas his Colleague,</hi> that were out upon no other but the Goſpel deſign.</p>
            <p n="2">2.Obſerve <hi>the matter of the Charge;</hi> viz. <hi>that they</hi> (and their followers) <hi>had turned the world upſide down.</hi> A proverbial ſay, but high charge! and their meaning probably was that they ſtirred up the world to Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sedition, a grievous Charge! — But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was, (to ſpeak on the Apoſtles ſide) it was utterly falſe, (like that of <hi>Tertullus</hi> againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 24 5. ſays he, <hi>We have found this man a pestilent fellow, &amp; a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of ſedition,</hi> &amp;c. For all the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo ready to confirm his lie, v.9 <hi>The Jews alſo aſſented, ſaying, that thoſe things were ſo</hi>) In a good ſenſe, it were well if the charge in the Text had been true, for the depraved world wanted then, (and never more perhaps) to be turned clean out of their idolatrous, vicious Cuſtoms; and to be brought to the Faith and Purity of the Goſpel. But theſe (the only Tumult and Uproar-makers of that Day;) continue the Charge, <hi>v.</hi> 7. for that they brought in <hi>Customs contrary to</hi> Caeſar'<hi>s.</hi> Whereas, theſe Servants of God, try'd to advance the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, without the leaſt Injury <hi>to the Roman Empire:</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> knew to be ſo in their Conſciences; but caſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Aſperſion on them, to make them odious to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and pretended regard <hi>to</hi> Caeſar'<hi>s Decrees,</hi> only to ruin Chriſt's <hi>Servants,</hi> and hinder the Goſpel: whereas the <hi>traduced perſons,</hi> honoured the <hi>Emperor,</hi> pray'd for his Life, for a proſperous Reign, and valiant Armies; a faithful <hi>Senate,</hi> diſcreet Counſel, a good People, and a quiet World. For this they taught, Tit. 3.1. <hi>Put 'em in mind to be ſubject to principalities, &amp; powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work</hi> &amp;c. And
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002627_0004_0FDB8027F13A8A00"/>Yet was the world (at that time all gone to naught;) ſet to miſrepute them, and the whole Goſpel deſign, viz. to advance a divine Knowledge and Purity, with Reformation of Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve, a farther Aggravation inſiſted on, <hi>are come hither alſo.</hi> O Neſandous! It was bad eno' to go to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and ſpread their leaven, but quite unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to go near the Chargers. Thus they proceed in Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation againſt the Servants of God, till out of breath: for men will be as violent in a bad cauſe ſometimes, viz. when miſperſuaded, as others are in a good one. All that I ſhall obſerve to you from the words is this. viz.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>
                  <hi>That the Goſpel itſelf, when firſt advanced in the World, and the first Preachers of it, had a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Outcry raiſed upon them.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>The Malignant world, did not know how to ſpeak bad eno', and contemptuouſly eno' hereof they tho't. What ſcorn and hard frumps had <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doctrine from the <hi>Athenian Philoſophers?</hi> v.18. <hi>Some ſaid what will this babbler ſay? other ſome, He ſeemeth to be a ſetter Forth of ſtrange gods,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtles offered nothing more harſh to Reaſon, than convincing proofs, <hi>that Chriſt was the appointed, and expected Meſſiah to come &amp; ſave the world; and irrefragable Confirmations of the truth of his Reſurrection, that mon might be perſuaded, they had a living Saviour to trust in;</hi> and that they might quit the vices ſpoken of in Rom. 1.30.1 Cor. 6.10. Tit. 3.3. Gal. 5.21.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. <hi>And get waſhed, ſanctified, justified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And appear with the ſpirit of love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faithfulneſs, meekneſs, temperance and the like, as a proof that they had cloſed with the Saviour of the world, as their Head and Saviour.</hi> And could this hurt any, need it to have diſturbed any! Yet harſh and very unwelcome treatment, had the Goſpel and the firſt Preachers of it, when Chriſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002627_0005_0FDB8029F4BF72D0"/>any more inſtance of this thing, it is but turning back to what the <hi>Apostles,</hi> at their firſt ſetting into the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> met with, Acts 4.18. &amp; 5.40. That was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable Crime, viz. to preach Chriſt <hi>crucified;</hi> for fear men ſhould get into a new &amp; better way of Salvation, than that of <hi>following their fooliſh ſuperstitions, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men,</hi> that brought more gain to them, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to any body elſe —. Thus Chriſtianity notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its brightneſs and purity, was not only expos'd naked in the day of its Birth, but made odious to the People.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Whence was it thus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">Anſ. 1. <hi>The first Preachers of the Goſpel, were not ſuch promiſing, taking, quaint men.</hi> This was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4. <hi>And my ſpeech, &amp; my preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power.</hi> Which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle acknowledged, under the <hi>Denomination of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 4 13. A crucified Chriſt was the Rhetorick! The <hi>Roman Empire</hi> was now at its height, <hi>Philoſophy &amp; Eloquence</hi> in its flower &amp; vigour, and the <hi>Sages</hi> of that time puſh'd againſt the Diſciples of Chriſt and their Doctrine with their might, as fine undertakers (to ſpeak ironically) to new model the World. (Say they) No, the meſſages of God himſelf ſhall be ſlighted, if brought by ſuch hands: like as the <hi>Emulation</hi> ſhewed itſelf at the time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> under <hi>Luther</hi>'s preaching, when many <hi>Church Dignitarys &amp; Eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> could not but own, that ſundry things wanted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the Church, but could not bear it ſhould be lead on by a ſorry <hi>Monk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Goſpel in its Doctrine &amp; Deſign is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to men's Lusts.</hi> And hence might proceed the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made unto it. This corrupt nature is very fond of, &amp; doth not know how to away with the hard ſayings of the Goſpel about them, <hi>to deny themſelves, &amp; take up their croſs, plucking out a right eye, leaving mammon, and laying up treaſure on Earth, giving liberally to the poor, &amp; depending upon Heavenly Refundments, loving
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002627_0006_0FDB802B838D0EC0"/>Christ,</hi> &amp;c. which makes ſome go away from the hearing <hi>with damp, as the young man, who when he heard that ſaying, went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſſions.</hi> Mat. 9.22. And others ſet up with bold rages, and try to ſpurn at the Goſpel, and run over it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Meerly for its newneſs the Goſpel might be excepted againſt.</hi> For our nature is apt to be fond of things we have had a long Intimacy with, and apt to recoyl at In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, if never ſo much for the better. So you ſhall ſee ſome fond of an old houſe, 8 houſe implements, cloaths, hats &amp;c. and if thoſe that are never ſo much better &amp; more uſeful, be offered in their room, they are ſlighted, becauſe thoſe they have had ſuch long acquaintance with, are ſo dear to them. So their old <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> corrupt <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Idolatries,</hi> the infidel world would not part with, for a <hi>ſound Goſpel</hi> —</p>
               <p>USE. <hi>Hence the best things that God has ſent us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World may be miſconstrued &amp; miſrepreſented.</hi> When God ſent Chriſt into the World, ſome ſaid he was a <hi>friend of Publicans &amp; Sinners,</hi> &amp; held a compact with <hi>Belzebub,</hi> to ſlur &amp; blaſpheme his mighty works. And the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was by ſome reputed <hi>babbling, &amp; a ſetting forth of strange gods.</hi> And the Apoſtles, <hi>whoſe feet ſhou'd have been beautiful, for bringing the glad &amp; gracious tidings of peace &amp; reconciliation by Christ, they were counted pestilent fellows &amp; mad men.</hi> But ſurely this ought not ſo to be. This was one effect of the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Reaſon depraved, &amp; benighted with the fall, that in ſome caſes it no better diſcerned good from evil. Whence I would take occaſion, to offer to the Conſciences of ſome Neighbours &amp; Brethren, that appear not ſo well ſatisfied, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Eſſay of Regulation &amp; Amendment, of the defects of our <hi>public Pſalmody,</hi> &amp; to have too <hi>tort &amp; ſmart</hi> Objections, viz. that they may miſs it, &amp; <hi>offend against the generation of the juſt,</hi> tho' they ſeem to be pretty ſure to themſelves; That I am well perſuaded, 'ere this Generation paſs away, thouſands upon better conſideration, will ſee reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract precipitant Cenſures, on conſcionable endeavours, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Anſ. <hi>Perſons are accepted of God, if with a good and honeſt heart, they Sing, Pray or Read God's Word as well as they can.</hi> But to do theſe <hi>brokenly,</hi> when they might do them more <hi>accurately</hi> is a diſreſpect &amp; diſhonour to God, &amp; therefore cenſurable. A Perſon performing a holy Service, with many lameneſſes and defects while he don't know better, may be accepted of God; but when he knows how to come to amendment hereof and refuſes, and ſets himſelf againſt it, he will have tho't to Anſwer to God—.
