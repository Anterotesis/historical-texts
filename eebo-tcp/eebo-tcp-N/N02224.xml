         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I began with a little, and after my Time was out, I did not preſently get a fine Horſe, and ride about ſpunging on one honeſt Houſe-Keeper or another, idling half the Year, unleſs I could get ſuch Wages as the induſtrious Farmer could not afford, which I knew however, he muſt give, in Corn and Hay-Harveſt: But hired my ſelf to my old Maſter at mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Yearly Wages, until I had paid for the firſt Hundred of my Land. Then ſet to Work, clearing ſome of it in the

               <p>I never went to Markets, Fairs, or the Town, but when my Buſineſs called me, and was ſuch as would compenſate the Time and Charge. When there, I never ſate tipling the Day out, and then ride home in the Night to deſtroy my Health, and unfit me for Buſineſs the next Day. My Wife (for I married the ſecond Year of ſettling) was loving and induſtrious; She ſpun ſo much Linnen and Woollen as to be pretty well ſtock'd before Encreaſe of young Children took her off. And by that Time, thro' the Bleſſing of God on my Induſtry, I had got enough aforehand to afford her a Maid, and ſoon after, my ſelf a Man. Our Children grew, and help'd us on bravely, ſo that I added to my Land a Piece to ſettle one Son, and began it, and have agreed for another, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wherewithal to pay for it.</p>

But Happineſs, if we think rightly, conſiſts in the Golden Mean, to be free from Straits and Penury, on the one Hand, and the Temptations to Luxury and its Crony-Vices on the other.
