            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>MR. S. SMITH obſerved, that, <q>were there but <hi>one man,</hi> and he a <hi>negro,</hi> ſuffering under the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>yoke</hi> of <hi>impreſſment,</hi> it was the duty of the government to provide <hi>relief</hi> for that man.</q> Now, Mr. Smith, have you not ſeveral negroes? How eaſy, then, is it for you to do an act of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy, without application to the government, and without plunging the country into a dangerous diſpute with another nation? You will ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, that your negroes are not ſuffering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the galling "yoke of impreſſment;" but, where is the difference, whether they are under the yoke of the Britiſh or under your yoke; ſlavery is ſtill ſlavery; nor is the yoke the weight of a hair lighter, for laſting durante vita, or becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030221_0004_0FE5278518F76350"/>
by a man who pretends to be the advocate of liberty.</p>
               <p>Nothing that I have ſaid, or ſhall ſay, on this ſubject, is intended to juſtify the Britiſh in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſment of <hi>Americans:</hi> I look upon their conduct in this reſpect as tyrannical; as the effect of that overbearing inſolence which is the characteriſtic of but too many among their ſubaltern officers, and I think that redreſs ought to be obtained, with all convenient ſpeed. But, I here confine myſelf to <hi>Americans alone,</hi> by which word I mean, thoſe who were born in the United States, or were inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of them at the peace of 1783, not including <hi>deſerters from the Britiſh during the war.</hi> Theſe are Americans, and no others are, and, I venture to predict, that, whatever ſchemes the Congreſs may fall on, whatever regiſters, certificates or oaths of civiſm they may think proper to furniſh ſailors with, Great Britain will ever ſeize hers, where ſhe finds them.</p>
               <p>Mr. LIVINGSTON ſaid, that <q>it would be no difficult matter to prove, that foreigners natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized ſince the Declaration of Independence, were entitled to the protection of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> He attempted to prove this, and I ſhall not contradict him, for the thing is, in itſelf ſo evidently abſurd as to need no remark.—As to what he pleaſes to call the <hi>naturalization of foreigners</hi> (whole cargoes at a time or otherwiſe) the rights of citizenſhip they enjoy under their new maſters, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſhall be reſerved for a future opportunity. It will be ſufficient to add, on this article, that a bill was at laſt agreed to for appointing agents for the relief and protection of impreſſed ſeamen. But if theſe agents are to be employed (as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <head>PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. <date>
                     <hi>MARCH</hi> 2nd.</date>
               </head>
               <p>Mr. LIVINGSTON (from N. York) ſaid that it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtood that ſome important conſtitutional que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions would be diſcuſſed, when the treaty lately conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between this country and Great Britain ſhould come under conſideration, it was very deſirable, therefore, that every document which might tend to throw light on the ſubject ſhould be before the Houſe.—For this purpoſe, he would move the following reſolution:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Reſolved, that the Preſident of the United States be requeſted to lay before this Houſe, a copy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions given to the miniſter of the United States who negociated the treaty with Great Britain, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated by his meſſage on the 1ſt inſt. together with the correſpondence and documents relative to the ſaid treaty.</q> Ordered to lie on the table.</p>
               <p>To this reſolution the following exception was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards added:—<q>excepting ſuch of ſaid papers as any exiſting negociation may render improper to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. TRACEY (Connecticut) requeſted the gentleman who brought forward this reſolution to give his reaſons for doing ſo. He had at preſent only told the Houſe that, as the conſtitutionality of the treaty might be diſcuſſed, he thought it neceſſary to propoſe the meaſure. It was well known by every man in that Houſe that much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion, and much ſenſibility had been occaſioned by the treaty in queſtion all over the Union.—He thought that the only way to treat the matter fairly, would be for every member on that floor to come forward and expreſs himſelf openly. Perhaps the happineſs of the country
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030221_0006_0FE5283907F71FA0"/>
might depend upon the iſſue of their deliberations upon it. In order to avoid all bitterneſs and miſunderſtanding, it would be beſt for members to come forward at firſt and ſtate their opinions fully. He, therefore aſked why this motion was made? If made barely to enable the Houſe to examine into the conſtitutionality of the treaty, he thought that might be determined by comparing it with the conſtitution itſelf. It may be thought neceſſary that theſe papers be produced in order to impeach any of the perſons employed in the negociation, or the Precident. He wiſhed to know for what purpoſe theſe papers are called. He thought to declare the whole intention of the motion would be a means of harmonizing the Houſe upon the ſubject. However, until he knew the real intention, he would hope it was a good one. If he diſagreed from the honourable mover, he ſhould give his reaſons for it, it was a delicate ſubject. That they had a right to the papers called for for a good purpoſe, could not be doubted, but unleſs the Houſe had real occaſion for them, the Preſident would be juſtified, in keeping them where they are. What, ſaid he, do we want with theſe papers? Is it to make a better treaty, or to do away the one made? He wiſhed to know the mover's reaſons fully.</p>
               <p>Mr. LIVINGSTON ſaid he had never any wiſh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his intention, as he truſted he never ſhould have any which he ſhould be aſhamed to avow. The gentleman aſked with propriety for information: he anſwered, his motion was made for the purpoſe of gaining information. He aſked to what particular point. It may be to all the points he has mentioned. It was impoſſible to know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the papers were before him. He wiſhed for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the reſult would depend upon the information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. He did not know that the impeachment of any perſon would be determined upon by that Houſe. He did not think ſo himſelf; but he thought it neceſſary they ſhould have an opportunity of making a fair judgment of the matter. They were the proper perſons to whom was delegated the power of puniſhing officers; they ought therefore, to have full opportunity of judging of their conduct. It was ſimply for information that the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſked, not only with reſpect to the officers who were employed on the occaſion, but with reſpect to the thing
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030221_0007_0FE5283A996AE5A0"/>
itſelf. He believed, that Houſe had the power to carry into effect any Treaty, or not. It was for this purpoſe that he wanted information; and if the Houſe were of the ſame opinion, they would ſupport the motion. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been ſaid as to the delicacy of the ſubject. If, ſaid he, any reaſon of State will not permit the Preſident to give the papers they aſked for, he will give his reaſons for refuſing them. He meant not to invade the rights of any branch of government; it was information which he ſought for.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILES (Virginia) ſaid he would briefly ſtate the reaſons which induced him to ſupport the paſſing of the reſolution which lay on the table. The gentleman from Connecticut had juſtly ſaid that the treaty had cauſed great ſenſibility throughout the United States. It was on this account that he wanted that information which they had a right to expect, and without which they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to conſider the ſubject. If he were to judge of the treaty itſelf, it would not allay that ſenſibility which had been raiſed againſt it, but he truſted the information which was called for would be of a ſort to reconcile the public mind. If no information was given he muſt own it would have an unfavorable impreſſion on his mind. He wiſhed, therefore, for information.</p>
               <p>Mr. MURRAY (Maryland) obſerved that if the mover of the reſolution before the Houſe had clearly declared that the object of it was for information, he ſhould not have an objection to it; but the explanation given, led him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it had in view the eſtabliſhment of a very alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine—no leſs than to determine whether the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be carried into effect or not. By the Conſtitution, he ſaid, the treaty was become the law of the land, and obligatory on all the citizens of the United States. From the explanation given, he ſhould give the meaſure his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided negative; for if that Houſe had the power to decide on the legality of the treaty, in vain has the Conſtitution given power to the Preſident and Senate to make treaties. It appeared to him that the Houſe had no right to enquire into the particular ground upon which this treaty has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the law of the land, ſince it appears that the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Senate have acted agreeably to the Conſtitution.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030221_0008_0FE527596F2A0150"/>
It would be a ſoleciſm in Government, to ſay that there were two powers which could controul each other. He thought the reſolution unconſtitutional, as it was predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated on the right of that Houſe to interfere with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er placed in the Preſident and Senate to make treaties. In order to juſtify this motion, the Houſe ſhould firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the treaty to be unconſtitutional, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> not to be the law of the land. If it was agreed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Houſe had a right to examine all the ſecrets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> negociations, a plan will be adopted which may open ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crets that may be of great injury to the nation. Every man knows, ſaid he, that in diplomatic tranſactions there are certain ſecret negociations; he did not know that it was the caſe in this, but it might be ſo. To carry into effect this reſolution, appeared to him a direct invaſion upon the conſtitutional rights placed in the Preſident, in conjunction with the Senate. He doubted whether the Senate could make this demand.</p>
               <p>Thus did the diſcuſſion wander from its object. This motion of Mr. Livingſton was the ſignal of hoſtile preparation. The Friends of the treaty took the alarm, and the queſtion became, not whether the Houſe had a right to call for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or not, but whether their ſanction was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the execution of a treaty.</p>
               <p>The debates occupied the Houſe and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic during nearly a month. It is incompatible with my plan to give all the ſpeeches at length, many of which do honour to the hearts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others to the heads of the ſpeakers: among the former may be noticed thoſe of Meſſieurs Buck, Sedgwick, Harper and William Smith; among the latter, thoſe of Meſſieurs Gallatin and Giles; and, on the whole, the debate contains as maſterly a diſplay of polemical talents as, perhaps, was ever exhibited by any aſſembly in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:030221_0009_0FE5287860BFB290"/>I ſhall content myſelf with inſerting here two of theſe ſpeeches only, which as they contain the ſubſtance of all that was ſaid on both ſides, will ſuffice, at once to give the reader a complete view of the arguments adduced, and a ſpecimen of the rhetorical abilities of the members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILES ſaid, when the preſent motion was firſt brought forward, he ſaw no other conſideration attached to it, than the expediency, or inexpediency of calling for the papers in queſtion. It was expected the Preſident was poſſeſſed of information reſpecting the treaty, as ſuch it became a queſtion whether it was not proper to make a call for it. The very referring of the treaty to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the whole ſhewed an intention of acting upon it. Indeed the communication from the Preſident at the opening of the ſeſſion, ſhewed that he expected that Houſe to exerciſe an agency on the treaty. It appeared to him, that if the papers would ſerve to explain any thing in the treaty, it was deſireable to have them. He was one of thoſe who, in reflecting on the treaty, and judging from the face of it, felt unfavorably towards it. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he had the right, and he conceived it to be his duty, to oppoſe the execution of, the inſtrument; but, knowing there was great reſponſibility attached to the buſineſs, he wiſhed for information. For the final iſſue, the weight of reſponſibility would never make him ſwerve from his duty. Theſe were his motives for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the motion.</p>
               <p>That the Houſe had a right to call for theſe papers was not denied; the right being conceded, it appeared to him that they might have confined themſelves to the expediency of the motion. But the oppoſition had not been ſo much againſt the motion, as againſt the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have been uſed, that do not relate to the ſubject. But tho' he believed that theſe were all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, yet, as it ſeemed to be deemed a teſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another buſineſs, and members appeared inclined now to expreſs an opinion on that head, he would aſk indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030221_0010_0FE52815C362B6E8"/>
of the committee whilſt he ſtated his ſentiments on that ſubject.</p>
               <p>The real queſtion appeared to be this, whether the treaty making power, can receive any check, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of proviſions placed in the Congreſs of the United States, and whether they have a right to queſtion the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the inſtruments?—Various arguments have been uſed to ſhew, that that Houſe have not the power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the treaty, or check its execution. Some of them have grown from the Conſtitution, others from the face of the inſtrument. Though, he ſaid, it would have been more agreeable to him to have explained his ſentiments in a different way, yet, as gentlemen have choſen to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the diſcuſſion of the great Conſtitutional queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſhould proceed to anſwer the objections which had been urged againſt what he conceived to be the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Of the deſcription of objection againſt the rights of that Houſe, which grew out of the inſtrument itſelf, he ſhould begin with remarks on what had fallen from the gentleman from South Carolina yeſterday. That gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had introduced the Convention held in the ſtate of Virginia near the time of adopting the Conſtitution, and ſaid, that it propoſed an amendment, containing, amongſt other checks, one reſpecting the treaty power, viz. that there ſhould be a concurrence of two thirds of the whole of the Senate, inſtead of two thirds of the Senate preſent. He believed it was ſo. But he would aſk the gentleman how this operated? The amendment was not to leſſen, but to increaſe the checks, which, from the extent of the treaty making power, as it ſtands in the Conſtitution, was thought to be neceſſary. But how the gentleman could infer that they believed there was no other check, he was at a loſs to determine. If he would refer to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that Convention, he would find the reaſons urged in ſupport of the propoſed amendments, which, indeed, were the opinions of individuals only. The next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which he reſorted to was, that of the opinion of certain citizens, at a meeting held at New-York, to ſhew that they conſidered the buſineſs of the treaty, wholly an executive buſineſs. He little expected, from a gentleman
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030221_0011_0FE527952199C2C8"/>
who is apt to ſpeak rather contemptuouſly of ſuch aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that the proceedings of town's meeting ſhould have been adduced in ſupport of his argument. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the expreſſions of ſuch meetings of the people would always have an effect on his mind. Was the gentleman willing to rely on the opinions of thoſe whom he has mentioned? If not, why introduce them? If the gentleman will admit that ſuch meetings are the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox expoſitors of the public Conſtitution, as they are expoſitors of the will, he had no objections to their being adduced. It did not appear, however, that he drew cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the ſentiments of the public meeting in queſtion; it was held to petition the Preſident to withhold his ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the treaty. Would not the ſtrongeſt arguments, then, be uſed to induce the Preſident not to execute the treaty? But he wiſhed to be permitted to take the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's own rule. What was the ſituation of their table; was it not covered with petitions from all parts of the Union againſt the treaty? Finding their petitions in vain to the Preſident, the people flew to that Houſe, and the table never had, upon any occaſion, ſo many petitions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, praying them not to give up the rights which the conſtitution had placed in their hands, of checking the treaty making power.—The next argument adduced by the gentleman was, the opinion expreſſed in the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lately propoſed by the State of Virginia, to the conſtitution; from which, he drew an implication that there was at preſent no check on the treaty making power, it was not ſo. It had not been contended that there was any particular words in the conſtitution which directly goes to this conſtruction, but that it grows out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther powers. This was the idea of the State of Virginia. The amendment was propoſed to relieve them from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive power, by giving them an expreſs power. It was unneceſſary to remind them of the fate which theſe amendments had met with. He hoped, however, the State of Virginia would perſue that conduct which had always marked her political character; and he truſted it would be admitted, that ſhe was not more diſtinguiſhed for her love of liberty, than ſhe was for her love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, of order and good conduct at home. He prided himſelf in being a Repreſentative of ſuch a ſtate; and he
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030221_0012_0FE528A35242ED40"/>
was perſuaded, though her ſiſter ſtates differed from her in opinion, ſhe would never ceaſe to pay them proper reſpect. He was ſorry the ſubject had been mentioned. If Virginia, he ſaid, had been the cauſe of indelicacy in others, ſhe was the innocent cauſe and therefore not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible. In making the propoſed amendments, ſhe was impelled by the beſt motives to attain an important object, an object, which, he doubted not, would ultimately be attended with ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from South-Carolina had reſorted to another ſubject with but little ſucceſs. He read a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from the journals of the houſe, importing, that when treaties were made under the authority of the United States, they ſhould be annexed to the laws.</p>
               <p>He believed it proper they ſhould be ſo. But does this ſhew that the practice of the Houſe had been againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their opinion on great national objects? The gentleman's next obſervation was with reſpect to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations for carrying into effect Indian treaties, ſaying that there was no difference betwixt treaties with foreign nations, and treaties with the Indian tribes. Mr. Giles remarked there always had been a diſtinction.—In the time of the Colonial Government, that diſtinction was made and it had never been done away. By means of Indian treaties, the treaty-making power had been vaſtly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he could not ſay whether for a good or bad purpoſe. Proviſion had been made for carrying Indian treaties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to effect, becauſe they thought it right. But ſuppoſe a motion had been made to ſtrike out the appropriation clauſe, in one of thoſe bills, would it have been out of order? No. That queſtion had been lately diſcuſſed (he referred to the buſineſs reſpecting the mint) and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon. There was another ſubject that gentleman mentioned, which he was very ſorry to hear, though he ſeemed to plume himſelf upon it, that the Preſident of the United States had accompanied the publication of this treaty with his proclamation to carry it into effect. Why was this mentioned? It was not to illuminate that Houſe. He was afraid it might have a tendency to check inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Perſons were too often brought before that Houſe; not to illuſtrate a ſubject, but to hinder free debate. He
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030221_0013_0FE528416105DF68"/>
would even admit that the Preſident believed that that Houſe had not the right to judge of the treaty. Were his opinion to be authority? No. What is the nature of the queſtion? It implies conteſted rights of different branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of government. His introducing the Preſident, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as an authoritative opinion, might alarm, but could not convince. Notwithſtanding the Preſident's proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſtill thought the treaty was ſent to that Houſe to be acted upon.</p>
               <p>Having anſwered moſt of the objections from collateral ſources, he ſhould proceed to more intereſting matter— to the Conſtitution itſelf, it was a little unfortunate, he ſaid, that ſentiments could not be ſo combined as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce always the ſame ideas in every mind. Hence aroſe difference of opinion.—It is not wonderful, that in the Congreſs of the United States, there ſhould be a variety of opinion. Of all the expoſitions of the treaty-making power, he thought that was the leaſt probable and moſt dangerous, which fell from the member from Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut—That power, he informed the Houſe, was undefined in its nature, unlimited in its object, and ſupreme in its operation. He would not ſay there had been no attempts at a definition of this extravagant power. It was ſaid, it might embrace legiſlative objects by compacts. He would not ſay that objection had been attended to, that it could not go beyond the Conſtitution, nor encroach on power placed by the Conſtitution in any branch of Government.</p>
               <p>On this conſtruction he would examine the queſtion. The firſt conſequence was, that the treaty ſupercedes the diſcuſſion of that Houſe. The next was, that it repeals all laws which ſtand in its way. When he proceeded to examine the conſtitution, he would touch on both thoſe particulars. He would remark, that as far as he had been able to examine the hiſtory of mankind, there was always an effort of the people to guard their rights, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite effort in government to encroach on them. The American people were called upon to eſtabliſh ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as would enſure their rights and liberties. It had been ſaid that the American people had been more ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than any other nation. But whilſt it appears that they have been more ſagacious to furniſh checks, there have not
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030221_0014_0FE52796AC1752B0"/>
been wanting continual attempts to invade them. In no nation has the doctrine of checks been ſo completely routed as in this, and if the opinions now contended for, prevail, nothing will remain to be done by checks. This conſtruction has been deduced from two ſources. One from the conſtitution, and the other from the nature of the thing. Gentlemen have read the clauſe of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which gives a power to the Preſident and Senate to make treaties. Here they ſtop, and ſay that this gives them a complete authority. If there was no other clauſe, it might be ſo. But let the queſtion be examined. The gentlemen then reſort to another clauſe, viz. <q>This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the laws of the United States which ſhall be made in purſuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which ſhall be made under the authority of the United States, ſhall be the ſupreme law of the land.</q> Here they ſtop again, and if there were no other words, it would ſeem to ſupport their doctrine. But the clauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains itſelf, <q>and the judges in every ſtate ſhall be bound thereby, any thing in the conſtitution or laws of any ſtate to the contrary notwithſtanding.</q> Can any thing be more evident, that this clauſe relates to former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of particular ſtates? It was neceſſary that the conſtitution and laws of each ſtate ſhould yield to the general Government. Gentlemen finding difficulties oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, contend for the ſupremacy of treaties over all laws. It is admitted the clauſes of the conſtitution will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this: and he would aſk where they found the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that treaties are ſuperior to laws? Gentlemen ſay that it is from the nature of things. He believed the reverſe. In this point he differed from the gentleman from Pennſylvania; for he would contend that laws could annul treaties, but that treaties could not annul laws. This being a new doctrine, he would beg leave to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate it. He inferred it from the nature of the two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Gentlemen aſſert that treaties cannot be repealed, becauſe they conſiſt of two parts, and nothing leſs than the conſent of both, or war, can annul them. He would aſk that Houſe, if they ever heard of a convention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two foreign nations for this purpoſe? if it could be done, he ſhould wiſh another envoy extraordinary to be appointed and ſent to repeal this treaty. But no ſuch meeting having ever taken place, from whence comes this
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030221_0015_0FE52786AE88F6C0"/>
theory? But is it reaſonable that laws ſhould repeal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Yes. But why? becauſe laws were the expreſſion of the national will, through its proper organ.</p>
               <p>It is admitted on all hands, ſaid Mr. Giles, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs has the power of declaring war; ſuppoſe it did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war with Great Britain, would not the treaty be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled? would the treaty operate during the war? No. At leaſt that part of it which ſpeaks of mutual amity, would be deſtroyed. He would go farther, the treaty makes an equalization of duties in the Canada trade. Could not this regulation be repealed? but this it might be ſaid, would lead to war. That might be; but he contended for the right. He ſaid that a law pro tanto renders the treaty void. Suppoſe Great Britain by her parliament, were to repeal any law relative the treaty, what would be the conſequence? Great Britain would make herſelf reſponſible. True; but ſhe might do it. Treaties were ſaid not to be repealable; was not that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the laws of the United States were like the laws of the Medes and Perſians, which change not? if gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men took time to examine the doctrine they would find it leſs ſound than they expected.</p>
               <p>In proportion as an authority was ſuppoſed to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited or undefined, in the ſame proportion was the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a check upon it. When he looked into the conſtitution, he found this check. Would it not, indeed have been the height of folly in the people to have given unbounded power with reſpect to making treaties, whilſt ſome of the regulations in the conſtitution give inſtances of well founded jealouſy in their rulers? if the doctrine contended for were juſt, it would afford a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the folly of the American people.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution, he ſaid, contained a diſtribution of powers. It had three diſtinct checks. The firſt related to the different ſpecies of authority. Each diſtinct au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was placed in ſeparate hands. The next was, the ſame ſpecies of authority is placed in two different branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the government, which renders a concurrence of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion neceſſary to any act. Another check, or denial of
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030221_0016_0FE52777E17FFD20"/>
authority altogether, was the qualified veto of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>As an inſtance of the caution which the people thought neceſſary againſt the encroachment of power, it was made an article of the conſtitution that no appropriation for an army could he made for more than two years. By which it appears that they were not ſatisfied, though they had provided that there ſhould be a concurrence of ſentiment in the Senate and Legiſlature, but determined to prevent the poſibility of keeping up an army eſtabliſhment longer than neceſſary. Another check was the biennial elections, as every new election was conſidered as a freſh check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the executive. No one will doubt that this was the motive; and the doctrine at preſent inſiſted on, ſeemed to ſhew the neceſſity of this caution.</p>
               <p>The checks on the treaty making power might conſiſt of ſeveral parts; he ſhould rely upon two. The firſt was, the neceſſity for the concurrence of that Houſe to give the efficacy to a treaty whenever it embraces any object which is contained in the power given by the conſtitution to Congreſs. The Preſident and Senate, it is acknowledged, have power to make treaties; but who have the power to regulate commerce? Congreſs. Who have the power to declare war? Congreſs. Who have the power to raiſe armies? Congreſs. Gentlemen talked much about the will of the people. If he <hi>adored any thing on earth, he ſaid, it was the will of the people.</hi> The queſtion was, what was the will of the people? That will was expreſſed in the conſtitution. And that Houſe, being the direct repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people, might be reaſonably ſuppoſed to be the repreſentatives of the public will; and it was neceſſary, therefore, that they ſhould concur in a meaſure of ſo great importance as that of a commerical treaty. But gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſeem to ſpeak of that Houſe as mere cyphers. What was the oath they took on taking their ſeats? Not to ſit ſilent to ſee the rights of the people invaded; but to guard the conſtitution. Shall they them ſhrink from their duty; be truſted they would not.</p>
               <p>The other check to the treaty making power, was that of the right of appropriation placed in Congreſs. <q>No
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030221_0017_0FE527A0713171E0"/>
money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of appropriations made by law.</q> Whence came this caution? From the ſame ſpirit which dictated the other checks in the conſtitution. Without an appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no miſchief can be effected. He would aſk the meaning of the word law? Law, ſaid he, is a rule of conduct preſcribed by competent authority, Does the law mentioned in this clauſe refer to the treaty making power? No. What does it mean? It refers to Congreſs and not to the treaty making power, then the law neceſſary to make appropriation is the exerciſe of the whole of the authority appointed by the people to make laws. But gentlemen finding that a new diſtinction muſt be made with reſpect to diſcrimination, have undertaken a new definition. The gentleman from Connecticut, ſpeaking on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, aſked whether all diſtinction was to be diſclaimed? No, he ſaid they were to exerciſe ſound diſcretion; but he was at a loſs to know what diſcretion was left them, if they might not refuſe to appropriate money to carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to effect what appeared to them miſchievous. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from South Carolina attempted to define this ſort of diſcretion, and finiſhed his remarks by ſaying, that they could never have a right to do wrong. But this did not define their idea. He would undertake to define the diſcretion they ſet up, it was a predeſtinated diſcretion, not giving its votaries a power of choice, but impelling them by neceſſity. Indeed the whole force of the remarks of gentlemen, was to recommend an eaſy, docile kind of diſcretion, which would be influenced by the opinions of others. Some gentlemen finding this doctrine would not do, have taken what they call moral obligation as their ground. He hoped they would give up conſtitutional ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, becauſe he believed a conſtitutional obligation was a moral one alſo.</p>
               <p>There had been much difficulty, he ſaid, with reſpect to moral obligation. The exerciſe of moral ſenſe was put in the diſcrimination of the Preſident and Senate, in their having made a treaty which gentlemen ſay binds that Houſe to carry it into effect. He always underſtood that moral ſenſe muſt reſide in an agent. There was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtance of it in Great Britain, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, becauſe their King can do no wrong. This
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030221_0018_0FE52879E3F04970"/>
brought him again to the word law. It was ſaid they intended to repeal the treaty. No. They claimed a power to refuſe the paſſing of a law—a mere negative power. When he was called upon to paſs a law, was he to do it without conſideration? Legiſlation neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly includes deliberation. It was the meaning of it. How then can a Legiſlature be addreſſed in this language, <q>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we acknowledge you are a legiſlative body, yet, in this caſe, you have no right to diſcuſs the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the treaty which you are to appropriate money to carry into effect,</q> The gentleman from Connecticut, who was entitled to much praiſe for his ability and ingenuity, ſaid he could exerciſe his opinion as a citizen upon the treaty, but not as a legiſlator. He could not enter into this diſtinction; for every opinion which he formed as a citizen, he held as a legiſlator. Gentlemen ſhould conſider that in paſſing a law, they were on legiſlative and not on executive ground. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him that theſe opinions had been foſtered by gentlemen who were in the habit of aſſociating together, and conſidered to have more force than they will be found to poſſeſs. He had been told that pulpit orators were leſs able to ſupport an argument than other men, from their dictatorial habits; and he believed the gentlemen who ſupported the arguments in favour of prerogative, though they appeared ſmooth and feaſible, would find a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſupporting them.</p>
               <p>They had been told it was unfair to make alluſions to the Britiſh Houſe of Commons.—The reference had been made for two purpoſes, viz, to ſhew the practicability and the uſe of the check inſiſted upon, as it is fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in that government. When prerogative was the queſtion, thoſe gentlemen who now oppoſe the appeal, are themſelves the firſt to make it; and he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that in the year 1796, the Britiſh Houſe of Commons would have been acknowledged to poſſeſs greater privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than the Legiſlature of the United States; but this was the fact, that they were ſtruggling for popular rights, and obliged to refer to Britain to ſtrengthen their claim. He acknowledged that the Britiſh Conſtitution was made up of cuſtoms, but theſe were their Conſtitution equally with their written one. The clauſe of their Conſtitution which
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030221_0019_0FE528492ECCAEB0"/>
forbids the drawing of money from the Treaſury but by law, is copied from the Engliſh practice; but now an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made to wreſt this privilege from their hands. If checks are neceſſary, ſaid Mr. Giles, no danger can ariſe from multiplying them, but were the contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to prevail, it would lead to this, that the Preſident and Senate might reduce that Houſe from the real and efficient, to mere formal guardians of the people.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid, that when a treaty is made by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, with the approbation of two thirds of the Senate, it is the ſupreme law of the land, and they were bound to obey it. It ſhould be recollected, that about three years ago, Congreſs was occupied in diſcuſſing the neceſſary meaſures to be purſued with reſpect to Great Britain. The Houſe of repreſentatives differed in opinion from the other branches. They deemed it adviſable not to truſt ſolely on the magnanimity of the king, nor to any of his other qualities; ſeveral regulations were propoſed. What was done? Certain meaſures were agreed upon in that Houſe, ſent to the Senate, but there negatived by the preſiding voice only. A negociator was then appointed, and the conſequence has been found to be a treaty, which goes to an inhibition of the powers of that Houſe, which gives a power to legiſlate againſt legiſlation. He would not ſay what evil conſequences might ariſe from ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. He only remarked upon the evil of a treaty making power, which would oblige that Houſe to grant money to carry into effect meaſures which might be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the public intereſt.</p>
               <p>The difference of opinion which he had mentioned, was not the only inſtance in which the Senate and that Houſe diſagreed in ſentiment. He believed the Senate paſſed two or three bills to increaſe the military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which were negatived by them. The doctrine of checks was fully illuſtrated. If, the Preſident and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate can, by the aſſociation of a foreign power, legiſlate and bind their meaſures concluſively on that Houſe, may they not go on to any extent? what ſecurity have the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt ſuch a power? the treaty in queſtion is yet open for farther negociation. Suppoſe Great Britain on
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030221_0020_0FE529B88B7CFE88"/>
pretence of guarding her frontier, were to ſend 10,000 troops into Canada; and ſuppoſe the United States were to raiſe 10,000 men to keep the Indians in order. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the thing was preſented to that Houſe, not for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, but obedience, what could be done? how would this operate with reſpect to appropriation? the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation might be for ten or twenty years, they could not withhold appropriations, becauſe, it is ſaid, they are under a moral obligation to do it. Ought they not, then, to be cautious how they admitted the extravagant doctrine laid down? he aſked what were the feelings of the people in general, on account of the injuries received from a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nation? did they wiſh to rely upon the magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Britiſh monarch? No; they wiſhed a redreſs of grievances, not a ſurrender of rights or a conceſſion of intereſts.</p>
               <p>The doctrine eſpouſed by gentlemen in oppoſition to this motion, would cut up all checks, all power of thinking in the legiſlative body on occaſions where treaties inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. This was not all. Two of theſe gentlemen had aſſerted, that if that Houſe went into a diſcuſſion of the treaty, it would be rebellion againſt the other authorities. What, ſaid he, can juſtify ſuch language? might it not be replied that they were deſtroying the liberties of their conſtituents, and ſo the debate end in abuſe? gentlemen can have little reſpect for the opinions of thoſe who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them in ſentiment, who give way to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. Another argument which had been a common place one, was, that the effect of any hindrance to carrying into effect this treaty, would be the diſorganizing of the government. He ſuppoſed that the propoſition before the Houſe, with the negative vote inſiſted on, as the right of that aſſembly, was a ſort of acquaſortis which was to eat up the whole powers of government. Suppoſe, ſaid he, there ſhould be a vote that the treaty ſhould not be carried into effect, would not that Houſe go on with its buſineſs as uſual? ſurely it would. There was not the leaſt foundation for ſuch aſſertions. They were mere clamour; a voice, and nothing beſides. Whenever the different branches of government, inſtead of checking each other, coalefeed together, and confidence in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive is the only ſecurity for good government, the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030221_0021_0FE528C01D79F5A0"/>
ſyſtem will be reduced indeed. But even then, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican people would not be intimidated by any military eſtabliſhment; for, finding the inefficacy of proper checks in their government, they would unitedly reſiſt any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to deprive them of their liberties.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid that certain advantages were to be derived to the United States from the late treaty, but he knew not of what ſort. And, he exclaimed, is the government of the United States brought to ſo low an ebb, as to be indebted to foreign nations for aid? if it was, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by and by new conceſſions would be made, for further ſervices. But if it be once underſtood, that there is not ſufficient merits in the government to ſecure the affections of the people, but that the Preſident and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate muſt lean on Great Britain for ſupport, to what a lamentable ſituation will the United States be reduced! he believed that if the doctrine attempted to be ſupported were to prevail, and by that means to deſtroy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of checks, the deſpotiſm of a Preſident and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Senators (he did not mean the preſent Preſident and Senators) might operate to an aſſociation of Deſpotiſm, which, if ever effected, muſt be by coercive meaſures.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles ſaid he might be miſtaken, but there was certainly an attempt to eſtabliſh principles leading to that end. He ſpoke of calumnies which had been ſpread abroad againſt him, but which he diſdained to anſwer. He left his conduct to ſpeak for him. If the public were to be led aſtray by declamations about war, diſorganization and confuſion, very little reliance could be placed on them. He concluded, by ſaying, that he hoped the importance of the ſubject, and his earneſt wiſh to retain the wholeſome proviſions againſt the poſſibility of incroachments upon the liberties of the people, would be a ſufficient apology for having ſo long engaged the attention of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee.</p>
               <p>The taſk of anſwering this artful ſpeech fell to Mr. Sedgwick. How he acquitted himſelf the reader will ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:030221_0022_0FE5292518B2F3C8"/>Mr. SEDGWICK (Maſſachuſetts) ſaid that after the length of time which had been conſumed, and the talents which had been ſo ably exerted, in the diſcuſſion of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he ſhould not think himſelf authoriſed to call the attention of the committee, to any obſervations of his, but that he conſidered it in principle, and in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as the moſt important queſtion, which had ever been debated in this Houſe. It was no leſs, than whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Houſe ſhould, by conſtruction and implication, extend its controuling influence to ſubjects which were expreſsly, and he thought excluſively, delegated by the people to another department of the Government. We had heretofore been warned emphatically againſt ſeizing on power, by conſtruction and implication. He had known no inſtance, in which the caution which that warning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, deſerved more attention than on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>It muſt, he ſaid, have been foreſeen by the author of the motion, that it would ultimately be conteſted on the preſent ground. No ſufficient reaſon had been given as an object for the call. The various reaſons which had been hinted at, had hardly been ſuggeſted, before they were reſpectively abandoned. It would be remembered, and indeed had been avowed, that a requeſt ſuch as the preſent, was in nature of a demand. That, it was true, if we had an authority on the ſubject of forming treaties, we had a right to all the means of exerciſing an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent diſcretion; and the demand, of courſe, was well founded. But if we had no ſuch authority, and we had none unleſs it could be diſcovered in the Conſtitution, then the demand had no good foundation on which it could reſt, and was in his opinion, an attempt at ſeizing on power by uſurpation.</p>
               <p>He was perfectly ſenſible in how diſagreeable an atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude a man would ſtand, who ſhould attempt to limit the extent of power, claimed by an aſſembly to which he ſhould addreſs himſelf. He had ſome of the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations of human nature to contend with. He felt the full force of the influence of this principle, as it would afford the cauſe of repulſion and reſiſtance, to the arguments which he might ſubmit. But having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030221_0023_0FE528C335E1B380"/>
an opinion, perfectly ſatisfactory to his own mind, from the beſt light which honeſt inveſtigation could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, he thought it a duty he owed his country and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, a duty rendered more indiſpenſable, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which were upon him to obey the will of the people, expreſſed in the Conſtitution of their government, which he had ſworn to ſupport, ſolemnly to declare that opinion and the reaſons on which it was founded.</p>
               <p>He in his conſcience believed, that if the Conſtitution could operate the benefits its original inſtitution intended, that if the government ſhould be rendered adequate to the protection of liberty and the ſecurity of the people: it muſt be, by keeping its ſevaral departments diſtinct, and within their preſcribed limits. Hence that man would give as good evidence of republicaniſm, of virtue, of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love of country, who ſhould defend the executive in the exerciſe of his conſtitutional rights, as the man who ſhould contend for any other department of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If either ſhould uſurp the appropriate powers of another, anarchy, confuſion or deſpotiſm muſt enſue. The functions of the uſurping power would not be legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate but their exerciſe, deſpotiſm. If the power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling treaties was not in the Houſe, the ſame ſpirit which might uſurp it, might alſo declare the exiſtence of the Houſe perpetual and fill the vacancies as they ſhould occur. The merits of the preſent queſtion it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be agreed, depended on this right; it was of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite importance therefore to decide it juſtly.</p>
               <p>It would be taken for granted that it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, on all hands, that we were to reſort to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, to know the extent and limits of our power, and that if we found not there a clear evidence of its exiſtence, we ought to abandon the exerciſe. It was certain we had not any expreſs delegation to make or to controul the public will in any of our relations with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations. On the other hand we found it declared, that the Preſident ſhould <hi>have power to make treaties, by and with the advice and conſent of the Senate, provided two thirds of the Senators preſent concurred.</hi> Treaties to attain the ends for which they were deſigned were from their nature ſupreme laws: but the Conſtitution had in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030221_0024_0FE5298B632B2898"/>
place declared, that treaties made under the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the United States ſhould be ſupreme laws. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen had ſaid that it was not declared that treaties made by the <hi>Preſident and Senate</hi> ſhould have this effect; but thoſe made under the <hi>authority of the United States.</hi> The queſtion then recurred what treaties were made under the <hi>authority of the United States.</hi> The true anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was, treaties made by thoſe, to whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by their Conſtitution, had delegated the power. The Preſident, qualified as had been mentioned, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly and none elſe had ſuch power. If we were to reſt the ſubject here, it would ſeem to follow irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to be incapable almoſt of higher proof, that whenever a compact was formed by the Preſident, with a foreign nation, and had received the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Senate, if it was of ſuch a nature as to be properly denominated a treaty, all its ſtipulations would thereby and from that moment become "ſupreme laws."</p>
               <p>That ſuch had been the conſtruction from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the government to the promulgation of the Britiſh treaty, he believed, would be univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and but for that treaty, probably, never would have been denied. Did this afford no evidence, that the conſtruction was a juſt one. Was the ſubject a leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant one, its deciſion might be ſafely truſted on this ground. But all important as it was for the purpoſe of further inveſtigation, it might be uſeful to conſider the nature, extent, objects and effects of this power.</p>
               <p>What authority was then delegated under a grant of power to form treaties; did not the term <hi>Treaty</hi> include all ſtipulations between independent nations, relative to ſubjects, in which the contracting parties, had a mutual or common intereſt? if it had a more confined or limited ſenſe it became thoſe who contended for it, to make the limits and deſignate the boundaries. Without a power ſo extenſive, much of the benefits reſulting from amicable intercourſe, between independent nations, would be loſt; and diſputes and differences, which are inevitable, would have no means of amicable termination. From the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious utility and indeed the abſolute neceſſity, that ſuch power ſhould be exerciſed, we know of no civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030221_0025_0FE528C4B8A1BDE0"/>
either ancient or modern, which had not provided the organs of negociation, to the extent ſubſtantially which he had mentioned. The power indiſpenſible had always been delegated, though guards had been provided againſt its abuſe by different means:</p>
               <p>It was not now to be enquired, whether the power of treating was wiſely depoſited, (although he was inclined to believe it could not be intruſted to ſafer hands.) It was ſufficient that thoſe who had the right, the citizens of America, had declared their will, which we were bound to reſpect, becauſe we had ſworn to ſupport it, and becauſe we were their deputies.</p>
               <p>The power of treating between independent nations might be claſſed under the following heads. 1. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and adjuſt differences whether to terminate or to prevent war. 2. To form contracts for mutual ſecurity or defence; or to make treaties offenſive or defenſive. 3. To regulate an intercourſe for mutual benefit, or to form treaties of commerce. Without the firſt war and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention could only be terminated, by the deſtruction of one of the parties: without the ſecond there could be no defence, by means of union and concurrence, againſt ſuperior force, and without the laſt, a profitable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial intercouſe, could not be arranged on terms of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity. Hence, then, it muſt be evident to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind, that by a grant of power to make trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, authority was given to bind the nation by ſtipulations to preſerve peace or terminate war—to enter into alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances offenſive and defenſive, and to form commercial treaties.</p>
               <p>This power, he held, unlimited by the conſtitution, and he held, too, that in its nature, to the extent he had mentioned, it was illimitable. Did a ſerious difference exiſt with a foreign nation, in determining on the nature and extent of the ſtipulations which might be neceſſary to adjuſt it; the cauſe of injury—national rights and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour—the evils of war, and all circumſtances of relation between the two countries, muſt be taken into account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:030221_0026_0FE529AAE80E8058"/>In forming alliances, the threatened preſſure, your own and your enemies relative ſtrength, the objects of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or defence, muſt be conſidered. And in adjuſting an equitable intercourſe for commercial purpoſes, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand circumſtances preſent themſelves for nice calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. A thouſand circumſtances of foreign relations would occur in the hiſtory of every country, under which nothing ſhort of unlimited powers of negociation would be adequate to a prevention of enormous perhaps ruinous evils.</p>
               <p>But it might be objected that a power ſo enormous, and comprehending ſuch eſſential intereſts might be abuſed, and thence aſked, where is the remedy? to this he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that a national aſſociation required, for the great purpoſe of preſervation, an unlimited confidence on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubjects. Hence not only this, but perhaps every other national government, had delegated to it, an unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed controul over the perſons and property of the nation. It might, by the expreſs power given to it of raiſing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, convert every citizen into a ſoldier, and by a ſingle aſſeſſment of a tax, it might command the uſe of all the property in the country.</p>
               <p>The power to raiſe armies and taxes was limited in its exerciſe by nothing but the diſcretion of the Legiſlature, under the direction of its prudence, wiſdom and virtue. Was there no ſecurity againſt a wanton abuſe of theſe enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous powers? yes; it was to be hoped that the people in electing the members of this Houſe, and the ſtates in chuſing thoſe of the other, would not ſelect characters, who regardleſs of the public good would wantonly impoſe on their conſtituents unneceſſary burthens. It would be an additional ſecurity that the intereſts of the rulers, were inſeparably connected, with thoſe of the people— that they could impoſe no burthens in which themſelves did not equally participate. But ſhould all thoſe guards be inſufficient, was there no dependence to be placed in the Preſident? the man elected by a refined proceſs, pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in fame and virtue as in rank? was there no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the watchful guardianſhip of ſuch a character re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible by every thing dear and valuable to man—his reputation, his own and his fellow citizens happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030221_0027_0FE528F17888BF70"/>
was there no well founded reliance on all theſe conſiderations, for ſecurity againſt oppreſſion? if not, we had not the requiſite materials, with which to adminiſter a republican government, and the project might be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.—After all however, ſhould the unlimited powers he had mentioned, and ſuch powers muſt always be unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, be wantonly abuſed, was there no remedy? yes, in the good ſenſe and manly independent ſpirit of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. If intolerable burthens were wantonly impoſed, if neceſſary to defeat the oppreſſion, oppoſition and inſurrection would not only be authorized, but become a duty. And if any man could honeſtly lay his hand on his heart, and in ſincerity declare, that a compliance with an exiſting treaty, was worth more than our government, our conſtitution, our union and the liberty protected by them; to that man he was ready to declare, that oppoſition had become a duty. Gentlemen had ſpoken of the ſubject, as if the members of this Houſe were the only repreſentatives of the people, as their only protectors againſt the uſurpations and oppreſſions of the other departments of government. Who then he aſked were the Senators? were they unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyrants, whoſe intereſts were ſeparated from and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thoſe of the people? No. Did they poſſeſs hereditary power and honours? No. Who, as contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by the conſtitution, were they? the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and the moſt virtuous of our citizens. What was the ſource from whence they derive their elevation? from the confidence of the people, and the free choice of their electors. Who were thoſe electors? not an ignorant herd, who could be cajoled, flattered and deceived, not even the body of the enlightened American citizens: but their legiſlatures—men to whom the real characters of the candidates would be known. For what purpoſes were they elected? to repreſent the moſt eſſential intereſts of their country—As the guardians of the ſovereignty of the ſtates, the happineſs of the people and their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties—Who as contemplated by the conſtitution was the Preſident? the man elected, by means intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the operation of faction and ambition, as the one beſt entitled to public confidence and eſteem—And was no confidence to be repoſed in ſuch characters, thus elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? might it not, to ſay no more, be at leaſt doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030221_0028_0FE529AC69DD9720"/>
the treating power might not be as ſafely intruſted in ſuch hands excluſively, as with the participation and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the controul of the more numerous branch of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, elected in ſmall diſtricts, aſſailed by party and faction, and expoſed to influence and intrigue? whatever merits this as an original queſtion might poſſeſs, the people had decided their will. To the Preſident and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate they have given powers to make treaties, they have given no ſuch powers to this Houſe.</p>
               <p>It was not in his opinion, proper when inveſtigating the conſtitutional queſtion of the extent of a particular power and in what hands it was depoſited, to divert the attention to a poſſible abuſe of that power. Should it become a queſtion whether Congreſs was by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution authoriſed to raiſe armies, and the extent to which the power might be exerciſed, it would be unfair and improper to divert the attention from the enquiry of what was the truth, to the abuſe which might reſult from the exerciſe of the power—To ſtate that if ſuch power exiſted, every citizen might by the wanton abuſe of it, be degraded from his rank and ſubjected to the deſpotiſm of a military diſcipline. To ſhew that armies might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as the inſtruments of deſtroying liberty—To picture your country as ſtrewed with human carcaſſes and ſtained with human blood by their means. What would this be but to ſubſtantiate prejudices inſtead of arguments? ſtill however it would remain true, that the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to raiſe armies, was only limited, by its diſcretion, under the direction of wiſdom and patriotiſm. The ſame obſervations changing their relations, may with equal juſtneſs be applied to the treaty making power. To be, and continue a nation, required on theſe ſubjects unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confidence in the delegation of the neceſſary powers. The people had granted them and provided, againſt their abuſe, ſuch guard as their wiſdom dictated.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madiſon) had ſtated five different conſtructions which poſſibly might be given to the conſtitution on this ſubject. Three of which (and for none of them to Mr. Sedgwick's knowledge had any man ever contended) the gentleman had proved to be unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The fourth, that which we had given to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030221_0029_0FE529CA10A5BFD0"/>
if admitted, and it ſhould be abuſed might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce miſchievous effects. Was not this true of all the great and eſſential powers of government? if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouling influence of the Houſe was added would the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be leſs? and if under theſe circumſtances, abuſed would the injury be more tolerable? in ſhort was not this a kind of argument infinitely more tending to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of prejudice than to the diſcovery of truth?</p>
               <p>The gentleman had really given no deciſive opinion what was the true conſtruction. He had however ſeemed to incline to a belief, that to the ſtipulation of a treaty relative to any ſubject committed to the controul of the Legiſlature, to give it validity, legiſlative co-operation was neceſſary. Of conſequence if this was withheld, the operation of the treaty would be defeated. That it was at the will and within the diſcretion of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to withhold ſuch co-operation, and of courſe the Houſe might controul and defeat the ſolemn engagements of the Preſident and Senate.</p>
               <p>The gentleman who had ſuggeſted this opinion was well known to the committee and through America. Mr. Sedgwick could not but obſerve, that it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unaccountable to his mind, that that gentleman had yet to form an opinion to whom was delegated that power, the nature, extent and effects of which he had ſo ſtrongly and perſpicuouſly detailed. The capacity of that gentleman's mind, long exerciſed on political ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, his known caution and prudence, would authorize a requeſt, that he or his friends would explain, how it was poſſible, if ſuch as he ſtates ſhould have been the intention of thoſe who framed the Conſtitution, that the true meaning ſhould not have been expreſſed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments? that when the gentleman went from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly which framed the Conſtitution, immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to one of thoſe which ratified it; he ſhould have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an oppoſite conſtruction. As Mr. Sedgwick would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take by and by to prove that in the Convention of Virginia he did admit the very conſtruction for which we now contended. He would take the liberty further to enquire, how it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that if ſuch was really the intention of the inſtrument, that ſuch was the meaning of the people, no man had
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030221_0030_0FE529CCD0C47718"/>
heard of it, until the diſcovery was produced, by the Britiſh treaty? ſtrange national intention unknown for years, to every individual!—As the gentleman had been pleaſed to dwell on the idea of a co-operation between the powers of the government, he would take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſtate what had been ably explained by other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the power of making treaties was wholly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of making ordinary laws, originating from different motives, producing different effects and operating to a different extent. In all thoſe particulars the difference had been perfectly underſtood. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ordinary legal protection of property and the puniſhment of its violation could never be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your own juriſdiction, but by treaty, the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection could be extended within the juriſdiction of a foreign government. You could not legiſlate an adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſputes, nor a peace with another country, but by treaty both might be effected. Your laws in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance could operate except in your own juriſdiction, and on your own citizens; by treaty an operation was given to ſtipulations, within the juriſdiction of both the contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties.</p>
               <p>It had been ſaid that treaties would not operate on thoſe ſubjects which were conſigned to legiſlative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. "If this be true," ſaid he, <q>how impotent in this reſpect is the power of the government? what, then permit me to enquire can the power of treating effect? I will tell you what it cannot do—it can make no alliances, becauſe any ſtipulations for offenſive or defenſive operations will infringe on the legiſlative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of declaring war, laying taxes or raiſing armies or all of them. No treaty of peace can probably be made which will not either aſcertain boundaries, ſtipulate privileges to aliens, the payment of money or a ceſſion of territory, and certainly no treaty of commerce can be made.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Was it not ſtrange that to this late hour it ſhould have been delayed, and that now all at once it ſhould have been diſcovered, that no power was delegated to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to regulate our foreign relations? that although a power was granted to the Preſident and Senate to form
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030221_0031_0FE528C63B7E5CA8"/>
treaties, that yet there were ſuch reſervations and reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, that there remained nothing on which this power could operate? or was it true that this power, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to treat with every government on earth but that of Great Britain? might he not be permitted further to enquire if this treaty had been formed with any other power, with the preciſe ſtipulations it now contained, whether there ever could have exiſted this doubt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionality?</p>
               <p>We had, he ſaid, entered into treaties of commerce with many nations, we had formed an alliance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a guarantee with France, we had gived conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar power including judicial authority to the citizens of that country, within our own juriſdiction, we had defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed piracies and provided for their puniſhment, we have removed the diſabilities of alienage, we had granted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies and ceded territory: all this and much more we had done, while the power of the government remained unqueſtioned and none even thought that ſuch treaties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired legiſlative co-operation. Treaties ſuch as thoſe could without oppoſition and by unanimous conſent be ratified and conſidered by force of ſuch ratification as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme laws; but ſimilar ſtipulations with Great Britain, were clearly perceived to be unconſtitutional, and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Envoy and Senate were denounced for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective agency as infractors of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The objection which he had juſt anſwered had been brought forward by a gentleman from Pennſylvania [Mr. Gallatin] with another nearly allied to it, if not reſting on preciſely the ſame foundation—that whatever ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a treaty required legiſlative proviſion or repealed a law, did not become a ſupreme law, until it had received le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative ſanction. There was no limitation expreſſed in the conſtitution on which to found either of thoſe objections. If we claimed the power which the objections imported the claim muſt reſt on conſtruction and implication alone. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole reaſoning of the gentlemen ſeemed to him to be capable of being expreſſed in a few words. <q>The Preſident and Senate, in the ſole and uncontrouled exerciſe of the treaty making power, may ſacrifice the moſt important intereſts of the people. The Houſe
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030221_0032_0FE528F31F59D160"/>
of Repreſentative is more worthy the public confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and therefore by our influence we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the abuſe of power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The gentleman, to prove his poſition ſtated that the power of treating in Great Britain and the United States is preciſely the ſame. He then had read a paſſage from Judge Blackſtone <q>that the ſovereign power of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with foreign nations was veſted in the perſon of the king, and that any contract he engaged in, no power in the kingdom could delay, reſiſt or annul.</q> At the ſame time he ſaid that certain treaties, ſuch as thoſe of ſubſidy and commerce were not binding until ratified by parliament. Now both theſe could not be true; for it was no leſs than a direct contradiction in terms to ſay, that there was no power in the nation which could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, reſiſt or annul the contracts of the king, and at the ſame time to ſay, there was a power in the nation. The parliament, which could delay, reſiſt and annul thoſe contracts. Both the aſſertions could not be true. He was willing however to allow that the treaties which the gentlemen had mentioned were not the ſupreme laws of that country until approved by the legiſlature. He had already ſaid that different countries had provided different guards, againſt the abuſe of this power. But why attempt to divert our attention from a conſtruction of our own conſtitution, to the vague uncertain cuſtoms and practices of other countries? why compare the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Senate to the king of Great Britain? in what was there a reſemblance? in nothing. Why then perplex the ſubject by the introduction of irrelative matter? was there perceived an intereſt in a diverſion from the only le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate ſource of information the declared will of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? if we found not there the power we claimed, we could exerciſe it only by uſurpation.</p>
               <p>Why did not gentlemen extend their reaſoning further? where in point of principle was the difference between reſtraining and controuling the legiſlative power? the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury may be as great in the one inſtance as in the other; nor is there any more foundation for denying to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Senate the power in the one caſe than in the other, from any words or expreſſions in the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:030221_0033_0FE529D374D350C0"/>If the gentlemen are right in their conſtruction, if this was the underſtanding of the people at the time they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated on and ratified the conſtitution, the power of the Preſident and Senate of making treaties which then created the moſt ſerious deliberation and alarming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion was the moſt innocent thing in nature. It could bind the eſſential intereſts of the nation in nothing. Could any man really believe that the agitation which a diſcuſſion of this ſubject occaſioned, more perhaps than any other in the conſtitution, could have for its object only the power of the Preſident and Senate, in which two thirds of the latter muſt concur, to digeſt ſchemes of treaties to be laid before the legiſlature for its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation?</p>
               <p>The gentleman from New York (Mr. Havens) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) had aſſerted the power of the legiſlature to repeal treaties—whenever the wiſdom of Congreſs ſhould concur in opinion, with theſe gentlemen we ſhould then ceaſe to contend reſpecting the conſtruction of the conſtitution on this ſubject. For whenever our nation ſhould in defiance of every principle of morality and common honeſty, by uſurpation eſtabliſh its right, to proſtrate national honor, by ſporting with the public faith, no nation would ſubmit to be contaminated by a connexion with one which avowed the right of viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its faith by the infraction of ſolemn treaties.</p>
               <p>On all ſubjects of this ſort the real enquiry was and ought to be, what was the intention of the parties to this inſtrument. Hence a brief review of ſome intereſting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, which took place at the adoption of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would not be impertinent, but might be uſeful.</p>
               <p>A cotemporaneous expoſition of any inſtrument, and eſpecially by thoſe who were agents in its fabrication, had been allowed, and was in fact among the beſt guides to finding its true meaning. Gentlemen who had been members of the convention, and unfriendly to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, with an intention of preventing its adoption, had ſtated to their conſtituents that the power of making treaties as conſided to the Preſident and Senate was as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as was now contended for. Their intention would
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030221_0034_0FE529639A443670"/>
have been no other than to alarm the people with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extent and what would be the pernicious exerciſe of this power. If this charge was unjuſt and groundleſs, what would have have been the conduct of the friends of that inſtrument? they would have proved the charge mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ill founded. They would have ſhewn that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was not liable to ſuch an objection. That it could bear no ſuch conſtruction. They would in the language of novel diſcovery have ſaid, that every ſubject of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was an exception from the power of making treaties; and thus they would have proved to the world, that the ſages of our country, had deviſed and offered to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened countrymen a ſcheme of government deſtitute, by an expreſs delegation, of the the eſſential attribute of adjuſting differences with other nations; and of agreeing with them on the terms of amicable intercourſe. But they did no ſuch thing—they admitted the power, proved the neceſſity of it and contended that it would be ſafe in practice. <q>Let me here, ſaid he, appeal to any unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced man, if he can poſſibly believe that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the conſtitution could have made the charge againſt it, and that its friends would have admitted the truth of it, on the hypotheſis that it was unfounded and falſe.</q> They certainly knew what they had ſo recent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended, and having oppoſite objects in view which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited their ſtrongeſt wiſhes, it was impoſſible they ſhould agree in impoſing on the people a falſe and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſtruction. So far had he extended his reflections as reſulting from the conduct of thoſe who formed the conſtitution; a conduct from which he flattered himſelf there flowed demonſtration, that the power of making treaties was as extenſive as that which was now contended for. This being the concurrence of men who could not have united to deceive, with regard to which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould be miſtaken, formed a guide for their opinion, which could not miſlead, which no degree of ſtupidity could miſtake, nor the moſt ingenious ſophiſtry ſucceſsfully miſrepreſent.</p>
               <p>So much he had thought proper to ſay as reſpected the conſtruction given to this part of the inſtrument by thoſe who formed, who could not miſtake, and who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no temptation to miſrepreſent it. It might be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

in the next place enquire under what opinion it was adopted? and if we perceived a correſpondence of conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between thoſe who formed and thoſe who received and approved; we might then ſurely derive all reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfation that we had diſcovered the truth. Here he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it might be aſſerted without any danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that in the ſtate conventions it was on one hand affirmed, that the Preſident and Senate would, by the conſtitution have power to form treaties on any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in which the United States and a foreign nation had a common intereſt, and that treaties ſo formed without any other aid or circumſtance whatever, would thereby become the ſupreme law of the land: and that the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this power was not ſo guarded as to render, it ſafe to the public intereſts. On the other hand, it was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that ſuch was the extent of the power, and it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, at leaſt, to be proved, that it was ſo guarded that danger could not reaſonably be apprehended, from its exerciſe. It would be too tedious and well might be thought unneceſſary to conſult all the materials, which might be within our reach on this ſubject: but he dared appeal to the recollection of every gentleman, who was in a ſituation to know the facts, for the correctneſs of the ſtatement which he had made, and he would read ſome few paſſages, from the debates of the convention of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, which would probably be on this occaſion, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons admitted, as the beſt authority; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly becauſe the ſubject, there was examined by eminent and ſcrupulous inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>He then read ſeveral paſſages to prove the ſtatement which he had made, and ſaid, the conſtruction he contended for was aſſented to by a ſolemn act of the convention which propoſed an amendment, which he alſo read, which would be wholly unneceſſary on any other hypotheſis; and that by the late conduct of the ſame ſtate, in the amendment propoſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it was manifeſt that it ſtill entertained the ſame opinion.</p>
               <p>Mr. SEDGWICK, in the courſe of his ſpeech, read the following extracts from the third volume of <q>debates and proceedings of the Convention of Virginia.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:030221_0036_0FE529C88EC77E38"/>Mr. MASON, <q>thought this a moſt dangerous clauſe. By the confederation, nine ſtates were neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in a treaty. This ſecured juſtice and moderation. His principal fear however, was not that five but ſeven ſtates, a bare majority, would make treaties, to bind the union.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. NICHOLAS ſaid, <q>the approbation of the Preſident, who had no local views, being elected by no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtate, but the people at large, was an additional ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. MADISON <q>thought it aſtoniſhing, that gentlemen ſhould think a treaty ſhould be got with ſurpriſe, or that foreign nations ſhould be ſolicitous to get a treaty ratified by the ſenators of a few ſtates—that ſhould the Preſident ſummon only a few ſtates, he would for ſo atrocious a thing be impeachable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. HENRY, <q>If two thirds of a quorum would be empowered to make a treaty, they might relinquiſh and alienate territorial rights, and our moſt valuable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial advantages; in ſhort, if any thing ſhould be left, it would be becauſe the Preſident and Senate were pleaſed to admit it." The power of making treaties was ill guarded, as it extended farther than it did in any country in the world. "Treaties were to have more force here than in any part of chriſtendom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>(How, Mr. Sedgwick aſked, could this be true, if the doctrine now laid down, in ſupport of the motion, was well founded?)</p>
               <p>Mr. MADISON. <q>Are not treaties the law of the land in England? I will refer you to a book, which is in every man's hand—Blackſtone's Commentaries. It will inform you, that treaties made by the king, are to be the ſupreme laws of the land. If they are to have any efficacy they muſt be the laws of the land. They are ſo in every country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:030221_0037_0FE528D374EA99B0"/>Gov. RANDOLPH. <q>It is ſaid there is no limitation of treaties. I defy the wiſdom of that gentleman to ſhew how they ought to be limited.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. NICHOLAS. <q>Have we not ſeen in America that treaties were violated, though they are in all countries conſidered as the ſupreme laws of the land?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. MASON. <q>It is true, that it is one of the greateſt acts of ſovereignty, and therefore ought to be moſt ſtrongly guarded. The ceſſion of ſuch power without ſuch checks and guards cannot be juſtified—yet I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch a power muſt be ſomewhere. It is ſo in all governments. If in the courſe of an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful war, we ſhould be compelled to give up part of our territories, or undergo ſubjugation, if the general government could not make a treaty to give up ſuch a part, for the preſervation of the reſidue, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf, and conſequently the rights of the people muſt fall. Such a power muſt therefore reſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. For my part, I never heard it denied that ſuch a power muſt be veſted in the government. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is that it is not ſufficiently guarded, and that it requires much more ſolemnity and caution, than are delineated in that ſyſtem.</q>
               </p>
               <p>(Strange, Mr. Sedgwick ſaid, that this gentleman did not diſcover, or was not told, that treaties before they ſhould become laws, muſt receive legiſlative ſanction!)</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There are other things which the king of England cannot do, which may be done by the Preſident and Senate in this caſe. Could the king by his prerogative enable foreign ſubjects to purchaſe lands, and have an hereditary indefeaſible title? will any gentleman ſay, that they (the Preſident and Senate) may not make a treaty, whereby the ſubjects of France, England and other powers may buy what lands they pleaſe in this country? the Preſident and Senate can make any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatſoever. We wiſh not to refuſe but to guard this power, as it is done in England. We wiſh an explicit declaration in that paper, that the power which can make other treaties cannot without the conſent of the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030221_0038_0FE529D642AE62D8"/>
national parliament, the national legiſlature, diſmember the empire. The Senate alone ought not to have this power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. CORBIN (who was in favour of the conſtitution) <q>If there be any found part in the conſtitution, it is in this clauſe. The repreſentatives are excluded from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing in making treaties, becauſe large popular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are very improper to tranſact ſuch buſineſs, from the impoſſibility of their acting with ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, diſpatch and deciſion, which can only be found in ſmall bodies, and are always ſubject to factions and party animoſities. It would be dangerous to give this power to the Preſident alone, as the conceſſion of ſuch a power to one individual, is repugnant to republican principles. It is therefore given to the Preſident and Senate (who repreſent the ſtates in their individual capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities) conjointly. In this it differs from every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we know. It ſteers with admirable dexterity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two extremes—neither leaving it to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive as in moſt other governments, nor to the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, which would too much retard ſuch negociations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That another member of the convention, Mr. Henry, after contending, that the conſtitution ought to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo as to guard againſt the abuſe of the treaty making power, by requiring the conſent of the Houſe, concluded his obſervations by ſaying:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That when <hi>their</hi> conſent is neceſſary there will be a certainty of attending to the public intereſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. MADISON concluded this intereſting debate, not by inſiſting on that ſecurity, which he had now diſcovered the conſtitution to have provided againſt the abuſe of this power: he ſtated:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the power was preciſely in the new conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it was in the confederation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The gentleman ſtated the checks which the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had in fact provided, but it did not then occur to him, that the conſent of this Houſe was amongſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:030221_0039_0FE529D7C72D72B8"/>Mr. Sedgwick then read the amendment which the convention of Virginia propoſed to the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That no commercial treaty ſhall be ratified without the concurrence of two thirds of the whole number of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and no treaty ceding, controuling, reſtraining, or ſuſpending, territorial rights or claims of the United States or any of them, or their or any of their rights or claims to fiſhing in the American ſea, or navigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the American rivers, ſhall be made but in caſes of the moſt urgent neceſſity; nor ſhall any ſuch treaty be ratified without the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both Houſes reſpectively.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had ſtated that the real inquiry was, what opinion was entertained on this ſubject by thoſe who ratified the conſtitution? if that opinion would be diſcovered with honeſt minds, it muſt be concluſive on the preſent debate. He had ſhewn what opinion was entertained by Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia—what power ſhe meant to delegate and to whom. That this opinion remained from that time until ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her late amendments, unaltered, appeared from the amendments themſelves. That ſtate, then, and her repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives here, who had expreſſed themſelves, differed in opinion. He did not mention Virginia with intention of producing any unpleaſant ſenſations. He was willing to allow that ſhe was great, wiſe, intelligent, enlightened, and if gentlemen pleaſed, <hi>moral;</hi> her opinion derived additional authority from her reſpectability.—It was not Virginia alone, but he was perſuaded every other ſtate, had given preciſely the ſame conſtruction.—<hi>That the treaty making power with all its effects and conſequences, was ſolely and excluſively in the Preſident and Senate:</hi> And he would dare to challenge gentlemen to produce a ſolitary inſtance of its being adopted under any other idea. Indeed, the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was at that time produced, would of all things be the moſt ridiculous, if any of the other conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were true. If the power was checked as was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it was impoſſible danger ſhould be apprehended from its exerciſe—it could indeed do neither good nor evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:030221_0040_0FE4FE60906DB040"/>Here then he ſaid we had the evidence of thoſe who framed and of thoſe who received and approved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. There was another ſource of enquiry, which would confirm if it wanted confirmation, that conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for which he had contended. It was the conſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which had been, practically given, by thoſe who had adminiſtered our government, from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our foreign relations, to the preſent ſeſſion—a conſtruction which had been aſſumed, admitted or acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, by our national and ſtate governments and by every individual citizen until they received new light, by our having accomodated our cauſes of contention with Great Britain and eſcaped the evils with which we had been threatened from that ſource.</p>
               <p>The aſſociation which preceded any expreſs contract between the ſtates, was ſuppoſed to imply an authority to form national compacts, impoſing national obligations, and pledging the public faith. Hence our treaty with France, which preceded two years our national aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the confederation, had been ſuppoſed binding on us, and not only obliging us to the faithful performance of our expreſs engagements, but as drawing after it undefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unlimited and perpetual obligations of gratitude. This ſeemed ſo far as reſpected defined obligations, to be a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional deduction from what is an inſeparable attendant on national aſſociations, and without which a nation would be deſtitute, of one of the beſt means of ſecuring its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and even exiſtence,</p>
               <p>To purſue, he ſaid, the hiſtory of our country on this ſubject, in the order of time, it would not be pretended that under the confederation, the powers of Congreſs to form "treaties and aiiiances" were more extenſive than thoſe of the Preſident and Senate under the conſtitution to form "treaties." The legiſlative powers of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then reſiding with the ſeveral ſtates, were as obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the operation of treaties (and extended to all the objects which the national and ſtate legiſlatures now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended) as the congreſſional legiſlature can now be. Yet under the confederation treaties of alliance, of peace, of commerce, were made, nor until the preſent moment has their obligation been denied, though they contained
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030221_0041_0FE528D4F8416DA0"/>
ſtipulations, perhaps, on all the ſubjects to which the treating power could extend. No legiſlative proviſion had been thought neceſſary to give them validity; and he dared appeal to every member of the committee, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enlightened citizen had admitted their binding obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſupreme laws—that the treaty of peace in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which controuled the moſt important rights of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty—arreſted the hand of juſtice in inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the higheſt crime which a citizen could commit, treaſon—and ſtayed proceedings in caſes of confiſcation, for forfeitures which had been incurred had always received this conſtruction—He would add that it was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be the opinion of that tribunal which the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution had authoriſed to pronounce the law the ſupreme court; that the treaty, <hi>from its own powers</hi> repealed all antecedent laws, which ſtood in the way of its execution.</p>
               <p>To proceed further on. Since the adoption of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the powers now denied, had been conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with all the conſequences and effects now contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for and until the preſent moment unqueſtioned. Peace had been concluded, ſubſidies granted, payment of money ſtipulated, territorial rights diſcuſſed and decided on. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for thoſe purpoſes had been ratified, not by venal and corrupt majorities, but by <hi>virtuous</hi> unanimity. Hence from the moment we had become a nation, under every form of our implied or expreſſed aſſociation, the powers now denied had been exerciſed, not only without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but with unqualified approbation.</p>
               <p>There was one more point of light in which this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ought to be viewed. In the year 1789, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to diſcriminate in the impoſition of our duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nations with whom we had, and thoſe with whom we had not treaties of commerce. The author of this propoſition renewed the ſame in the year 1794. This was virtually acknowledging the validity of the treaties which did exiſt, and inviting thoſe nations who had not already, to form commerical treaties. Something more than this was done by the motions which ſome gentlemen of the minority of the Senate, are ſaid to have made when this very treaty was in diſcuſſion. Their motions recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended an accomodation by treaty of all ſubſiſting dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030221_0042_0FE528F62687C500"/>
between the two countries. It could not eſcape remark, that theſe ſeveral propoſitions and motions were ſupported by all that deſcription of perſons who now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the treaty.</p>
               <p>It would not then be deemed impertinent to enquire, it was worthy attention, what was imported and admitted by this conduct and by thoſe propoſitions? they undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly implied a conceſſion that the ſubſiſting treaties were of validity; why elſe ſhould they be conſidered as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe of favourable diſcriminations? they impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, too, that there exiſted in this country a power to treat on commerical relations, and to adjuſt ſubſiſting dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
               <p>If without legiſlative aid (and they had received none) thoſe treaties would authoriſe the legiſlature to derange the commerical purſuits of the nation, and enter in legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative hoſtility with that nation with which we had the moſt extenſive relations; it muſt be from the competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the treaty making power on the principles which we contended. Strange again he would ſay, it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the true conſtruction of the conſtitution, on this very important ſubject, ſhould have eſcaped the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration and ſegacity, of the author of thoſe propoſitions, during the time of forming and ratifying the inſtrument, and his whole active public life from thoſe periods, until that of the publication of the Britiſh treaty.</p>
               <p>If, then, it was true, as he had endeavoured to prove, by that power, given by the conſtitution, to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Senate, to make treaties they had an authority to the extent he ſuppoſed, with all its conſequences and effects. If treaties ſo formed did in fact become the ſupreme law, then being compacts they bound the public ſaith and could not be violated without national diſgrace and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſhonour. They might require legiſlative proviſion, to carry them into effect; but this neither implied nor authorized the exerciſe of diſcretion, as to refuſed. The conſtitution he had, frequent occaſions of ſaying, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a government of departments. Each was intended to be furniſhed with the means of ſelf preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For this purpoſe it was declared, that the Preſident
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030221_0043_0FE52904008B0DA8"/>
would receive, a compenſation to be aſcertained by law. Laws were to be made by the legiſlature, of which this Houſe was one branch. To ſupport the conſtitution each depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be enabled to perform the functions aſſigned to it. To enable the executive to do its duties, the compenſation muſt be provided. It was then neceſſary to the ſupport of the conſtitution, that the compenſation ſhould be made. We had ſworn to ſupport the conſtitution. The people by their conſtitution had ſolemnly engaged that whoever was the preſident, ſhould receive a compenſation. We had been deputed to diſcharge the duties and engagements which our conſtituents had aſſumed. Under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances no man of common honeſty could declare that we were at liberty to refuſe all proviſion.</p>
               <p>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madiſon) had attempted to take a diſtinction between the duties we had impoſed on us by the conſtitution and ſuch as were enjoined by law. He could perceive no ſuch foundation for a diſtinction. After the ſalary of the Preſident was aſcertained by law, it could not be paid without an appropriation; would any one ſay he was at liberty to withhold it? No man he preſumed would wiſh to riſk his reputation by ſuch an aſſertion. For ſuch conduct inſtead of ſupporting would tend to ſubvert, and would if perſiſted in, annihilate the conſtitution. This was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly one of the moſt important of the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; the truth was, in fact, that we were bound to perform all the public engagements. The truth was, that our national aſſociation was a compact of virtue. To ſupport the conſtitution it was neceſſary to preſerve pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith—to promote the public happineſs it was eſſential to hold ſacred and to perform the public engagements. In this were included all engagements whether expreſſed in the form of conſtitution, of laws, or of treaties, in any way, indeed, in which the people had agreed that their will and their duties might be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Mr. SEDGWICK concluded by obſerving that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have preſented the ſubject in ſeveral other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant aſpects, but he had already treſpaſſed on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the committee. He would, as the time of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment

was paſſed, ſuſpend for the preſent any further obſervations; and he hoped that all the grounds which he had left unoccupied, could be taken by other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo as to ſupercede the neceſſity of troubling the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee with any further obſervations on this ſubject.</p>

               <head>REMARKS.</head>
               <p>The reſolution finally paſſed, fifty five againſt thirty ſeven. A committee was accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to wait on the Preſident with the ſame; and, on the 31ſt of March the Houſe received his refuſal of the papers. His meſſage was in his uſual perſpicuous and manly ſtile, and concluded in the following words: <q>As therefore it is perfectly clear to my underſtanding, that the aſſent of the Houſe of Repreſentatives is not neceſſary to the validity of a treaty: as the treaty with Great Britain exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, in itſelf, all the objects requiring legiſlative proviſion; and on theſe the papers called for can throw no light; and as it is eſſential to the due adminiſtration of the government, that the boundaries fixed by the conſtitution, between the different departments ſhould be preſerved,—a juſt regard to the conſtitution, and to the duty of my office, under all the circumſtances of this caſe, forbid a compliance with your requeſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In my remarks on this debate, I ſhall confine myſelf to the call for the papers, the debate on the treaty itſelf furniſhing the beſt opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking on the participation of the Houſe in the treaty making power.</p>
               <p>There is nobody will deny, that the Houſe of Repreſentatives have <hi>a right</hi> to call for papers of every kind, relative to matters laid before them; nor will any one deny, that the Preſident has an
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030221_0045_0FE529280D9FEE28"/>
equal <hi>right</hi> to refuſe them. The neceſſity of the call can alone render it juſtifiable in point of propriety, and, conſequently, if no ſuch neceſſity exiſts, a refuſal on the part of the Preſident can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be improper.</p>
               <p>Three reaſons were urged in favour of the call: 1. ſomething might be diſcovered that would juſtify an impeachment; 2. the papers might throw light on ſome parts of the treaty; 3. they might contain ſomething, which would tend to reconcile the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to that inſtrument.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the firſt of theſe; <hi>diſcovering grounds for an impeachment,</hi> I would aſk, who could have been the object of this impeachment? not the Negociator certainly; for, whatever might be his conduct at the court of London, it had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſolemn ſanction of the Preſident and Senate. He was charged with powers to make a treaty, he had done ſo, and thoſe who had diſpatched him, had approved and ratified the reſult of his negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; if, therefore, there was any blame, it muſt fall on thoſe unders whoſe orders he acted, and not on him.</p>
               <p>I preſume the idea of impeaching the Senate never entered the brains of even Virginians, and of courſe the Preſident muſt be the object. How an impeachment of General Waſhington will ſound in the ears of others I know not, in mine it ſounds extremely harſh; and, when I compare him with thoſe who had the effrontery to ſtart the idea, it is with difficulty I refrain from breaking through that reſpect, which is due to the aſſembly into which they have found the means to inſinuate themſelves. That <hi>they</hi> did not expect to find ſomething that would furniſh grounds of impeachment I will not
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030221_0046_0FE5290600B0BE18"/>
pretend to aver, for men are but too apt to judge of others by themſelves; but the only anſwer that ſuch a ſlanderous inſinuation merits from us, is, ſilent contempt.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>the papers might throw light on ſome parts of the treaty.</hi> Now, I, who am no ſtates-man, God-knows, have read this treaty, and I think I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it perfectly well. It is in good plain Engliſh, and, though that may be one of its principal faults with the quibblers from the ſouth, yet it ought to render explanatory papers unneceſſary. Will any one of the Oppoſition members ſay, that he does not underſtand the treaty? if he ſays ſo, will it not be neceſſary to ſend him back to his conſtituents, or furniſh him with an interpreter? I confeſs that the outlandiſh gentlemen, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Gallatin</hi> for example, may experience ſerious difficulties on this account; but is this to authorize a call that would divulge all the ſecrets of the ſtate? would it not be infinitely better to have the treaty tranſlated into <hi>Italian,</hi> or, like the French decrees of fraternity, into all the living languages? beſides, let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that the papers called for are in Engliſh as well as the treaty, and of courſe, thoſe who do not underſtand the latter would not underſtand the former.</p>
               <p>I would by no means inſinuate here, that all the Oppoſition members, who are not foreigners, are adequate to a full comprehenſion of the treaty; for, though, like the <hi>Bourgois Gentilhomme,</hi> they talk tolerable good proſe, without knowing it, their ſpeeches fully prove that they know but little of the merits of the treaty. And, to them, as to foreigners the ſame queſtion will apply: if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand the treaty, how are they to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030221_0047_0FE5298E39E409B0"/>
the papers? moſt people, I believe, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that a diplomatic correſpondence is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to analyſe than the inſtrument in queſtion, and, if ſo, how is it poſſible that theſe contracted minds ſhould derive light from ſuch a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</p>
               <p>Some of the members of oppoſition are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of a different ſtamp. Theſe did not want light. They are bleſſed with that in the extreme degree. The rays ſtrike on their minds with ſuch force as to blind every principle of honour and honeſty. From the fineſſe of theſe gentlemen what could have been expected for the papers? that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found politician patriot <hi>Madiſon</hi> found out <hi>five</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſtructions of one ſingle clauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and perhaps he would have found five times the number of every clauſe in the diſpatches. Where or when could this have ended?</p>
               <p>It is ſomething truely aſtoniſhing that papers, or any thing elſe, ſhould, at this late hour, be called for, in order to throw light on the Britiſh treaty. There have been, upon a moderate computation, more than fifty volumes in folio written and printed on the ſubject; public meetings have been held on it in every corner of the Union; petitions by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds have been given in for and againſt it; and the inſtrument itſelf has been in the hands of every one during the ſpace of eight months. Where, then, do theſe people come from, who now want papers to throw light on the ſubject; if, indeed, they can prove, that they have been buried in the weſtern woods, plotting "political ſins" anew, or conſtantly occupied in driving their negro <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents</hi> to the tobacco fields and home again, I ſhall be ready to make an allowance for their ignorance;
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030221_0048_0FE529AF3A94B828"/>
but, if they cannot prove this, if they have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame means of information as thoſe enjoyed by every man in the <hi>free</hi> States, and are yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the merits or demerits of the treaty, I muſt abſolutely declare them too ſtupid to judge of it at all, and totally unworthy of having an intricate dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomatic correſpondence ſubmitted to their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But, allowing that the papers might have thrown light on ſome parts of the treaty, how was this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their deciding on granting the ſupplies neceſſary to carry it into effect; for, it is for this purpoſe alone that a treaty is laid before them. We will ſuppoſe, for a moment, that they had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that Mr. Jay had gone beyond, or fallen ſhort of, his inſtructions; nay, we will even ſuppoſe, that they had found as indubitable proofs of Engliſh corruption, as they have had of French corruption; how could that circumſtance have affected their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion? If they have a right of exerciſing their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with reſpect to a treaty, it muſt be on the treaty itſelf, and that was before them. The means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the negociation could not alter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument itſelf. It has a preciſe meaning, couched in terms which cannot be miſunderſtood, and on that meaning alone could they found their deciſion. What an ideot of a connoiſſeur ſhould we think him, who, upon the ſight of a picture, ſhould call for the pencils and colours with which it was paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to form an opinion of its merits. Yet, exactly ſuch was the call for papers relative to the treaty.</p>
               <p>There was, however, another reaſon aſſigned: <hi>theſe papers might contain ſomething, which would tend to reconcile the people to the inſtrument.</hi> I could
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030221_0049_0FE529319F4C7B50"/>
have excuſed every thing but this groſs, this palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hypocriſy. What! did theſe oppoſition mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers deſire to ſee ſomething that would reconcile the people to the treaty! theſe very men who had, in ways more or leſs direct, ſtipulated with the mob to oppoſe it. It is a fact well known, that the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among them had all written or made public ſpeeches repreſenting it as inimical to the rights and liberties of the people; the gentleman who brought forward the reſolution was one of thoſe who took the lead at New York, when the <hi>French</hi> and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican flags were hoiſted againſt it, and when it was abſolutely burnt before the houſe of Governor Jay. And yet, theſe very men now pretend, that they wiſh for ſomething that may reconcile the people to it! what an opinion muſt they have of the Preſident, to ſuppoſe him open to ſuch barefaced deception; when men have long ſucceeded in this, or any way, they are apt to over rate their talents; it is not therefore ſo very wonderful, that they ſhould imagine it as eaſy to cajole General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington as their deluded conſtituents.</p>
               <p>I have now done with the <hi>pretended</hi> motives of the reſolution (on which I muſt confeſs I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up too much of the reader's time) and ſhall come to what I imagine to be the <hi>real</hi> motives of it.</p>
               <p>To begin at the fountain head, the mind from which the miſchievous and malicious idea firſt iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is tolerably well known, that the <hi>Livingſtons</hi> harbour a mortal hatred againſt the family of his Excellency Governor <hi>Jay,</hi> which hatred is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly paid back with contempt. The characters of the parties ſufficiently explain the cauſe. This is not the firſt inſtance of private reſentment finding
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030221_0050_0FE5293321E3F6E0"/>
its way into public aſſemblies. Something in theſe papers might have been found which, if properly handled, would have impreſſed on the minds of the ignorant, a belief that Mr. Jay had abandoned their intereſts; that he was partial to the Engliſh nation (which alone is a ſufficient crime) and that he felt little anxiety for the ſucceſs of the French. The ſlighteſt expreſſion, leaning this way, would have been tortured into the moſt odious ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by men who are capable of finding five differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conſtructions of a ſimple ſentence. There could not be imagined a more complete method of rendering the worthy Envoy odious to the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>in numbers,</hi> of his State, and of preparing the way for his being rejected at another election.</p>
               <p>But, though this might be the principle object with the "<hi>honourable</hi> mover," as he has been iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically called, yet we muſt not ſuppoſe all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of oppoſition to have no higher views. They undoubtedly participate with Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> in a deteſtation of the Envoy. I preſume this, becauſe it is natural; but their projects ſeem to be much more extenſive than the ouſting of a governor. Their eyes are fixed on another quarter, where a nobler game preſents itſelf. In ſhort, if I have any pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, their plan is nothing ſhort of driving the Preſident of the United States from the poſt he now fills.</p>
               <p>If there be any one who, meaſuring the hearts of others by his own, looks upon this as impoſſible, I requeſt him to turn his eye to the inſults that have been heaped on this Saviour of his country during the preſent ſeſſion of Congreſs. The fact is, nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doubts of this, and the only thing that ſurpriſes
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030221_0051_0FE5296216A9E140"/>
me, is, nobody attempts to render the deſtructive project abortive.</p>
               <p>It may be aſked; what views can the oppoſition have? to this queſtion I anſwer by another: what views have the diſorganizers in every country? what views could the <hi>nobleman</hi> have who propoſed, in France, the abolition of <hi>nobility?</hi> what views had the <hi>biſhop</hi> who propoſed the abolition of <hi>religion?</hi> what views had the ſilly Lord Stanhope when he propoſed an imitation of the French ſans-culottes, and declared <hi>he would like to be hanged?</hi> if there were any thing too ſtupid, abſurd and vile, to be wiſhed for by thoſe who are the partizans of France and of French principles, then we might enquire, what men could propoſe to themſelves in driving a Chief Magiſtrate like ours from his poſt.</p>
               <p>That they may not ſucceed is ſurely the ſincere deſire of every man, who wiſhes well to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But the event is, at leaſt, doubtful. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires fortitude ſomething more than human, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch treatment as the Preſident has received, without yielding to the dictates of diſguſt. There is hardly a man on earth but himſelf, that would not have retired long ago. For my part, I ſhould have hurled the papers in their face, in the midſt of their quibbling and ſpiteful harrangues, ſent them my reſignation and retired to my home. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, General Waſhington is a man of another cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. But it is not reaſonable to hope, that he will bear this tantalizing for ever: there is a certain point beyond which the patience and fortitude of no man can go, and ſhould his ungrateful enemies ſurpaſs it, we muſt expect to be left adrift in the ſtorm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:030221_0052_0FE52907852AC8D0"/>I know, that it is become a cuſtom to ſpeak lightly of the ſervices, paſt as well as preſent, of this great man, and that his adverſaries aſk, with a ſort of triumph; what! is America ſo poor in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and virtue as not to poſſeſs another man fit for Preſident?—I am far from thinking any ſuch thing. I believe there are many men in America of great talents and virtues, even equal to thoſe of General Waſhington; but there is ſomething more neceſſary in the chief of this Union, which no man poſſeſſes but himſelf; and that is, <hi>Univerſal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Some other man may be found, the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite of this or that part of the Union; but no other, of every part of it. It is a melancholy truth, but a truth, it is, that his life, as it grows towards a cloſe, becomes ſtill more and more neceſſary to his conſtituents. I do not ſcruple to ſay, and I care not who differs from me, that it is he, and <hi>he alone,</hi> that has kept the Union entire to this day. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gentlemen have been named as his ſucceſſors, all of them, without doubt, very fit for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant functions they would have to exerciſe; but, I aſk any thinking man, if, with the example they have before their eyes, either of them would accept of the Preſidency, or, if they ſhould, if they would be able to maintain harmony among the States for one year? I am confident they would not, unleſs a change of principles ſhould take place, which, at preſent, there is little reaſon to expect.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations ought to unite the friends of order and good government in their attachment to the man of their choice. They ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with ſilent approbation of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or confine the effuſions of their gratitude to ſentiments over the bottle: the applauſe of a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard is little better than ſlander. No; this is not the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:030221_0053_0FE529090C0A17A0"/>
way of giving ſupport to the government; it is to be done by manly and affectionate addreſſes; by public declarations of diſapprobation of the conduct of the enemies to the peace and happineſs of the country; and by zealous and effectual endeavours to undeceive the miſguided multitude.</p>

               <p>On the latter of theſe reſolutions it is only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to obſerve, that it is by no means inconſiſtent with the motives that dictated the call for papers; thoſe motives I have already ſtated, it will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be uſeleſs to ſay anything more on the reſolution.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſolution merits a great deal of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it ſeems, to be the laſting definition of the treaty making power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Patriot Madiſon</hi> was the only member that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a defence of this reſolution. To give his ſpeech here would be to fill up my pages with what no one would read: I ſhall, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf with inſerting an extract from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in the Virginia Convention, at the time when the Conſtitution of the United States was under conſideration.</p>
               <p>The reader ſhould be informed, that this <hi>patriot</hi> was, at the time of forming the conſtitution, a firm friend to it; and indeed, I have ſeen it aſſerted in print, that he even drew it up. Let us, then, compare the explanation he gave of this treaty mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauſe, at the time the conſtitution was under
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030221_0056_0FE4FE5EC4DE6620"/>
conſideration, with the explanation contained in the reſolution which he now ſupports.</p>
               <p>A member in the convention having objected to the treaty making power, as expreſſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, becauſe treaties became ſupreme laws of the land, <hi>without the participation of Congreſs,</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot Madiſon roſe and ſaid: <q>
                     <hi>Are not treaties the law of the land in England?</hi> I will refer you to a book, which is in every man's hand, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone's Commentaries. It will inform you, that treaties, <hi>made by the king,</hi> are to be the ſupreme laws of the land. <hi>If they are to have any effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy they muſt be laws of the land.</hi> They are ſo <hi>in every country.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now where has the patriot been ſince the time that he gave this explanation of the treaty making power? what ſort of company muſt he have fallen into? I ſhould be very ſorry to ſuppoſe that he has drank at the fountain that poiſoned his countryman Randolph; but, really ſuch a change of ſentiment ſuch directly contradictory explanation of the very ſame clauſe, is hard to be accounted for.</p>
               <p>In this debate on the call for the papers, which was, in fact, a debate on the treaty making power, the patriot was ſeveral times called on for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of his doctrine advanced in the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He had the prudence to avoid an anſwer at that time; and to reſerve himſelf for the diſcuſſion of the preſent reſolution. He tells us here, that, upon <hi>his honour,</hi> he has <hi>forgotten</hi> what paſſed in the convention; but that, however <hi>reſpectable</hi> ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities may be, the conſtitution muſt now <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain itſelf.</hi>—And ſo, Sir, you have <hi>forgotten,</hi> have you? Forgotten all about it? the waters of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030221_0057_0FE52914E87B0598"/>
where you have undergone your political bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and where you have emerged a new man, are I ſuppoſe, like thoſe of Lethe,
<q>
                     <l>"Where mortals the <hi>ſweets of forgetfulneſs</hi> prove;</l>
                     <l>"Where the <hi>Slave-dealer's</hi> conſcience is cas'd of its woes,</l>
                     <l>"And <hi>the Debtor forgets all the debts that he owes."</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But, though Mr. Madiſon had been dipped in the pool of oblivion, ſome other members of the Houſe had not, and as they made ſo preſſing a call on him for the explanation, he was obliged to ſay ſomething. It was not certainly a very ſatisfactory anſwer, to ſay that, however <hi>reſpectable</hi> ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities might be, the conſtitution muſt now <hi>explain itſelf.</hi> As to the <hi>reſpectability</hi> of the authority, as far as relates to himſelf, I am ready to give that up; but how the conſtitution is to explain itſelf, when he has found out five different conſtructions of the ſame clauſe, I cannot perceive. If it be true, that he penned the conſtitution, I hope he will not boaſt of his work, unleſs, indeed, which is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he wiſhed it to anſwer all the convenient pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a Jeſuit's Creed.</p>
               <p>The Preſident, in his meſſage, tells the Houſe, with the candour and uprighthneſs of heart which ſo eminently diſtinguiſh him from his adverſaries, that, the treaty making power has been thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by both parties in the negociations with foreign powers. "It is thus," ſays he, <q>that the treaty making power has been underſtood by foreign nations; and in all treaties made with them, <hi>we</hi> have declared, and they have believed, that when ratified by the Preſident, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030221_0058_0FE529BA0D1142B8"/>
and conſent of the Senate, they became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory.</q>—To this Mr. Madiſon replies: <q>By <hi>we</hi> was to be underſtood the executive alone, and not the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</q> Again he obſerves that <q>this was the firſt treaty made with a <hi>foreign</hi> power, ſince the operation of the preſent government; and that therefore prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents muſt loſe much of their weight.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What the patriot means by a <hi>foreign</hi> power, I know not: it is more than probable that, in his ample budget of conſtructions, he may have a dozen or two ready to be applied to his word <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign;</hi> but, according to my ſimple conception of the meaning of this epithet, it is applicable to every power with whom the United States have made, or can make, treaties; and of courſe, it ought to be applied to the Indian as well as to the European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The continental powers of Europe are all ſituated on the ſame land; ſome of them muſt neceſſarily be divided by land-marks, as we are from the Indians, yet they treat each other as <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> powers. If the word <hi>foreign</hi> is to be applied to no nation ſituated on the ſame land with ourſelves, it is yet to be proved, whether it ought to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to France and Spain, or not. Indeed, it is likely, that the patriot means to confine the word <hi>foreign</hi> to the Britiſh nation, as the only one which is divided from us by the ſea; if ſo, and if he ſhould be able to perſuade us, that his <hi>conſtruction</hi> is a good one, we may then allow, that this treaty is the firſt which the Federal Government has form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with foreign powers; but, till he can do this, I for my part, muſt continue to look upon the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made with the Indians, as made with foreign powers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:030221_0059_0FE5297308865F80"/>If then it be true, and true it moſt aſſuredly is, that the treaties made with the Indians, bear in themſelves the full force of the principle laid down by the Preſident: <q>that when ratified by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Senate, they become obligatory,</q> how happens it, that no objection was ever yet made to their contents in that reſpect? foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have ſeen thoſe treaties go quietly into effect, without waiting for the ſanction of the Houſe of Repreſentatives; and this, of itſelf, was a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole nation, that no ſuch ſanction was neceſſary. But, ſays the patriot, "the Houſe of Repreſentatives never made any ſuch declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;" and for this very reaſon; becauſe no ſuch declaration was wanted. The Preſident and Senate ratified the treaties, and nobody diſputed their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo to do; the unmaking power of the Houſe was reſerved to be exerciſed on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>Had the Houſe of Repreſentatives poſſeſſed the power of ſetting a treaty aſide, or rather as they now contend, of giving it a final ratification, they ſhould have come forward and declared ſo, when the firſt treaty made under the preſent government was laid before them. This would have been can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly telling other powers not to look upon a treaty as finally ratified by the United States, till it had been approved of by the Houſe; and, in the preſent inſtance, the king of great Britain would not have been deceived into a ratification on his part, till ſuch approbation had been obtained.</p>
               <p>Taking leave of the tergiverſation of patriot Madiſon, I ſhall add a few ſhort remarks on the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution itſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:030221_0060_0FE52934A9557B60"/>One of its greateſt faults is, its unneceſſary length; it is however, like all the other propoſitions brought forward by the Oppoſition: calculated to deceive the multitude, and rally them under the banners of an intereſted and, perhaps, corrupted faction, under the pretext of ſupporting their rights. The plain meaning of it is this: <hi>The Preſident and Senate have a right to</hi> make <hi>treaties, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives to</hi> unmake <hi>them;</hi> and Mr. Blount, if he had had as much courage as malice, would have couched it in theſe very words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When a treaty, ſays the reſolution, ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates regulations on any ſubjects ſubmitted by the Conſtitution to the power of Congreſs, it muſt depend for its execution on Congreſs,</q> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeqently, on the Houſe of Repreſentatives. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral regulations are ſubmitted to the power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: I ſhall confine myſelf to one only, as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to demonſtrate the conſequences of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine here held up. "Congreſs," ſays the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <q>
                     <hi>is empowered</hi> to regulate commerce with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations.</q> Now what treaty, let me aſk, can the United States make with any nation on earth, <hi>not containing ſtipulations on commerce?</hi> what treaty can be formed with Great Britain, with Spain, with the Algerines, or even with the Indians, that does not contain ſtipulations of this kind? There are treaties with them all now before the Houſe, and they all do contain ſuch ſtipulations. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, of courſe, that the Preſident and Senate can make no treaty, that can be carried into execution without the conſent, or ratification of the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>Yes, there are treaties of alliance offenſive or defenſive, or both, which may not contain ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="129"
                      facs="unknown:030221_0061_0FE529651FE1B670"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
on commerce; but then, the Congreſs has the power to declare war, and as theſe are certainly warlike regulations, the Houſe of Repreſentatives will undoubtedly claim a participation in making them, or at leaſt in unmaking them, according to the ſpirit of the reſolution. So that, the Preſident and Senate's treaty making power is, in fact, no power at all. It is a mere form of words; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thrown out to give foreign nations a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the ſtability and promptitude of this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in order to lure them into <hi>conceſſions,</hi> while the <hi>real</hi> power is reſerved for annulling ſuch treaties, as fall ſhort of the exorbitant pretenſions, or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate againſt the intereſted views, of theſe States.</p>
               <p>If a vote of the Houſe of Repreſentatives be neceſſary to the <hi>ratification</hi> of a treaty; I ſay rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication becauſe that ACT alone is worthy of the name, which gives full and complete effect to a treaty; if then, a vote of this Houſe be neceſſary to ſuch ratification, it ſhould be obtained <hi>before</hi> the ratification be diſpatched to a foreign court. Any other manner of proceeding is mere duplicity. What ſays the treaty before us: <q>This treaty, when the ſame ſhall have been ratified by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and by the Preſident of the United States, by and with the advice and conſent of their Senate, and the reſpective ratifications mutually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, ſhall be binding and obligatory on His Majeſty and on the ſaid States, &amp;c.</q> Now, this has been done; the treaty has been ratified by His Majeſty and by the Preſident, with the conſent of the Senate, and yet the Houſe of Repreſentatives pretend, that it is <hi>not</hi> binding on theſe States, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>their conſent</hi> alſo. Is this duplicity, or is it ſomething worſe!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:030221_0062_0FE529166C444680"/>Suppoſe the poſts, which are, in fulfilment of this treaty, to be delivered up to the United States, were ſituated in ſome part of Europe, where no intelligence of this reſolution could be obtained in due time to prevent the delivery; or ſuppoſe the treaty had ſtipulated for the weſtern poſts being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up in the month of December laſt. Had either of theſe been the caſe, Great Britain would have fulfilled her engagement, in this reſpect, while the United States are debating with themſelves <hi>whether they ſhall fulfil theirs or not.</hi> What ſort of national faith is this? to make uſe of the words of Mr. Giles reſpecting the land jobbers, this is <hi>ſwindling upon a broad ſcale,</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>This reſolution, whatever may be the fate of the Britiſh treaty, will have the moſt pernicious effects on the relations of the United States with foreign nations. If the miniſters of any power can be ſuppoſed to underſtand this Conſtitution, it muſt be thoſe of Great Britain. We ſee, that they have underſtood it as giving the ſole power of making and ratifying treaties to the Preſident and Senate; and it is certain that other powers have, till now underſtood it in the ſame way. But, the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>patriot</hi> Blount is well calculated to undeceive them. All nations will now ſay: <q>Yes, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have a Preſident and Senate, whom they hold forth to us as officers empowered to make treaties with us, and to give ſuch treaties their full effect, as "ſupreme laws of their land;" but we now perceive that this is all deception; theſe officers are only authorized to make and ratify <hi>ſham</hi> treaties with us; if they obtain their wiſhes, they confirm theſe treaties afterwards, but if not, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to themſelves the power of ſetting them aſide.</q> In future, therefore, we muſt naturally expect, that
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030221_0063_0FE52937A03AC350"/>
no power on earth, except, perhaps, a humiliated king of Spain, or a ſtupid Indian Chief, will ever look upon a treaty with us as legally ratified, till it has received the ſanction of the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; nay, were I a prince, I would not ratify, till the treaty had been ſigned by every individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſovereign people; for, as <hi>patriot</hi> Madiſon judiciouſly obſerved, <q>there is a <hi>provident</hi> article in the Conſtitution itſelf, by which an avenue is always left open to the <hi>ſovereign people</hi> for <hi>expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or amendments,</hi> as they may be found indiſpenſable.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here I ſhall be told, that the Britiſh Houſe of Commons poſſeſſes the ſame power, with reſpect to treaties as is contended for by the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, and yet, that does not prevent other nations from treating with the king of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. If any inconſiſtency on the part of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition could at this day excite ſurprize, it would be their having held up the practices of Great Britain as proper for their imitation. What! theſe very men, whoſe continual theme has been the execrating of the practices of that nation, now fly to it for precidents! the firſt writer that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in oppoſition to the Britiſh treaty, repreſented it as dangerous, becauſe it would <q>tend to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the faſhions, forms and <hi>precedents</hi> of a monarchy!</q> 
                  <hi>Mr. Giles</hi> ſaid, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning Randall, that <q>he ſhould be <hi>ſorry</hi> to ſee <hi>this Houſe</hi> adopt <hi>precedents</hi> from the Britiſh Houſe of Commons!</q> ſeveral times during this very debate, it was averred that the Conſtitution of Great Britain was juſt crumbling to pieces; and it is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ago than laſt year, that the ſagacious <hi>patriot</hi> Madi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon foretold, that he ſhould ſoon ſee the peers of Great Britain coming to aſk a lodging from him. Mr. Swanwick, in the debates on the frigates, ſaid that
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:030221_0064_0FE5298FC0FAA028"/>
Great Britain was on the verge of ruin. Another of theſe oppoſers declared ſhe was at her laſt gaſp. And theſe are the men, who now tell us, that imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Great Britain is the only way of preſerving the liberties of the people; while they ſeize every opportunity moſt ſlanderouſly to repreſent the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that country as ſlaves.</p>
               <p>But, what are theſe precedents which they have taken from the Conſtitution of Great Britain? they tell us that the Houſe of Commons claim a right to withhold the ſupplies neceſſary to carry a treaty into effect. They claim this right with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all ſupplies; but, were they ever known to exerciſe it ſince the reign of the profligate french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified Charles? at leaſt, were they ever known to exerciſe it for the purpoſe of violating a treaty made with a foreign power? I defy theſe gentlemen to prove any ſuch thing, and even if they could prove it, I would be very glad to know, how the precedent will apply to themſelves. The Britiſh Conſtitution, happily for the people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is not written in a book; is not reduced to a few clauſes, each of which admits of <hi>five con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</hi> There is no poſitive law that ſays to the Houſe of Commons; <q>you ſhall have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative voice on the expediency or inexpedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of treaties.</q> This is not neceſſary in a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment like that of Great Britain. The organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization of the Houſe of Commons is itſelf a gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee for their doing nothing that may endanger the honour or ſafety of the State. The electors there are few; the members are the repreſentatives of property, and not of numbers. They are elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſeven years, and not for two. They are independent of the mob, a much better ſecurity for the ſtate, than their being independent of thoſe
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030221_0065_0FE5296FFA3B7498"/>
who ſit at the helm of affairs. There is not, I am perſuaded, a man in that Houſe, who could, under any circumſtances, bring himſelf to avow openly, that "he <hi>adored</hi> the voice of the people," as Mr. Giles did in the debate on the call for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. There is not the moſt diſtant reſemblance between the Houſe of Commons and the Houſe of Repreſentatives; and therefore the citing of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents from the records of each other muſt be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inadmiſſible. In one particular, however, I am willing to allow that the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives would do well in imitating the Houſe of Commons, and here, I believe I ſhall be ſeconded by every honeſt man in the Union; I mean in making proviſion for carrying the preſent treaty into effect.</p>
               <p>In the Philadelphia Gazette of laſt year I find the following words, made uſe of by <hi>Mr. Giles</hi> in the debate on the allowances to members of Congreſs. <q>Mr. Giles ſaid, there was a country from which America had <hi>copied</hi> a great deal <hi>too much.</hi> The members of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no wages, while the officers of ſtate had immenſe ſalaries. It was, however, <hi>underſtood</hi> that the Britiſh Houſe of Commons were very <hi>well paid.</hi> Mr. Giles did not wiſh to ſee <hi>ſcenes</hi> of that kind <hi>in this country.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, would it, I wonder, be permitted me to aſk this talkative gentleman, what he meant by "ſcenes"? If this were permitted, I would go on, and aſk him, what he meant by <hi>copying too much</hi> from Great Britain? if he himſelf be a copy of ſome original from that country, which I believe to be the caſe, in this inſtance I ſhall not contend, that we have not copied too much; but as to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030221_0066_0FE52917F0F95A80"/>
to members of Congreſs, I think we have not copied quite enough, witneſs a ſeſſion ſpun out to the month of May, and nothing done. Again, I would aſk him, how he came to <hi>underſtand</hi> that the members of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons were very <hi>well paid,</hi> or in other words, <hi>corrupted by the King?</hi> he knows how ſeverely I could retort upon him here; how I could dare him to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; but I forbear, and return to the ſentence of this extract which ſo immediately applies to the ſubject before us.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that the members of the Houſe of Commons receive no ſtipend for their ſervices in that capacity, therefore, when the propoſal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Houſe was to draw money out of the pockets of the people to pay Mr. Giles and his colleagues ſuch a ſtipend, he thought America ſhould not copy from Great Britain. Imitating the Houſe of Commons in this inſtance, would have deprived the gentleman of what he probably <hi>"adored"</hi> as much as he does "the voice of the people," and, perhaps, a great deal more. The Houſe of Commons was therefore thrown aſide, as totally unworthy of imitation; but, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the records of that Houſe ſeemed to ſtrengthen the arguments of Mr. Giles for ſetting aſide the treaty, then it was not wrong to copy from it: it was to be imitated as the only model; as the only aſſembly in the world, that was the true repoſitory of the liberties of the people.— Theſe palpable inconſiſtencies I leave Mr. Giles to reconcile, which I make no doubt he will be able to do, to the entire ſatisfaction of <hi>his</hi> conſtituents.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now diſmiſs this reſolution of citizen Blount, with obſerving, that if no treaty, <hi>contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030221_0067_0FE5299144D050A8"/>
ſtipulations on commerce,</hi> is finally ratified till ſanctioned by a vote of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, no treaty, formed by the preſent government is yet valid; for though that with Spain for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has been ſanctioned by the Houſe, ſuch ſanction was not obtained prior to the ratification by the king of Spain. The ratification which that king now poſſeſſes is not valid, and therefore the treaty is not. This is clear and fair reaſoning, and I defy even patriot Madiſon, with his five con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, to oppoſe it with ſucceſs. Is it aſſerted that the ratification now in the hands of the court of Spain is binding on the United States? ſo then, is the ratification now in the hands of His Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Majeſty; for they have both emanated from exactly the ſame powers. If the ratification ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed with Great Britain be not final, be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, neither is that exchanged with Spain; the kings of both nations have been duped; they have exchanged obligatory ratifications for ſuch as were not obligatory, and of courſe, both the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties become null and void: nor ſhould I ſcruple, were I the miniſter of either of thoſe princes, to adviſe an infraction of either treaty, when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might render it convenient; fully confident that this reſolution of the Houſe of Repreſentatives would juſtify the proceeding.</p>

the treaty into effect, <hi>Mr. Maclay</hi> ſpoke againſt it, and concluded his ſpeech with the following preamble and reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Houſe having taken into conſideration the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, between the United States and Great Britain, communicated by the Preſident in his meſſage of the firſt day of March laſt, are of opinion, that it is in many reſpects highly injurious to the intereſts of the United States; yet, <hi>were they poſſeſſed of any information which could juſtify the great ſacrifices,</hi> contained in the treaty, their ſincere deſire to cheriſh harmony and amicable intercourſe with all nations, and their earneſt wiſh to co-operate in haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening a final adjuſtment of the differences ſubſiſting between the United States and Great Britain, might have induced them to wave their objections to the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but, <hi>when they contemplate the conduct of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in perſevering ſince the treaty was ſigned, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſment of American Seamen and the ſeizure of American veſſels (laden with proviſions) contrary to the ſacred rights of neutral nations;</hi> whether this be viewed as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction meant to be given to any articles in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or as contrary to an infraction of the true meaning and ſpirit thereof, the houſe cannot but regard it as incumbent on them, in fidelity to the truſt repoſed in them, to forbear, under ſuch circumſtances, taking at preſent any active meaſures on the ſubject, therefore, <hi>Reſolved, that under the circumſtances aforeſaid, and with ſuch information as the Houſe poſſeſs, it is not expedient at this time to concur in paſſing the laws neceſſary for carrying the ſaid treaty into effect.</hi>

               <head>REMARKS.</head>
               <p>The preamble to this reſolution holds out as an excuſe for withholding the ſupplies, that, <hi>the Houſe is not in poſſeſſion of any information to juſtify the great ſacrifices, contained in the treaty.</hi> What informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could poſſibly render thoſe ſacrifices leſs than they are? how could the communication of the correſpondence between the Preſident and Mr. Jay
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:030221_0069_0FE529748C2F9548"/>
alter the nature of ſacrifices contained in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty itſelf? If an infraction of this treaty ſhould take place on the part of Great Britain, to what ſhould we appeal? to the treaty itſelf, and not to the notes and converſations employed in the negociation. The inſtrument itſelf is good or bad, and contains in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf full proofs of either, and, if the Houſe have a right to decide on its merits, why not do it bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; why not ſcorn this miſerable ſubterfuge?</p>
               <p>"But," ſays the preamble, <q>when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the conduct of Great Britain ſince the treaty was ſigned, &amp;c.</q> Now, allowing all the falſhoods which have been circulated concerning impreſſments and ſeizures, to be undeniable truths, and that they are all contrary to the rights of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral nations, what have they to do with laws neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to carry the treaty into effect? or how can the papers of negociation render them more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious? if they are contrary to the rights of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral nations, or to the letter of the treaty, no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers whatever can juſtify them; if they are not, no papers can render them unjuſtifiable.</p>
               <p>One ſentence in this preample is ſingularly unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: <hi>"ſince</hi> the treaty was <hi>ſigned."</hi> Obſerve here well, that an objection to giving the treaty its final ratification is founded on ſomething that Great Britain has done as an <hi>infraction of it.</hi> The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have fairly tumbled into their own pit. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reſolution of Mr. Blount, now on the journals of the Houſe, the treaty is not a law of this land; it is not in force; it is not yet a treaty; and conſequently the Britiſh can be guilty of no infraction. Do the Oppoſition wiſh, that this inſtrument ſhould be obligatory on Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, from the moment of the ſigning of the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:030221_0070_0FE529BE4DDB3208"/>
as they now ſtand, and that it ſhould not even yet be obligatory on theſe States? they may, probably, find powers to treat with them on this footing; a king of ſcalpes, the five kings of France (barber Tom and his comrades four) or a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſcion of the ſtump of the Bourbons, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, do it; but the king of Great Britain never will.</p>
               <p>After theſe remarks on this hypoctritical and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd preamble, I ſhall endeavour to point out the fatal conſequences that the adoption of the reſolution muſt be attended with, taking, previouſly, a view of the cauſes which have led to the preſent oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If, in doing this, I make uſe of an undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed language, which, notwithſtanding the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liberty of the preſs, is little cuſtomary in theſe States, I hope, my liege Lords, the ſovereign-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, will not take offence, as I declare upon my honour, that my motive, and my only motive, is, to perſuade them to live in peace with the only power on earth that is capable of doing them an injury in war.</p>
               <p>Among the cauſes of the oppoſition to the treaty, the ſtipulation for an honourable diſcharge of the debts, due from the Southern States (<hi>Virginia</hi> in particular) to the merchants of Great Britain, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly claims the firſt place. Theſe debts, due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the American war, were, according to the treaty of peace, to be honourably diſcharged; or, at leaſt, no law was to be paſſed, or to remain in force, which might operate as an impediment to their recovery. Here is the article of the treaty: <q>
                     <hi>Art.</hi> IV. It is agreed, that creditors on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, <hi>ſhall meet with no lawful impediment</hi> to
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:030221_0071_0FE528B4B0F83D58"/>
the recovery of the full value, in ſterling money, of all <hi>bona fide</hi> debts heretofore contracted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, in defiance of the general government, and regardleſs of the national faith, thus ſolemnly pledged, the State of Virginia in particular has enacted, or kept in force, ſuch laws as are an impediment to the recovery of theſe debts. In conſequence of this violation of the treaty of peace, and as a protection due from Great Britain to her merchants, ſhe kept poſſeſſion of the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Poſts, in order to oblige the United States to a fulfilment of their engagements. The <hi>debtor</hi> State, or States, have continued their diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble laws in force to this day, and for this reaſon it is, that to this day Great Britain keeps the forts in her poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>When a new treaty between the two nations was to be made, the relinguiſhment of the poſts was the firſt object on the part of Great Britain, and accordingly, the treaty ſets out with a ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their being given up, <hi>on the firſt day of June</hi> 1796, five weeks from this day. But, on the other hand, the United States ſtipulate to pay, or cauſe to be paid, the abovementioned debts, the recovery of which has been hitherto unjuſtly imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by acts which the Virginians have the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to dignify with the names of laws.</p>
               <p>It was not to be ſuppoſed that Virginia would not oppoſe to this arrangement. Both her Senators ſtepped forward againſt the treaty. One of them, Mr. Maſon divulged its contents prematurely. It was printed without the permiſſion of the Executive power; agents were diſpatched with it to every part of the Union, with inſtructions to miſrepreſent its meaning, and to ſtir up ſuch an oppoſition as might
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:030221_0072_0FE5299A6E3EA750"/>
deter the Preſident from a ratification. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing advertiſement will fully ſhow the temper of that State at the time.</p>

               <p>I muſt beg to be excuſed for ſtepping aſide from my ſubject a minute, in order to make a few obſervations, of a more general nature, on the conduct of this turbulent, and I may ſay rebellious State. One of her Repreſentatives in Congreſs, Mr. Giles ſaid, <q>that he hoped Virginia would purſue uniformly the line of conduct that had ever marked her political character. Her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, he obſerved, had been uniform from the beginning of the revolution to the preſent day; uniform and exemplary in her <hi>obedience to the laws,</hi> &amp;c.—He prided himſelf in repreſening ſuch a State.</q> About a <hi>twentieth part</hi> of ſuch
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:030221_0073_0FE5297EE09E24B8"/>
a State, the gentleman meant, without doubt; that is, if he did not, for the moment, mean to give up his title of "<hi>immediate</hi> repreſentative."</p>
               <p>Indeed, as Mr. Giles obſerved, the conduct of his State has been uniform, if a continual diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the government of the United States, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concealed under the maſk of hypocriſy and baſe crawling flattery, and ſometimes breaking out in open oppoſition; if this be a uniform conduct, her conduct has been uniform. The reader muſt have remarked the word <hi>"Britiſh Tyrant."</hi> in the above advertiſement, and he muſt alſo know that to abuſe and vilify that monarch is the favourite theme of Virginians. Now, to give him a pretty correct idea of the uniformity of their political conduct, I ſhall here inſert an extract from the American Magazine for September, 1769. <q>We your Majeſty's <hi>moſt loyal, dutiful,</hi> and <hi>affectionate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> of your Majeſty's ancient colony of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, beg leave in the <hi>humbleſt manner,</hi> to aſſure your Majeſty, that your faithful Subjects of this colony, ever diſtinguiſhed by their loyalty and firm attachment to your Majeſty and your royal anceſtors, &amp;c. &amp;c. We are <hi>ready to ſacrifice our lives and fortunes</hi> in defence of your Majeſty's <hi>ſacred</hi> perſon and government.—It is with the deepeſt concern and moſt <hi>heart felt grief</hi> that your Majeſty's dutiful ſubjects of this colony find that their loyalty hath been <hi>traduced</hi> and that thoſe meaſures which a juſt regard for the <hi>Britiſh Conſtitution (dearer to them than life)</hi> made neceſſary duties, have been miſrepreſented as rebellious attacks on your Majeſty's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—After expreſſing our confidence in your royal <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> permit us to aſſure your Majeſty, that the moſt fervent prayers of your
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:030221_0074_0FE5298082FCEC50"/>
people of this colony are <hi>daily addreſſed to the Almighty,</hi> that your Majeſty's reign may be long and proſperous over Great Britain and all your Dominions; and that after death, your Majeſty may taſte the fulleſt fruition of eternal bliſs, and that a deſcendant of your illuſtrious Houſe may reign over the extended Britiſh Empire <hi>until time ſhall be no more.</hi>
                  </q> AMEN!</p>
               <p>The man whoſe <hi>ſacred</hi> perſon they were ready to ſacrifice life and fortune in defence of, is now called the <hi>"Britiſh Tyrant;"</hi> and <hi>"the Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutution, dearer to them than life;"</hi> is now, <hi>"the gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yoke of Great Britain!"</hi> Poor bankrupt devils, the king of great Britain ſtands in no need of their lives and fortunes nor of their prayers daily addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Almighty. Neither do their curſes affect him a bit more than thoſe of the French atheiſts. I dare ſay, if the truth were known, that he does not think half ſo much about the "ancient and dutiful and loyal and pious State of Virginia" as he does about the kennel of his Stag-Hounds.</p>
               <p>Another trait of the uniformity of conduct in this State is exhibited in her behaviour to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States. After his election, he received the firſt addreſs from the Virginians. I can ſay nothing better nor worſe of this addreſs, than that it was full as dutiful, affectionate and <hi>ſincere,</hi> as the addreſs to the king. Let any man compare that addreſs with the inſults that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent State, and her members in Congreſs, have heaped on the Preſident during the laſt nine months, and then doubt of the uniformity of the conduct of Virginia, if he can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:030221_0075_0FE529820689CC30"/>But Mr. Giles ſays, <q>Virginia has been uniform and exemplary in her <hi>obedience to the laws.</hi>
                  </q> I ſhall mention but two inſtances of this. The firſt is, her having abſolutely diſobeyed the treaty of peace, by making, or keeping in force, acts which have hitherto prevented the fulfilment of that treaty, and which had nearly plunged the Union into a war. The ſecond inſtance is, her having attempted, during this very ſeſſion of Congreſs, to raiſe up an oppoſition to the government in every State in the Union, and even to deſtroy the Conſtitution. If theſe inſtances of her <hi>"obedience to the laws"</hi> were not ſufficient, one might add her inſtructions, to all her repreſentatives, to oppoſe the execution of the Britiſh Treaty, "a ſupreme law of the land." Such are the proofs which Mr. Giles might have cited of her <q>uniform and <hi>exemplary</hi> obedience to the laws.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Giles may "pride himſelf in being a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative from "ſuch a State;" but, I believe that few men, who do not <hi>adore</hi> 
                  <q>the voice of the people,</q> will envy him his poſt.</p>
               <p>Who did not expect that every member from this State would do his utmoſt to ſet the treaty aſide? the final determination of the Houſe of Repreſentatives is not yet known; but I do not ſcruple to declare all thoſe enemies of the treaty, who voted in favour of Mr. Blount's reſolution, and it is well known that every member from Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia is included in that number. Had the treaty been oppoſed from any other motive than the one I contend for, ſurely, out of eighteen members, ſome one would have been found not included in the oppoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:030221_0076_0FE528D6819D5480"/>If there are any particular members, among thoſe now leagued againſt the conſtitution, who claim the guilty pre-eminence, it muſt be thoſe who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by this ſelfiſh, this diſgraceful motive. It is a truth, and a truth that will be a laſting ſtigma on the American character, that, if this treaty be rendered null, it will be for no other reaſon, than <hi>becauſe it engages for a diſcharge of juſt debts,</hi> on the part of Americans.</p>
               <p>I am far from wiſhing to inſinuate, that there are no honourable exceptions to be found among the people of Virginia: a recent attempt in their legiſlature to ſubject lands to ſeizure for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts is a full proof that ſuch exceptions do exiſt; but in ſpeaking of a State we muſt ſpeak of it as one; our opinions muſt be founded on the meaſures, it adopts, whether ſuch meaſures may be the effect of the unanimous voice of the people or not. In like manner foreign nations muſt judge of the United States. If they fail in the fulfilment of their engagements; if the ſwindling propoſitions for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the treaty ſhould finally ſucceed; foreign nations will pronounce on the meaſure itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying any attention to our internal diſputes and diviſions. The minority will be lumped with the majority; the everlaſting ſtain will imprint itſelf on the whole American people, not excepting the hitherto ſpotleſs character of a Waſhington.</p>
               <p>French influence is another ſource of oppoſition to the treaty. Thoſe who have read Mr. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph's Vindication, as it was humourouſly called, have ſeen how narrowly the Preſident eſcaped from the plots of that gentleman; what overtures were made to the French Miniſter for <q>ſome thouſands of dollars." They will ſee how that "pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:030221_0077_0FE5299D4D0AF570"/>
patriot</q> laboured to protract the ratification; how well his plans were laid for embroiling this country with Great Britain, and how all his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were taken for ſubjecting the government of this country to France. I do not ſay, that any of the members, who now oppoſe the government and the treaty, are abſolutely in the pay of the five kings; but, after reviewing the mutinous conduct of the Secretary of State; after having duly conſidered the rank of the perſon on whoſe behalf, as well as his own, certain overtures were made; after having ſeen ſome of the men now in Congreſs, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>an inconſiſtent leader,</hi> named as a confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial friend of <hi>Citizen Fauchet,</hi> I muſt be excuſed, if I have my doubts. Doubts I ſhall have till I ſee thoſe, who now oppoſe the treaty, ceaſe their eulogiums, their fulſome and nauſeous eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums, of a people, who, in their preſent ſtate, are not entitled even to pity.</p>
               <p>What influence the French have had among the multitude will appear from two circumſtances (I could mention a thouſand) freſh in every ones mind. At the town-meeting at New York, called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the treaty, the people marched under the banners of France and America. Theſe flags were carried at the head of the vile and inſolent proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that proceeded to the governor's houſe, and there burnt the treaty. The other fact is of ſtill more recent date, and ſtill more ſtriking. The petition, ſaid to be ſigned by fifteen hundred <hi>citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> of Philadelphia, againſt the treaty, and now before the Houſe, was carried round for ſignature by a <hi>Frenchman.</hi> The <hi>chairman</hi> of the meeting was alſo a <hi>Frenchman;</hi> nor am I ſure that it was not originally drawn up in the <hi>French language.</hi> I wonder what the people of England, or, indeed, of
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:030221_0078_0FE52971855C4C98"/>
any independant nation, would ſay to a foreigner, who ſhould carry round for their ſignature, a petition againſt the execution of a "law of the land;" a ſolemn contract entered into between them and another nation? There is a certain point of debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, below which no nation can ſink, whether this be that point, or not, I will not at preſent take upon me to ſay; God only knows what he has yet in reſerve for us.</p>
               <p>I am aware, it will be ſaid here; that, though the chairman, under whoſe authority and direction this petition was drawn up, was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> yet it was preſented to the Houſe by an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> or, to ſpeak more correctly, an <hi>Homuncio,</hi> born in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. But, let it be recollected that this <hi>Homuncio</hi> has, ſince the beginning of the preſent war, been a moſt deſperate ſupporter of the cauſe of the French; that he trades to France, and to France principally, and that the whole of his political career juſtifies the name of <hi>Engliſh Jacobin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reader, from what has been ſaid of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive mortal, will at once perceive that I am ſpeaking of <hi>Mr. Swanwick,</hi> one of the auguſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the City of Philadelphia. I have been told, that this gentleman has taken upon him to pronounce me a hired <hi>Engliſh ſcribbler.</hi> I will not tell this <hi>omicciuolo</hi> (for the <hi>Italian</hi> diminutive ſuits him beſt on every account) what I am; but I will tell him what I am not.—I am not deſcended from the dregs of the King of Great Britain's Cuſtom-Houſe; I was never fed from the ſcraps of His Majeſties bounty, collected by an honeſt ſpy, called <hi>a Tide-Waiter.</hi> I never ſnapped at the hand that gave me bread, and nouriſhed the ſtreams from which I drew my life. I am the baſe and
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:030221_0079_0FE528D8066EAEC8"/>
cringing flatterer of no man, much leſs of the men I deſpiſe. I never wrote to England an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my <hi>titles,</hi> outnumbering thoſe of a Spaniſh Hidalgo, and concluding with, <q>Preſident of the Emigration ſociety, Treaſurer of the Dancing-Aſſembly, and Truſtee of the Young Ladies School.</q> At the age of <hi>thirty eight,</hi> in the prime of life, I never decorated my bed-chamber with laſcivious pictures, <hi>Leda and her Swan,</hi> and ſuch like ſtimuluſes. One who is obliged to have recourſe to theſe miſerable ſhifts is unworthy even of the name <hi>omicciuollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After having thus candidly given an account of myſelf, let me aſk you, <hi>Mr. Swanwick,</hi> a queſtion or two.—How came you to imagine yourſelf bleſſed with the <hi>aura divina?</hi> how came you to imagine, that the <hi>Muſes,</hi> who are of the female ſex, had ever caſt a favourable eye on you? beſides, if you muſt commit your miſerable doggerel to paper, why ſend it to England for impreſſion? why take ſuch incredible pains to inſure its appearance in an Engliſh Magazine? why did you not ſend it to your new country, France? can it be poſſible that you yet wiſh to ſhine among the countrymen of your anceſtors? I will wear the ſhine off you, as ſure as you and I live.—As to the piece I here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to, I have not room, at preſent, to lay it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my readers; but I will juſt aſk, how you came to diſcover, that <hi>Earth</hi> is to <hi>become</hi> the <hi>proto-type of Heaven?</hi>

               <p>It is juſt matter of ſurprize that this gentleman ſhould be elected the repreſentative of ſuch a city as Philadelphia. The arts by which his election was brought about I reſerve as the ſubject of an article in a future Cenſor. I have heard of a ſturdy young Lord in England, who got himſelf elected through the intereſt of the wives and daughters of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents; Mr. Swanwick will never be ſuſpected of <hi>this kind</hi> of <hi>corruption;</hi> but whether he ought to be ſuſpected of no other kind, is more than I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine. Grog is cheap, and its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is mighty.</p>
               <p>After this long and rambling digreſſion, I return to the ſubject of French influence, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the reader muſt agree with me, that, after the Virginia Debts, it has been the principal cauſe of oppoſition to the Britiſh treaty.</p>
               <p>However, it muſt be confeſſed, that theſe cauſes, powerful as they have been, would have produced but a partial effect, had they not been aided by the deluſion of the great body of the people with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſituation of Great Britain. The ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour they entertained againſt that nation laid them open to the falſhoods which the friends of France, among whom we may reckon nearly all the News-Printers, ſo induſtriouſly ſpread through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A hundred times Great Britain has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:030221_0081_0FE5299ECFC07C68"/>
as on the brink of ruin. The editor of the Philadelphia Gazette opened the new-year, 1795, with congratulating his cuſtomers on the ſtability and vigour of the Federal Government, while that of Great Britain was juſt crumbling to pieces. In the ſame paper, he called the Iſland of Britain <hi>"an inſular Baſtile."</hi>—When intelligence was received of the progreſs the French were mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Holland, the papers announced it as an event that muſt neceſſarily be the immediate cauſe of the total overthrow of the Britiſh nation. <q>The taking of Amſterdam," ſaid the papers, "is the laſt blow to the power of Britain.</q> Bets were laid that Great Britain would become an appendage of the French Republic; and more than once were we informed by the public papers, that the tricolor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed flag was flying on St. James's Palace.</p>
               <p>Groſs as theſe impoſitions were, they were gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſwallowed by the people, nine tenths of whom believed every aſſertion of the kind that was made. Men are apt to believe what they wiſh; it is hard to convince them, that thoſe whom they hate are objects of envy and reſpect. Such was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral opinion of the diſtreſſes and weakneſs of Great Britain, and ſuch the perſuaſion that her ſituation would oblige her to yield to any thing that Mr. Jay ſhould dictate, that, when intelligence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the concluſion of the treaty, <hi>Pichegru</hi> was toaſted as the <hi>negociator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A circumſtance like this, though deſpicable in itſelf, proves that an opinion was entertained, that His Britannic Majeſty had been <hi>forced,</hi> by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the French, to accept of ſuch terms as Mr. Jay choſe to offer, and, of courſe, a treaty was expected, at once humiliating to Great Britain
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:030221_0082_0FE5294132968BD8"/>
and honourable as well as advantageous to the United States. Nothing equal to theſe lofty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations was to be found in the treaty. It was a diſappointment; and diſappointment ever diſpoſes men to diſcontent. In vain were the people told, that they had been deceived with reſpect to the ſtate of Great Britain: in vain was it hinted to them, that ſhe would finally be ſucceſsful in the war: their hatred and the continued chain of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood running through the public papers, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them deaf to the voice of reaſon and of truth. The Southern Debtors and French Emiſſaries took advantage of this prevalent deluſion, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition became almoſt univerſal.</p>
               <p>There were not wanting men of talents to add fuel to the flame, nor were there wanting others, actuated by a ſincere love of their country, who endeavoured to counter-act ſuch baleful efforts. It is certainly owing to the writings of theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the people have latterly begun to form a right judgment of this important treaty, and to rally round that government on which their very exiſtence as an independant nation depends. The judges, too, in the middle and nothern States, have exerted a laudable zeal; ſome of the public papers have ſtood forth in the cauſe of order and truth; and there is not the leaſt doubt, that the treaty would have met with no oppoſition in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, had not the members been choſen, while the public mind was at the height of its fermentation. This was unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe: <hi>treaty,</hi> and <hi>no treaty,</hi> were the ſignals at the elections; and as the oppoſers were the moſt numerous, ſo are the members of the oppoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:030221_0083_0FE528E24563BED8"/>Thus is this oppoſition bottomed on <hi>diſhoneſty, corruption,</hi> or <hi>ignorance,</hi> and, probably, on all three together. That it may be fruſtrated is my ſincere wiſh, and that it will I have not the leaſt doubt: I cannot bring myſelf to imagine, that the people of this country will tamely ſuffer themſelves to be hurled from the pinnacle of national proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into the horrid abyſs of foreign and civil war, of anarchy, requiſitions and maſſacre, by a band of intereſted and deſperate leaders, who have nothing to loſe but the poſts which their too credulous conſtituents have beſtowed on them. I have not the leaſt doubt that the nefarious conſpiration will be finally rendered abortive, and that the French gold, now in circulation, will be as ineffectual as that formerly diſtributed among the <q>pretended patriots of America;</q> but, while there is a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the contrary, the attention of the people ought to be directed to the dangers that await them. I ſhall point out theſe dangers as they preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me: if the reader ſhould think them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary, he may do well to treat them like other efforts of imagination; but, if he has the leaſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think them real, it is certainly his duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to avert them by every exertion in his power.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that preſents itſelf among the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of annulling the treaty, is, the detention of the Weſtern Poſts by the Britiſh. The not poſſeſſing of theſe poſts has latterly coſt the people of this country about a million of dollars annually, beſides the loſs of lives; beſides defeats and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual diſcontents. The poſſeſſion of them muſt, then, be a deſirable object. But, ſay the enemies of the treaty, they ought to have been given up
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030221_0084_0FE52942D0218FF8"/>
long ago, unconditionally. I have proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and I could repeat my proofs, but this is now totally out of the queſtion: we know they were not given up, that they are not yet given up, and we may be aſſured that they will not be given up, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the preſent treaty is carried into effect.</p>
               <p>But, it is ſaid, that the Britiſh are bound by the treaty to give up the poſts on the 1ſt of June, and that they ought to fulfill this part of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, without paying any attention to what is doing in Congreſs; that they have no buſineſs with our internal diſputes, the treaty being the only rule for their conduct; and, with this doctrine in hand, it is ſuppoſed, that ſome members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives mean to delay their deciſion on the ſubject till after the firſt of June; and if the poſts are not evacuated at that time, to accuſe the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh of annulling the treaty. To this I anſwer: that I am fully perſuaded, that the Governor of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da will retain the poſts, till the treaty has been ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by an appropriation law; and that I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced he would be juſtified in ſo doing. This nation formed a certain conſtitution, or manner of government, which they promulgated to the world; in this conſtitution it is ſaid, that treaties, made and ratified by the Preſident and Senate, <hi>ſhall be ſupreme laws of the land.</hi> Perſuaded that the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would abide by this its ſolemn declaration, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral powers made treaties with the Preſident and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and, among others, Great Britain; but before the time for fulfilling a certain ſtipulation in the treaty with Great Britain is arrived, it becomes matter of doubt, whether this treaty be valid or not; or rather, one branch of the American go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment declares it invalid, by a reſolution entered on its journals. Under ſuch circumſtances, will
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:030221_0085_0FE528E44E2A4C08"/>
common reaſon or common ſenſe deny, that the Britiſh would be juſtifiable in refuſing to fulfill their part of the ſtipulations?</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that Mr. Blount's reſolution declares the treaty <hi>invalid.</hi> The word invalid is not made uſe of but we ſhall ſoon ſee that the reſolution goes to the full length. The Houſe, by adopting it, have formally and explicitly declared, that a treaty including commercial regulations, is not binding on the United States, till ſanctioned by the Houſe of Repreſentatives. The preſent treaty includes commercial regulations, and therefore is <hi>not binding on the United States.</hi> The Houſe have alſo declared in this reſolution, that treaties including commercial regulations require the ſanction of the Houſe of Repreſentatives before they can be effectual; or, in other words, that the ratification of the Preſident and Senate is <hi>not ſufficient to give ſuch treaties their full and entire effect.</hi> The preſent treaty was, then, concluded and ratified by perſons not fully empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Now, the firſt principles, touching treaties, are; that, to be valid, <hi>the parties muſt have full power to conclude, ratify, and carry into effect;</hi> and that, the covenant muſt be <hi>equally binding and obligatory on both parties.</hi> The Houſe of Repreſentatives have declared, that the preſent treaty fails in both theſe points; they declare it invalid, and the Britiſh will certainly be permitted to believe them. Upon this ground it is, that, ſhould the Governor of Canada deliver the poſts, before the Houſe has ſanctioned the treaty, he would deſerve to loſe his head.</p>
               <p>I will juſt ſtop here to obſerve; that, I dare ſay, it never entered into the heads of the wiſe Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:030221_0086_0FE5294453D76050"/>
that Billy Pitt may, perhaps, play them a trick. Suppoſe he could gull the <hi>five</hi> ſans-culotte kings with Canada, in exchange for St. Domingo? the <hi>Poſts</hi> would go into the bargain, of courſe, and then we ſhould have to diſpute with our own dear kindred republicans for them. Take care, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; now or never is the time to have them, take my word for it.</p>
               <p>The treaty being invalid, all the other ſtipulations as well as that reſpecting the poſts, will aſſuredly remain unfulfilled. The reviſal of the ſentences given in the courts of Vice Admiralty, and the appointment of commiſſioners for examining ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, &amp;c. will not take place; the conſequence of which will be, the merchants of this country will loſe about five or ſix millions of dollars. Indeed, Mr. Livingſton, with a view of ſilencing theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, has brought forward a reſolution for paying theſe few millions out of the treaſury of the United States. All the difference in this caſe will be, that the loſs will be divided among us all; the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working peaſant and mechanic will be obliged to contribute towards an indemnification for a loſs, incurred by adventurers and ſpeculators.</p>
               <p>Things will remain, then, with reſpect to Great Britain, juſt as they were before Mr. Jay went to England; we muſt, therefore, bring ourſelves back to that epoch, and ſet out afreſh.</p>
               <p>The ſame alternative preſents itſelf: a negociation or war. The Preſident would prefer a negociation? but, can any one ſuppoſe, that he will ever enter into another? I ſhall, however, for a moment, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this to be poſſible. I ſhall ſuppoſe him content to give up his adherence to the conſtitution, to receive
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:030221_0087_0FE5291F2E327E08"/>
his inſtructions from the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and to order his Envoy to confine himſelf within the bounds traced out by that Houſe. I ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Envoy arrived at the Court of St. James's; and, that all may be of a piece, I ſhall ſuppoſe this Envoy to be the immaculate <hi>Mr. Gallatin.</hi> If this reſpectable perſonage ſhould be admitted to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with Lord Grenville, of which I much doubt, the following dialogue would very probably take place</p>

Can it be poſſible that the Americans are ſo poor in talents, ſo debaſed in principle, as to entruſt their public affairs to an European adventurer, the leader of an inſurrection! Can theſe people be ſo degenerated. I bluſh to think them the offspring of Britons. Bleſſed for ever be the laws of Old England, that exclude all foreigners from public offices. Theſe wretches are now tearing the government of America to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the ſubtle and intriguing <hi>Neckar</hi> did that of France.

I am certain that every offer to treat would be rejected with diſdain. War, then, muſt be reſorted to: not that war is the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the violation of a treaty; but with the accumulated load of griefs and inſults on both ſides, and the irreconcileable hatred exiſting in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030221_0091_0FE528B634301B80"/>
againſt Great Britain, it is morally impoſſible to preſerve peace.</p>
               <p>The Preſident and Senate are oppoſed to war; they know well its conſequences to this country; but, who can tell what the Preſident of next year may be? Can any man poſſibly hope, that General Waſhington will ſuffer himſelf to be degraded by remaining the pageant, the mere tool of a faithleſs and profligate faction. The reputation he has gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not in the power of hell to wreſt from him; hitherto he has been ſuffered to keep in the path of honour; but, one ſingle ſtep in the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is now required to tread, and his renown is blaſted for ever. No; if this treaty does not go into effect, it cannot be expected, it cannot be hoped, that he will again accept the poſt of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Nor will any other man accept of it, who is attached to the preſent conſtitution. Some more pliant mortal muſt, then, be found; ſome proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted friend of France, ready to ſacrifice the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of this country to the wild and bloody princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Convention. With ſuch a Preſident, and with ſuch a majority in the Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, war with Britain would be inevitable.</p>
               <p>War is at all times and to all countries dreadful in its effects, but to no country and at no time was it ever ſo dreadful as it would now be to America. This is not a warlike nation, nor has this nation a warlike government. In a war with any nation whatever, this country can gain nothing, and in a war with Great Britain it has every thing to loſe.</p>
               <p>When aſſertions like theſe are advanced, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for war turn, with imaginary triumph, to
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:030221_0092_0FE528E5D18390F8"/>
the reſult of the laſt war. They tell us, that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was victorious, and that the country is now much more populous and rich than it was then.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, what did this country <hi>gain</hi> by the laſt war? If <hi>independence</hi> was a <hi>gain</hi> (for <hi>at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> that is very problematical) it was the only gain, I ſhall not dwell on the <hi>loſſes;</hi> thoſe who have had their houſes burnt about their ears; thoſe who have been pillaged, plundered robbed of their property; thoſe who are now ſtarving with bundles of continental money under their roofs; thoſe who have loſt their children or their parents, do not need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of the loſſes of that war. If <hi>independence</hi> was the <hi>only gain</hi> of laſt war, what is to be the gain of another? The <hi>warriors</hi> do not pretend, that we could go and take Great Britain: they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that we could take Jamaica: they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend even that we could take Bermuda. What then can we take? Why—<hi>Canada.</hi> This is the burthen of their ſong, or rather <hi>war-hoop.</hi> With this they divert the rabble, and ſharpen their fangs for war and conqueſt. If you aſk them <hi>how</hi> they would do this, they tell you that <hi>men</hi> are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that <hi>four hundred thouſand</hi> would turn out volunteer againſt Great Britain. I believe twice that number would turn out for a field-day, with ſticks and ſtaves, and return very peaceably home to ſupper; but would they do this two days run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? If I am to judge from experience; from the infinite difficulty the government had to aſſemble ſo trifling a force as fifteen thouſand men on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent occaſion, I ſhould reduce this army of four hundred thouſand men to three or four battalions. I ſhall be told, that the ſentiments of the people concerning the <hi>exciſe</hi> were divided; and are they unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imous concerning the treaty? I will however ſuppoſe the people to have but one ſentiment; I will ſuppoſe
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:030221_0093_0FE5295185D83358"/>
                  <hi>one</hi> hundred thouſand men ready to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to all the rigour of military diſcipline, and all the hardſhips inſeparable from actual ſervice; I will ſuppoſe them all heroes, ready to <q>ſeek the bubble honour in the cannon's mouth;</q> and I will ſuppoſe a Waſhington at their head. Yet, theſe heroes muſt eat, and muſt have ſome kind of covering too, and this will coſt money. In ſhort, I have made a little calculation of the expence of <hi>fifty</hi> thouſand men, <hi>ten</hi> armed veſſels, <hi>ten</hi> galleys, with all the neceſſary officers, horſes, waggons, cannon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and I find the amount to be above <hi>twenty millions of dollars</hi> annually, a ſum three times as great as the <hi>preſent</hi> revenue of the United States. Can any ſober man look at this, and imagine this country fit to engage in a war? There is not ſpecie in the country ſufficient to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the war one month. As to loans, where are they to be obtained? in France, or in Holland? the very mention of thoſe countries, on ſuch a ſubject, excites laughter. Domeſtic loans; who will lend a ſixpence? Taxes? there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but houſes and land to tax. Commerce will be no more. The enemy will let nothing out of our ports, or into them. In a word, it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible for this country to equip any thing like a creditable force, without having recourſe to a <hi>paper currency and requiſitions.</hi> I care not who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from me in opinion, this opinion I give as my own, and, if war is declared, I ſhall ſee it verified.</p>
               <p>As <hi>doing injury to Great Britain</hi> is the ſtrongeſt ſtimulus to war in this country, I ſhall now take a view of the extent of that injury in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. As to the taking of Canada, I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it probable. There are men in that country
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:030221_0094_0FE528B929FF5BA8"/>
as well as this, and they are better men, too, if we believe thoſe debaſed wretches, who tell us, that one frenchman is worth three of their own an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. At any rate they are men, they are at home, they have eight or nine regular regiments, and a train of artillery, ſuch as this country will not have in fifty years to come, Engineers and other experienced officers. When the <hi>warriors</hi> talk about taking Canada, they forget that there is any body to defend it. To be ſure the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are <hi>ſubjects;</hi> but as they might get together twice the number of the <hi>citizens</hi> marched againſt them, there is a poſſibility, at leaſt, that they might lay ſome few of the latter dead upon the field.</p>
               <p>By ſea, a war with this country would not add a dollar to the expences of Great Britain. She is already armed, and can very well ſpare a ſtout ſquadron for this coaſt. How this ſquadron <hi>might be employed</hi> I ſhall not point out; ſuffice it to ſay, that, if doing <hi>injury</hi> ſhould be the object of the Britiſh Court, more could be done to us in one week, than we could do to Great Britain in ten years.</p>
               <p>But, we ſhould ſtarve their iſlands: no ſuch thing. He who is maſter of the ſea, may call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the maſter of the land. Thoſe who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to ſell, will ſell it, in ſpite of decrees and ordinances. The Britiſh would obtain all they wanted, juſt as they now do, with this advantage, that they would prevent their enemies from doing the ſame. The more I contemplate this ſubject, the more I am convinced, that a war with Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca would be favourable to the cauſe in which Great Britain is at preſent engaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="unknown:030221_0095_0FE5295307D5CC60"/>Another reaſon for going to war, is; we ſhould <hi>injure</hi> (always <hi>injure</hi>) the manufacturers in Great Britain; to which I beg may be added, we ſhould leave ourſelves naked. This latter may be a deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able object with the <hi>ſans-culottes,</hi> though I ſhould hardly imagine that Mr. <hi>Swanwick</hi> would much approve of it. People vainly ſuppoſe that the very exiſtence of Great Britain depends on her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with this country: experience might have taught us the contrary: ſhe can do without our trade for a dozen years at a time. Nor would ſuch a contraction of her commerce at the preſent time, and <hi>in the preſent caſe,</hi> cauſe any diſcontent in that country. Our behaviour would unite the nation, and the Engliſhman that would not patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear a temporary inconvenience or diſtreſs, that would not even ſpend his laſt ſhilling, to enable his king to revenge ſuch an abominable trait of perfidy as the annulling of this treaty, ought to be ſtripped to his ſkin, nay of his ſkin into the bargain. The fact is, that, beſides wanting the aid of France, this country would alſo want the aid of the Engliſh in this war: and this would be one of the great differences between this war and the laſt. Laſt war, addreſſes to the people of England did much: ſome of thoſe who came to fight for the king, took very good care to fight againſt him: ſoldiers and ſailors came to deſert to their <hi>brothers,</hi> who were combatting in a cauſe, which was pretty generally looked upon as the cauſe of Britons. Things are now changed. <hi>Doctor Franklin,</hi> were he to riſe from the dead, would not now be heard at the bar of the Houſe of Lords. No Engliſh Lords, <hi>after the fate of Lord Chatham's ſtatue</hi> at Charleſton, will ever take upon him the cauſe of this country; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, indeed, it be the Earl of Stanhope, who <hi>wiſhes
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:030221_0096_0FE529548B0BA6E8"/>
to be hanged.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Such was really the fate of Lord Chatham's ſtatue at Charleſton, in the ſpring of 1794. Mr. <hi>William Pitt's</hi> Effigy was burnt in the ſame town, and on the ſame day.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctor Prieſtley</hi> we have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have among us, and therefore he can do his country no more harm. No; if we are to have war, let us come forward boldly like republicans, and tell the Britiſh we abhor and deteſt them. No wheedling, no coaxing. Let thoſe who have burnt that nation's flag, and called for all the thunder bolts in the ſtores of heaven to be hurled on them, expect from them all the miſchief they can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do.</p>
               <p>I know, that ſuch language as this is unuſual in this country. It would be much more pleaſing to dwell on the power of the United States and the decrepid ſtate of Great Britain; but I am no can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for popular favour or applauſe. I delight in ſpeaking hard truths; and beſides, this is not the time for jeſting or flattery.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto proceeded upon the ſuppoſition, that the people of this country would be all unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cauſe of the war. But, how far would this be from the caſe! almoſt all the rich, almoſt all the people of property, would be oppoſed to it. There is another and ſtill more dangerous kind of diviſion, which would finally end in a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Union: I mean the diviſion of the North from the South. The enemies of peace, in the Houſe of Repreſentatives, are, with two honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exceptions, to be found almoſt ſolely in the ſouthern States. Can it be imagined, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and induſtrious people of the north will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be dragged down to perdition, merely to ſatisfy the unprincipled vengeance of a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:030221_0097_0FE528E7535B0848"/>
neſt of fraudulent debtors? Can it be imagined, that the New Englanders will tamely ſuffer the <hi>lords</hi> of Virginia to ſport with their proſperity and happineſs, as they do with their barrels of rice and tobacco at a cock-match? Common ſenſe forbids us to believe any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>I have ſuppoſed alſo, that the government would retain its preſent form; but, can this poſſibly be ſo? No; the moment a war ſhould be declared, in conſequence of the rejection of the treaty, the conſtitution would be thrown aſide as uſeleſs lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. A revolutionary ſtate muſt ſucceed. Then our Briſſots and our Robeſpierres would mount the throne: we have them ready at hand, and a war is all that is wanting to bring them forth. We ſhould have our <hi>ariſtocrats;</hi> indeed, they are already pointed out: the erection of a guillotine is all that remains for the <hi>patriots</hi> to do, preparatory to their execution. In ſhort, do we envy the French their ſituation, or do we not? Do we wiſh to experience thoſe ſufferings, at the recital of which we now weep? Do we wiſh to witneſs all thoſe cruelties, thoſe frightful horrors, that freeze the blood and make us aſhamed of our ſpecies? If we do, a war, at the preſent moment, will infallibly bring us the object of our wiſhes, and we ſhall do well to ſecond the endeavours of the Livingſtons, the Madiſons and the Gallatins.</p>

                        <salute>DEAR COUSIN,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I have long been a conſtant reader of your uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works, and, as belonging to a branch of your family, I have taken to myſelf ſome part of the honour which their boldneſs and evident object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the author; but, as my branch is a young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or ſubaltern one, and as I have not had the folly to adopt the levelling principles of the ſans-culottes of the preſent day, I have not 'till now preſumed to intrude on your time, nor ſhould I have done it at all, had not the Democratic tricks in this city ſeemed to call aloud for publicity.</p>
                     <p>Without further apology, then, I take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to inform you; that, yeſterday, an aſſembly was held in the Bridewel-Fields (they were, you ſee, on their own dunghill) to re-damn the treaty, or, in other words to decide on a <hi>petition</hi> to <hi>order</hi> the Houſe of Repreſentatives not to paſs the laws neceſſary for carrying it into effect. As all the merchants, and other inhabitants of credit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, had before ſigned a petition to a contrary effect, you will eaſily ſuppoſe of whom this Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel meeting was compoſed. The hour was, 12 o'clock, when <hi>labourers</hi> of every deſcription were at leiſure to attend. P. R. Liv—ton and M. Liv—ton (<hi>worthy</hi> relations of our <hi>nominal</hi> repreſentative) were the leading orators. After theſe came their coadjutor, Francis Van D—ke, a chocolate grinder, known only for his ſtupid head, his rancourous heart, his ſour phiz and the ridiculous buſtle he made about the <hi>tricolored flag,</hi> that ſome wag had the liberticide impudence to tear down from the place where it was hoiſted in our Coffee-Houſe. This man was <hi>chairman</hi> of the meeting. The next ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was Serj—t Cl—ke, ſo conſeſſedly in the pay
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:030221_0099_0FE529A7ED3DDD08"/>
of France, that he once actually ſued G—net for not paying his <hi>ſecret ſervices</hi> according to ſtipulated agreement. This "pretended patriot," previous to the meeting, advertized for the purpoſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing <q>ſeveral thouſand of hoop-poles, to be uſed as <hi>junkets (alias</hi> bludgeons) on the day of parade.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The complexion of the meeting was ſuch, that, it is ſaid, even the Liv—tons <hi>bluſhed</hi> at it. This, however, nobody, that knows the thickneſs of their ſkin, will believe. A petition was drawn up; but, as the aſſiſtants could not be ſuppoſed capable of ſigning their names, and, as in making their marks they muſt have rendered the paper as ſooty as their own paws, a committee was appointed to ſign for them, though the paws of this committee are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not much <hi>cleaner</hi> than thoſe of the aſſembly in general.</p>
                     <p>What effect ſuch a petition as this may have I know not: the ſapient heads of the Oppoſition ſeem to be turned; but they may reſt aſſured, that, if they have <hi>ſold</hi> us to France, the bargain will notſtand. They object to our treaty with Britain, becauſe contracted without their conſent, and we ſhall object to their treaty with France, becauſe contracted without our conſent. This is fighting them at their own weapons.</p>
                     <p>I muſt now call your attention to another event. On the 12th inſtant, one <hi>Kettlatas,</hi> whoſe offence was that of <hi>vilifying the aſſembly of the State,</hi> was ſet at liberty, and drawn in triumph through the ſtreets, ſeated in an old ragged Pheaton, by the Guards of the city; I mean the Black-Guards.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:030221_0100_0FE529C319FB13C8"/>
On this joyful occaſion there was a ſort of civic-fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival. The French <hi>hulks,</hi> now lying in our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour (where they have lain for nine months paſt, and where they will lie while there is an Engliſh armed ſhip at ſea) decorated themſelves in all their ſans-culotte parafarnalia, uſually exhibited at the triumph of ſavage anarchy over order and law.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee the cloſe connection that every where exiſts between the French and the brutal enemies of our governments. Theſe are inſults that no government ever before put up with; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, I truſt, we ſhall not long ſuffer with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.</p>
