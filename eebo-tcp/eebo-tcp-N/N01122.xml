            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Battel array against their Enemies. That which is supposed in the Text, is, That the People of God in a righteous Cause, and from a Call of God, are going forth in an Offensive War, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods, and their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.)

A care to keep themselves in their desires and actions from every Sin. True Holiness requires not only avoiding some of the grossest Sins, or many Sins, but every Sin.

            <p>When a People send forth their Souldiers on any Expedition, they are concerned to have Men of Courage and Activity employed, and these to be well accoutred, and every way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Service. They wish them good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, yea undoubtedly make many Prayers for their Safety and Success; all these things are very desirable, and commendable: but to the Souldiers prospering and succeeding abroad, its needful that they themselves, and such as stay at home, take heed that they dont provoke the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi> and <hi>God of Armies</hi> to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Himself from the <hi>Camp,</hi> or turn an Enemy to their Forces.</p>
            <p>In the Prosecution of this Truth consider these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> That the <hi>Gracious Presence</hi> of God with the Armies of His People, is a great Mercy, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely needful for their Prosperity. Its only through God that they can do Valiantly: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of the holy Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60.9, 10, 11, 12.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001339_0005_0FB2863B8C7F3FD0"/>
               <hi>Who will bring me into the strong City? Who will lead me into Edom? Wilt not thou O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou O God, which didst not go out with our Armies? Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our Enemies.</hi> Zech. 12.5. <hi>And the Governours of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.</hi> If an Army want this, what ever prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are made of choicest Souldiers, and those Equipt after the best sort, they shall either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with shameful disappointment, as to any annoyance to their adversaries, or fall as a prey to the rage and fury of their Enemies; yea the most valiant will easily be swept away: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this it shall be said, as Jer. 46.15. <hi>Why are thy valiant men swept away; they stood not, because the Lord did drive them.</hi> Consider here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> for War are from the <hi>Lord.</hi> Among the Praise worthy Characters of Souldiers the holy Scriptures make mention of this as none of the least, that they are <hi>Expert,</hi> and <hi>Skilful in War,</hi> 1 Chron. 12.33, 35, 36. <hi>Of Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lun such as went forth to Battel, expert in war with all instruments of war, fifty thousand which could keep rank,</hi> &amp;c. You read in the Scriptures of <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> for <hi>War,</hi> Isa. 36.5. <hi>I say, (sayest thou) (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wisdom and Counsel are very
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001339_0006_0FB2863D39B53568"/>
needful in all War: There are many War-like Stratagems and devices that require counsel, &amp; sound judgment; when, where, and how to attaque an Enemy, are weighty considerations that require Wisdom and Counsel for War: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for our own defence and safety; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, Encampings, Entrenching, Figures of Battel; Ordering and placing the Souldiery to advantage; Scaling of Walls, do all require Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Wisdom. But Counsel and Wisdom in all is from God: The holy Psalmist acknowledges all his skill to be given to him from God: He says, <hi>God taught him,</hi> Psal. 144.1. <hi>Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teacheth my hands to War, and my fingers to Fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> are from the Lord. 'Tis God that girdeth them with Strength. Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is the gift of God. Though some Persons are naturally of a more robust and couragious Spirit, and temper, than many others; yet it must be acknowledged, that it is God, which maketh them to differ; Yea <hi>Men of Courage,</hi> are not at all times equally couragious: Experience shows us also, that Persons of a timerous consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, have at times acted with the highest courage, and bravest resolution: From whence tis evident that valour is given, or taken away as pleaseth God. Strength and courage are very desirable qualifications for Souldiers, to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during &amp; going through the Fatigues of a War,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001339_0007_0FB2863E379F1AF0"/>
and their disputing with the Enemy in the gate, or their encountring the Adversary in the <hi>High places of the Field.</hi> They must be valiant, that would successfully fight the Battels of the Lord. Therefore that Commendation, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.8. <hi>And of the Gadites these separated themselves unto David unto the hold of the Wilderness, men of might, &amp; men of War, fit for the battel, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, &amp; were as swift as the roes upon the mountains.</hi> Strength and Courage as well as Wisdom &amp; Counsel are from the Lord: Tis God that takes away courage from the Adversary, and makes them dismay'd: 'Twas He that sent faitness of heart among the Canaanites of old, Josh. 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>And she said to the men, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terrour is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red-sea for you, when you came out of Egypt, and what you did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other side Iordan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And assoon as we heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the Lord your God, He is God in Heaven Above, and in earth beneath.</hi> Tis God that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens as a punishment of a Peoples Sins to take away courage, Lev. 26.36, 37. <hi>I will send a fait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a shaking leaf shall chase them, and they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001339_0008_0FB28643B9C9EE18"/>
shall flee, as fleeing from a sword: and they shall fall when none pursueth. And they shall fall one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</hi> Amos 2.14, 15. Tis God, that gives Spirit and Courage, Zech. 10.5. <hi>And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their Enemies in the mire of the streets in the battel, and they shall fight, because the Lord is with them.</hi> — It is God that hath said, Jer. 51.30, 31, 32. <hi>The mighty men of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon have forborn to fight: they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed, they became as women: they have burnt their dwelling places: her bars are broken. One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another; to shew the king of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon that his city is taken at one end, And that the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages are stopped, and the reeds they have burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Success</hi> of the battel is from the Lord. Tis He that crowns with the Victory: He gives Success to which party He will; yea tis alone with Him to save by many or by few; yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the fewest &amp; weakest have the Victory: Raw &amp; unexperienced Souldiers, carry the Field, when old experienced and well disciplined Souldiers flee away. Its therefore said, 2 Chron. 20.15. <hi>Be not afraid nor dismay'd by reason of this great Multitude for the battel is not yours, but Gods. Ye shall not need to fight in this battel: set your selves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001339_0009_0FB28645D9F606D0"/>
Iudah and Ierusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed: to morrow go out against them, for the Lord will be with you.</hi> God can make the Stars in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to fight against his Peoples Enemies. That good reforming King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> speaks comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his Souldiery, when proud insulting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were invading, 2 Chron. 32.7, 8. <hi>Be strong and couragious, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be moe with us, then with him.

An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall be deliver any by his great strength.</hi> Tho' the horse be prepared for the day of battel, safety is of the Lord: Its there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said, Eccl. 9.11. <hi>Nor the battel to the strong.</hi> If valiant, stout-hearted enemies come against Gods People, they cant prevail, when Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence is with them: Psal. 76.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battel.

            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> P. That People who have the <hi>Gracious Presence of God</hi> with their Armies, must carefully watch against all <hi>God-Provoking</hi> Evils.</p>
            <p>The Reasons are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because God is a <hi>Holy God,</hi> and cannot with any approbation behold iniquity, Hab. 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity.</hi> From the Holiness of God we may argue his Righteousness in frowning upon the Armies of a Sinful People, and refusing to go forth with them: from the Holiness of God we may argue, that it is inconsistent with the Honour of God, to give uninterrupted Success to the Armies of a degenerate Covenant People. When a People wont approve themselves a holy People, God says, That the staff in the hand of their Enemies, is His indignation, Isa. 10.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain: for all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out still. O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001339_0011_0FB2864CB2DD0EA0"/>
people of my wrath will I give him a chance to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</hi> The Unholiness of a People leaves them naked, and takes away their defence; which made Joshua and Caleb to say, Numb. 14.9. <hi>Only rebel not ye against the Lord, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear ye the people of the Land, for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them,</hi> — Its therefore said that Aaron had made the People naked, when he complyed with their motion in making them a calf, Exod. 32.25. <hi>And when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame amongst their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.)</hi> Tis God that is the defence of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Tis he that appoints Salvation for Walls &amp; Bulwarks, and always seasonably defends; as Birds flying he defends, but tis where He is the glory in the midst of them, Zech. 9.15. and 12.8. Isa. 4.5. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud, and a smoke by day, and the shining of a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.</hi> When God would encourage his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the days of Joshua, to expect his fighting for them and with them, He bids them be holy and obedient, Joshua 1.7, 8, 9. <hi>Only be thou strong, and very couragious, that thou mayest observe to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the law which Moses my servant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee: turn not from it to the right hand, or to the left: that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001339_0012_0FB2864EC002B750"/>2 <hi>Reas.</hi> Because they are the Sins of <hi>Gods Covenant People,</hi> that bring upon them the heavy distressing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites of War. Judg. 2 14, 15. <hi>And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, &amp; he delivered them into the hands of spoilers, that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</hi> Judg. 5 8. <hi>They chose new gods; then was war in the gates.</hi> How then can Gods People hope to speed, and get free from Judgments, that take no heed to Reform and put away the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Causes of War? See Josh. 7.11, 12, 13. <hi>Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the cursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even amongst their own stuff. Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from amongst you. Vp, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people, and say, Sanctifie your selves against to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</hi> See again, Josh. 24.19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20. — <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord: for he is an holy God: he is a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, he will not forgive your transgressions, nor your sins. If ye forsake the Lord, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reas.</hi> Because God gives them no ground
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001339_0013_0FB286508CD04600"/>
of encouragement to expect His <hi>Gracious, Succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Prospering Presence,</hi> without taking heed to put away what is an <hi>Offence</hi> to Him. As is enough evident from the fore-mentioned Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and multitudes of other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. God gives his People sufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a way of holy Obedience and thorough Reformation, to expect his gracious Presence with them in all respects; but on no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: As Psal. 89.30, 31, 32. <hi>If his children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake my law, and walk not in my judgments; If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; Then will I visit their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquities with stripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE</hi> I. To convince that People of their Sin and Folly, who boast of the Numbers, and Courage of their Souldiers sent forth on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but dont take care to put away, or keep themselves from Sin. The Sins of a People at home do oftimes more against the Souldiery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, than the Sword of the Adversary: Isai. 3.25, 26. <hi>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she being desolate, shall sit upon the ground.</hi> Its sure, nothing more animates, emboldens and encourages Adversaries, then the Sins of them they fight against: Jer. 50.7. <hi>All that found them, have devoured them, and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the Lord,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001339_0014_0FB286541F2E1DE0"/>
the Habitation of Iustice, even the Lord, the Hope of their Fathers.</hi> The Sins of a People in Covenant with God do strengthen the hopes of them that make War against them: Isa. 36.10. <hi>And am I now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it? The Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</hi> When a People walk holily, God is an Enemy to their Enemies: Jer. 2.3. <hi>Israel was holiness unto the Lord, and the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him, shall offend, evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord.</hi> The folly of a Covenant People in this regard is very great, because they know what God saith in this Word of avenging the quarrel of his Covenant, and bringing Enemies against them, and giving them Success; yea they know from the way of Gods former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences towards His own Professing People; how ineffectual a degenerate Peoples Forces have been to resist the anger of God; how He diminished the Armies of backsliding Israel of old, and poured contempt upon them. Their folly is very great because the most essential means of safety and success are neglected, and Gods counsel rejected. Again, God does not give them encouragement to rely on Him for success in a way of Apostasy, but rejects their confidences. We can never find Armies coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and numerous enough to resist God: Nor can we make Forts so high, and thick, but God
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001339_0015_0FB28655B6807420"/>
can easily throw them down, and make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual and unserviceable: their Sin and Folly therefore is witnessed against, that repaired their Forts, but disregarded God, Isa. 22.8. &amp;c. <hi>And thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forrest.</hi> II.V. <hi>But ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long aloe.</hi> See also 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE.</hi> II. This should put us upon enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Whether the fault of the unsuccesfulness of our Souldiery, be not in those of us that stay by the stuff. Are we, have we been keeping our selves from every Wicked thing? We have reason to take notice of the frowns of God upon us, and be humbled under them, in that God does not go forth with our Armies; or do any great matter by them against our Adversaries: a great deal expended in raising Armies, Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some &amp; toylsome Marches by the Souldiery, &amp; very little effected: for God does not go forth with our Forces: How often has our Souldiery been unsuccessful, and Armies returned without any considerable annoyance of our Enemies: how often has God in this way put our Military Troops to shame? Surely such disappointments should put us upon enquiries, Why God thus frowns? What means the heat of his displeasure? God expects to hear all saying, <hi>What have I done?</hi> There are many complaints on this account. Sometimes, some are ready to murmur against
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001339_0016_0FB286574BF9B838"/>
Rulers, (an evil that Israel of old were guilty of when under frowns, they would be complaining and murmuring against their Rulers, and an evil too too prevailing among Gods People in every age) as tho' the fault was in them, and they the blameable causes of their disasters. Some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain against the Commanders of the Forces em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, &amp; sent forth, as tho' they wanted courage, and were faint hearted, or were not Persons of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conduct. Sirs, let me tell you, the fault is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often in them that tarry by the Stuff, they are all the while taking a course to provoke the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> &amp; <hi>God of Armies</hi> to be an Enemy to their Souldiers: Far from being affected for the Souldiers abroad, as <hi>Uriah</hi> was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.11. Sirs, let me ask you who are censuring others for their cowardise, and imputing the want of Success in our War, to those that are employed in sending Forces abroad, or to those that are sent forth, Whither you hant reason to be turning some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against your selves, <hi>viz.</hi> in taking courses to make God angry with the Land? Who? where is the man of you all? that can stand before our God, who is a consuming fire to the workers of iniquity, when he clothes himself with vengeance, and comes forth in Battel array to punish &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Sinful, backsliding People: If God armes Flyes, Frogs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to come in battel array upon Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah, &amp; the Egyyptians, they cant withstand. If Enemies be in themselves despicable, yet if sent
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001339_0017_0FB28659C77053D0"/>
by God and commissioned by him to punish a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People, they shall be made very formidable. Verily Sirs, when God so often seems in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences to fight against our Armies, it gives us reason in good earnest to inquire whether God be not saying, <hi>Neither will I be with you any more, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you put away the accursed thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>USE.</hi> III. Of Reproof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To reprove Souldiers, and such as go forth to War, that take no heed to keep themselves from every wicked thing. Its great folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in you to remain Un-reformed, and to be going on still in your iniquities. One would think that Frontiers &amp; Souldiers should be engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all seriousness, and thorowness to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thorowly to amend their ways and their doings, they are so often as it were in the jaws of Death, and at the mouth of the Grave: and yet how often cause to fear, whether borders be not borders of Wickedness, &amp; continuing to provoke God to say, as Mal. 1.4.— <hi>And they shall call them the border of wickedness, and the people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</hi> Surely the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in so many of our borders should at least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion all our borders to be solemnly thinking upon that Scripture, Jer. 15.13, 14. <hi>Thy substance &amp; thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, &amp; that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001339_0018_0FB2865BBABAF920"/>
which shall burn upon you.</hi> If in all our borders we approve our selves holy to the Lord, and keep our selves from every wicked thing, doubtless God will say as Zeph. 2.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>I have heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Moab, &amp; the revilings of the children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, whereby they have reproached my people, &amp; magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themselves against their border. Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab shall be as Sodom, &amp; the children of Ammon as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, even the breeding of nettles, &amp; salt pits, &amp; a perpetual desolation, the residue of my people shall spoil them, &amp; the remnant of my people shall possess them. This shall they have for their pride, because they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, &amp; magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts. The Lord will be terrible unto them:</hi> Surely the frequent disappointments of Souldiers give occasion to ask whether the <hi>Holy God,</hi> the <hi>Lord of hosts,</hi> &amp; <hi>God of Armies,</hi> dont see what is displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to the <hi>Pure eyes of his glory</hi> among them. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souldiers are very much to blame, if by their own Sins, they turn back the weapons of their own Warfare, &amp; prove traitors to themselves. Is there not ground to fear whether the Sins of Souldiers, not only before but in their Service do not provoke God at least to say, <hi>That He wont ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them to do any great Service for Him, or His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> The unsatiable Tiplings of Souldiers at Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries, their delighful Debauching of themselves with Strong Drink, when ever they can come at it, to ingratiate themselves with one another; are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001339_0019_0FB2865D04E51510"/>
not the way to ingratiate themselves with God; if they by wickedness debase themselves, they take a course either to return with shame under such humbling considerations that God was not with them, and that they have not performed any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical Actions; or to fall down among the slain in the day of Gods anger. Souldiers must not be Enemies to God <hi>themselves,</hi> by their Sins, if they would be thought to do God Service in fighting against his <hi>Enemies.</hi> Our <hi>Armies</hi> should be HOLY to the Lord: Its through God alone you can do valiantly: what a madness then to Sin away the gracious presence of God from you? and to provoke him to say, <hi>I will not be with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To reprove all such who tarry at home, (when the Host goes forth to War) and take no care to keep themselves from every wicked thing. How very faulty and blame worthy are all those that indulge themselves in God-provoking Evils to a making the Land guilty before God? Its Sin at any time, but this gives a farther accent to the Sin of a People, and is a real aggravation of their Sinfulness, that they refuse to amend their ways and their doings, when their Armies are in the Field.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You act as tho' you had no <hi>Bowels of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to your Friends, Relations &amp; Neighbours, and are doing of them the greatest injury. You cry out against the Enemy for Murdering so many. Sirs, your ways and your doings procure these
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001339_0020_0FB2866031ED8268"/>
things: I may say, our Apostasies from God and Holiness, kill our Friends, &amp; open the Grave for many of our acquaintance. You cant express your charity and love to your Neighbours and Friends who jeopard their Lives in the high places of the Field, whilst by your Sins you are separating between them &amp; their God. The <hi>Sins</hi> of a Covenant People do more against their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies &amp; Frontiers, and slay more of their Friends than their <hi>Enemies</hi> can do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You are hereby an occasion of a great deal of dishonour to the <hi>Holy God,</hi> and the <hi>holy Religion</hi> you profess. By your means the Adversaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the true Religion as tho' God disown'd it, because he frowns upon the Armies of them that profess it; the Enemies reproach &amp; defy the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> of the <hi>Living God.</hi> Our Armies would be a terrour to our Adversaries, and would have been very Victorious, were it not for our Apostasy. You blame them that do defy our Armies; but much blame belongs to you that occasion their being reproached. You are dreadfully in love with your Lusts, or you would not be thus gratifying of them, to the prejudice of Religion, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the Land, to the reproach of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the God of Israel. Your hearts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved far from God, who cannot at such a day and under such circumstances, be prevailed with to be a holy people to the Lord: may we not say you are the <hi>Troublers of Gods Israel</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:001339_0021_0FB286649DE273A0"/>3. You are dreadfully stupid under, &amp; unaffected with the Wrath of God that burns so against us this day. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.24, 25. God has brought such desolations that have made the Ears of them that hear of them to tingle: yea to give an occasion to say as to some of our own Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Go to my house at Shiloah, &amp; see what I have done</hi>; and yet how many so unawakened under so many Sins and Judgments past, that they are at present running upon the thick bosses of Gods buckler, who are Sinning to the procuring guilt to their own Souls, and the Land, without fear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You are very Presumptuous whilst you look for great Success to your Forces in such a way of unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medness. Your Prayers, so long as such idols are set up in your hearts, are not like to be prevailing, are like to be as unserviceable to your Hosts abroad, as they to you; yea you may expect that God will answer by <hi>Terrible Things,</hi> and yet in <hi>Righteousness,</hi> when you wont hearken to the voice of God to amend your ways and your doings: <hi>Ezek</hi> 14 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many Prayers, Days of Prayer &amp; Fasting, without Reformation, are not likely to be acceptable Prayers to God: They are not such Fasts as he has chosen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Last VSE.</hi> Of Exhortation, to Exhort you to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be a <hi>Holy People</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be keeping from every <hi>Wicked thing.</hi> All those that stay at home may do a great deal to further, or hinder the Success of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Your Prayers of Faith, your holy Examples, your painful Endeavours to promote Holiness, &amp; effect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Provoking Evils, may do a great deal of Service.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God stands as it may be said with his <hi>Drawn Sword</hi> in his hand to awaken you to a necessary Reformation. He dont only threaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but gives you to hear what Armies He has in a readiness, either to drive you to your Duty,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001339_0022_0FB28667D0BFFE90"/>
or punish you for your refusals of Obedience. God has already mixt many a bitter cup for us to drink, to put us upon considering, &amp; says to this day, <hi>That his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still: You can't resist God &amp; Prosper.</hi> When the Trumpet is blown and such Alarming providence, to warn, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sad if by our security &amp; bold impenitency we provoke God to sheathe his Sword in our bowels, &amp; cause the slain of the Lord to be many.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you go on in your Unreformedness, you will be an occasion of our Hosts going out to meet the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with the guilt of a backsliding People upon them. No <hi>Army</hi> your Forces can meet with can be so formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, as the <hi>Guilt</hi> of a People Apostatizing from God, and holy Obedience. The Sword of our Souldiery would not return empty, our Hosts would perform praise worthy Actions, our Warriours would do valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if our iniquities dont dishearten &amp; disappoint them. Oh! make hast, to get Guilt removed, endeavour that the controversy between God &amp; the Land may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, that our Peace may be made with God; &amp; then he will be as the <hi>Lord of our Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Your being holy &amp; keeping from Sin, will be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way beneficial to your selves. God will do you no harm if you repent &amp; turn to him; He will crown your Forces with Success<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as birds flying he will defend your Plantations: It will be beneficial to you as to your Worldly Interests; a great deal of your Substance that is spent on your Lusts, will be preserved; &amp; those heavy Charges under which you groan, will be prevented. Such breaches, and bereavements in Relations, Towns, Families &amp; Neighbourhoods, causing such distressing, amazing Sorrows &amp; Griefs, will be prevented; such strifes &amp; unhappy Contentions that take away our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and are so ominous, will be a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

accusation of your own Consciences, informed from the word of God, prevented, &amp; your Souls will be filled with Gods love &amp; grace in every respect for Soul &amp; Body; it will be a Gain and Benefit to you to be Holy.</p>
            <p n="4">4 You will by Unreformedness augment the fierce anger of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; bring a farther decay upon Religion. If instead of reforming Sins warn'd of, and witness'd against; we grow angry with them that warn us, &amp; wont be reform'd; we shall procure great guilt to our selves: <hi>Ier.</hi> 26 18, 19. If we cant bear to have our Sins Witnessed against to put us upon reforming &amp; amending, we must yet prepare to bear the indignation of the Lord, and must feel the effects of Gods Wrath. Is the iniquity of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Let us then labour to get a right knowledge what the God-provoking Evils are that are among us, and carefully set our selves against them. Are they not Contempt of Christ, Gospel Grace, &amp; Gospel institutions, making way for the manifest works of the Flesh, in Wantonness, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Idleness &amp; Pride? Are there not unhappy Contentions, Murmurings, reproachful Censuring of one another, &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, with a Luke-warmness of Soul in our Profession?</p>
            <p>Let every one carefully in their place set themselves to Reform, and amend: Those that are in Civil Authority should not hold the Sword in vain. All that God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned to Preach in his Name, should in Life &amp; Doctrine endeavour a Reformation, &amp; improve their interest &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the Suppressing of Sin. All heads of Families should engage in a speedy &amp; thorow care that we may be a People Saved from our Degeneracy, and become a holy People to the Lord; and then God will say with respect to our Forces, as Josh. 5.13, 14. <hi>And Ioshua went unto him &amp; said unto him, Art thou for us or for our Adversaries? And he said nay but as a Captain of the Host of the Lord am I now come.</hi>
