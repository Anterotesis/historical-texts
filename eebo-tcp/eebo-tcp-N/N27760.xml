            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FROM the beginning, the world has been favored in every age, with one or more eminent characters, who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves, in a very remarkable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by their virtues, in promoting the public good.—The Great Governor of the Univerſe, when about to confer any ſpecial favor upon any particular nation or people, has permitted them to be brought into ſtraits and difficulties, that in raiſing up and inſpiring ſome highly favored character among them, with wiſdom and courage to ſuperintend the affairs of the body politick, they might be convinced they owed their deliverance to HIM, who ſitteth upon the flood and rudeth <hi>King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi> In this chapter we have the dying teſtimony of Stephen, relative to the deliverance of Iſrael, after four hundred years bondage, by Moſes, one of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom the Lord had choſen as their leader, whoſe life was preſerved amidſt innumerable dangers, and who, under the direction of Providence, was brought up in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036991_0003_100C33AAD7352D68"/>
the court of Egypt and was learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians, who were then famed for all manner of polite literature, particularly philoſophy, aſtronomy and hieroglyphics. Moſes receiving his education at court, had opportunities of improving himſelf by the beſt of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, the beſt of tutors and the beſt of converſation in all the arts and ſciences and had a genius for them; by this means, he detected and confuted the aſtrologers and magicians of Egypt and the way was paved for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon the difficult and arduous taſk of delivering his own nation from their long captivity and bondage.—Being advanced to the office of prime miniſter of ſtate, the favorite of heaven and the friend of the friendleſs Jews then under the hand of the oppreſſor, he was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered conſpicuous by his courage, conduct and ſucceſs, and being prepared by human helps and divine emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he became <hi>mighty</hi> in words and in deeds. After the miracles he wrought and the deliverances he procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Iſrael, as an honeſt and faithful ſervant of God, He aſcribed all the glory to Him in whoſe cauſe he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked and by whoſe power he had been ſuſtained. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, he conſulted the Lord and proved by his exemplary conduct that he feared and ſerved the God of Iſrael.</p>

BEING called together by the Executive and Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority to celebrate the auſpicious birth of the illuſtrious GEORGE WASHINGTON, who was born February 22d, 1732, whoſe name alone ſtrikes earthly titles dead, and to mourn his death, which took place December 14th, 1799, while authority commands and duty ſupports that authority, gratitude and affection, which are the moſt powerful conſtraints, lay us under the moſt pleaſing, yet painful neceſſity of complying with the wiſhes of our rulers and of uniting with millions of our fellow-citizens in paying a ſmall tribute to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory and ſublime virtues of our deceaſed and beloved de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, guardian and father, and which humble tribute will no doubt be annually paid, while the page of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry continues to hand down to poſterity the peculiar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits and ſingular Virtues of one of the greateſt of Men that ever inhabited this lower world. Like Moſes, he was ſingularly eminent in the following reſpects: Firſt, In wiſdom—Secondly, In words—Thirdly, In deeds.</p>
            <p>FIRST, Eminent in wiſdom. Though Moſes was learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians, yet the firſt and greateſt mark of his wiſdom appeared in his regard to the divine authority, in chooſing GOD for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, embracing the promiſe of Chriſt expreſſed in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah's

Thus proving like a wiſe man, that the concerns of the Soul were of infinitely greater importance than thoſe of a temporal nature; he regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his conduct accordingly, as one made wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. So our illuſtrious Father deceaſed, was a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that wiſdom which is from above which is "Pure, peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy," therefore a man of prayer, a man of faith and a Man of God—He evidenced his religion by the ſtrictneſs of his morals, the integrity of his heart and his love to his country.

            <p>To reſcue mankind from theſe dreadful woes, was the labor and toil of the late illuſtrious character. For this he was raiſed up and qualified—for this he fought—for this he prayed, and in the poſſeſſion of this he rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. In the victories he obtained, and in the nation's quiet enjoyment of theſe invaluable bleſſings, he ſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſword, retired to his ſhade and glorified his God.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Eminent, or mighty in words. Few they were but weighty; as well choſen, as the ſubjects which called for them were important. The gentleman, the ſcholar, the ſtateſman, the warrior and the chriſtian ſhine forth in his letters of correſpondence, on all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

lie as well as private occaſions, while his diction in his farewell addreſs and laſt legacy to his dear countrymen and fellow-citizens, diſcovers his genius and eloquence. His word was a law—not enforced by arbitrary authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but by reaſon and argument, and as cheerfully was he obeyed as he humbly commanded. His words were fitly ſpoken, therefore, like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY. Eminent, or mighty in deeds. Read the hiſtory of the revolution—Contemplate the bleſſings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed as the fruit of his labors, and with me you will join in aſcribing the glory to God, as the author, while acknowledging the merit and praiſe due to his wiſdom, courage and prudence, as the inſtrument. Eulogium upon eulogium and oration upon oration has been deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered and circulated through the union to make the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his virtues upon our minds more plain and clear, and to emulate our youth with becoming ardour to imitate his bright example, that generations yet to come may ſee and be aſtoniſhed at the great things the Lord has done for this highly favored nation, through the indefatigable labors of this great man. Theſe Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhores are now become the grand aſſylum for the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036991_0009_100C33B6B55DC228"/>

            <p>I ſhould encroach upon the office of the hiſtorian and do injuſtice to the character of the American Hero, were I to attempt to unfold his plans, to deſcribe his exploits, his battles, his victories and the fruits of all, in the vaſt variety of bleſſed conſequences which follow. While we admire the man, let us admire that wiſdom which direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind and conduct—that power which ſhielded him from every danger and that goodneſs which rendered him ſucceſsful in promoting and eſtabliſhing the liberty, independence and proſperity of his country; and let us bow with cheerful ſubmiſſion to the will of God in his removal from us, fully perſuaded that the God of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is at no loſs to raiſe up an Eliſha to catch the falling mantle of our deceaſed Elijah. Amidſt all theſe prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent marks of wiſdom and true excellency, Waſhington was but a man, a moral man and a ſinner, who needed the blood of the covenant to atone for his guilt, the

Could he now be an eye witneſs of our devotion, and were it in his power to addreſs us, inſtead of ſoliciting our homage and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he would check that promptitude for creature worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with the angel ſay "See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-ſervant, worſhip God." He would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our attention to one infinitely more deſerving our adoration, than even the moſt uſeful and celebrated mortal, even to CHRIST JESUS, and to the character of this glorious perſon I now call your attention, who was before Abraham and who is a greater than Solomon, even God's fellow, and in whom dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily—Who is both white and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

An all-ſufficient Redeemer was provided—

What ſhall his name be called? IMMANUEL, "God with us." God in our nature, God on our ſide: He ſtooped from heaven to earth, he ſuffered the juſt for the unjuſt, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all righteouſneſs, magnified the law, died to atone our guilt, aſcended on high as the mighty conqueror, and now lives, ever lives to make interceſſion even for tranſgreſſors. Thus he fought our battles, vanquiſhed our foes, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a complete victory over ſin, death and hell; received the approbation of his Father in theſe words of inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "This is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed," and opened the gates of life and ſalvation, with the moſt preſſing invitation, and ſure promiſe of acceptance, on our laying down the weapons of hoſtility, falling at the footſtool of mercy and pleading the promiſe of his grace.</p>
            <p>HE was endued with wiſdom. "In him were hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge;" for "In him dwelt all the fulneſs of the Godhead," that "out of his fulneſs we might receive grace for grace."</p>
            <p>HE was mighty in words—O what gracious words dropt from his lips! well might one ſay "His lips are like lilies dropping ſweet ſmelling myrrh." The goſpel of ſalvation in all its variety, beauty and ſweetneſs is as "Good news from a far country."</p>

HERE are warnings, reproofs, invitations and promiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Words of peace to his friends, but terror to his foes. In ſome inſtances they have been words conveying light and giving life; comforting, healing, ſupporting and eſtabliſhing. In others, they have been the ſavor of death unto death. "If our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt." While theſe words ſpeak comfort to the mourner, they ſpeak terror to the impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—Mighty in words by making uſe of the weakeſt of inſtruments to accompliſh his great and glorious purpoſes, that the excellency of the power might be known to be of God and not of man. Mighty in deeds as well as in words. What has he not done to ſatisfy the demands of juſtice and make honorable the law which we have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?—What has he not done to make known his word of truth, in ſpite of all the oppoſition of earth and hell? What has he not done in order to bring home with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power and efficacy the word of ſalvation to the hearts of his people, and in guiding, guarding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting them, and enabling them to perſevere, that they might receive the end of their faith, even the ſalvation of their ſouls, and in crowning all their efforts with glory, honor, immortality and eternal life.—While therefore, ſome make the fruitleſs attempt, to deify the celebrated

WASHINGTON, in whom was united ſuch an aſſemblage of natural, moral and divine excellencies, the greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of human nature, that in his countenance was portrayed the greatneſs of his ſoul and the dignity of his character, ſo that <hi>vice</hi> before Him ſtood abaſhed, and conſcious guilt appal'd, ſhrunk back, while others have, in vain, attempted to make him an advocate above, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting him to the ſkies upon the foundation of his virtues, thereby tarniſhing his character as a Chriſtian, diſhonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their maker, and eclipſing the glory of the Saviour of mankind—While others, again, conſidered his military, literary and perſonal accompliſhments, as the price of his future rewards, they fully his reputation, and little think, he ſpake, he wrote, he fought and conquered for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of others, and with an eye to a ſtate of futurity—Vain, deluded mortals! The Chriſtian Hero is degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch <hi>romance.</hi> The nation is inſulted, while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion diſowns the foundation on which ſuch principles are built. Let us bow with reverence before the great Arbiter of the univerſe, and celebrate the birth, mourn the death and rejoice in the proſpect of uniting with our beloved WASHINGTON in aſcriptions of praiſe to HIM who hath conferred ſuch ineſtimable favours on this happy land.</p>

LET us not attempt to bring down the curſe of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by turning from the worſhip of the Creator, to that of the creature.—Ever may we improve the bleſſings we enjoy, by acknowledging the hand which beſtowed them with thankfulneſs and humility, expreſſed by the cheerful obedience of our lives to his will. As fallen ſinners in bondage to ſin and Satan, cry to this deliverer, enliſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his banner, truſt to his wiſdom and ſoon the battle will be over, the victory gained and ſalvation aſcribed to him to whom alone it is due.</p>
