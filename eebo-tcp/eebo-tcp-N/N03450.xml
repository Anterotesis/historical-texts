            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROVERBS XXVIII. 17.</bibl>
               <q>A man that doth Violence to the blood of any
person, shall flee to the Pit, Let no man
stay him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Divine Sentence in the Lips
of the King, seems to be of the
same Nature with that Law
which was Established presently
after the flood, Gen. ix. 6. <hi>Whoso
sheddeth mans blood, by man shall
his blood be shed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the Nature of man hath been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Apostasy, persons have been capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all that is bad. Not only have they
been filled with Hatred and Enmity to the
blessed God, which hath broken out &amp; shewn
it self in their words and Actions and is Horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be thought upon, But they have been
Exceeding Injurious to one another;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:004215_0004_0000000000000000"/>
For this Reason Government hath been <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi>
and Laws have been provided, that
Injuries may Either be prevented or redressed
and Societies may be kept in tolerable peace
and Order. For there would be no Living in
any <hi>Safety,</hi> if there were no Restraints, laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
peoples Evil Inclinaions, If it were free
for them, who are Viciously Disposed, to Act
as they please, If there were none to call them
to an Account, or put them to Shame in any
thing, or punish them for what they do amiss.</p>
            <p>As for Lesser Injuries which are done to
our Neighbours, whither by Wronging them
in their <hi>Estates,</hi> or Hurting them in their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
Depriving them of <hi>their Liberty,</hi> or
Maiming <hi>their Bodies</hi> and the like, Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
may be made them again, and the Laws
take care about it; That it shall be done <hi>in
Kind,</hi> or <hi>in Money,</hi> which in this sense may be
also said, <hi>to Answer all things,</hi> as well as because
it purchaseth for us all the Necessaries and
Conveniences of Life</p>
            <p>But when Life is Taken away, because <hi>that</hi>
cannot be restored again to the person slain &amp;
it is univesally preferred above all Temporal
good Things, Therefore it is <hi>fit</hi> and the Laws
have provided, that <hi>Life shall go for Life,</hi> as a
punishment for the Crime, That Evil doers
should be made to suffer an Equal Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
with <hi>that</hi> which they have brought upon
Others, and also to be a Warning to all the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004215_0005_0000000000000000"/>
standers by, that they may <hi>hear and fear and do
no more so wickedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doing Violence to the Blood of any person,</hi> is a
phrase to Express the Slaying of another with
Intention and Design and without a Cause;</p>
            <p>Such an One must <hi>flee to the Pit,</hi> i. e. the
Grave, He must be put to Death and buried
out of sight, It may Intimate too, the hast
and Dispatch that must be made in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
He must be reprieved no longer, than
some valuable End may be served by it and
particularly to give him time for repentance.</p>
            <p>It seems to me, that this phrase, doth not
so much Intimate, as some would Interpret it,
that they who are guilty of Murder, will go
about as <hi>Vagabonds</hi> &amp; <hi>Fugitives</hi> (like <hi>Cain</hi> after
the Slaughter of his brother) run into Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
be perpetually haunted and affrighted
with an Evil Conscience and be ready Ever &amp;
anon to lay Violent hands upon themselves,
and that none should pity them, Comfort
them or stay their hand from so Just an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
if it were in their power;</p>
            <p>But rather it shews what is fit to be Done
by the Ministers of Justice, those publick <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Blood,</hi> When Murder hath been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
they should <hi>Straitway</hi> Enquire into it,
Secure the person Suspected, bring him to his
Trial as soon as may be and having sufficient
proof of the Fact, Sentence the guilty person
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004215_0006_0000000000000000"/>
to <hi>dy the Death</hi> and see that Execution be
done with all Convenient hast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let no man Stay him.</hi> Every one in their
Place should Discountenance the Violence that
hath been done and rise up as with a general
Consent to testify against it, They should
Contribute what is in their Power and lend
an hand towards the bringing of such offenders
unto Justice; If it were in their power to
stop the prosecution, defeat the process or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the Sentence, they must not do it; For
such Offenders as these have forfeited their
Claim to the protection of mankind and must
now be driven from among men.</p>
            <p>In the farther speaking to these words I shall
Consider. <hi>First.</hi> That when persons have
been guilty of Doing Violence to the blood of
Others, too often there are Endeavours used,
to screen them from the punishment which
they have Justly Deserved. <hi>Secondly.</hi> That
this is by no means fit to be done and people
should be strictly Cautioned against it. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
That Death is the Just punishment to be
Inflicted upon such persons, who have been
guilty of doing Violence to the blood of others.</p>
            <p>I. We may Consider, <hi>That when persons have
been guilty of doing Violence to the blood of Others,
too often there are Endeavours used to Screen them
from the punishment which they have Iustly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
This is supposed in the Text, <hi>Let no man
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004215_0007_0000000000000000"/>
stay him,</hi> that some may be Inclined to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
&amp; prevent their fleeing to the pit, There
are none so bad, but there will be some, to
favour and shelter and rescue them from the
punishment which they have deserved:</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to the farther Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this head, I shall premise two things
to shew what is not faulty in such cases.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is no fault to have Compassion upon such
malefactors and minister to their Necessities and
Comfort, during the Time they are permitted to
Live.</hi> Common Humanity will bind us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Just Indignation rising in our
breasts, against the Odious crime that hath
been Committed, to see that nothing be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the tolerable support of Life during
their Confinement. If they should prove stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
&amp; hard hearted, these good Offices will
indeed be done with so much less good-will;</p>
            <p>But when they appear truly sensible of their
fauls &amp; humble under them, we may minister
to them with readiness and Delight, we must
feed them when they are Hungry, cloth them
when they are Naked, see that they be not
Exposed to the cold and not suffer them to
want any thing that is for their Convenience;</p>
            <p>It is true, they are not shut up in Prison there
to be pampered &amp; seasted, but Neither should
they be unnecessarily pinch'd and exposed;
Besides the publick allowance, there is room
for private charity's to be Exercised, that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004215_0008_0000000000000000"/>
they may not suffer more than needs must,
during the time they are allowed to Live, and
if they have given Evidence of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and behaved themselves like Christians,
whatever persons shall bestow upon them <hi>in
the name of a Disciple</hi> and because they <hi>belong to
Christ</hi> though it be but a <hi>cup of cold water only,</hi>
Verily they <hi>shall not lose their reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Much less is it a fault, to Instruct, Counsel
and Pray for them, and take what pains we can
with them that they may be prepared for Death and
find mercy with God, when they must be dispatched
out of this world.</hi> For we may remember that
no crimes whatever they be, do put poor
Creatures out of the reach of Divine mercy,
provided they may be made sensible of them
and brought to a thorow repentance; Pains
therefore should be taken with such people, if
haply God will please to bless those Endeavours
for the opening of their Eyes, that they may
be brought to <hi>fly for refuge to lay hold of the
hope that is set before them;</hi> That since they
must quickly Die they may be prepared to
die well and their spirits may be saved in the
Day of the Lord;</p>
            <p>Instructions should be given them from
God's Word; The Odiousness &amp; Evil Desert
of their Sins should be shewed them, till they
are brought heartily to bewail and repent of
them; The way of Salvation by Jesus Christ
should be set before them and they should be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004215_0009_0000000000000000"/>
urged still to fall in therewith; and Prayers
should be put up for them Night &amp; Day.</p>
            <p>These things premised, I proceed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bder,
that persons are too often faulty in
Screening those who have done Violence to the
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lood of others from the punishment which
they have deserved; This has been attempted
divers ways.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sometimes by Suppressing the Truth, when
they are called to give Testimony and Evidence of
what they know in such cases.</hi> They know a
great deal if they would but speak, They
could give in a full &amp; clear Evidence in the case.
But sometimes it hath been seen that Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
have stifled and suppressed the truth in
favour to them, that their Iniquity may not be
brought to Light;</p>
            <p>As there are false witnesses, who somtimes
speak more than is true in Order to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of the Innocent, So there are people
who will not declare what they Know when
they are called to it and put upon it, in Order
to the Screening of the guilty. Or they will
so soften their Testimony that there shall be
no great force in it, chusing rather to derive
some guilt to themselves, than that they
should be made to flee to the pit, as they have
justly Deserv'd. This may be attempted,</p>
            <p>2. Somtimes by Endeavouring to plead them off,
when the matter comes before the Cognizance of
the Iudges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004215_0010_0000000000000000"/>
There have been Advocates who have used
their Eloquence &amp; skill in a Mercenary &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
manner to blanch the foulest Actions
and bring off clear such as have Justly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to die:</p>
            <p>Not but that Advocates may be justly Assigned
to Criminals to set their Case in its true light,
to keep off that mischief which they have not
Justly deserved and that they may not be too
much born down in the heat of the prosecution.</p>
            <p>But when they quite pervert things, Call
evil good &amp; put light for darkness, and by the
colouring of words &amp; arts of Sophistry they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make that innocent or venial, which
merits the utmost resentment, Now they may
be said to use their Endeavour to <hi>Stay</hi> them,
who by the Ordinance of Justice, should be
<hi>fleing to the pit.</hi> This may be attempted,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Somtimes by giving in wrong Verdicts, after
the Cause hath been heard, or accepting such Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
when they are brought in.</hi> This also hath
been Known somtimes in the world; Verdicts
have been given somtimes by <hi>favour,</hi> as well as
somtimes by <hi>prejudice.</hi> When this last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails,
the poor Prisoner, though he hath amply
clear'd himself &amp; baffled by his Just replyes all
the charges &amp; accusations brought against him,
yet hath been brought in guilty, and the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
hath been Accepted, because he was one
that had fallen under a general Odium; So on
the other hand, when the proofs have been
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004215_0011_0000000000000000"/>
Numerous and the Evidences full and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable,
through favour he hath yet been
Cleared and the Verdict Accepted.</p>
            <p>Thus One that should have fled to the pit,
hath been unjustly stopt. This hath been
attempted,</p>
            <p>4. Sometimes by gathering into parties &amp; Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
such Malefactors by strong hand, against those
who were preparing to Call them to an account.</p>
            <p>Jonathan's Case was indeed peculiar, when
his Father told him that <hi>he should surely Die,</hi>
And the people were in no fault when they
Interposed &amp; Delivered him out of his Hands,
For the King had adjured the people rashly,
Neither did Jonathan know of the Curse which
had been pronounc'd. 1 Sam. xiv. 45 <hi>And the people
said unto Saul, Shall Ionathan die, who hath wrought
this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to
the ground, for he hath wrought with God this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But somtimes Numbers have gather'd round
a great deal worse people, Tho' their Crimes
were bloody and to the last Degree Infamous,
Yet they have Interposed &amp; Desended them,
against the Demands of Justice and so they
have Escaped the punishment which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
and such as should have fled to the pit,
have been Unjustly stopt. This hath been
attempted,</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Somtimes by Assisting such Malefactors to make
their Escape from Iustice and that whither before
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004215_0012_0000000000000000"/>
or after their being taken into Custody.</hi> They have
clandestinely Conveyed them away, into other
Governments, into forreign Countrys, where
they have not been Known or their Crimes
heard of, where no more Inquiry would be
made after them, Or, if there were, it was
presum'd that they would not be deliver'd up.
Or they have kept them Concealed so long till
there was no more Inquiry made after them,
Or they have Disguised them to that degree,
that they could not lightly be known, though
they should be met with; They have taken
off their Chains and even broken Open their
Prisons to set them at Liberty; This they
have thought to be a piece of Kindness and
faithfulness to one that was in Extremity.</p>
            <p>But really it was a faulty &amp; Injurious Screen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Offender from Justice, an unworthy
staying of them who should have fled unto the
pit. In these and such like ways people are
too often faulty, And this brings me to the
Second particular.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>I am to Consider,</hi> That this is by no means
fit to be done and people should be strictly Cautioned
against it.</p>
            <p>So we read in the Text, <hi>Let no man stay him.</hi>
No man, Let his Circumstances, relation or
Temptations, be what they will, should lend an
hand to so Evil a thing as this, Nothing will
Vindicate or bear them out in this, Here
we may consider the following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004215_0013_0000000000000000"/>
1. Tho' they may be the Dearest friends or Nearest
relations, Or their Lives may be ever so Necessary
to persons, yet no Indirect or unjust Endeavours
should be used to Screen Malefacters from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which they have Deserved.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a trying Case when some useful
Servant and much more when a Child, or a
Parent, or a Brother, or a Sister, or some dear
Friend hath been less to fall into so odious a
Crime as this; Nature will work; all the springs
of tenderness will be touch'd; They would
give all the world that it were otherwise, that
they knew Nothing, That they were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to speak, That their hands might not be
upon them: But yet Justice the Honour of
God, the safety of Society, should be dearer to
them than the nearest Friend or the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Companion;</p>
            <p>And tho' when they are called to tell their
Story, it may well be suppos'd that their hearts
will ake and throb and their utterance be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
stopt by floods of tears, Yet no part of the
truth should be willingly suppressed. Moses in
the Law puts the Case very high with respect
to the Enticers to Idolatry, which was then by
the Lord made a Capital crime, &amp; it will hold
the same proportion with respect to any other
Capital crime Deut. xiii. 6,—9. <hi>If thy brother,
the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or
the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend which is as thine
own soul, entire thee secretly, saying, Let us go and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004215_0014_0000000000000000"/>
serve other gods—, Thou shalt not consent unto
him, nor hearken unto him, Neither shall thine eye
pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou
conceal him, But thou shalt surely kill him, Thine
hand shall b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st upon him to put him to death and
afterwards the hand of all the people</hi> It may well
be expected that Natural Affection will greatly
work at such a time and Interest will have a
strong Influence, but neither should prevail
against the honour of God, the rules of Justice
and the safety of Society.</p>
            <p>How much to the honour of Levi, is the Zeal
&amp; Impartiality of that tribe, mention'd by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
when Idolatry had been committed &amp; a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
severe testimony was expected to be giv'n
against it, in order to the preservation of the rest
of the people. Deut xxxiii 9. <hi>Who said unto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
&amp; unto his mother, I have not seen him, neither did
he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
for they have observed thy word, &amp; kept
thy covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Tho' they may be great &amp; Considerable persons
who are guilty and they, whose blood they have done
Violence unto, may be but Comparatively mean.</hi>
This should not be so considered as to stop a
prosecution, or stifle a testimony, or favour or
forward an Escape, A Barbarian is of the
meanest Nation, a Servant is of the lowest rank,
an Infant is of the most imperfect age, Yet
even their blood is required by God and the
Laws, when it hath been unjustly shed; Rich
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004215_0015_0000000000000000"/>
and great people are most Honoured, Masters
over Servants and Parents over Children, may
seem to have most power and authority (I say
nothing now of Princes over Subjects, that being
a curious Argument and which may need very
Cautious handling) Yet even these may not be
protected by their greatness, authority or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
if they have done Violence to blood,
If they have defaced the Image of God in which
every man is made and destroyed his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
they also must flee to the pit and
none may stay them.</p>
            <p>3. Tho' such Malefactors may be ready to bribe &amp;
pay well for their being thus Screened from the hand
of Iustice. <hi>The Law of God is positive in that
case. Numb. xxxv.</hi> 31. Moreover ye shall take no
satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty
of death; but he shall surely be put to death. <hi>Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
persons would bribe high and be ready to
give all the Substance of their house, all that
they are worth in the world might they be
permitted to Escape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But such Crimes are not to be purged with
offerings or Money, If Justice takes place, all
the Substance of their houses will be contemned.
<hi>Money</hi> that is said to <hi>answer all things,</hi> must do
nothing here, The ministers of Justice must be
as resolule, as he whom Solomon speaks of,
whose bed had been abused. Prov. vi. 35. <hi>He
will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
though thou givest many gifts.</hi> Were this to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004215_0016_0000000000000000"/>
have any Influence, poor people would be in an
hard plight who have little or nothing to offer
or buy off their punishment, while the rich
might be in Capacity to Escape, But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that blood which hath been spilt can only
be satisfied for by the blood of him that shed
it. Once more,</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Tho' the poor Malefactors may beg and plead
hard and promise ever so good behaviour for the time
to come.</hi> What moving Expressions do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
come out of the mouths of poor people
on such Occasions! With what affecting Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
will they plead! With what Earnestness
will they cry! They faint, They swoon away
under their Dismal apprehensions; The Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are struck with concern; The Judges are
melted into tears, Yet they must not be so
mollified thereby as to neglect Justice; With
tears in their Eyes they must pronounce the
righteous Sentence and commend them to the
mercy of God, who have forfeited all Claim to
be suffered any longer among men; Oh, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
case, when the cry for <hi>Mercy, Mercy</hi> must
no longer be regarded! They must have <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without mercy,</hi> who have <hi>shewed no mercy.</hi>
They must be suffered no longer here in this
Life and it will be well if they can so manage,
as to find mercy in the Next.</p>
            <p>No persons should stay the unhappy Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
from fleing to the pit, none should lend
an helping hand to assist or favor their Escape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004215_0017_0000000000000000"/>
(1) <hi>Because in so doing they bring guilt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
This is the Language of the action;
Such persons do practically and in effect say,
These Malefactors have done well, They are
innocent people &amp; do not deserve to die; Now
they that <hi>Iustify the wicked</hi> &amp; <hi>condemn the Iust,</hi>
are both of them <hi>an Abomination to the Lord;</hi>
By such favour and countenance they do as it
were, put themselves in the place of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
and Kill them who have been unjustly
stain over again; If people were aware of
this, they would surely have a care how they
did thus load themselves with the guilt of blood.
Our own <hi>Iniquities,</hi> certainly are not <hi>too little for
us,</hi> that we should foolishly Venture to be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of Other peoples sins.</hi> Why should any
Contract an heavier load when they are already
so much overborn? For this reason no person
should Countenance &amp; abet, Conceal or shelter
them who have been guilty of such an Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Crime as this.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>Because thereby they Contribute to bring guilt
upon the Land, to ripen it for &amp; lay it open to divine
Iudgments.</hi> As on the one hand the putting to
Death them that are Innocent sadly Exposeth
the places where it is done, So on the other
hand, the suffering them to Escape, who by their
Crimes have fitted themselves for such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
it Defiles and brings guilt and lays a
land open to God's Judgments. Numb. xxxv.
33, 34. <hi>So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004215_0018_0000000000000000"/>
are; for blood it defileth the land; and the land can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by
the blood of him that shed it: Defile not therefore the
land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell; for I the
Lord dwell among the children of Israel.</hi> We all
do, at least we should wish well to the Country
in which we live, that it may be a land of peace,
favoured from above and shined upon by the
light of God's Countenance; Wherefore we
should all be Cautious, that we do nothing of this
nature to draw down God's Displeasure upon it.</p>
            <p>We may Remember how heavy the hand of
God upon Israel was, and that many Years after
the fact was done, for the Innocent blood of
the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> which King <hi>Saul</hi> in a warm fit of
false <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Children of Israel, had shed;
Not was the Lord atoned to the Land, till the
blood of his posterity was shed for it, &amp; no less
than Seven of them hang'd up before the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in a just regard to our Country
we must be far from using any attempts to stay
them who by the just Judgment of God upon
them, for their sins should be fleing to the pit.</p>
            <p>(3) To these things may be added, <hi>That if
such Malefactors may be spared, there is no Security
to be bad, but that they will act the same Vile part
over again, upon other persons, upon the like or even
lesser Temptations.</hi> Their having Escaped once
will Imbolden them to repeat the same Crimes,
with hopes of Impunity too, another time.
Especially if they have past a tryal &amp; by any
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004215_0019_0000000000000000"/>
Artifice or trick they have Come off clear; For
now they may go about among men without
fearing their being again call'd in Question by
men for this fact Indeed if they have Escaped
by flight or Concealment, such Malefactors are
daily Dogg'd or haunted by an Evil Conscience.
They start at their own shadow, Suspect every
thing and are afraid of every one they meet;
They are ready to use <hi>Cain's</hi> Language, as they
are Troubled with the like Horror, Gen iv. 14.
<hi>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face
of the earth &amp; from thy face shall I be hid, &amp; I shall
be a fugitive &amp; a vagabond in the earth, and it shall
come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where such Malefactors Escape in a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
Process, tho' still they may have some
racks &amp; twinges of Conscience in their sober
Intervals, Yet being Enabled thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with their Neighbours without fear, they
will be hardned in sin and be apt to fall into
new offences of the same Kind, especially when
their former actions shall be cast into their
teeth, as somtimes they will. This way, the
sparing of such Criminals will also become a
plague and mischief to mankind.</p>
            <p>III. We may Consider, <hi>That Death is the Iust
punishment of such persons who have been guilty of
doing Violence to the blood of others.</hi> They must
<hi>flee to the pit;</hi> They must be Dispatch'd out of
the world in all convenient hast; There shou'd
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004215_0020_0000000000000000"/>
be no waiting till Death comes in the form of
some Distemper or Accident &amp; doth the work.
We may not say of them as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Saul,</hi>
in 1 Sam. xxvi. 10. <hi>As the Lord liveth, the Lord
shall smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he
shall descend into battle &amp; perish.</hi> No, Violence
they have used and with Violence they must
be Dispatched out of the world, Here we
may Consider two things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Lord our God in his blessed word hath all
along appointed this to be the punishment for this
Crimes.</hi> Immediately after the flood this Law
was given, as was observed before. Gen ix. 6.
<hi>Whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood
be shed.</hi> The <hi>Earth</hi> had been <hi>filled with Violence</hi>
before, So much Wickedness was committed,
so much Cruelty had been acted that it was Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it should be purged by a flood; It was
not sufficient it seems for the Lord to <hi>set marks</hi>
upon people that they might be known, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at and avoided, when they had done this
wickedness, as well as secur'd against the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of blood, as was done upon <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Lamech</hi>
promiseth himself the like protection &amp; secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
when he had Imitated this his Ancestor
in his sin, Gen iv. 23, 24. <hi>I have slain a man to
my wounding and a young man to my hurt, If Cain
shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy &amp;
seven-fold.</hi> Now the Lord makes this Crime Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
if we have reason to think that it had not
been so by any given Law before, Accordingly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004215_0021_0000000000000000"/>
he puts it into his Judicial Law which he
gave to the people of Israel. Exod xxi. 12. <hi>He
that smiteth a man so that he die, shall surely he
put to death.</hi> And it held in use, we see, till
Solomon's time, as appears by the words of the
Text. Nor is this Law abolished under the
New Testament, as we find, 1 Tim. i. 9. <hi>The law
is not made for a righteous man, but for—Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for
man-slayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>In all humane Governments, this hath been agreed
upon &amp; settled, that Death should be the punishment
for this Crime.</hi> They have found it necessary
for the peace and safety of Societies to have
such a Constitution and to put the Law in
Execution, as occasions should offer, that they
who <hi>wittingly</hi> &amp; <hi>wilfully</hi> shed the blood of others,
Except it be in their own Defence, in some
lawful War, or as Improved so to do by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
as Instruments and Executioners of
Justice, Should, when the fact is proved upon
them, be surely put to death.</p>
            <p>Accordingly there is no Well-ordered Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
in the world, where this Law and
practise doth not obtain, Even Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have come into it; It is not peculiar to
our Nation &amp; Country, but this is the Order
and manner throughout the whole World.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to make some <hi>Improvement</hi> of
what hath been spoken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004215_0022_0000000000000000"/>
USE, I. <hi>Should no man stay any person, who hath
done Violence to the blood of another from fleing to
the pit, Learn we hence what a piteous Case such
persons bring themselves into, who venture upon such
acts of Violence.</hi> By this they have forfeited
all respect and put themselves out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the Laws and Justly lose the good-will
of their Neighbours; No man must stand
by them, Countenance or bolster them up in
what they have done; All that may be done
for them now, is to prepare them for Death;
Nothing to save them from it.</p>
            <p>Before this, they might have Expected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
protection, assistance and Countenance
from all that were round about them; But after
such a bloody action committed, Every one in
their places are to rise up against them &amp; bear
their Testimony against the Violence that hath
been done. They are to be look'd upon and
treated as the Enemies of mankind &amp; driven
out of their Society in all convenient Hast;
The Dearest friends they have in the world
must so stop the current of their Affection to
them, as not to Interpose between them and
the fatal stroke; They may sigh and mourn
over them and their Souls may weep in secret
for the piteous plight they have bro't them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into; But they may not say a word or
do an act that shall tend to prevent their flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the pit; None in the world with all
their malice, could have bro't them into so sad
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004215_0023_0000000000000000"/>
and wretched a Condition as they have bro't
themselves. Here let two things be consider'd.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It is not to be wondred at, that they who have
been guilty of this Crime, tho' it may be kept a while
Concealed from mankind, should be perpetually haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their own Consciences and made a Terror to
themselves.</hi> Even <hi>Cain,</hi> who was secured from
being slain, by the particular Care and order of
God, after his bloody fact, went about as a <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
&amp; vagabond</hi> upon the Earth; So do Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
of this kind, carry an heavy Load and
burden about them, tho' no man as yet knows
of the Evil which they have done, it is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Imprinted upon their own minds and they
be not able to shake off the remembrance;
Their Consciences terrify them, They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of their own Shadows, Every little noise
&amp; Disturbance throws them into a fright and
their extraordinary fears have somtimes Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
them against their own wills &amp; meaning.</p>
            <p>Nor need we wonder at this, since all people
are ready to rise up against them wherever
they are Known; Yea &amp; they naturally expect
that the Judgments of God will follow them
and bring them to some Disastrous End at
length, tho' they may Escape for a Time; So
the Barbarous people at <hi>Malta,</hi> when they saw
the Viper fasten upon Paul'<hi>s</hi> Hand, said among
themselves, <hi>No Doubt this man is a Murderer,
whom tho' he hath escaped the Sea, yet Vengeance
suffereth not to live,</hi> Act. xxviii. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004215_0024_0000000000000000"/>
2. <hi>It may well be expected, that persons Convicted
of this Crime, if they have any sense &amp; Consideration
left, when they come coolly to reflect, should be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
vile &amp; Odious in their own Eyes.</hi> When
they see with what abhorrence &amp; general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
mankind riseth up against them; How
Neighbours, friends &amp; Acquaintance, as well as
Strangers conspire together and that without
any prejudice, to bring them to Justice and
none dare say a word for their being spar'd any
longer, This must make them little, mean &amp;
Vile in their own Eyes too, when they think
of it; Now surely whatever Pride, haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Self-conceit they may have Indulg'd in
times past, they must lay it aside for the future
and their <hi>high-looks will be brought down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Time, surely they will put their
mouths in the Dust and cry out, <hi>Vnclean, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;
Unworthy, unworthy!</hi> One would think
almost that after such an Odious fact proved
upon them, the Light would be painful unto
them &amp; the days tedious till they were gotten
Clear out of humane sight and had taken
sanctuary in the grave, Till, their Sin being
pardoned by the great Mercy of God, to which
they fly, the memory of their horrid act may
be bury'd with them in the Dust &amp; by Length
of time come to be more &amp; more forgotten.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Should no man stay any person who hath done
Violence to the blood of another, from fleing to the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004215_0025_0000000000000000"/>
pit, this should be a Caution &amp; Warning to all sorts
of people to keep themselves clear from this Iniquity.</hi>
Let no man take part with Evil-doers or lend
an hand to obstruct publick Justice; Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
people may think perhaps that it is a <hi>good
Office</hi> to relieve &amp; rescue Calamitous persons,
tho' they are <hi>suffering Iustly &amp; receive</hi> no more
than the <hi>Due reward of their deeds.</hi> But they
will find themselves to be quite mistaken in
their Computation; Whosoever are Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to save them who are guilty of Death and
Convey them out of the reach of Justice, In
the Day, when God shall <hi>make Inquisition for
blood,</hi> it will be charged to their Score and they
will have an heavy reckoning of it; They will
then see that they have brought themselves to
a fine pass by their misplaced Kindness;</p>
            <p>Whatever pity, whatever good will any
man may be inclin'd to shew to such kind of
Malefactors, Let it be in other ways than this,
In Instructing, advising &amp; Counselling of them
for the good of their Souls, praying for them,
Encouraging them to fly to and hope in God's
Mercy, And (when they have truly repented
&amp; thrown themselves at God's feet) in chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and bearing them up against the fears of
Death, Here they may worthily busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
This indeed is a good Office; But let
them not Venture to put fond Notions into
their heads, or form plots &amp; projects for them
how they may make their Escape from Justice,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004215_0026_0000000000000000"/>
This would bring dreadful guilt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
Neither would it be any Kindness in the
long run to such Malefactors; Such Over-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
people may justly fear a worse doom upon
them than that which was once pronounced
against <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. XX. 42—<hi>Because thou hast
let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>Should no man stay any person, who hath done
Violence to the blood of another, from fleing to the
pit, however since the Occasion is awful and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
it will behove all persons to behave in a proper
and becoming manner.</hi> Death when it reacheth
any by the hand of God, whither it be brought
on by some <hi>Distemper</hi> or by some <hi>Accident,</hi> is
an affecting thing to the Spectators &amp; it should
serve to make them <hi>grave, serious</hi> &amp; <hi>Composed,</hi>
If it happens to any that are <hi>near us,</hi> whom we
are <hi>acquainted with</hi> or <hi>related to,</hi> we can scarce
look on with Dry Eyes or without throbbing
hearts; They must have divested themselves
very much of humane Nature who are not
greatly moved on such an Occasion:</p>
            <p>But when any are found <hi>Slain</hi> by the <hi>hand of
Violence,</hi> this raiseth <hi>grief, Indignation</hi> &amp; <hi>Horror</hi>
in the minds of those who flock together upon
the occasion and with one Voice they Enquire,
Who hath been so wicked as to do <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>?</p>
            <p>When the matter remain'd uncertain &amp; the
Criminal could not be found out, Expiations
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004215_0027_0000000000000000"/>
were appointed by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessions
were to be made that God would
not <hi>Impute Innocent blood</hi> to them, by the people
of such places as were found nearest to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
slain, as you may see, Deut. xxi. 1—9. In
like manner, it wou'd be proper in our days that
fervent prayers &amp; Supplications of this kind,
should be made upon such an Incident as this.</p>
            <p>When the Murderer is found out, Convicted,
Condemned and Execution is to be done, what
more melancholy sight can there scarce be in
this world? People Crowd to the Tryal with
Eager hast, They attend the Process with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hearts; They gaze upon the poor Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
after Condemnation, observing wistly what
Sense they have of the grievous fault which
they have Committed, If they see them Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
penitent and sinking under the weight of it,
their Compassions work towards them: But
if they are hardened and obstinate and Stupid,
they have little pity to throw away upon such
abandoned Creatures. When the Day of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
comes, then, <hi>Multitudes, Multitudes</hi> flock
together; And Oh! that it might be to learn
Wisdom, that they might <hi>hear &amp; Fear</hi> &amp; none of
them ever Venture any more to do so <hi>wickedly,</hi>
so <hi>Presumptuously.</hi> Deut. xvii. 13. <hi>And all the people
shall hear and fear and do no more presumptuously.</hi>
To the same purpose we read, Deut xiii. 11.</p>
            <p>Such a sad Spectacle is before us this Day;
such an one as we never yet had in this County
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004215_0028_0000000000000000"/>
since it was first Settled; A poor Woman is
to be Dispatched out of this world, for the
Murder of her Spurious Child; The Day hath
been fixed, The Time is now Come and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must be Done. Wherefore I would now
Address my self,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>To the Congregation now gathered together in
greater Numbers on this Occasion.</hi> You have this
Day a moving sight before your Eyes, of One
<hi>fleing to the pit</hi> and <hi>none may stay her,</hi> Because she
hath been <hi>wicked Overmuch,</hi> she is now to <hi>die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Time,</hi> Eccl vii. 17. And here I shall
offer these following particulars.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Let us now think with Our selves what reason
we all have to bless God, that we have not been left
to fall into the like Crimes.</hi> Our Hearts also are
bad Enough, and what is there so Vile that we
are not capable of Committing, if God should
leave us to our selves; Let none of us bless our
selves too much, and say, It was Impossible for
us to have done as she hath done; If any of us
should find such thoughts as these rising in us
and we should pretend to very much Innocency
&amp; Integrity of heart, we may Imagine the Lord
speaking to us, as once he did to <hi>Abimelech</hi> in
another case. Gen. xx. 6—<hi>I know that thou didst
this in the integrity of thy heart, for I also witheld
thee from sinning against me.</hi> If God should take
off his restraining grace and think it proper to
let us see <hi>what is in our Hearts,</hi> we should soon do
as bad or worse than she hath done; We had
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004215_0029_0000000000000000"/>
need to pray that God would keep a Check, a
Bridle still upon us; Instead of triumphing over
poor Offenders, who have indeed done very
Criminal things, Let us bless God that we are
not in their places. For we have that within
us which would have prompted us to the like
had not God graciously restrained us.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>Let every one now he Humbled before God,
for all approaches they have at any time made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this Crime.</hi> It may be you have not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done Violence to the blood of any person in
the world, But let persons take a view of their
<hi>thoughts</hi> and their <hi>wishes:</hi> These may have been
<hi>bloody Enough.</hi> When persons Displeased you,
when they have seemed to stand in your way
When by Living still they have kept you longer
out of those Possessions which you Earnestly
Crav'd after, when to your thinking, they only
did mischief while they lived, have You not too
often stood <hi>wishing &amp; waiting</hi> for their Death,
grudging iem their Health, their Friends &amp; other
advantages which God was pleas'd to bless them
with and continue to them for a considerable
time, And this notwithstanding they were Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
persons, nearly related, had formerly
been kind and in short had Deserved no such
Usage at Your hands; The Psalmist tells us of
such people in his day, who said, Psal. xli. 5.—
<hi>When shall he die &amp; his name perish?</hi> Some persons,
as if <hi>they</hi> had been the Sovereign Arbiters of
Life &amp; Death, have taken it upon them in their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004215_0030_0000000000000000"/>
minds to dispose of Others and have thought
the time long that they were suffered to Live;
Could men have look'd into their hearts as God
Can &amp; Doth, they might have seen wild work
there a doing, These &amp; those Stript &amp; reduced,
mortified &amp; Disabled &amp; several dispatch'd out
of the way, upon no desert or provocation; Let
Every one now be humbled before God, for this
mischievous kind of wishing, this unruly work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their tho'ts, as far as they can find they
have been guilty; Tho' Only God &amp; our own
Consciences have been privy thereto and those
who are about us suspect no such thing by us,
Yet it is Enough for our Conviction that God
knoweth our hearts and this is a trespass against
the Sixth Commandment. Surely we ought to
with well to Every one that is about us and if
any of them behave themselves ill or are indeed
worthy to die, we should leave them to God,
who will take his time to deal with them &amp; call
them to an account; For he hath said, <hi>Vengeance
is his and he will repay it.</hi> Wherefore let none
harbour the least ill-will against any in their
hearts, Nay let them take heed that they do
not by any unworthy Carriage, grieve the hearts
of any whom it is their <hi>Duty</hi> to love, honour
and please, lest <hi>they bring down their heads with
Sorrow to the grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) <hi>Let Every one be Warned by this Example
to take heed to themselves and beware of Every thing
that may tend to pave the way to this Crime.</hi> Let
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004215_0031_0000000000000000"/>
all be Warned against a <hi>Loose and Disorderly way
of Living,</hi> lest God be provoked to give them up
to their Own hearts Lusts &amp; they fall into Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Offences; And, Oh! that Parents and
Masters would be Intreated to look well to the
Education of Children &amp; Servants, <hi>to train them
up in the way wherein they should go,</hi> For altho'
sometimes it happens that they who have had a
<hi>good Education</hi> &amp; been kept under a <hi>strict Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
do <hi>yet break loose</hi> and fall into Scandalous &amp;
Even Capital Crimes, through their not taking
heed to the Instructions that have been given
them, Yet little better can be Expected, if Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
are altogether Negligent, If they wink
at their Crimes and much more if they Enco<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Improve them to do wicked Actions,
This is to bring them up to Ruin; Sinners
begin with Lesser Crimes and then they grow
worse &amp; worse, When once they are set Out in
an ill-way, they know not to what Lengths they
may go, It is like the passage down some steep
Hill, It will be difficult stopping till they come
to the bottom;</p>
            <p>Beware of <hi>Disobedience</hi> to <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>religions
Masters,</hi> Of <hi>Sabbath-breaking, Mispence of precious
Time</hi> and such like Evils, which they that come
to Untimely Ends are wont to Warn the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers
against &amp; tell them aloud that these were
the things which have brought them to this.</p>
            <p>But I would Especially Warn Persons against
the <hi>Lusts of Vncleanness,</hi> those <hi>Sins against our own
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004215_0032_0000000000000000"/>
bodies</hi> and which are said peculiarly to <hi>defile the
Temples of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Since they who have
Committed folly of this Kind, are so often
(besides this sad Instance before us) tempted,
in Order to <hi>hide</hi> their <hi>Sin and Shame</hi> from the
world, to add Murder to their former Offence.</p>
            <p>Diverse have been found Out and brought
to Condign Punishment for it both in this
Land and Elsewhere, and what great Numbers
have Escaped Discovery in this Life and are
reserved to the final Judgment of God, he
only Knows; Oh! Let Every one from this
Time, learn, according to the Apostle'<hi>s</hi> advice,
to <hi>possess their Vessels in Sanctification &amp; Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4) <hi>Let Every one be moved to pity &amp; pray for
this poor Criminal, that God would be pleased to
grant her repentance and remission of Sins.</hi> That
altho' Justice will not suffer her longer to live,
Yet that she may find Mercy in God's sight
and through the grace of Jesus Christ be made
<hi>meet for the Inheritance among the Saints in Light,</hi>
That her Repentance may be sincere and
thorow and her <hi>heart right in the sight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be no Difficulty to his grace to change
and make a New Creature of her, Nor any
Dishonour to his Name, to pardon her when
she is truly penitent, So that there is no Bar
<hi>lying in the way</hi> to discourage such our Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on her account. She is presently going to
her Execution, Let me bespeak <hi>your good wishes
&amp; prayers for her,</hi> fervent &amp; Devout as her Case
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004215_0033_0000000000000000"/>
requires; Were any of us in the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
what, we should desire of <hi>our Christian
Friends, do ye even the same</hi> unto her.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Come, not only to feed <hi>your Eyes</hi>
with a Strange &amp; unusual Spectacle or gratifie
<hi>your Curiosity,</hi> but to be assisting as You may,
to a person Just upon the Borders of Eternity
with Your good wishes and prayers;</p>
            <p>Let none be so Barbarous as to Insult her in
this <hi>Day of her Calamity,</hi> But let Every ones
Compassions be moved and as far as you have
Interest in Heaven, Improve it Earnestly on
her account, to draw down a Blessing upon her
if possible, in her last Moments; Her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<hi>Cryes to you</hi> for this, Her Melancholy
Appearance and beseeching Air may even Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
it from You and tho' <hi>she cannot Recompence
you,</hi> Yet if it be performed with a <hi>truly Christian
spirit,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> will <hi>remember</hi> and <hi>Reward</hi> this
Your <hi>Labour of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>I shall Address my self more particularly to the
poor Malefactor that is now to Suffer.</hi> We cannot
help being Concerned for You as our <hi>Fellow-Creature</hi>
&amp; the more since You are become our
<hi>Fellow-Christian,</hi> Having with <hi>Humble Confession
of your Sin</hi> &amp; <hi>Serious Profession of your Faith,</hi> given
up your self in <hi>Solemn Covenant</hi> to be <hi>the Lord's</hi>
and at your Earnest Request have been <hi>Baptized
in the Name of the Lord Iesus;</hi> as also Admitted
to <hi>Sit down</hi> with us at the <hi>Table of the Lord.</hi>

This, tho' it may Contribute, through the
Mercy of God to the Salvation of your Soul, if
on Your part, it were done with Judgment and
Sincerity, Yet it must not by any means free
you from the Execution of the Sentence that
hath Justly been passed upon You; We may
say in your Case, as the Apostle doth in another
that is not altogether unlike. Rom. viii. 10. <hi>And
if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin,
but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</hi> Had
you been left to have been Stupid &amp; Obstinate
and Insensible under this Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
tho' your Case would have been <hi>far
more Pityable,</hi> Yet in all probability you would
have met with a great deal <hi>less Compassion.</hi> But
now you have made a Profession of Religion,
this Conciliates the Esteem and draws the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the people of God towards You, as
far as they have ground to hope &amp; believe that
you are Upright therein; Wherefore as to one
that hath Own'd &amp; Confessed our <hi>Common Lord
and Master, Iesus Christ.</hi> I would now give
these few words of parting Advice.</p>
            <p>[1] <hi>Be sure you harbour no Grudge or Animosity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any person what ever.</hi> If Ever <hi>you took any
thing hard</hi> that you have met with <hi>in the Course
of your Tryal, Condemnation</hi> &amp; <hi>Confinement,</hi> Yet now
let your heart be made quite clean from all
manner of <hi>Malignant Passions,</hi> as what will not

any persons really wronged you in being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
to bring on this Day of Suffering
upon you, Yet it would be your Interest to let
your resentment die, before you passed into the
Other world, According to the bright Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Your &amp; Our blessed Lord and Master,

Luk. xxiii. 34. <hi>Then said Iesus, Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do.</hi> But when
they, who in their several places, have appear'd
against you, have kept a good Conscience and
only have born witness to the Truth; when
they must have brought guilt upon themselves,
if they had not testified and acted as they did,
When it was with pain and Anguish of heart
that they performed this grievous part; Not
the least resentment must remain in your mind,
as Ever you would hope that the Repentance
you have professed, should be Accepted in the
sight of God; Wherefore, wish them all well,
as you do the <hi>best Friends</hi> that you have in the
world, Pray that all manner of Blessings,
Temporal &amp; Spiritual may remain upon them
and their Posterity for Ever; Thus, Die, I do
not say, forgiving (for what of this sort have
<hi>you</hi> to forgive) but bearing an Universal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will

that you have not neglected this Necessary and

Evil of Sin, the beauty of Holiness and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Jesus Christ, If he hath blessed the
Instructions which have been given you, heard
the Praerys that have been put up for you and
brought you heartily to Close with the Offers

Better far, than to have been Left in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of Liberty, to have gone on in your
courses of Sin and Vanity &amp; to have <hi>filled up the
measure of your Iniquity</hi> &amp; Dyed in your Sins:</p>
            <p>Give him the glory of all <hi>the good</hi> you have
reason to hope hath been done <hi>for you</hi> and <hi>Warn</hi>
the Survivers that they do not <hi>Venture to offend</hi>
after your Example and <hi>Sin against the Lord;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when presently <hi>you must pass along the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
way</hi> and arrive at the <hi>Fatal Tree,</hi> may the
Lord please powerfully to Support you against
the Fear and under the Shame of this Death;
That as a poor unhappy Sinner <hi>you may patiently
Submit to the Iustice of this Sentence,</hi> to take <hi>away
by your Death</hi> the guilt of Blood from the Land;
Yet as a Believer, you may <hi>look beyond the grave
to an happy Immortality,</hi> hoping in <hi>His Mercy,</hi>
who can <hi>abundantly Pardon</hi> and Committing
<hi>your Departing Soul</hi> into his <hi>Fatherly hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall Conclude with the Instance of a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
mention'd in the Gospel, suffering for
his Faults and that <hi>indeed Iustly,</hi> who in that
hour had <hi>repentance unto Life,</hi> graciously <hi>given</hi>
unto <hi>him;</hi> He turns his Dying Eyes to our
blessed Saviour, as he hung by his side &amp; saith,
<hi>Lord, Remember me when thou Comest into thy
Kingdom.</hi> So do you say, <hi>Lord, Remember me
now thou art in thy Kingdom.</hi> And, Oh! May
he please mercifully to say to You, as then unto
him; <hi>This Day thou shalt be with Me in Paradise.</hi>

               <head>IT may Possibly be Acceptable to the Publick, if some
brief Account were given of the person, on the
Occasion of whose Execution the foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was Delivered.</head>
               <p>SHE was of the <hi>Pequot</hi> Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> &amp; Descended
from one of the best Families among them; In
her Childhood she was put into the Family of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Mr. WILLIAM WORTHINGTON, where
she was taught to read well and to write &amp; Instructed
in the principles of religion; During her Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
she often Lamented her neglecting to Improve
the Advantages she Enjoyed, always speaking honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
of her Master, who was frequent in giving
her good Instruction and Advice.</p>
               <p>Having Unhappily fallen into the Sin of Fornication
&amp; being with Child, it pass'd for a while without Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
by any in the family, at length being Question'd
about it she deny'd it &amp; turn'd it off, assigning <hi>other causes</hi>
for the appearances that were observ'd, so that the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
about her were thereby <hi>very much</hi> laid asleep:</p>
               <p>When her hour was Come, she was Delivered alone
by her self in the Barn; upon search the Infant was
found, with marks upon it of Violence, that had been
used, of which wounds it soon Dyed.</p>
               <p>Upon this she was Committed to the County Goal,
where she lay Confined for a considerable time, &amp; the
longer because the Witnesses who were to give Evidence
in the case, were, by reason of Infirmity (one of them)
not able to travel so far from home to the place where
the Court was to be held, to bear their Testimony.</p>
               <p>During this space, I have little to observe Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her; Only, that when the Court for her Tryal was
appointed to be held at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> she seemed to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a full Expectation that she should be Cleared.</p>
               <p>But when upon her tryal, the proofs of her Guilt,
appeared so plain and full to the Jury and the Court,
that she was brought in Guilty and Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004215_0041_0000000000000000"/>
was pronounced against her, she was thrown
into the utmost Confusion &amp; Distress, Her Expressions
were rash and unguarded and she scarce forebore
throwing blame on all sorts of persons; With this
Disposition of mind (tho' somewhat moderated) she
was remanded back to her prison.</p>
               <p>From this time pains were Continually taken with
her, not only to allay this resentment, but to make
her Sensible of the Heinousness of her Sin, of her Lost
and undone Condition by Nature and her need of an
Interest in Jesus Christ, setting forth at the same time
the greatness of Gods mercy and that there is forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with him that he may be feared, which pains
(together with Gods Blessing, upon her reading the
holy Scriptures and other good Books that were put
into her hands and her attendance on the Ministry of
the Word, on Sabbath and Lecture days, as well as at
private Meetings from house to house in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to all of which she was allowed to come) it is to
be hoped were sanctifyed to give her quite another
sight and sense of things than she had before: One of
her Expressions were, <hi>That she seemed to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
in the former part of her Life and that things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to her quite other wise than they used to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Authority were so favourable to her, as to allow
her Large Opportunity (almost six Months from her
Condemnation to her Execution) which Time she was
diligent to Improve in making preparation for her Death;</p>
               <p>Having Never been <hi>Baptized,</hi> she was Earnestly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of that, wherefore pains were taken to Acquaint
her with the main principles of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and the Nature of the Covenant of Grace. The
understanding of which her former good Education,
made more Easie to her. And after some time, upon
her <hi>making an Open Acknowledgement of her great and
Crying Sins,</hi> taking shame to her self &amp; manifesting her
Sorrow on that account; <hi>Professing the Christian Faith &amp;
Consenting to the Covenant of grace,</hi> she was <hi>Baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:004215_0042_0000000000000000"/>
Soon after, She was Extreamly Desirous to partake
with us at the <hi>Lord's Table before she Suffer'd,</hi> And upon
its appearing that she understood the Nature &amp; Design
of that Ordinance, at her request she was allowed and
had the opportunity to Communicate with us <hi>twice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In her attendance upon the ministry of the Word her
Behaviour was Decent &amp; she ever appeared as one <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
Affected,</hi> Especially when her Case was more
particularly touch'd upon whither in <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Sermons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I visited her in her prison, she seldom could
part with me, without Desiring that I would Pray
with her before I went, which favour she Desired of
others also, who Visited her during her Confinement.</p>
               <p>Many of her Expressions from time to time were
Valuable and worth the Preserving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Among other things she said,</hi> That it was a Mercy she
was found out, otherwise she might have gone on in her
Course of sinning &amp; been Eternally Lost. That sin seem'd
now like poison to her &amp; those sins in which she was wont
to delight, were now Loathsom: That she had found more
pleasure in her prison, than Ever she did in the Days of
her Vanity. That she was heartily sorry for her sin not so
much for the shame &amp; punishment that it had bro't her to,
as because thereby she had offended and dishonoured God.
She could submit to the shame of her Death, It would be
soon Over &amp; then she should not know what people talked
of her. Some <hi>(she said)</hi> had reported of her things
that were false, but she heartily forgave them; She
Entertained no grudge or malice against any person on
any account, for that alone, she knew, would ruin her,
if she did. The Devil was very busie, she said, to hinder
h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r from Praying &amp; Reading, but she did it the more, to
spite him <hi>(that was her word)</hi> and the Temptation
Vanished &amp; she found Comfort. <hi>She often Expressed her</hi>
Concern <hi>lest she should</hi> build upon a sandy foundation.
<hi>Being asked from time to time, how Death seemed to
her, the nearer it Approached. She answered,</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
More Terrible, sometimes Less Terrible. <hi>And
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004215_0043_0000000000000000"/>
being asked at what times she Observed it to be less
Terrible, she replyed,</hi> That after she had been Earnestly
seeking to God, the fear of Death very much Abated. <hi>She
said,</hi> that her dependance was upon the Righteousness of
Christ for her acceptance with God and look'd up on him as
a surety who had paid their debts for believers.</p>
               <p>But I forbear gathering up any more of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
That I be not too tedious.</p>
               <p>The Day before her Execution she was Exceedingly
Overwhelmed and cast Down, It seemed to be the
most <hi>trying time</hi> to her, during her whole Confinement,
whither it were Occasioned by the want of her taking
her usual rest or food or whether the near approach of
Death were Left to be an Uncommon Terror to her.</p>
               <p>Every one's Compassions were moved for her, and
she was Visited more frequently &amp; by greater Numbers
of persons and Prayers more fervently made on her
account. Towards the Evening <hi>her Master</hi> came from
<hi>Saybrook</hi> to take his last farewell of her, with whose
presence, the Instructions and Consolations that were
given &amp; the Prayers that were made for her, she som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
revived and was Overheard in her Prayers (after
the people were, many of them, gone) to <hi>bless God
who had sent his Servants that Day to Pray for, to Instruct
and Comfort her a poor Dying Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the Day of her Execution, she was more
strengthened and enabled to attend at the Sermon that
was preach'd on that Melancholy Occasion, altho' with
some faintings; Upon her retiring to the Prison, when
it was Over, she made apt and pertinent remarks, upon
the sight of her Cossin, the taking off of her fetters, the
putting the rope about her Neck &amp; other such Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.
Then she took her Leave of her friends thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them for the good Offices which they had done
her (as she Ever Expressed a grateful Spirit to every
one, that at any time, had shewn her any Kindness)
She passed on foot in the sad procession, for about a Mile,
to the place of Execution &amp; still <hi>went On praying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:004215_0044_0000000000000000"/>
Excepting when the <hi>Rev'd Ministers in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood</hi>
(gathered together on the Occasion &amp; who
gave her their Company) Endeavoured to fill up the
time, by ministring to her Counsels, Comforts &amp; En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
to whom she made satisfactory replyes.</p>
               <p>When she was arrived at the place of Execution,
(which was surrounded with a Vast Circle of people,
more Numerous, perhaps, than Ever was gathered
together before, On any Occasion, in this Colony,) she
first Commended her self to God's mercy. In a more
set and very fervent Prayer. Tho' sometimes the
Expressions were more broken and Incoherent</p>
               <p>Next Her Master, Full of Concern and Affection
for her, Spread her Case before God; Her Warning
left in writing was publickly read to which she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
many Other Warnings and Counsels by word of
mouth, Lifting up her Voice as she could that she
might be the farther heard; We took our Leave of
her and she of us in an Affecting Manner;</p>
               <p>The few moments she had to live after this, she spent in
warm &amp; Devout Addresses to her Heavenly Father, till
her breath was stopt; And with her hands lifted up, as
she cou'd, she past out of life, <hi>in the posture of one praying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She was of a proper Stature &amp; goodly Countenance
and seemed to be Naturally of an Ingenious Disposition;</p>
               <p>By her good Behaviour all Along she generally
gain'd the Esteem and good will of those that Came
about her and it is <hi>Charitably hoped,</hi> that she might
find Mercy in the sight of the Lord.</p>
               <p>May this Example be of use to all Persons in <hi>our times</hi>
to keep them from Sinning against God, that every one
may <hi>hear</hi> &amp; <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>do no more Presumptuously</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Particularly, may all her <hi>Country people,</hi> in their several
Tribes, whither round about us or farther off, hearken
diligently to the Offers &amp; Proposals of the Gospel that
are made to them! Let there be Nothing to Obstruct
&amp; Discourage so good a work, May the Time to favour
them now Come, the set time let it Come! <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>THE
Confession &amp; Dying Warning of Katherine Garret.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I Katherine Garret,</hi> being Condemned to Die
for the Crying Sin of Murder, Do Own the
Iustice of GOD in suffering me to die this Violent
Death; and also Acknowledge the Iustice of the
Court who has Sentenced me to die this Death; and
I thank them who have Lengthned the Time to me,
whereby I have had great Opportunity to prepare for
my Death: I thank those also who have taken pains
with me for my Soul; so that since I have been in
Prison, I have had opportunity to seek after Baptism
&amp; the Supper of the Lord &amp; have obtained both. I
Confess my self to have been a great Sinner; a sinner
by Nature, also guilty of many Actual Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
Particularly of Pride and Lying, as well as
of the Sin of destroying the Fruit of my own Body,
for which latter, I am now to Die. I thank God that
I was learn'd to Read in my Childhood, which has
been much my Exercise since I have been in Prison,
and especially since my Condemnation. The Bible
has been a precious Book to me. There I read, <hi>That
JESUS CHRIST came into the world to Save
Sinners,</hi> Even the <hi>Chief of Sinners:</hi> And that
<hi>all manner of Sins shall be forgiven, One only
Excepted; For His Blood Cleanseth from all
Sin.</hi> And other good Books I have been favoured
with, by peoples giving and lending them to me,
which has been blessed to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:004215_0046_0000000000000000"/>
I would Warn all Young People against Sinning
against their own Consciences; For there is a GOD
that Knows all things. Oh! Beware of all Sin,
Especially of Fornication; for that has led me to
Murder. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it
Holy. Be Sober and wise. Redeem your Time,
and Improve it well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Little Children I would Warn you to take heed of
Sinning against God. Be Dutiful to your Parents;
For</hi> the Eye that Mocks at his Father and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseth
to Obey his Mother, the Ravens of the
Valley shall pick it out, and the Young Eagles
shall eat it. <hi>Little Children, Learn to Pray to
God, Sit still on the Lord's Day, and Love your
Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would also Warn Servants, Either <hi>Whites</hi> or
<hi>Blacks,</hi> to be Obedient to your Masters &amp; Mistresses.
Be Faithful in your places and diligent: Above all
Fear God; fear to Sin against Him: He is our
Great Master.</p>
            <p>I would also Intreat Parents and Masters to set a
good Example before their Children and Servants,
for You also must give an Account to God how you
carry it to them.</p>
            <p>I desire the Prayers of all God's People for me,
Private Christians, as well as Ministers of the Gospel,
that I may while I have Life Improve it aright;
May have all my Sins Pardoned and may be
Accepted through <hi>CHRIST JESUS.</hi> Amen.</p>
