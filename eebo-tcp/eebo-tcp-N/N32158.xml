            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is a remark of a very conſiderable writer of our own, "<hi>that it cannot be improper to canvaſs any conſtitutional queſtion when decency is obſerved and nothing advanced but on the credit of the beſt authorities,</hi> becauſe in a <hi>Britiſh</hi> country every man ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the laws by which his liberty and property are inſured."

I will however ſtill leave this right as I found it (I always wiſhed it ſhould remain unagitated) undetermined and undecided; but I hope I am not too ſanguine to flatter myſelf that thoſe that read what may make againſt it will be convinced they that hold the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative may ſtill be honeſt men, and good and loyal ſubjects, whether in a private character, or as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of a free and loyal people. I deſign to mention ſome arguments which perſuade me this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is not clearly eſtabliſhed, and I ſhall take ſo much notice of the arguments brought in ſupport of it to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether they really prove what is intended.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper firſt to lay down a few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principles which are univerſally allowed. It is agreed on all ſides that the exiſtence of a Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is now as neceſſary and eſſential to our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the exiſtence of a King and Houſe of Lords. It is agreed that the Commons being the Repreſentatives of the people the people ought to chuſe them, the King and Lords muſt not interfere in the choice, and any one duly choſen, and not by law incapacitated, the election ca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, but to reign without Parliament is contrary to the Conſtitution; to diſſolve wantonly, and without cauſe, is not againſt the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but it ſeems an improper uſe of a very legal power. The deſign of a Houſe of Commons is to be a check on the Prerogative, and to watch over the rights of the people. Prerogative is placed in the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:042393_0003_101BD8900082D818"/>
Crown that the people may not encroach on the rights of the Crown. By the wiſdom of the Conſtitution every branch of the Legiſlature forms a mutual check upon the other, the people are a check upon the Nobility, and the Nobility upon the people, while the King is a check upon both, and his executive power is again checked and kept within due bounds by the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, through the privilege they have of enquiring into, impeaching, and puniſhing the conduct of the King's evil Counſellors. The Houſe of Commons is to conſult for the good of the nation, and all monies given to the King are given only by the Commons; whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for this purpoſe is their undeniable privilege, for, unleſs they may freely conſult, and do that for which they are called together and conſtituted a Houſe, the very purpoſes of their meeting muſt be defeated. I ſuppoſe therefore it will not be denied, as the Crown calls the Commons together for national purpoſes, the Commons ſo met muſt have a right or privilege to every thing that appears neceſſary to anſwer the purpoſes for which they are called and met together. This I take the true idea of the privileges of the Houſe, and as the Houſe cannot ſubſiſt nor act properly without them, to deny or curtail theſe privileges is attempting the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition of the Houſe itſelf, and of courſe deſtroying the Conſtitution. The faireſt way therefore to judge of any claim of either branch of the Legiſlature is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the effect it may have on the other branches, and whatever claſheth with any known right or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of either King or any of the two Houſes cannot be conſtitutional, whatever would prevent the Crown in the execution of thoſe laws made by the Legiſlative cannot be ſupported, and if the Crown has any power that may reſtrain freedom of debate, or abridge the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of giving and granting in the Houſe of Commons, or impede them in buſineſs, otherwiſe than by adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prorogation, or diſſolution, I cannot ſee how the Houſe may be conceived free and independent in their deliberations.</p>
            <p>I believe few men will deny any of theſe principles; let them be kept in conſtant view when we enquire into the queſtion whether the Crown has a right to reject a Speaker duly choſen and preſented for approbation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:042393_0004_101BD8919898EFA0"/>
               <hi>The Houſe of Commons muſt have a Speaker.</hi> All Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies met for conſultation have found it neceſſary to place one over themſelves to keep up order and regulate their debates; if 500 men were all to ſpeak at once, and none have authority to call them to order, the voice of wiſdom muſt be loſt in noiſe, and prudent counſel ſwallowed up in confuſion. Formerly both Houſes are ſaid to have had but one Speaker between them, but as both Houſes became more diſtinct, and the Commons more important, they of courſe had a Speaker of their own, who is ſo neceſſary that ordinarily they do no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs without him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Speaker they muſt either chuſe themſelves, or he muſt be placed over them by the Crown.</hi> "The Speaker of the Houſe of Lords is the Lord Chancellor or Keeper of the Great Seal, or <hi>any other APPOINTED BY THE KING's COMMISSION</hi>; and if none be ſo appointed, the Houſe of Lords (it is ſaid) may elect;" <hi>Blackſtone, vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 181. The Speaker of the Houſe of Commons is choſen by the Houſe, but muſt be approved of by the King, <hi>ibid.</hi> "It is true the Commons are to chuſe their Speaker," <hi>Coke.</hi> How far the King's approbation is neceſſary is the queſtion in diſpute, but all agree that the Commons muſt chuſe their Speaker, and it ſeems the choice is of more importance than preſentation or approbation, becauſe without choice there can be no ſuch thing as either.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Speaker choſen ought to be a perſon properly qualified.</hi> If every Member of Parliament ought to be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and uninfluenced by any views of honour or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt but the publick good, the Speaker ought to be ſo much more. He ought to be equally well acquainted with the privileges of the Houſe and the rights of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and of ſufficient fortitude to act conſiſtent with both on every occaſion, neither courting popularity by diſputing the juſt rights of the Crown, nor have an eye to gain or promotion by betraying any right of the ſubject. <hi>The election of any Member to be Speaker is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn declaration of the Houſe that they judge him the man beſt qualified for that buſineſs.</hi> I believe it ſeldom, if ever, happened, that a Member was choſen Speaker the firſt time of his ſerving as a Member. A perſon is uſually pitched upon who, from long experience, is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042393_0005_101BD8975D0E00E8"/>
with the privileges and proceedings of the Houſe, and of whoſe abilities alſo the Houſe have had long and ſufficient experience. The Speaker has been called a ſervant of the Houſe, and as the King has an undoubted right to chuſe, and muſt be the beſt judge of his own ſervants, ſo the Commons are beſt acquainted with the character of every Member of their Houſe, and thereby beſt able to judge who is the fitteſt for any particular buſineſs that may be aſſigned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Speaker ſits in the Houſe, not in the name or as a Commiſſioner of the King, but</hi> (though his ſeat is a little raiſed) <hi>as a Member upon a par with the reſt,</hi> choſen and appointed by themſelves; not to do any buſineſs for the King, but their buſineſs, to be their mouth, regulate their debates, and execute their orders; neither is he to have "<hi>eyes to ſee, or ears to hear, but as directed by the Houſe.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not denied by any that the Commons muſt chuſe, nor that their choice ought to be free,</hi> and it has been allowed that they are not obliged to chuſe a perſon nominated or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Crown, ſuppoſing the Crown ſhould think proper to recommend or make ſuch a nomination, but as it has always been cuſtomary to preſent the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker ſo choſen to the King for approbation, it is hence concluded that the King may ſet aſide the choice of his Commons, and reject a Speaker ſo preſented. If the want of ſuch a right of rejection had any apparent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to render ſome other abſolute rights of the King more precarious, or to endanger his Crown or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the King ought undoubtedly to have it, for he ought to have his right, and every thing that may legally ſecure it; if the exerciſe of that right, though not neceſſary to the King, might add to his greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and in no caſe whatever bring any danger to the ſubject, I would in mere decency make a compliment of it to the King; but if it ſhould appear that the claim and exerciſe of that right had even a diſtant tendency to hurt the ſubject, and wound the Conſtitution, I would then wiſh that the King had and inſiſted to have all the juſt rights of his Royal Prerogative, and no more.</p>
            <p>That I may treat the queſtion in the moſt inoffenſive manner, I declare that I mean not to write againſt the right claimed by the Crown; I only propoſe ſome doubts
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:042393_0006_101BD898E13D0498"/>
which I ſhall be glad to ſee cleared up, and with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will I join all my fellow loyal ſubjects to acquieſce in any claim that may appear the conſtitutional right of the Crown.</p>
            <p>AS it is agreed on all hands the Commons muſt chuſe their Speaker, in the very nature of things it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that he whom they choſe ought to be conſidered as Speaker. Whom are they to chuſe? A Speaker. By whoſe authority are they to chuſe him? By the King's command, and as the Repreſentatives of the people; if, after having thus received the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſitting as the Repreſentatives of the people, they have choſen a man to be Speaker, the perſon ſo choſen is not what they choſe him, it will be equally difficult to aſſert what it ſeems juſt as difficult to deny, that they made a choice, or that they had not authority to make the choice they actually have made.</p>
            <p>It has been allowed "that the Commons may freely chuſe whom they pleaſe for their Speaker, but aſſerted, "that the Crown, for its own preſervation, has a right to reject an improper perſon, (<hi>Georgia Gazette, June</hi> 10.) By an improper perſon here muſt be underſtood one whom the Commons thought proper, but who is thought improper by the Crown. Now let any one aſk himſelf whether he ſhould think he enjoyed the right of freely chuſing whomſoever he pleaſed for his own ſervant if another had the right to put a negative on the ſervant he had actually choſen, under pretence of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the ſervice of him by whom choſen, and thereby deprive him of his ſervice at pleaſure. To talk of a free choice, which yet may be controuled and annulled by another, ſeems inconſiſtent with the very nature of choice, and at moſt it can only be called a freedom to chuſe upon condition that another do not invalidate the choice; if the perſon choſen be equally acceptable to him that chuſes and to him that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, it matters very little by whom ſuch a choice is made; but if acceptable and neceſſary only to thoſe by whom the choice was made, I cannot ſee what their choice avails if it may be ſet aſide at pleaſure by another, perhaps too it might be ſet aſide for that very reaſon becauſe the perſon choſen is ſuſpected of being more in the intereſt of thoſe by whom he is choſen than may be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:042393_0007_101BD89BD24F9F40"/>
conſiſtent with the deſigns of him by whom he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>Theſe that chuſe a Speaker to do the buſineſs of the Houſe have firſt been choſen themſelves to do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nation; they are not met by their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor to do their own buſineſs, nor the King's buſineſs, but the buſineſs of the nation; they cannot debate the concerns of the nation without a Speaker to direct and regulate their debates; but it is of infinite concern to the nation that no man miſlead, reſtrain, or impede their debates; a Speaker might do all this, and were he to do it to ſerve the Crown, it would be in vain to look to the Crown for relief, he would be a dead weight to them, and they unable to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; it ſeems therefore that the choice of a Speaker by the Repreſentatives ſhould be as free and final as the choice of the people of the Repreſentatives who are to chuſe the Speaker.</p>
            <p>The ſitting of the Commons, though called by the King's writ; the privileges of the Houſe, though prayed for of the King; the freedom of debate; are all matter of right, and not of favour; the very deſign of the Houſe of Commons is to prevent too extenſive or an undue influence of the Crown; if any proceedings of the Houſe become matters of favour of the Crown, what becomes of the intrinſick right and authority of the Commons? A Speaker was excepted againſt, becauſe, "if the King always ſhould accept a perſon pitched upon by the Houſe, then it would be no great favour to be choſen a Speaker." Here the exception againſt a Speaker was however ſweetened with a reaſon being given; but if the Speaker holds his place, not by the choice of the Repreſentatives, but by the favour of the Crown, it is then evident that the principal man in the Houſe of Commons holds his place under the favour and influence of that very power to prevent whoſe too powerful influence, and reſtrain it within its proper bounds, is, or ought to be, the principal object of the Repreſentatives of a free people.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The whole of the law and cuſtom of Parliament has its original from this one maxim, that whatever matter ariſes concerning either Houſe of Parliament ought to be examined, diſcuſſed, and adjudged, in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:042393_0008_101BD89ED5D4D248"/>
that Houſe to which it relates, and not elſewhere,</q>
               <hi>Blackſtone Com.</hi> 1.163. In conſequence of this the Commons may judge void the elections of Members al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſitting, and declare thoſe duly elected, who have not been returned ſo by the proper Officer; and it would ſeem ſtrange if they, who have a right to judge of every election in the kingdom, ſhould not have a right to chuſe their own Speaker, if they were judges who is properly elected a Repreſentative of the whole nation, and yet liable to have a negative put on a choice made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own ſervant. The Houſe of Commons have an undoubted right by their own act, and without any concurrence or interfering of the Crown, to expell any of their Members, the Speaker not excepted, for miſbehaviour, the reaſon of which ſeems to be, as the Crown is not ſuppoſed to interfere in elections, neither ought it in expulſions; but if the Speaker holds his place by the King's favour and approbation, ſo as without that he is not Speaker "<hi>pleno jure,</hi>" it would ſeem ſtrange that the Commons ſhould have a right to drive a man by their ſole authority from a poſt where they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have placed him without the King's command and favour. To depoſe a man from a poſt which he could not hold, nor be choſen to, but with the King's approbation, ſeems to be a greater power than to chuſe their Officer without, the King's approbation.</p>
            <p>If the King has a right to reject a Speaker choſen, he muſt hold that right either in virtue of ſome act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or it muſt be a part of his Royal Prerogative; the former was never aſſerted, the latter is the ſubject in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Upon a ſuppoſition the King had a clear conſtitutional right to nominate, or even impoſe a Speaker, as ſoon as the Houſe meets, that right ſeems clearly given up, by his ordering or giving the Houſe leave to chuſe a Speaker themſelves. As it is ſaid even the Lords may elect, unleſs the King appoints a Speaker for them, it ſeems clearly to follow that the King requiring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to chuſe, he means that the perſon by them cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſhall actually be Speaker, for they are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make choice of one or more perſons of whom the King may chuſe one, but ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to chuſe a Speaker for themſelves. That the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:042393_0009_101BD8A32C4C9380"/>
King does not interfere in the choice of a Prolocutor of the Law vocation, which has been called a Parliament in miniature, I conclude, becauſe when Dr. <hi>Jane</hi> was preferred to Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> King <hi>William</hi> did not reject, though certainly not as agreeable to the King's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as that excellent man Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi>; and as elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be made, according to <hi>Coke, ſine prece,</hi> without prayer or gift, ſo he obſerves they ought alſo to be made <hi>ſine praecepto,</hi> without the King's command by writ or otherwiſe, and he ſaith an act for that purpoſe was a cloſe and prudent ſalve, not only for that ſore, but for all other in like caſe, and is but an act declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the ancient law and cuſtom of Parliament.</p>
            <p>If we would argue from facts, but one inſtance has been produced where the choice of the Commons was excepted againſt, and none whatever where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſubmitted to a rejection; but the caſe of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Seymour</hi> will come in more fully hereafter. It is difficult to conceive how the Houſe may preſerve free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in debate if they are not at liberty to chuſe the perſon by whom theſe debates are to be directed. That they may chuſe any man whom the King ſhall approve is in reality ſaying they may chuſe no man but whom the King approves, and that would ſeem perfectly equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to they have no right to chuſe any man but whom the King chuſeth; the King will not approve of any perſon but who he is morally ſure will enter into all his meaſures; it by any means, whether by influence, nomination, choice, refuſal of approbation of any other, the King gets a man of ſuch a caſt in the chair of the Houſe of Commons, the King then has ſo far the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and a moſt powerful influence over the whole Houſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">That a Speaker may impede the buſineſs of the Houſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of arbitrary meaſures of the Crown we have a ſtriking inſtance in the Parliament 1673; the Commons remonſtrated againſt the marriage of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> with a Papiſt, which has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſo much miſchief to the nation, "To cut ſhort theſe agreeable attacks, the King reſolved to prorogue the Parliament, and with that intent came unexpectedly to the Houſe of Peers, and ſent the Uſher to ſummon the Commons. It happened that the Speaker and the Uſher nearly met at the door of the Houſe, but the Speaker being within, ſome of the Members ſuddenly ſhut the door and cried, <hi>To the chair, to the chair</hi>; while others cried, The black rod is at the door. The Speaker was hurried to the chair, and the following motions were inſtantly made—The alliance with <hi>France</hi> is a grievance—Evil Counſellors about the King are a grievance.— There was a general cry, <hi>To the queſtion, to the queſtion</hi>; but (behold now the benefit of a Speaker agreeable to <hi>Charles</hi> II.) the Uſher knocking violently at the door, <hi>THE SPEAKER LEAPT FROM THE CHAIR,</hi> and the Parliament being prorogued gave the Duke leiſure to conſummate his marriage. <hi>Rapin.</hi>
               </note> It is only in behalf of ſuch a Speaker that it
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:042393_0010_101BD8A4AF088AE8"/>
can be the Crown's intereſt to contend. Such a Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, under pretence of calling to order, may interrupt the freedom of debate, and ſtop an enquiry into any mal practice or eſcape; by a ſham ſickneſs, or his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the Houſe, an offender may eſcape; but, ſuppoſing the Crown ſhould reject a Speaker, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his being too popular, or having too great an influence in the Houſe, it would not only be treating the body of Repreſentatives as men that are not able to judge for themſelves, but it is apparent that the power of rejecting a man becauſe he is popular and diſagreeable to the Crown is as dangerous a power in the hands of a bad ruler as can well be imagined.</p>
            <p>When a Speaker is preſented to a King for approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the King muſt either be willing that all things ſhould continue and proceed according to the known Laws and Conſtitution of the land, or he muſt have contrary views; in the former caſe he can hardly have any motive or cauſe to reject any perſon that is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Speaker alone can make no alteration, and if the Commons ſhould attempt any thing againſt the Crown a diſſolution would legally enſue; but ſhould a ruler intend to make any alteration in the laws, a Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker might be a proper inſtrument in his hand for that purpoſe. The King it ſhould ſeem can have no reaſon or motive to reject any Speaker, but on a ſuſpicion of his having a ſtronger bias to the popular ſide than to the juſt Royal Prerogative; but beſides, that the King, in caſe of rejecting ſuch a one, muſt alſo harbour very hard thoughts of his Commons, it is eaſily ſeen what ſuch a power might lead to. Of a wiſe and good Prince nothing is to be apprehended, but againſt wicked or weak Princes, or rather pernicious and evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, the people can never be too much upon their guard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:042393_0011_101BD8A79C836488"/>It is not to be ſuppoſed, when a Speaker is preſented, his character and principles can be unknown to the King's Miniſters, but ſuppoſing they were, I cannot ſee how that ſhould be any ground for rejection; if he is known to be a fit tool the right of rejection will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, he will be ſure not to be rejected; if known to be a man zealous for the juſt rights and liberties of the nation, a patriot Prince can have no thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſuch an one; and that an arbitrary Sovereign, who will not reject a man of a contrary ſtamp, ſhould have a right to reject the only man that is fitteſt to oppoſe him and ſerve the nation, I think a very dangerous part of the Prerogative, and I am at a perfect loſs how to reconcile ſuch a power with the ſpirit and deſign of the Conſtitution of a free people.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations I muſt own ſtrongly influence me to doubt whether the Crown has a conſtitutional right to ſet aſide and reject a Speaker choſen by the Repreſentatives of the people. It is but fair, however, to hear what has been ſaid in ſupport of this right, and I do not mean that the arguments in favour of it ſhould loſe any of their force in my hands, I mean to repreſent them in all their weight, and as to theſe arguments and my remarks <hi>valeant quantum valere poſſunt,</hi> let them go as far as they may.</p>
            <p>Two writers have appeared among us in favour of this claim of the Prerogative; what <hi>NEUTER</hi> advanced, like his ſignature, is nothing neither here nor there; but, as he talks of a contagious political delirium, I am much afraid he has been in the neighbourhood of the contagion, however I wiſh him well over.</p>
            <p>I intend to conſider every argument of <hi>G. B. ſi per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gama dextra defendi potuiſſent hac vice defenſa fuiſſent.</hi> I dare ſay what books and arguments in this cauſe are not found with him will in vain be looked for any where elſe in this province.</p>
            <p>Two paſſages have been quoted from <hi>Coke</hi> in ſupport of this negative; <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith: "<hi>The Commons ſhall preſent their Speaker in the Upper Houſe to the King, who ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able himſelf, and in moſt humble manner intreat the King to command them to chuſe a more ſufficient man.</hi>" From this paſſage it is ſaid to appear that the new Speaker in the face of the whole Houſe of Commons admits a power
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:042393_0012_101BD8A935D84D40"/>
of rejection in the Crown; but is not this rather a large concluſion from ſmall premiſes? Does not the Speaker's intreaty that the King would order a fitter man to be choſen ſavour as much of compliment as any thing elſe? Does it not at leaſt look as much like compliment as like an acknowledgment of the right of rejection? However, if this proves any ſuch right, the argument I conceive muſt ſtand thus: The Speaker is to diſable himſelf, (<hi>i. e.</hi> plead his inability) and intreat the King to command the Commons to chuſe a fitter man; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (becauſe he pleads his inability, and wiſheth a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man may be choſen) the Crown has a clear right to put a negative on any man the Commons ſhall chuſe as their Speaker. I deſpair to convince that man of any thing, except what he himſelf pleaſeth, who can be convinced by ſuch an argument. <hi>Coke</hi> alſo ſaith: "<hi>It is true the Commons are to chuſe, but ſeeing that after their choice the King may refuſe him, for avoiding of expence and time, and conteſtation, the uſe is, (as in the congé d' eſlier of a Biſhop) that the King doth name a diſcreet and learned man, whom the Commons elect, but without their election no Speaker can be appointed for them.</hi>" The only expreſſion in this paſſage that may be conſtrued in ſupport of this claim is, that the King <hi>may</hi> refuſe. It has been obſerved that all this may mean no more than that the King may do it though he has no conſtitutional right ſo to do; and to this it has been anſwered, that <hi>Coke</hi> declares what he writes is grounded upon the authority and reaſon of books, rolls of Parliament, and judicial records, and that to make any objection againſt it is to make objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not againſt <hi>Coke,</hi> but (forſooth) againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution itſelf; but as no book, authority, reaſon, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary roll, or judicial record, has been produced older than this paſſage, I apprehend all this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith with regard to the King's <hi>may</hi> may be bare narrative ſtill, and no legal declaration of what the King may legally do; and I am the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to doubt this matter, becauſe I find <hi>Coke</hi> does not always ſpeak like a Legiſlator, or one that declares the law; in this caſe, <hi>e. g.</hi> he ſaith every Member of the Houſe being a Counſellor, he ſhould have three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the elephant—that he has no gall—that he is inflexible and cannot bow—and that he is of ripe and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:042393_0013_101BD8AF0BEB1238"/>
moſt perfect memory. Now this ſeems a very good ſimile, but that any law declares a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be like an elephant I ſtill doubt, though I think all that write and act in publick ought to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gall, and all Legiſlators inflexibly right. I don't know when <hi>Coke</hi> wrote, but ſhould any writer now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, while the Parliament ſits, the King has as much authority in the choice of their Speaker as in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Biſhop by congé d' eſlier, he would hardly be in any danger of receiving the thanks of the Houſe; but perhaps theſe things may better ſuit the meridian of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and, great as the authority is, I preſume it is no treaſon to ſay that the Conſtitution is now better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood than even a <hi>Coke</hi> explained it in the days of the <hi>Stuarts</hi>; and yet after all he expreſsly ſaith, though he ſeems to begin rather abruptly: True it is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt chuſe their own Speaker, and he cannot be appointed for them. All that was thought law in the days of <hi>Coke</hi> has not been thought ſo ſince. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> the great oracle of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> law, had not only concurred witn all other Lawyers in favour of this Prerogative of diſpenſing power, but ſeems even to believe it ſo inherent to the Crown that an act of Parliament itſelf could not aboliſh it, becauſe from the law of nature the King has a right to the ſervice of all his ſubjects. <hi>Hume's Hiſt. of England,</hi> vi. 394, On this principle Papiſts may be made Counſellors in <hi>Grenada,</hi> and why not in <hi>England?</hi> and men of known loyalty and approved abilities may be rejected as Speakers. I dare ſay, however contemptibly <hi>G. B.</hi> may ſpeak of thoſe that do not underſtand an ambiguous paſſage of <hi>Coke</hi> as he does, he will never ſet his name to any propoſition that with <hi>Coke</hi> declares the diſpenſing power legal. The Revolution, as <hi>Hume</hi> juſtly obſerves, having put an end to theſe diſputes, the acquiſition of real liberty ſhewed the danger of the ſubſiſtance of ſuch a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I am really ſurprized at the ſtreſs that has been laid on the caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> rejected by <hi>Charles</hi> II. in 1679. It has been ſaid "he was rejected," "the King never gave the matter up," "prorogued the Houſe for a <hi>few days,</hi>" "that the Houſe dropt the matter," which it ſeems they had miſtaken," "and proceeded to the choice of another perſon," (<hi>See Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Gazette for April</hi> 29, 1772:) And again, (<hi>Georgia Gazette for May</hi> 13) "that the King aſſerted the right of nomination," "rejected one Speaker and nominated another," and, <hi>N. B.</hi> becauſe "the Houſe declined to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:042393_0014_101BD8B1F84B6468"/>
chuſe him prorogued them," "that the Houſe did not aſſert their right but chuſed <hi>Gregory,</hi>" "and did not ſhew a want of publick ſpirit by impeding publick buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had they done ſo it is ſuppoſed <hi>Charles</hi> would have diſſolved them, left they ſhould ſerve him the ſame trick that had been ſerved his father:" And again, (<hi>Georgia Gazette May</hi> 29) "that in the next ſeſſion they repaired their miſtake, and choſe a different perſon." Now, whoever puts all this together will naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Commons choſe a Speaker diſagreeable to the King, whom the King rejected; that, on their not reſcinding their choice, the King inſiſted on his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a right, and never gave it up, but prorogued them for ſome days, and that then they dropt the matter, repaired their miſtake, gave up their claim ſo far that now "it can't be ſaid to be undecided," choſe another perſon, and ſo all was well, the King's right eſtabliſhed, and whoever now thinks and ſaith otherwiſe is a fiery Republican, and as bad (or nearly) as the Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. I do not mean to criticize upon this account given by an author of whom it has been ſaid "that he writes unſoured by party, and with an apparent view to give candid information;" but I adviſe the reader next to peruſe a different account given by two authors who have never been deemed partial, and who at leaſt cannot be ſaid to be influenced by our <hi>Georgia</hi> diſputes.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Rapin:</hi> The Parliament began with a warm diſpute between the King and the Commons about the choice of a Speaker. The Commons having choſen Mr. <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> the King, who knew <hi>Seymour</hi> was a particular enemy of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> refuſed his approbation, and ordered the Commons to proceed to a new choice. The Houſe was extremely diſpleaſed with this refuſal, alledging, that it was never known that a perſon ſhould be excepted againſt, and no reaſon given, and <hi>that the thing itſelf of preſenting a Speaker to the King was but a bare compliment.</hi> The King, on his ſide, inſiſted on the approbation or refuſal of a Speaker when preſented to him as a branch of his Prerogative. During a ſix days diſpute, the Commons made ſeveral repreſentations to the King, to which he gave very ſhort anſwers. At laſt, as the Commons would not deſiſt from what they thought their right, the King went
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:042393_0015_101BD8B381987280"/>
to the Parliament, and prorogued it from the 13th to the 15th, that is, for <hi>ONE</hi> day's interval between the two <hi>SESSIONS.</hi> The Parliament meeting the 15th, the King ordered the Commons to proceed to the choice of a Speaker; then, to avoid a revival of the diſpute, they choſe Mr. <hi>William Gregory,</hi> Serjeant at Law, who was approved by the King. <hi>Rapin, vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 703.</p>
            <p>The account given in the Parliamentary Debates is ſtill fuller:</p>
            <p>The Chancellor, by the King's commands, ordered the Houſe of Commons to proceed to the choice of a Speaker, who was to be preſented to the King the next day; and being returned to their Houſe, Colonel <hi>Birch</hi> did nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and recommend the Right Honourable <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> Knight of the Shire for the county of <hi>Devon,</hi> Treaſurer of the Navy, one of his Majeſty's moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privy-Council, and Speaker of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Being a perſon acceptable to the King, and one who for his great integrity, ability, and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the employment, was the fitteſt perſon for ſo great a truſt. And Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> being unanimouſly called upon to the chair, was conducted thither by Sir <hi>Thomas Lee,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Whitmore,</hi> and divers other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and being there placed, he made a gratulatory ſpeech to the Houſe for their great kindneſs and affection towards him, in their unanimous choice of him: But ſtill he deſired the Houſe that they would proceed to a new election,
<q>For the long ſittings of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ſo impaired his health, that he doubted he ſhould not be well able to undergo the ſervice of the Houſe as would be expected from him:</q>
But the Houſe not admitting of any excuſe, confirmed their choice; upon which <hi>be deſired leave,</hi>
               <q>That he might intercede with his Majeſty, that he would be pleaſed to diſcharge him of the duty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it appears, that he need not have been ſo ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; for the King and the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> taking this choice to be an ill preſage, that this Parliament would begin where the laſt ended, were reſolved not to approve of it: And as ſoon as he appeared to be perſented, the Lord Chancellor ſtood up, and ſaid,
<q>That if his Majeſty ſhould always accept a perſon pitcht upon by the Houſe of Commons, then it would be no great favour to be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:042393_0016_101BD8B50F4FC108"/>
choſen a Speaker; and therefore his Majeſty, being the beſt judge of perſons and things, thought fit to except againſt Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> as being fitly qualifyed for other ſervices and imployments, without giving any reaſon to the perſons chuſing or the perſons choſen.</q>
And therefore he ordered them to fix upon ſome other perſon by to-morrow morning, to be preſented to the King for his approbation. The Commons immediately returned back to their own Houſe, where Sir <hi>John Ernly</hi> ſtood up and acquainted them,
<q>He had orders from his Majeſty to recommend Sir <hi>Thomas Meers</hi> to them to be their Speaker, as a perſon well known in the method and practice of Parliaments, and a perſon that he thought would be very acceptable and ſerviceable to them.</q>
But the Houſe in a great heat cryed out, <hi>No, no!</hi> and fell into a warm debate. Mr. <hi>Sacheverell</hi> ſaid,
<q>It was never known that a perſon ſhould be excepted againſt, and no reaſon at all given, and therefore concluded, that it was done purpoſely to gratify ſome particular perſons. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid for above a hundred years, it had not been known that a Speaker preſented was ever excepted againſt; and the thing itſelf of preſenting him to the King, as he humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was but a bare compliment. Sir <hi>Thomas Clarges</hi> alledged, that there were Parliaments long before there were Speakers choſen, and afterwards, for the eaſe of the Houſe among themſelves, they pitched upon a Speaker.—All our lives and liberties are preſerved by this Houſe, therefore we are to preſerve the liberties of it. Mr. <hi>Garraway</hi> objected, if Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> be rejected and no reaſon given, pray who muſt chuſe a Speaker, the King or we? It is plain not we?—Sir <hi>Thomas Lee</hi> ſaid, we addreſs'd ourſelves to his Majeſty the laſt Parliament, as fearing his perſon to be in danger, but we received no anſwer at all in a whole week; we were immediately prorogued unexpectedly; and a little after diſſolved, as unexpectedly; and I ſuppoſe, the ſame perſons that gave that advice, gave this alſo.</q>
Others concluded, that all this was only for a bone of contention, fearing they ſhould agree, and ſo called to adjourn; which was ſoon agreed to.</p>
            <p>Theſe heats were ſo much the greater, becauſe they reaſonably ſuppoſed that it was all occaſioned by the Earl
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:042393_0017_101BD8BC4408BED0"/>
of <hi>Danby</hi>; whoſe power was not wholly at an end; and between whom and Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> there was a particular reſentment. However, the firſt thing reſolved on the next day, being <hi>Saturday,</hi> was,
<q>That an humble appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be made to the King, to acquaint his Majeſty, that the matter yeſterday delivered by the Lord Chancellor, relating to the Speaker, is of ſo great importance, that this Houſe cannot immediately come to a reſolution therein: And therefore do humbly deſire his Majeſty, that he will graciouſly be pleaſed, to grant ſome further time for this Houſe to take the matter into conſideration.</q>
And they ordered the Chancellor of the dutchy, the Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Capel,</hi> immediately to attend his Majeſty with this vote. Being returned in a ſhort time, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> acquainted the Houſe, That they had attended his Majeſty, who was ſitting in Council; and that his Majeſty, as ſoon as he was informed they were to wait upon him from the Houſe immediately came out, and received them with great chearfulneſs and kindneſs: And having delivered their meſſage, his Majeſty retired to the Council-Chamber, and coming out again, was pleaſed to return the following anſwer by word of mouth, which they had reduced to writing:

            <p>WE your Majeſty's moſt dutiful and loyal ſubjects, the Commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, do with all obedience return your Majeſty moſt hearty thanks for the favourable reception, and gracious anſwer your Majeſty was pleaſed to return to our late meſſage; wherein your Majeſty was pleaſed, not only to <hi>allow us longer time,</hi> to deliberate of what was delivered to us by the Lord Chancellor, relating to the choice of a Speaker, but likewiſe to expreſs ſo great a care <hi>not to infringe our privileges.</hi> And we deſire your Majeſty to believe no ſubjects ever had a more tender regard, than ourſelves,

to the rights of your Majeſty, and your Royal Prerogative; which we ſhall always acknowledge to be veſted in the Crown, for the benefit and protection of your people. And therefore for the clearing all doubts that may ariſe in your Royal mind, upon this occaſion now before us, we crave leave humbly to repreſent unto your Majeſty, That it is the undoubted right of the Commons to have the free election of one of their Members to be their Speaker, and to perform the ſervice of the Houſe: And that the Speaker ſo elected, and preſented according to cuſtom, hath by the conſtant practice of all former ages, been continued Speaker and executed that employment, unleſs ſuch perſons have been excuſed for ſome corporal diſeaſe, which has been alledged, either by themſelves, or ſome others in their behalf, in full Parliament. According to this uſage, Mr. <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly choſen, upon the conſideration of his great ability and ſufficiency for that place, of which we had large experience in the laſt Parliament, and was preſented by us to your Majeſty, as a perſon we conceived would be moſt acceptable to your Majeſty's Royal judgment. This being the true ſtate of the caſe, we do in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity lay it before your Majeſty's view; hoping that your Majeſty, upon due conſideration of former precedents, will reſt ſatisfied with our proceedings, and will think fit not to deprive us of ſo neceſſary a Member, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying him in any other ſervice; but to give us ſuch a gracious anſwer, as your Majeſty, and your Royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, have always done heretofore upon the like occaſions; that ſo we may, without more loſs of time, proceed to the diſpatch of thoſe important affairs, for which we were called hither: Wherein we doubt not but we ſhall ſo behave ourſelves, as to give an ample teſtimony to the whole world of our duty and affection to your Majeſty's ſervice, and of our care of the peace and proſperity of your kingdoms.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS by the gracious anſwer your Majeſty was pleaſed to give to our firſt meſſage in Council, whereby your Majeſty was pleaſed to declare a reſolution, <hi>not to infringe our juſt rights and privileges,</hi> we your Majeſty's moſt dutiful and loyal Commons were encouraged to make an humble repreſentation to your Majeſty upon the choice of our Speaker, which on <hi>Tueſday</hi> laſt was preſented by ſome of our Members: We do, with great trouble and infinite ſorrow, find by the report made to us by thoſe Members, at their return, that your Majeſty was pleaſed to give us an immediate anſwer to the ſame, without taking any further conſideration; which we are perſuaded, if your Majeſty had done, what we then offered to your Majeſty would ſo far have prevailed upon your Royal judgment, as to have given your Majeſty ſatisfaction in the reaſonableneſs of our deſire; and preſerved us in your Majeſty's favourable opinion of our proceedings. And ſince we do humbly conceive, that the occaſion of this queſtion hath ariſen from your Majeſty's not being truly informed of the ſtate of the caſe; we humbly beſeech your Majeſty to take the ſaid repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into your further conſideration, and give us ſuch a gracious anſwer, that we may be put in a capacity to manifeſt our readineſs to enter into theſe conſultations which neceſſarily tend to the preſervation and welfare of your Majeſty and your kingdoms.</p>

            <p>Upon reading this addreſs to the King, he immediately gave this quick and ſharp return; <hi>Gentlemen, I will ſend you an anſwer to-morrow.</hi> Accordingly, as he had often done before upon great difficulties, he reſolved to put an end to the diſpute; and on the next morning, being <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 13th of <hi>March,</hi> he came to the Houſe of Peers, and ſending for the Commons, he immediately prorogued the Parliament till <hi>Saturday</hi> following, after the Commons had ſat without a Speaker but ſix days. And thus the King found a way to gain his point, but with very little advantage to his own buſineſs and affairs.</p>
            <p>On the appointed day, <hi>March</hi> 15th, his Majeſty came to the Houſe of Peers in his Royal robes, and the Houſe of Commons attending, his Majeſty was pleaſed to put both Houſes in mind of what he ſaid to them at the opening of the Parliament: And then the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:042393_0020_101BD8BF4AB1E270"/>
by the King's command, directed the Commons to return to their Houſe, and to proceed to the choice of a Speaker. And being returned, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> put the Houſe in mind of the King's commands, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recommended <hi>William Gregory</hi> Sergeant at law, <hi>as a perſon, for his great learning and integrity, fit for the employment.</hi> And Mr. Sergeant <hi>Gregory</hi> being unanimouſly called upon to the chair, he in a ſhort ſpeech modeſtly excuſed himſelf, and deſired of the Houſe, that another might be nominated; but no excuſe being admitted, he was formally conducted to the chair, by his two intimate friends, the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cavendiſh,</hi> and there confirmed in the place.</p>
            <p>"On the <hi>Monday</hi> following, he was preſented by the Commons to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Houſe of Lords, who without heſitation approved of the choice." <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> having ſo often been mentioned in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, it may not be amiſs to take ſome notice of his character as drawn by <hi>Burnet,</hi> and of his behaviour as Speaker: "In pride he had neither ſhame nor decency: He was violent againſt the Court till he forced himſelf into good poſts: He knew the Houſe, and every man in it, ſo well, that by looking about he could tell the fate of any queſtion: He was the moſt aſſuming Speaker that ever ſat in the chair: If any thing was put when the Court party was not well gathered together, he would have held the Houſe from doing any thing by a wilful miſtaking or misſtating the queſtion; by that he gave time to thoſe who were appointed for that mercenary work to go about and gather in all their party, and he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when they had got the majority, and THEN he would very fairly ſtate the queſtion WHEN he was ſure to carry it." It is moſt likely that in favour of ſuch a man the Court party would exert all their influence to get him choſen, and very improbable that being choſen the Commons would ſo ſtrenuouſly have oppoſed his rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they had not thought it illegal and a dangerous precedent; but from this very inſtance it appears to demonſtration how eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial it is to the regularity, freedom, and juſt iſſue of national de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, that no ſuch Speaker ſhould by any means be obtruded, or one of a contrary ſtamp be rejected. The Commons maintained their claim as long as they were ſuffered to continue, and till a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation put an end to all their proceedings. At the next ſeſſion they might be the more unwilling to revive their former choice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could eaſily fix upon a better man; <hi>Gregory</hi> was then choſen, and in the two ſucceeding Parliaments that very <hi>Williams</hi> who had aſſerted that the preſenting the Speaker to the King was a bare compliment; the King did not ſhew any reſentment, but approved of him without heſitation. The true reaſon of <hi>Seymour</hi>'s rejection, who had been Speaker before, was this: The Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> expected to be proſecuted for things done by the King's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; the King, in order to ſecure him, granted him a pardon in a very illegal manner; <hi>Seymour</hi> was looked upon as <hi>Danby</hi>'s enemy, and it was thought too dangerous that upon this occaſion he ſhould be Speaker; hence the King rather excuſed himſelf for not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than harſhly rejected him; and thus it appears that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was made with a manifeſt view to obſtruct publick juſtice, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the right of rejection was never claimed nor contended for but upon this ſingle occaſion, it does not ſeem to derive any merit from the only inſtance when it was pleaded.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:042393_0021_101BD8C0E4383398"/>I ſhall not make many remarks on theſe accounts, but I cannot forbear obſerving that the only inſtance where a Speaker appears rejected by the Crown was in the reign of a <hi>Stuart,</hi> when there was a ſettled deſign againſt the religion and liberties of the nation, which is far from being a preſumption favourable to ſuch a claim; even then the King does not reject <hi>ex plenitudine potestatis,</hi> but <hi>aſſigns as a reaſon</hi> that Sir <hi>Edward Seymour</hi> was proper for other ſervices; and yet the Commons tell the King, that to chuſe their Speaker without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of their choice is their undoubted right. When <hi>Charles</hi> recommended another as one who he thought would be very acceptable and ſerviceable to <hi>THEM,</hi> they cried, No, no, and never would nor did chuſe him; the King wiſheth then to find an expedient, did not inſiſt on his nomination, but prorogued them for a ſingle day, which was plainly done to compromiſe the matter; when they met again, he recommended nobody, but Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> who afterwards fell a martyr to liberty, nominated <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was unanimouſly choſen, and formally conducted to the chair, and there-confirmed in the place, and <hi>Monday</hi> after the King ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of him without heſitation. <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, expreſsly ſaith the point was ſettled, that the right of electing was in the Houſe, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation was a thing of courſe.</p>
            <p>The argument, that if the King has no right to reject he may be under a neceſſity of admitting diſagreeable perſons into his preſence, as perſons may be choſen diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected to his Majeſty's perſon and government, of which <hi>Wilkes</hi> being made Sheriff is given as an example, I cannot think of any great ſtrength. I ſuppoſe the law calls no man diſaffected who takes the oaths preſcribed by law, and if any ſhould be perſonally diſagreeable to the King there is no neceſſity for his coming into his preſence. <hi>Wilkes</hi> I believe never did, but I conceive
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:042393_0022_101BD8C6A968FB90"/>
the Conſtitution diſables no man to ſerve his country in any place not in the gift of the Crown merely becauſe he may be diſagreeable to the King. The ſame Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that choſe <hi>Seymour</hi> deputed Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> to the King, who never was a friend to the King's meaſures, and yet <hi>Charles</hi> had more grace than to receive him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than politely. The right of rejecting a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable perſon can be of no manner of ſervice to the Crown, unleſs it may be exerciſed as often as a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon is choſen. Suppoſing the caſe to happen, it can hardly be expected that a Houſe ſo ill diſpoſed as to chuſe a diſagreeable perſon at firſt would become ſo good-natured, by the afront of a rejection, as to chuſe a perſon more agreeable in a ſecond election; or, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing elections were repeated till the Commons gave way and choſe a perſon perfectly agreeable to the Crown, what muſt be the natural conſequence to the people? it can be no other than an expreſs introduction of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would have to repreſent the King. The Speaker is not the King's Repreſentative, but if the Crown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts none ſhall be Speaker but one that will obey the orders, or, which may be juſt the ſame, is agreeable to the King, he might as well; in that caſe the King would have an Officer in the Houſe, introduced, not by bribery and corruption, but by refuſing to approve any other, and he might have the caſting vote in a place where he ought to have no vote at all.</p>
            <p>That <hi>to preſent a Speaker for approbation implies a right of rejection</hi> has been alledged with greater ſhew; but that it is the Commons choice, and not the King's approbation, that conſtitutes the Speaker, ſeems very plain, becauſe he is placed in the chair immediately after the election, and ſometimes acts as ſuch ſome days before he is preſented and approved of by the King. It would be very indecent to veſt him in the office, and place him in the chair, if after all the King's negative might ſet aſide the choice; and I would apply here what Sir <hi>R. Atkins</hi> ſaith with regard to a form obſerved at the ſame time when the Speaker is preſented, "<hi>That humble and modeſt way of the people's addreſſing their Sovereign, — for granting privileges,</hi>" of which the right to chuſe and have a Speaker ſeems neceſſarily one) "<hi>ſhows great reverence and becomes the majeſty of the Prince to be addreſſed to; but let it not be made an argument that either the laws thereupon made, or the privileges allowed, are precarious, and merely a favour, or may he refuſed them of right.</hi>" There are many preſentations in law which allow not of rejection. The uſual privileges, without which the Houſe cannot act nor ſubſiſt, muſt be aſked for; but as this is a petition not of favour, but of right, ſo it ſeems the approbation of a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is as much ſo. If the Conſtitution requires ſome application <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:042393_0023_101BD8C99FD08418"/>
the King, it alſo obliges the Crown never to put a negative on ſome applications. The new Speaker humbly <hi>PRAYS</hi> for the privileges of the Houſe, but ſhould any Prince be ſo ill-adviſed as to look upon that application as a matter which he may refuſe, he might perhaps be informed that ſuch a refuſal implied no leſs than a breach of the original contract between him and his people, and that in this caſe it would be in vain to ſay that the power of giving (or approving) alſo implies a power of refuſing.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that this claim of the Crown was but once denied by Parliament; I believe it was always denied; but it might as well have been ſaid it was but once claimed by the Crown. Some weight is laid on the circumſtance that a Speaker was recommended as acceptable to the King, but it ſeems the King alſo recommended a man as one whom he ſuppoſed very acceptable to Parliament. When a ſuperior recommends to an inferior it is no argument that thoſe to whom he recommends have not a final choice. That a perſon <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> is acceptable to the King may be no improper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to or motive with his electors.</p>
            <p>To eſtabliſh this claim of the Crown, it has been obſerved, that Speakers have been diſallowed, like Sir <hi>John Popham</hi>; but the caſe amounts to no more than his excuſe was admitted; formerly every Speaker begged leave of the Houſe that he might excuſe himſelf to the King; this requeſt of leave ſeems rather a proof that the election of the Houſe is looked upon as final than otherwiſe, and <hi>Popham,</hi> though his excuſe muſt have been very good, appears the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which it was admitted, and cannot be of much weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo many inſtances where no excuſe was allowed. It is very certain the King did not approve <hi>Seymour,</hi> but it is not leſs ſo that, in order to get rid of the choice, he was obliged to prorogue the Houſe, and that all he gained is, that the Commons did not revive the diſpute. The acquieſcing of the Repreſentatives of <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> under a negative put on their choice is entirely owing to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of their charter, and I am ſtill of opinion that what rights the King reſerved to himſelf in that charter are not ſuch as are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted prerogative of the Crown, but ſuch as every Aſſembly or Parliament has a juſt claim to where the contrary it not expreſsly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated by charter.</p>
            <p>It has been advanced, that "<hi>when the King gave the Commons leave to chuſe a Speaker he reſerved to himſelf the right of rejecting a Speaker that might be diſagreeable to him, and that there was a compact between the King and Commons for that purpoſe.</hi>" This would be a ſtrong argument indeed; but when and where was that compact made? What au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or hiſtorian ſpeaks of it? What authority is cited in proof of it? "<hi>Why it is natural to conclude,</hi>" but is it not as natural to conclude that, becauſe no traces of any ſuch compact are to be found, and that the Commons always regularly choſe their own Speaker, and that not even an attempt was ever made to reject him, but in the caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Seymour,</hi> and that then the King never made any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch an original compact, but ſubmitted to have his own nomination treated with a negative, and approved of one choſen in oppoſition to his own former recommendation, that therefore no <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> compact ever exiſted? And as this country it very "ſcarce of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>" I am clearly of opinion <hi>that</hi> book is not on this ſide of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> where this compact ſtands upon record, but if a copy, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <pb n="24" facs="unknown:042393_0024_101BD8CB21FAA778"/>
where this compact may be found, is left with the Priter it ſhall be duly acknowledged, and, if the owner chuſes it, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe given that his name ſhall not be mentioned.</p>
            <p>I ought to take notice of one argument more, (<hi>Georgia Gazette June</hi> 24:) "<hi>If the Maſſachuſetts-Bay hold their provincial Legiſlation under charter, do not we in this province hold it under his Majeſty's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and inſtruction to his Repreſentative? And if that charter has reſerved the power of negation upon their choice of a Speaker, will not the commiſſions and inſtructions to the Governor of this province have the ſame effect?</hi> I conceive a very great difference between his Majeſty's inſtructions and charters; an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> I ſhould think entitled to <hi>Engliſh</hi> laws, which I ſuppoſe implies Legiſlation any where and every where in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions; that this right is prior to any charter or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and is held not by inſtructions to a Governor, but is his natural right, which nothing but outlawry can deprive him of Whatever is not law cannot be binding upon a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject, and I ſuppoſe no man will ſay that, becauſe the King has an undoubted right to inſtruct his ſervants, that therefore he has alſo a right to give inſtructions contrary to the Conſtitution, or derogatory of the right of the ſubject; ſuch an inſtruction a Governor might look upon as a law to himſelf, but it is only the King can do no wrong, and the reaſon is plain, becauſe the King can do nothing againſt law or the Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid that a Speaker may have an undue influence to the prejudice of the Crown; but he can <hi>have</hi> no undue influence to Speaker before he is really ſuch, and it cannot <hi>appear</hi> that he has any undue influence before he has actually entered on his office, and in this caſe the Crown is ſufficiently guarded by its indiſputable negative on every act of Legiſlature, and of diſſolution whenever it ſhall be thought neceſſary. By this alſo it would ſeem as if the Crown had a right to reject a Speaker actually approved of when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his influence ſhould become diſagreeable, which doctrine I believe is entirely new, perhaps not free from danger.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly of this province ſometimes conſiſted only of 19 Members; 9 then made a Houſe, and 5 a majority; as the number of Repreſentatives increaſed it was thought neceſſary that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to conſtitute a Houſe ſhould be increaſed in proportion; 19 now make a Houſe, and 10 a majority, to do any buſineſs relating to the province. The remark that the ſtrenuous advocate of the right of negative makes upon this alteration is this: "<hi>Such reſolutions</hi> (which by the way were unanimous) <hi>could be made with no other view than the putting it in the power of a few leading men to impede the publick buſineſs by a ſeceſſion whenever they pleaſed</hi>; which remark, as I ſuppoſe it had not been made had any Aſſembly ſubſiſted, ſo every reader will judge with what juſtice and temperit was made. That he wiſhes 5 men might have the power rather than 10 is ſelf-evident, and that 1 man may more eaſily influence 4 or 5 than 9 or 10 need not be doubted.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with a citation from a debate in the Houſe of Lords in 1675: "<hi>The Lords plainly ſpoke out, That men had been, might and were likely to be, in either Houſe, too much for the King, as they called it, and that whoever did endeavour to give more power to the King than the law and Conſtitution had given, — might juſtly be ſaid <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
