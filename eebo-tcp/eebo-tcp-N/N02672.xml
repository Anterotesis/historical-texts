            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A MODEST ENQUIRY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THERE is no Science, the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of which is more uſeful and commendable than the Knowledge of the true Intereſt of one's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and perhaps there is no Kind of Learning more abſtruſe and intricate, more difficult to acquire in any Degree of Perfection than This, and therefore none more generally neglected. Hence it is, that we every Day find Men in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation contending warmly on ſome Point in Politicks, which, altho' it may nearly concern them both, neither of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any more than they do each other.</p>
            <p>Thus much by way of Apology for this preſent <hi>Enquiry into the Nature and Neceſſity of a Paper Currency.</hi> And if any Thing I ſhall ſay, may be a Means of fixing a Subject that is now the chief
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003165_0003_0ff085dde6327cf8"/>
Concern of my Countrymen, in a clearer Light, I ſhall have the Satisfaction of thinking my Time and Pains well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
            <p>To proceed, then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a certain proportionate Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Money requiſite to carry on the Trade of a Country freely and currently; More than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hich would be of no Advantage in Trade, and Leſs, if much leſs, exceedingly detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leads us to the following general Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>A great Want of Money in any Trading Country, occaſions Intereſt to be at at a very high Rate.</hi> And here it may be obſerved, that it is impoſſible by any Laws to reſtrain Men from giving and receiving exorbitant Intereſt, where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is ſuitably ſcarce: For he that wants Money will find out Ways to give 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> when he cannot have it for leſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the Law forbids to take more than 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> Now the Intereſt of Money being high is prejudicial to a Country ſeveral Ways: It makes Land bear a low Price, becauſe few Men will lay out their Money in Land, when they can make a much greater Profit by lending it out
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003165_0004_0ff085e2ef5a92e8"/>
upon Intereſt: And much leſs will Men be inclined to venture their Money at Sea, when they can, without Riſque or Hazard, have a great and certain Profit by keeping it at home; thus Trade is diſcouraged. And if in two Neigbouring Countries the Traders of one, by Reaſon of a greater Plenty of Money, can bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it to trade with at a lower Rate than the Traders of the other, they will infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly have the Advantage, and get the greateſt Part of that Trade into their own Hands; For he that trades with Money he hath borrowed at 8 or 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> cannot hold Market with him that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows his Money at 6 or 4. — On the contrary, <hi>A plentiful Currency will occaſion Intereſt to be low:</hi> And this will be an Inducement to many to lay out their Money in Lands, rather than put it out to Uſe, by which means Land will begin to riſe in Value and bear a better Price: And at the ſame Time it will tend to enliven Trade exceedingly, becauſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will find more Profit in employing their Money that Way than in Uſury; and many that underſtand Buſineſs very well, but have not a Stock ſufficient of their own, will be encouraged to borrow
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003165_0005_0ff085e5db83b768"/>
Money to trade with, when they can have it a moderate Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Want of Money in a Country reduces the Price of that Part of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce which is uſed in Trade:</hi> Becauſe Trade being diſcouraged by it as above, there is a much leſs Demand for that Produce. And this is another Reaſon why Land in ſuch a Caſe will be low, eſpecially where the Staple Commodity of the Country is the immediate Produce of the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Produce being low, fewer Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple find an Advantage in Husbandry, or the Improvement of Land. — On the contrary, <hi>A Plentiful Currency will occaſion the Trading Produce to bear a good Price:</hi> Becauſe Trade being encouraged and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by it, there will be a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Demand for that Produce; which will be a great Encouragement of Husbandry and Tillage, and conſequently make Land more valuable, for that many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would apply themſelves to Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, who probably might otherwiſe have ſought ſome more profitable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>As we have already experienced how much the Increaſe of our Currency by what Paper Money has been made, has
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003165_0006_0ff085e978a18b18"/>
encouraged our Trade; particularly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance only in one Article, <hi>Ship-Building</hi>; it may not be amiſs to obſerve under this Head, what a great Advantage it muſt be to us as a Trading Country, that has Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and all the Materials proper for that Buſineſs within itſelf, to have <hi>Ship-Building</hi> as much as poſſible advanced: For every Ship that is built here for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, gains the Province her clear Value in Gold and Silver, which muſt otherwiſe have been ſent Home for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in her Stead; and likewiſe, every Ship built in and belonging to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, not only ſaves the Province her firſt Coſt, but all the Freight, Wages and Proviſions ſhe ever makes or requires as long as ſhe laſts; provided Care is taken to make This her <hi>Pay Port,</hi> and that ſhe always takes Proviſions with her for the whole Voyage, which may eaſily be done. And how conſiderable an Article this is yearly in our Favour, every one, the leaſt acquainted with mercantile Affairs, muſt needs be ſenſible; for if we could not Build our ſelves, we muſt either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſo many Veſſels as we want from other Countries, or elſe Hire them to carry our Produce to Market, which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003165_0007_0ff085ede18f7610"/>
would be more expenſive than Purchaſing; and on many other Accounts exceedingly to our Loſs. Now as Trade in general will decline where there is not a plentiful Currency, ſo <hi>Ship-Building</hi> muſt certainly of Conſequence decline where Trade is declining.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Want of Money in a Country diſcourages Labouring and Handicrafts Men (which are the chief Strength and Support of a People) from coming to ſettle in it, and induces many that were ſettled to leave the Country, and ſeek Entertainment and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Places, where they can be better paid.</hi> For what can be more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning to an induſtrious labouring Man, than this, that after he hath earned his Bread with the Sweat of his Brows, he muſt ſpend as much Time, and have near as much Fatigue in getting it, as he had to earn it. <hi>And nothing makes more bad Paymaſters than a general Scarcity of Money.</hi> And here again is a Third Reaſon for Land's bearing a low Price in ſuch a Country, becauſe Land always increaſes in Value in Proportion with the Increaſe of the People ſettling on it, there being ſo many more Buyers; and its Value will infallibly be diminiſhed, if the Number
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003165_0008_0ff085f1f4e686b8"/>
of its Inhabitants diminiſh. — On the contrary, <hi>A Plentiful Currency will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage great Numbers of Labouring and Handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts Men to come and Settle in the Country,</hi> by the ſame Reaſon that a Want of it will diſcourage and drive them out. Now the more Inhabitants, the greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for Land (as is ſaid above) upon which it muſt neceſſarily riſe in Value, and bear a better Price. The ſame may be ſaid of the Value of Houſe-Rent, which will be advanced for the ſame Reaſons; and by the Increaſe of Trade and Riches People will be enabled to pay greater Rents. Now the Value of Houſe-Rent riſing, and Intereſt becoming low, many that in a Scarcity of Money prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed Uſury, will probably be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Building; which will likewiſe ſenſibly enliven Buſineſs in any Place; it being an Advantage not only to <hi>Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Bricklayers, Maſons, Carpenters, Joiners, Glaziers,</hi> and ſeveral other Trades immediately employ'd by Building, but likewiſe to <hi>Farmers, Brewers, Bakers, Taylors, Shoemakers, Shop-keepers,</hi> and in ſhort to every one that they lay their Money out with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003165_0009_0ff085f3e7e75cd0"/>Fourthly, <hi>Want of Money in ſuch a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as ours, occaſions a greater Conſumption of</hi> Engliſh <hi>and</hi> European <hi>Goods, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Number of the People, than there would otherwiſe be.</hi> Becauſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Traders, by whom abundance of Artificers and labouring Men are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, finding their other Affairs require what Money they can get into their hands, oblige thoſe who work for them to take one half, or perhaps two thirds Goods in Pay. By this Means a greater Quantity of Goods are diſpoſed of, and to a greater Value; becauſe Working Men and their Families ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereby induced to be more profuſe and extravagant in fine Apparel and the like, than they would be if they were obliged to pay ready Money for ſuch Things after they had earn'd and received it, or if ſuch Goods were not impoſed upon them, of which they can make no other Uſe: For ſuch People cannot ſend the Goods they are paid with to a Foreign Market, without loſing conſiderably by having them ſold for leſs than they ſtand 'em in here; neither can they eaſily diſpoſe of them at Home, becauſe their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are generally ſupplied in the ſame Manner; But how unreaſonable would it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003165_0010_0ff085f5b7996600"/>
be, if ſome of thoſe very Men who <hi>have been a Means</hi> of thus forcing People into unneceſſary Expence, ſhould be the firſt and moſt earneſt in accuſing them of <hi>Pride and Prodigality.</hi> Now tho' this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Conſumption of Foreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities may be a Profit to particular Men, yet the Country in general grows poorer by it apace. — On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, As <hi>A plentiful Currency will occaſion a leſs Conſumption of</hi> European <hi>Goods, in Proportion to the Number of the People,</hi> ſo it will be a means of making the Balance of our Trade more equal than it now is, if it does not give it in our Favour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our own Produce will be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the ſame Time. And it is to be obſerved, that tho' leſs Foreign Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities are conſumed in Proportion to the Number of People, yet this will be no Diſadvantage to the Merchant, becauſe the Number of People increaſing, will occaſion an increaſing Demand of more Foreign Goods in the Whole.</p>
            <p>Thus we have ſeen ſome of the many heavy Diſadvantages a Country (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſuch a Country as ours) muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, when it has not a ſufficient Stock of running Caſh to manage its
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003165_0011_0ff085fd03d57200"/>
Trade currently. And we have likewiſe ſeen ſome of the Advantages which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue from having Money ſufficient, or a Plentiful Currency.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Paragraphs being well conſidered, we ſhall naturally be led to draw the following Concluſions with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what Perſons will probably be for or againſt Emitting a large Additional Sum of Paper Bills in this Province.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Since Men will always be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully influenced in their Opinions and Actions by what appears to be their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſt: Therefore all thoſe, who wanting Courage to venture in Trade, now practiſe Lending Money on Security for exorbitant Intereſt, which in a Scarcity of Money will be done notwithſtanding the Law, I ſay all ſuch will probably be againſt a large Addition to our preſent Stock of Paper-Money; becauſe a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Currency will lower Intereſt, and make it common to lend on leſs Security.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All thoſe who are Poſſeſſors of large Sums of Money, and are diſpoſed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Land, which is attended with a great and ſure Advantage in a growing Country as this is; I ſay, the Intereſt of all ſuch Men will encline them to oppoſe a large
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003165_0012_0ff085ff2523c060"/>
Addition to our Money. Becauſe their Wealth is now continually increaſing by the large Intereſt they receive, which will enable them (if they can keep Land from riſing) to purchaſe More ſome time hence than they can at preſent; and in the mean time all Trade being diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, not only thoſe who borrow of them, but the Common People in general will be impoveriſhed, and conſequently obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſell More Land for leſs Money than they will do at preſent. And yet, after ſuch Men are poſſeſſed of as much Land as they can purchaſe, it will then be their Intereſt to have Money made Plentiful, becauſe that will immediately make Land riſe in Value in <hi>their</hi> Hands. Now it ought not to be wonder'd at, if Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Knowledge of a Man's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt do ſometimes make a true Gueſs at his Deſigns; for, <hi>Intereſt,</hi> they ſay, <hi>will not Lie.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Lawyers, and others concerned in Court Buſineſs, will probably many of them be againſt a plentiful Currency; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe People in that Caſe will have leſs Occaſion to run in Debt, and conſequently leſs Occaſion to go to Law and Sue one another for their Debts. Tho' I know

ſome even among theſe Gentlemen, that regard the Publick Good before their own apparent private Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All thoſe who are any way Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants on ſuch Perſons as are above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, whether as holding Offices, as Tenants, or as Debtors, muſt at leaſt <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> to be againſt a large Addition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they do not, they muſt ſenſibly feel their preſent Intereſt hurt. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there are, doubtleſs, many well-meaning Gentlemen and Others, who, without any immediate private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their own in View, are againſt making ſuch an Addition, thro' an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they may have of the Honeſty and ſound Judgment of ſome of their Friends that oppoſe it, (perhaps for the Ends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) without having given it any thorough Conſiderarion themſelves. And thus it is no Wonder if there is a <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Party on that Side.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, Thoſe who are Lovers of Trade, and delight to ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures encouraged, will be for having a large Addition to our Currency: For they very well know, that People will have little Heart to advance Money in Trade, when what they can get is ſcarce
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003165_0014_0ff0860659891fe8"/>
ſufficient to purchaſe Neceſſaries, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Families with Proviſion. Much leſs will they lay it out in advancing new Manufactures; nor is it poſſible new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures ſhould turn to any Account, where there is not Money to pay the Workmen, who are diſcouraged by being paid in Goods, becauſe it is a great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to them.</p>
            <p>Again, Thoſe who are truly for the Proprietor's Intereſt (and have no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Views of their own that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant) will be heartily for a large Addition: Becauſe, as I have ſhewn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, Plenty of Money will for ſeveral Reaſons make Land riſe in Value exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: And I appeal to thoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned for the Proprietor in the Sale of his Lands, whether Land has not riſen very much ſince the firſt Emiſſion of what Paper Currency we now have, and even by its Means. Now we all know the Proprietary has great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſell.</p>
            <p>And ſince a Plentiful Currency will be ſo great a Cauſe of advancing this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in Trade and Riches, and increaſing the Number of its People; which, tho' it will not ſenſibly leſſen the Inhabitants of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003165_0015_0ff08609613ce170"/>
               <hi>Great Britain,</hi> will occaſion a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vent and Demand for their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities here; and allowing that the Crown is the more powerful for its Subjects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in Wealth and Number, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to oppoſe us in making as great a Sum of Paper Money here, as we, who are the beſt Judges of our own Neceſſities, find convenient. And if I were not ſenſible that the Gentlemen of Trade in <hi>England,</hi> to whom we have already parted with our Silver and Gold, are miſinformed of our Circumſtances, and therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have our Currency ſtinted to what it now is, I ſhould think the Government at Home had ſome Reaſons for diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging and impoveriſhing this Province, which we are not acquainted with.</p>
            <p>It remains now that we enquire, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a large Addition to our Paper Curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will not make it ſink in Value very much</hi>; And here it will be requiſite that we firſt form juſt Notions of the Nature and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Money in general.</p>
            <p>As Providence has ſo ordered it, that not only different Countries, but even different Parts of the ſame Country, have their peculiar moſt ſuitable Productions;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003165_0016_0ff0860c10dd2f38"/>
and likewiſe that different Men have Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's adapted to Variety of different Arts and Manufactures, Therefore <hi>Commerce,</hi> or the Exchange of one Commodity or Manufacture for another, is highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and beneficial to Mankind. As for Inſtance, <hi>A</hi> may be skilful in the Art of making Cloth, and <hi>B</hi> underſtand the raiſing of Corn; <hi>A</hi> wants Corn, and <hi>B</hi> Cloth; upon which they make an Exchange with each other for as much as each has Occaſion, to the mutual Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Satisfaction of both.</p>
            <p>But as it would be very tedious, if there were no other Way of general Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but by an immediate Exchange of Commodities; becauſe a Man that had Corn to diſpoſe of, and wanted Cloth for it, might perhaps in his Search for a Chapman to deal with, meet with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty People that had Cloth to diſpoſe of, but wanted no Corn; and with twenty others that wanted his Corn, but had no Cloth to ſuit him with. To remedy ſuch Inconveniences, and facilitate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, Men have invented MONEY, properly called a <hi>Medium of Exchange,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through or by its Means Labour is exchanged for Labour, or one Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003165_0017_0ff0860e860e81b0"/>
for another. And whatever particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Thing Men have agreed to make this Medium of, whether Gold, Silver, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or Tobacco; it is, to thoſe who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it (if they want any Thing) that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing which they want, becauſe it will immediately procure it for them. It is Cloth to him that wants Cloth, and Corn to thoſe that want Corn; and ſo of all other Neceſſaries, it <hi>is</hi> whatſoever it will procure. Thus he who had Corn to diſpoſe of, and wanted to purchaſe Cloth with it, might ſell his Corn for its Value in this general Medium, to one who wanted Corn but had no Cloth; and with this Medium he might purchaſe Cloth of him that wanted no Corn, but perhaps ſome other Thing, as Iron it may be, which this Medium will immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and ſo he may be ſaid to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed his Cloth for Iron; and thus the general Exchange is ſoon performed, to the Satisfaction of all Parties, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Facility.</p>
            <p>For many Ages, thoſe Parts of the World which are engaged in Commerce, have fixed upon Gold and Silver as the chief and moſt proper Materials for this Medium; they being in themſelves va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003165_0018_0ff086131115a458"/>
Metals for their Fineneſs, Beauty, and Scarcity. By theſe, particularly by Silver, it has been uſual to value all Things elſe: But as Silver it ſelf is of no certain permanent Value, being worth more or leſs according to its Scarcity or Plenty, therefore it ſeems requiſite to fix upon Something elſe, more proper to be made a <hi>Meaſure of Values,</hi> and this I take to be <hi>Labour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Labour may the Value of Silver be meaſured as well as other Things. As, Suppoſe one Man employed to raiſe Corn, while another is digging and refining Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; at the Year's End, or at any other Period of Time, the compleat Produce of Corn, and that of Silver, are the natural Price of each other; and if one be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Buſhels, and the other twenty Ounces, then an Ounce of that Silver is worth the Labour of raiſing a Buſhel of that Corn. Now if by the Diſcovery of ſome near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, more eaſy or plentiful Mines, a Man may get Forty Ounces of Silver as eaſily as formerly he did Twenty, and the ſame Labour is ſtill required to raiſe Twenty Buſhels of Corn, then Two Ounces of Silver will be worth no more than the ſame Labour of raiſing One Buſhel of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003165_0019_0ff086157057afc8"/>
Corn, and that Buſhel of Corn will be as cheap at two Ounces, as it was before at one; <hi>caeteris paribus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Riches of a Country are to be valued by the Quantity of Labour its Inhabitants are able to purchaſe, and not by the Quantity of Silver and Gold they poſſeſs; which will purchaſe more or leſs Labour, and therefore is more or leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, as is ſaid before, according to its Scarcity or Plenty. As thoſe Metals have grown much more plentiful in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> ſince the Diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> ſo they have ſunk in Value exceedingly; for, to inſtance in <hi>England,</hi> formerly one Penny of Silver was worth a Days La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but now it is hardly worth the ſixth Part of a Days Labour; becauſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet perhaps <hi>England</hi> is in Effect no richer now than at that Time; becauſe as much Labour might be purchas'd, or Work got done of almoſt any kind, for 100 <hi>l.</hi> then, as will now require or is now worth 600 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003165_0020_0ff086170d89ba90"/>In the next Place let us conſider the Nature of <hi>Banks</hi> emitting <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> as they are at this Time uſed in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Amſterdam, London</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Places being Seats of vaſt Trade, and the Payment of great Sums being for that Reaſon frequent, <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> are found very convenient in Buſineſs; becauſe a great Sum is more eaſily counted in Them, lighter in Carriage, concealed in leſs Room, and therefore ſafer in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling or Laying up, and on many other Accounts they are very much valued. The Banks are the general Caſhiers of all Gentlemen, Merchants and great Traders in and about thoſe Cities; there they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite their Money, and may take out Bills to the Value, for which they can be certain to have Money again at the Bank at any Time: This gives the Bills a Credit; ſo that in <hi>England</hi> they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leſs valuable than Money, and in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi> they are generally worth more. And the Bankers always reſerving Money in hand to anſwer more than the common Run of Demands (and ſome People conſtantly putting in while others are taking out) are able beſides to lend large Sums, on good Security, to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003165_0021_0ff0861ab855e7d0"/>
the Government or others, for a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Intereſt, by which they are paid for their Care and Trouble; and the Money which otherwiſe would have lain dead in their Hands, is made to circulate again thereby among the People: And thus the Running Caſh of the Nation is as it were doubled; for all great Payments being made in Bills, Money in lower Trade becomes much more plentiful: And this is an exceeding great Advantage to a Trading Country, that is not over-ſtock'd with Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>As thoſe who take Bills out of the Banks in <hi>Europe,</hi> put in Money for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; ſo here, and in ſome of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Provinces, we engage our Land. Which of theſe Methods will moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſecure the Bills from actually ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Value, comes next to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Trade in general being nothing elſe but the Exchange of Labour for Labour, the Value of all Things is, as I have ſaid before, moſt juſtly meaſured by Labour. Now ſuppoſe I put my Money into a Bank, and take out a Bill for the Value; if this Bill at the Time of my receiving it, would purchaſe me the Labour of one
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003165_0022_0ff0861c51a7ca68"/>
hundred Men for twenty Days; but ſome time after will only purchaſe the Labour of the ſame Number of Men for fifteen Days; it is plain the Bill has ſunk in Value one fourth Part. Now Silver and Gold being of no permanent Value; and as this Bill is founded on Money, and therefore to be eſteemed as ſuch, it may be that the Occaſion of this Fall is the increaſing Plenty of Gold and Silver, by which Money is one fourth Part leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than before, and therefore one fourth more is given of it for the ſame Quantity of Labour; and if Land is not become more plentiful by ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate Decreaſe of the People, one fourth Part more of Money is given for the ſame Quantity of Land, whereby it appears that it would have been more profitable to me to have laid that Money out in Land which I put into the Bank, than to place it there and take a Bill for it. And it is certain that the Value of Money has been continually ſinking in <hi>England</hi> for ſeveral Ages paſt, becauſe it has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increaſing in Quantity. But if Bills could be taken out of a Bank in <hi>Europe</hi> on a Land Security, it is probable the Value of ſuch Bills would be more
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003165_0023_0ff0861ed5064748"/>
certain and ſteady, becauſe the Number of Inhabitants continue to be near the ſame in thoſe Countries from Age to Age.</p>
            <p>For as Bills iſſued upon Money Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are Money, ſo Bills iſſued upon Land, are in Effect <hi>Coined Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore (to apply the Above to our own Circumſtances) If Land in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was falling, or any way likely to fall, it would behove the Legiſlature moſt carefully to contrive how to prevent rhe Bills iſſued upon Land from falling with it. But as our People increaſe exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and will be further increaſed, as I have before ſhewn, by the Help of a large Addition to our Currency; and as Land in conſequence is continually riſing, So, in caſe no Bills are emitted but what are upon Land Security, the Money-Acts in every Part punctually enforced and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, the Payments of Principal and Intereſt being duly and ſtrictly required, and the Principal <hi>bona fide</hi> ſunk according to Law, it is abſolutely impoſſible ſuch Bills ſhould ever ſink below their firſt Value, or below the Value of the Land on which they are founded. In ſhort, there is ſo little Danger of their ſinking,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003165_0024_0ff086225604c7a0"/>
that they would certainly riſe as the Land riſes, if they were not emitted in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Manner for preventing it; That is, by providing in the Act <hi>That Payment may be made, either in thoſe Bills, or in any other Bills made current by any Act of the Legiſlature of this Province</hi>; and that the Intereſt, as it is received, may be again emitted in Diſcharge of Publick Debts; whereby circulating it returns again into the Hands of the Borrowers, and becomes Part of their future Payments; and thus as it is likely there will not be any Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty for want of Bills to pay the Office, they are hereby kept from riſing above their firſt Value: For elſe, ſuppoſing there ſhould be emitted upon mortgaged Land its full preſent Value in Bills; as in the Banks in <hi>Europe</hi> the full Value of the Money depoſited is given out in Bills; and ſuppoſing the Office would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſame Sum in thoſe Bills in Diſcharge of the Land; as in the Banks aforeſaid, the ſame Sum in their Bills muſt be brought in, in order to receive out the Money: In ſuch Caſe the Bills would moſt ſurely riſe in Value as the Land riſes; as certainly as the Bank Bills founded on Money would fall if that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003165_0025_0ff08623e5416638"/>
was falling. Thus if I were to mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to a Loan-Office, or Bank, a Parcel of Land now valued at 100 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver, and receive for it the like Sum in Bills, to be paid in again at the Expiration of a certain Term of Years; before which, my Land riſing in Value, becomes worth 150 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver: 'Tis plain, that if I have not theſe Bills in Poſſeſſion, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice will take nothing but theſe Bills, or elſe what it is now become worth in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in Diſcharge of my Land; I ſay it appears plain, that thoſe Bills will now be worth 150 <hi>l.</hi> in Silver to the Poſſeſſor; and if I can purchaſe them for leſs, in order to redeem my Land, I ſhall by ſo much be a Gainer.</p>
            <p>I need not ſay any Thing to convince the Judicious that our Bills have not yet ſunk, tho' there is and has been ſome Difference between them and Silver; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is evident that that Difference is occaſioned by the Scarcity of the latter, which is now become a Merchandize, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and falling, like other Commodities, as there is a greater or leſs Demand for it, or as it is more or leſs Plenty.</p>
            <p>Yet farther, in order to make a true Eſtimate of the Value of Money, we muſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003165_0026_0ff0862adc15aab0"/>
diſtinguiſh between Money as it is Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which is Merchandize, and as by being coin'd it is made a Currency: For its Value as a Merchandize, and its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue as a Currency, are two diſtinct Things; and each may poſſibly riſe and fall in ſome Degree independent of the other. Thus if the Quantity of Bullion increaſes in a Country, it will proportionably decreaſe in Value; but if at the ſame Time the Quantity of current Coin ſhould decreaſe, (ſuppoſing Payments may not be made in Bullion) what Coin there is will riſe in Value as a Currency, <hi>i. e.</hi> People will give more Labour in Manufactures for a certain Sum of ready Money.</p>
            <p>In the ſame Manner muſt we conſider a <hi>Paper Currency</hi> founded on Land; as it is Land, and as it is a Currency</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Money as Bullion, or as Land, is valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by ſo much Labour as it coſts to procure that Bullion or Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Money, as a Currency, has an Additional Value by ſo much Time and Labour as it ſaves in the Exchange of Commodities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If, as a Currency, it ſaves one Fourth Part of the Time and Labour of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; it has, on that Account, one Fourth added to its original Value.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:003165_0027_0ff0862c65967b78"/>When there is no Money in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, all Commerce muſt be by Exchange. Now if it takes one fourth Part of the Time and Labour of a Country, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or get their Commodities exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; then, in computing their Value, that Labour of Exchanging muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Labour of manufacturing thoſe Commodities: But if that Time or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is ſaved by introducing Money ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, then the additional Value on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Labour of Exchanging may be abated, and Things ſold for only the Value of the Labour in making them; becauſe the People may now in the ſame Time make one Fourth more in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Manufactures than they could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>From theſe Conſiderations it may be gathered, that in all the Degrees between having no Money in a Country, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſufficient for the Trade, it will riſe and fall in Value as a Currency, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Decreaſe or Increaſe of its Quantity: And if there may be at ſome Time more than enough, the Overplus will have no Effect towards making the Currency, as a Currency, of leſs Value than when there was but enough; becauſe
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003165_0028_0ff0862f11908178"/>
ſuch Overplus will not be uſed in Trade, but be ſome other way diſpoſed of.</p>
            <p>If we enquire. <hi>How much</hi> per Cent. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ought to be required upon the Loan of theſe Bills</hi>; we muſt conſider what is the Natural Standard of Uſury: And this appears to be, where the Security is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, at leaſt the Rent of ſo much Land as the Money lent will buy: For it cannot be expected that any Man will lend his Money for leſs than it would fetch him in as Rent if he laid it out in Land, which is the moſt ſecure Property in the World. But if the Security is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, then a kind of Enſurance muſt be enterwoven with the ſimple natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which may advance the Uſury ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſcionably to any height below the Principal it ſelf. Now among us, if the Value of Land is twenty Years Purchaſe, Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> is the juſt Rate of Intereſt for Money lent on undoubted Security. Yet if Money grows ſcarce in a Country, it becomes more difficult for People to make punctual Payments of what they borrow, Money being hard to be raiſed; likewiſe Trade being diſcouraged, and Buſineſs impeded for want of a Currency, abundance of People muſt be in declining
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003165_0029_0ff07db78bd816d8"/>
Circumſtances, and by theſe Means Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is more precarious than where Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is plenty. On ſuch Accounts it is no wonder if People ask a greater Intereſt for their Money than the natural Intereſt; and what is above is to be look'd upon as a kind of <hi>Praemium</hi> for the Enſurance of thoſe Uncertainties, as they are greater or leſs. Thus we always ſee, that where Money is ſcarce, Intereſt is high, and low where it is plenty. Now it is certainly the Advantage of a Country to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as low as poſſible, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn; and this can be done no other way than by making Money plentiful. And ſince, in Emitting Paper Money a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, the Office has the beſt of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Titles to the Land being all skilfully and ſtrictly examined and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and as it is only permitting the People by Law to coin their own Land, which coſts the Government nothing, the Intereſt being more than enough to pay the Charges of Printing, Officers Fees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot ſee any good Reaſon why Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the Loan-Office ſhould not be thought fully ſufficient. As a low In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt may incline more to take Money out, it will become more plentiful in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003165_0030_0ff0863933033828"/>
Trade; and this may bring down the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſury, in which Security is more dubious, to the Pitch it is determined at by Law.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be objected, <hi>That Emitting It at ſo low an Intereſt, and on ſuch eaſy Terms, will occaſion more to be taken out than the Trade of the Country really requires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It may be anſwered, That, as has already been ſhewn, there can never be ſo much of it emitted as to make it fall below the Land it is founded on; becauſe no Man in his Senſes will mortgage his Eſtate for what is of no more Value to him than That he has mortgaged, eſpecially if the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what he receives is more precarious than of what he mortgages, as that of Paper Money is when compared to Land: And if it ſhould ever become ſo plenty by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Perſons continuing to take out a large Overplus, above what is neceſſary in Trade, ſo as to make People imagine it would become by that Means of leſs Value than their mortgaged Lands, they would immediately of Courſe begin to pay it in again to the Office to redeem their Land, and continue to do ſo till there was no more left in Trade than was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary. And thus the Proportion
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003165_0031_0ff0863acffdd770"/>
would find it ſelf, (tho' there were a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion too much in the Office to be let out) without giving any one the Trouble of Calculation.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be objected to what I have written concerning the Advantages of a large Addition to our Currency, <hi>That if the People of this Province increaſe, and Husbandry is more followed, we ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock the Markets with our Produce of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> &amp;c. To this it may be anſwered, that we can never have too many People (nor too much Money) For when one Branch of Trade or Buſineſs is overſtocked with Hands, there are the more to ſpare to be employed in another. So if raiſing Wheat proves dull, more may (if there is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſupport and carry on new Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures) proceed to the raiſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing of <hi>Hemp, Silk, Iron,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Things the Country is very ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, for which we only want Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to work, and Money to pay them with.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole it may be obſerved, That it is the higheſt Intereſt of a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Country in general to make Money plentiful; and that it can be a Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to none that have honeſt Deſigns.

It cannot hurt even the Uſurers, tho' it ſhould ſink what they receive as Intereſt; becauſe they will be proportionably more ſecure in what they lend; or they will have an Opportunity of employing their Money to greater Advantage, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as to the Country. Neither can it hurt thoſe Merchants who have great Sums out-ſtanding in Debts in the Country, and ſeem on that Account to have the moſt plauſible Reaſon to fear it; <hi>to wit,</hi> becauſe a large Addition being made to our Currency, will increaſe the Demand of our Exporting Produce, and by that Means raiſe the Price of it, ſo that they will not be able to purchaſe ſo much Bread or Flower with 100 <hi>l.</hi> when they ſhall receive it after ſuch an Addition, as they now can, and may if there is no Addition: I ſay it cannot hurt even ſuch, becauſe they will get in their Debts juſt in exact Proportion ſo much the eaſier and ſooner as the Money becomes plentier; and therefore, conſidering the Intereſt and Trouble ſaved, they will not be Loſers; becauſe it only ſinks in Value as a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, proportionally as it becomes more plenty. It cannot hurt the Intereſt of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as has been ſhewn; and it
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003165_0033_0ff0864283c42c20"/>
will greatly advance the Intereſt of the Proprietor. It will be an Advantage to every induſtrious Tradeſman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe his Buſineſs will be carried on more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Trade be univerſally enlivened by it. And as more Buſineſs in all Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures will be done, by ſo much as the Labour and Time ſpent in Exchange is ſaved, the Country in general will grow ſo much the richer.</p>
            <p>It is nothing to the Purpoſe to object the wretched Fall of the Bills in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> unleſs it might be made evident that their Currency was emitted with the ſame Prudence, and on ſuch good Security as ours is; and it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was not.</p>
            <p>As this Eſſay is wrote and publiſhed in Haſte, and the Subject in it ſelf intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, I hope I ſhall be cenſured with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, if, for want of Time carefully to reviſe what I have written, in ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I ſhould appear to have expreſs'd my ſelf too obſcurely, and in others am lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Objections I did not foreſee. I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deſire to be acquainted with the Truth, and on that Account ſhall think my ſelf obliged to any one, who will
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003165_0034_0ff086464e8a7538"/>
take the Pains to ſhew me, or the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, where I am miſtaken in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, And as we all know there are among us ſeveral Gentlemen of acute Parts and profound Learning, who are very much againſt any Addition to our Money, it were to be wiſhed that they would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Country with their Sentiments on this Head in Print; which, ſupported with Truth and good Reaſoning, may probably be very convincing. And this is to be deſired the rather, becauſe many People knowing the Abilities of thoſe Gentlemen to manage a good Cauſe, are apt to conſtrue their Silence in This, as an Argument of a bad One. Had any Thing of that Kind ever yet appeared, perhaps I ſhould not have given the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick this Trouble: But as thoſe ingenious Gentlemen have not yet (and I doubt never will) think it worth their Concern to enlighten the Minds of their erring Countrymen in this Particular. I think it would be highly commendable in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us, more fully to bend our Minds to the Study of <hi>What is the true Intereſt of PENNSYLVANIA</hi>; whereby we may be enabled, not only to reaſon pertinently with one another;

but, if Occaſion requires, to tranſmit Home ſuch clear Repreſentations, and muſt inevitably convince our Superiors of the Reaſonableneſs and Integrity of our Deſigns.</p>
