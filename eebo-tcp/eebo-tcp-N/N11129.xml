            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE WRITER of the ensuing sheets can, with truth, say more, than the generality of those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who either espouse, or oppose the claim of the BRITISH PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—which is, that HIS political opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been the result of mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rational enquiry.—They have not been influenced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by prejudice, nor, by any interested, or ambitious motives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

To those, who are inclined to doubt HIS sincerity, HE begs leave to recommend a little more <hi>Charity.</hi> To those, who are possessed of greater candor, and who, yet, may be disposed to ask how HE can be sure, that his opinions have not been influenced by prejudice? HE answers, because he remembers the time, when HE had strong prejudices, on the side, HE now opposes.—His change of sentiment (HE firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes) proceeded from the superior force of the arguments, in favour of the American claims.</p>

To imagine, there are not wise and good men, on both sides, must be the effect of a weak head, or a corrupt heart.—HE earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats the candid attention of the judicious and well-meaning, and hopes, that what he has written may be read, with as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, and as sincere a regard to truth, as the importance of the controversy demands.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I resume my pen, in reply to the curious epistle, you have been pleased to favour me with; and can assure you, that, notwithstanding, I am naturally of a grave and phlegmatic disposition, it has been the source of abundant merriment to me. The spirit that breathes throughout is so rancorous, illiberal and imperious: The argumentative part of it so puerile and fallacious: The misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of facts so palpable and flagrant: The criticisms so illiterate, trifling and absurd: The conceits so low, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teril and splenetic, that I will venture to pronounce it one of the most ludicrous performances, which has been exhibited to public view, during all the present controversy.</p>
            <p>You have not even imposed the laborious task of pursuing you through a labyrinth of <hi>subtilty.</hi> You have not had abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity sufficient, however violent your efforts, to try the <hi>depths</hi> of <hi>sophistry;</hi> but have barely skimmed along its <hi>surface.</hi> I should, almost, deem the animadversions, I am going to make, unnecessary, were it not, that, without them, you might exult in a fancied victory, and arrogate to yourself imaginary trophies.</p>
            <p>But while I pass this judgment, it is not my intention to detract from your real merit. Candour obliges me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that you possess every accomplishment of a pol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

writer, which may serve to dazzle and mislead superficial and vulgar minds; a peremptory dictatorial air, a pert vivacity of expression, an inordinate passion for conceit, and a noble disdain of being fettered by the laws of truth. These, Sir, are important qualifications, and these all unite in you, in a very eminent degree.—So that, though you may never expect the plaudit of the judicious and discerning, you may console yourself, with this assurance, that</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"Fools and witlings "will" ev'ry sentence raise,</l>
               <l>"And wonder, with a foolish face of praise.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>You will, no doubt, be pleased, with this further concession, to wit, that there is a striking resemblance between yourself and the renowned hero of the <hi>Dunciad. "Pert dulness"</hi> seems to be the chief characteristic of your genius as well as his. I might point out a variety of circumstances, in which you both agree; but I shall content myself with having given the hint, and leave it to yourself and to your <hi>other</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">If we may judge from the style and turn of thought, you were pleased to be your own admirer in the <hi>card in reply.</hi>
               </note> admirers to prosecute a comparison, which will reflect so high lustre on the object of admiration.</p>
            <p>Having thus, briefly, delivered my sentiments of your performance in general, I shall proceed to a particular examination of it, so far, as may be requisite, towards placing it in that just point of light in which it ought to stand. I flatter myself, I shall find no difficulty in obviating the objections you have produced, against the Full Vindication; and in shewing, that your View of the Controversy between Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain and the Colonies, is not only partial and unjust, but diametrically opposite to the first principles of civil society.—In doing this, I may, occasionally, interweave some strictures on the Congress Canvassed.</p>
            <p>First, then, I observe, you endeavour to bring the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inconsistency upon me, for writing <q>a long and elaborate pamphlet to justify <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t those attempts," im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent as they were in a general sense, <q>might, yet, have a tendency to mislead and prejudice the minds of a few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q> To prevent this, I wrote; and if I have been

instrumental in preserving a single person, from the baneful effects of your insidious efforts, I shall not regret the time I have devoted to that laudable purpose. To confirm, or to add one friend to his country, would afford a more refined and permanent satisfaction to me, than could, possibly, animate the breast of the proudest ministerial <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inion, though elevated to the pinnacle of his wished-for preferment, and basking in the sunshine of court favour, as the despicable wages of his prostitution and servility.</p>
            <p>You tell me, <q>I knew that at the bar of impartial reason and common sense, the conduct of the Congress must be condemned; but was too much interested, too deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, in party-views and party-heats, to bear this with patience. <hi>I</hi> had no remedy (you say) but <hi>artifice, sophistry, misrepresentation, and abuse.</hi> These (you call) my weapons, and these I wield, like an old experienced practitioner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You ask, <q>Is this too heavy a charge? Can you la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> your hand upon your heart, and, upon your honour, plead not guilty?</q>—Yes, Sir, I can do more. I can make a solemn appeal to the tribunal of Heaven, for the rectitude of my intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can affirm, with the most scrupulous regard to truth, that I am of opinion, the conduct of the Congress will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> as the felicity and prosperity of this vast continent are concerned, and that I am perfectly disengaged from party of every kind,</p>
            <p>Here, I expect, you will exclaim with your usual vehemence and indecency;—you are now espousing the cause of a party! It is the most daring impudence and falshood to assert the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary!—I can, by no means, conceive, that an opposition to a small herd of mal-contents, among whom, you have thought proper to rank, and a zealous attachment to the general mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of America can be denominated the effect of a party spirit. You, Sir, and your adherents may be justly deemed a faction, because you compose a small number inimical to the common voice of your country. To determine the truth of this affirmation, it is necessary to take a comprehensive view of all the colonies.</p>
            <p>Thoughout your letter, you seem to consider me, as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who has acted, and is still acting some part in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and execution of public measures. You tacitly represent me as a Delegate, or member of the Committee. Whether this be done with a design to create a suspicion of my sincerity, or whether it be really your opinion, I know not. Perhaps it
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014096_0007_0F92DCDE17C57EB8"/>
is from a complex motive. But I can assure you, if you are in earnest, that you are entirely mistaken. I have taken no other part in the affair, than that of defending the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Congress, in conversation, and by the pamphlet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lately published. I approved of them, and thought an undeviating compliance with them essential to the preservation of American freedom. I shall, therefore, strenuously exert myself for the promotion of that valuable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd.</p>
            <p>In the field of literary contention, it is common to see the epithets <hi>artifice, sophistry, misrepresentation</hi> and <hi>abuse,</hi> mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bandied about. Whether they are more justly applicable to you, or me, the public must decide. With respect to abuse, I make not the least doubt, but every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your envenomed pen has endeavoured to sully the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our continental representatives, with the presumptuous charges of ignorance, knavery, sedition, rebellion, treason and tyranny;—a tremendous catalogue indeed!

            <p>These things being considered, it is manifest, that, in my answer to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I congratulate myself upon the sentiments, you entertain of my last performance. Such is my opinion of your abilities as a critic, that I very much prefer your disapprobation to your applause. But, with respect to the <hi>brilliancy</hi> of thought you speak of, give me leave to inform you, that I aimed at nothing more, than justness of thought. I addressed myself to the judgment, not to the imagination. In works, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

No wonder, then, if you have excelled me in this particular; since your plan is so much more fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014096_0008_0F92DCDF047D71D0"/>I shall, for the present, pass over to that part of your pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, in which you endeavour to establish the supremacy of the British Parliament over America. After a proper eclair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissement of this point, I shall draw such inferences, as will sap the foundation of every thing you have offered.</p>
            <p>The first thing that presents itself is a wish, that <q>
                  <hi>I</hi> had, explicitly, declared to the public my ideas of the <hi>natural rights</hi> of mankind. Man, in a state of nature (you say) may be considered, as perfectly free from all restraints of <hi>law</hi> and <hi>government,</hi> and, then, the weak must submit to the strong.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall, henceforth, begin to make some allowance for that enmity, you have discovered to the <hi>natural rights</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. For, though ignorance of them in this enlightened age cannot be admitted, as a sufficient excuse for you; yet, it ought, in some measure, to extenuate your guilt. If you will follow my advice, there still may be hopes of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Apply yourself, without delay, to the study of the law of nature. I would recommend to your perusal, Grotius, Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>endorf, Locke, Montesquieu, and Burlemaqui. I might mention other excellent writers on this subject; but if you attend, diligently, to these, you will not require any others.</p>
            <p>There is so strong a similitude between your political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and those maintained by Mr. Hobbs, that, in judging from them, a person might very easily <hi>mistake</hi> you for a disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his. His opinion was, exactly, coincident with yours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elative to man in a state of nature. He held, as you do, that he was, then, perfectly free from all restraint of <hi>law</hi> and <hi>government.</hi> Moral obligation, according to him, is derived from the introduction of civil society; and there is no virtue, but what is purely artificial,—the mere contrivance of politicians, for the maintenance of social intercourse. But the reason he run into this absurd and impious doctrine, was, that he disbelieved the existence of an intelligent superintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle, who is the governor, and will be the final judge of the universe.</p>
            <p>As you, sometimes, swear <hi>by him that made you,</hi> I conclude, your sentiment does not correspond with his, in that which is the basis of the doctrine, you both agree in; and this makes it impossible to imagine whence this congruity between you arises. To grant, that there is a supreme intelligence, who rules the world, and has established laws to regulate the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his creatures; and, still, to assert, that man, in a

            <p>Good and wise men, in all ages, have embraced a very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similar theory.

            <p>This is what is called the law of nature, <q>which, being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is, of cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

No human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid, derive all their authority, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or immediately, from this original.</q> BLACKSTO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon this law, depend the natural rights of mankind, the supreme being gave existence to man, together with the means of preserving and beatifying that existence. He endowed him with rational faculties, by the help of which, to discern and pursue such things, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hence, in a state of nature, no man had any <hi>moral</hi> power to deprive another of his life, limbs, property or liberty; nor the least authority to command, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To usurp dominion over a a people, in their own despite, or to grasp at a more extensive power than they are willing to entrust, is to violate that law of nature, which gives every man a right to his personal liberty; and can, therefore, confer no obligation to obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The principal aim of society is to protect individuals, in the enjoyment of those absolute rights, which were vested in them by the immutable laws of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014096_0010_0F92DCE077D3FE00"/>
and primary end of human laws, is to maintain and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late these <hi>absolute rights</hi> of individuals.</q> BLACKSTONE.</p>
            <p>If we examine the pretensions of parliament, by this crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, which is evidently, a good one, we shall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their injustice. First, they are subversive of our natural liberty, because an authority is assumed over us, which we by no means assent to. And secondly, they divest us of that moral security, for our lives and properties, which we are intitled to, and which it is the primary end of society to bestow. For such security can never exist, while we have no part in making the laws, that are to bind us; and while it may be the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of our uncontroled legislators to oppress us as much as possible.</p>
            <p>To deny these principles will be not less absurd, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the plainest axioms: I shall not, therefore, attempt any further illustration of them.</p>
            <p>You say, <q>when I assert, that since Americans have not, by any act of theirs, impowered the British parliament to make laws for them, it follows they can have no just autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to do it, I advance a position subversive of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which all colonies must, from their very nature, have on the mother country.</q> The premises from which I drew this conclusion, are indisputable. You have not detected any fallacy in them; but endeavor to overthrow them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a false and imaginary consequence. My principles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the only dependence which can subsist, consistent with any idea of civil liberty, or with the future welfare of the British empire, as will appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>"The dependence of the colonies, on the mother country," (you assert) <q>has ever been acknowledged.

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014096_0011_0F92DCE298FE8B58"/>In what sense, the dependance of the colonies on the mother country, has been acknowledged, will appear from those circumstances of their political history, which I shall, by and by, recite. The term colony signifies nothing more, than a body of people drawn from the mother country, to inhabit some distant place, or the country it self to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited. As to the degrees and modifications of that subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, which is due to the parent state, these must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon other things, besides the mere act of emigration, to inhabit or settle a distant country. These must be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the spirit of the constitution of the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by the compacts for the purpose of colonizing, and, more especially, by the law of nature, and that <hi>supreme law</hi> of every society—<hi>its own happiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The idea of colony does not involve the idea of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There is a wide difference, between the dependence of a free people, and the submission of slav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. The former I allow, the latter I reject with disdain. Nor does the notion of a colony imply any subordination to our fellow subjects, in the parent state, while there is one common sovereign established. The dependence of the colonies, on Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is an ambiguous and equivocal phrase. It may, either mean dependence on the people of Great-Britain, or on the King. In the former sense, it is absurd and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: In the latter it is just and rational. No person will affirm, that a French colony is independent, on the parent state, though it acknowledge the King of France as rightful sovereign. Nor can it, with any greater propriety, be said, that an English colony is independent, while it bears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to the King of Great-Britain. The difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their dependence, is only that which distinguishes civil liberty from slavery; and results from the different genius of the French and English constitution.</p>
            <p>But you deny, that <q>we can be liege subjects to the King of Great-Britain, while we disavow the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> You endeavour to prove it thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Congress Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of protection on their part, and the duty of allegiance on ours arise.</p>
            <p>So that, to disclaim the authority of a British Parliament over us, does by no mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s imply the dereliction of our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to British Monarchs. Our compact takes no cognizance of the manner of their accession to the throne. It is sufficient for us, that they are Kings of England.</p>
            <p>The most valid reasons can be assigned for our allegiance to the King of Great-Britain; but not one of the least force or plausibility for our subjection to parliamentary decrees.</p>
            <p>We hold our lands in America by virtue of charters from British Monarchs; and are under no obligations to the lords or commons for them: Our title is similar and equal to that, by which they possess their lands; and the King is the legal foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of both: this is one grand source of our obligation to allegiance.</p>
            <p>Another, and the principal source is, that protection which we have hitherto enjoyed from the Kings of Great-Britain. Nothing is more common than to hear the votaries of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment urge the protection we have received from the mother country, as an argument for submission to its claims. But they entertain erroneous conceptions of the matter; the King himself, being the supreme executive magistrate, is regarded by the constitution, as the supreme protector of the empire. For this purpose, he is the generali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>imo, or first in military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: in him is vested the power of making war and peace, of raising armies, equipping fleets and directing all their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He it is that has defended us from our enemies, and to him alone, we are obliged to render allegiance and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</p>
            <p>The law of nature and the British constitution both confine allegiance to the person of the King; and found it upon the principle of protection. We may see the subject discussed at
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014096_0013_0F92DCE413269680"/>
large in the case of Calvin: The definition given of it by the learned Coke, is this, <q>Legiance is the mutual bond and obligation between the King and his subjects, whereby subjects are called his liege subjects, because they are bound to obey and serve him; and he is called their liege lord, because he is bound to maintain and defend them</q>. Hence it is evident, that while we enjoy the protection of the King, it is incumbent upon us to obey and serve him, without the interposition of parliamentary supremacy.</p>
            <p>The right of parliament to legislate for us cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for upon any reasonable grounds. The constitution of Great Britain is very properly called a limitted monarchy, the people having reserved to themselves a share in the legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, as a check upon the regal authority, to prevent its degenerating into despotism and tyranny. The very aim and intention of the democratical part, or the house of commons, is to secure the rights of the people. Its very being depends upon those rights. Its whole power is derived from them, and must be terminated by them.</p>
            <p>It is the unalienable birth-right of every Englishman, who can be considered as <hi>a free agent</hi> to participate in framing the laws which are to bind him, either as to his life or property. But, as many inconveniences would result from the exercise of this right, in person, it is appointed by the constitution, that he shall delegate it to another. Hence he is to give his vote in the election of some person he chuses to confide in as his representative. This right no power on earth can divest him of. It was enjoyed by his aucestors time immemorial; recognized and established by Magna Charta, and is essential to the existence of the constitution. Abolish this privilege, and the house of commons is annihilated.</p>
            <p>But what was the use and design of this privilege? To se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his life and property from the attacks of exorbitant power. And in what manner is this done? By giving him the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those, who are to have the disposal and regulation of them, and whose interest is in every respect connected with his.</p>
            <p>The representative in this case is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These securities, the most powerful that human affairs will admit of, have the people of Britain, for the good deportment of their representatives towards them. They may have proved, at some times, and on some occasions, defective; but, upon the whole, they have been found suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
            <p>When we ascribe to the British house of commons a juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the colonies, the scene is entirely reversed. All these kinds of security immediately disappear; no ties of gratitude or interest remain. Interest, indeed, may ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to our prejudice.

            <p>But what merits still more serious atention is this. There seems to be, already, a jealousy of our dawning splendour. It is looked upon as portentous of aproaching independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. This we have reason to believe is one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal incitements to the present rigorous and unconstituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal proceedings against us.

fertility of our soil, the variety of our products, the rapidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our population, the industry of our country men and the commodiousness of our ports, naturally lead to a suspicion of independence, and would always have an influence perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us.

            <p>The experience of past ages may inform us, that when the circumstances of a people render them distressed, their rulers generally recur to severe, cruel and oppressive measures. Instead of endeavouring to establish their authority in the <hi>affection</hi> of their subjects, they think t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>One great engine, to effect this in America, would be a large standing army, maintained our of our own pockets to be at the devotion of our oppressors. This would be introduced under pretence of defending us; but in fact to make our bondage and misery complete.</p>

            <p>This will be called too high wrought a picture, aphantom of my own deluded imagination. The highest eulogies will be lavished on the wisdom and justice of the British nation. But deplorable is the condition of that people who have nothing else than the wisdom and justice of another to depend upon.</p>

               <q>Political writers (says a celebrated author <note n="*" place="bottom">HUME, Vol. I.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is therefore a just <hi>political</hi> maxim, that <hi>every man must be supp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sed a knave.</hi> Though, at the same time, it appears somewhat strange, that a maxim should be true in politics, which is false in fact. But to satisfy us on this head, we may consider, that men are generally more honest in a private than in a public capacity; and will go greater lengths to serve a party, than when their own private interest is alone concerned. Honour is a great check upon mankind. But, where a considerable body of men act together, this check is in a great measure removed; since a man is sure to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his own party, for what promotes the common interest, and he soon learns to despise the clamours of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. To this we may add that every court, or senate is determined by the greater number of voices; so that if self-interest influences only the majority, (as it will always do) the whole senate follows the allurements of this separate interest, and acts as if it contained not one member, who had any regard to public interest and liberty.</q> What ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional force do these observations acquire, when applied to the dominion of one community over another!</p>
            <p>From what has been said. It is plain, that we are without those checks, upon the representatives of Great-Britain, which alone can make them answer the end of their appointment, with respect to us; which is the preservation of the rights, and the advancement of the happiness of the governed. The direct and inevitable consequence is, <hi>they have no right to govern us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us examine it in another light. The house of Commons receives all its authority from its electors, in consequence of the right they have to a share in the legi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ature: Its electors are freeholders, citizens and others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Great-Britain. It follows therefore, that all its authority is confined to Great-Britain. This is demonstrative. Sophistry, by an artful play of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous terms, may perplex and obscure it; but reason can never confute it. The power, which one society bestows upon any man or body of men, can never extend beyond its own
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014096_0017_0F92DCE7DD4CE290"/>
limits. The people of Great-Britain may confer an authority over themselves; but they can never confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any over the people of America. Because, it is impossible for them to give <hi>that</hi> to another, which they never possessed themselves. Now, I should be glad to see an attempt to prove, that a freeholder, citizen, or any other man in Great-Britain has any inhere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r right to the life, property, or liberty of a freeholder, citizen, or any other man in America. He can have no original and intrinsic right, because nature has distributed an equality of rights to every man: He can have no secondary, or derivative right, because the only thing which could give him that is wanting, the content of the natural proprietor.—It is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon you to demonstrate the existence of such a right, or any thing else you may produce will be of little avail. I do not expect you will be discouraged at the apparent difficulty. It is the peculiar province of an enterprizing genius to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the greatest obstacles, and you have discovered an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable dexterity in this way.—You have put to flight some of my best arguments, with no greater pains, than a few posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive assertions, and as many paltry witti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>idence, <hi>you know the case to be as I state it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I say, that the authority of parliament is confined to Great-Britain, I speak of it, in its primitive and original state. Parliament may acquire an incidental influence over others; but this must be by their own free consent. For without this, any power it might exercise, would be mere usurpation, and by no means a just authority.</p>
            <p>The best way of determining disputes, and of investigating truth, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y descending to elementary principles. Any other method may only bewilder and misguide the understanding; but this will soon lead to a convincing and satisfactory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. By observing this method, we shall learn the following truths.</p>
            <p>That the existence of the house of commons depends upon the people's right to a share in the legislature; which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, by means of electing the members of that house. That the end and intention of this right is, to preserve the life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and liberty of the subject, from the encroachments of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and tyranny.</p>
            <p>That this end is accomplished, by means of the <hi>intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> of interest, between those members and their constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the people of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>That with respect to the people of America, there is no such <hi>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; but the contrary. And therefore
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014096_0018_0F92DCE8A248AC20"/>
that end could not be answered to them; consequently the <hi>end</hi> ceasing, the <hi>means</hi> must cease also.</p>
            <p>That the house of commons derives all its power, from its own real constituents, who are the people of Great-Britain, and that therefore, it has no power, but what they <hi>originally</hi> had in themselves.</p>
            <p>That they had no original right to the life, property, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Americans; nor any acquired from their own consent, and of course could give no authority over them.</p>
            <p>That, therefore, the house of commons has no such authority.</p>
            <p>What need is there of a multiplicity of arguments, or a long chain of reasoning to inculcate these luminous principles? They speak the plainest language to every man of common sense; and must carry conviction where the mental eye is not bedimmed, by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e mist of prejudice, partiality, ambition, or avarice. Let us now see what has been offered in opposition to them.</p>
            <p>But, by the way, let me remark, that I have levelled my battery chiefly against the authority of the house of commons, over America; because, if that be proved not to exist, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is at an end. The efficacy of acts of parliament depends, upon the due authority of the respective branches, to bind the different orders and ranks of the nation.</p>
            <p>It is said, that <q>in every government, there must be a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme absolute authority lodged some where. In arbitrary governments, this power is in the monarch. In aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical governments, in the nobles. In demo cratical, in the people, or the deputies of their electing. Our own govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a mixture of all these kinds, the supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is vested in the king, nobles and people; i.e. the king, house of lords and house of commons, <hi>elected by the people.</hi> This supreme authority extends as far as the British domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions extend To suppose a part of the British dominions which is not subject to the power of the British legislature, is not better sense, than to suppose a country, at one and the same time, to be and not to be a part of the British domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. If therefore the colony of New-York is a part of the British dominions, the colony of New-York, is subject, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on the supreme legislative authority of Great-Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This argument is the most sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In order to this, there must indeed be some connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pervading principle; but this is sound in the person and prerogative of the King.

The part which the people have in the legislature, may more justly be considered as a limitation of the Sovereign authority, to prevent its being exercised in an oppressive and despotic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Monarchy is universally allowed to predominate in the constitution. In this view, there is not the least absurdity in the supposition that Americans have a right to a limitation.

similar to that of the people of Great-Britain. At any rate, there can never be said to be two sovereign powers, in the same state; while <hi>one common king</hi> is acknowledged, by every member of it.</p>

There is not the least contradiction in this, no <hi>imperium</hi> in <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio,</hi> as is maintained; for the power of every distinct branch will be limited to itself, and the authority of his Majesty over the whole, will, like a central force, attract them all to the same point.</p>
            <p>The second part of your paragraph is this, <q>In arbitrary governments, this (supreme absolute) power is in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; in aristocratical governments, in the nobles; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical, in the people, or the deputies of their electing.

It is not the supreme power being placed in one, instead of many, that discriminates an arbitrary from a free government. When any people are ruled by laws, in framing which, they have no part, that are to bind them, to all intents and purposes, without, in the same manner, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the legislators themselves, they are in the strictest sense slaves, and the government with respect to them, is despotic. Great-Britain is itself a free country; but it is only so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its inhabitants have a share in the legislature: If they were once divested of that, they would cease to be free. So that, if its jurisdiction be extended over other countries that have no actual share in its legislature, it becomes arbitrary to them; because they are destitute of those checks and controuls

which constitute that <hi>moral</hi> security which is the very essence of civil liberty.</p>
            <p>I will go farther, and assert, that the authority of the British Parliament over America, would, in all probability, be a more intolerable and excessive species of despotism than an absolute monarchy.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hume, in enumerating those political maxims, which will be eternally true, speaks thus: <q>It may easily be observed, that though free governments have been commonly the most happy, for those who pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </q> He goes on to give many solid reasons for this, and among other things, observes, that <q>a free state necessarily makes a great distinction (between herself and the provinces) and must continue to do so, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </note> The power of an absolute prince is not temporary, but perpetual. He is under no temptation to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the favour of one part of his dominions, at the expence of another; but, it is his interest to treat them all, upon the same footing. Very different is the case with regard to the Parliament: The Lords and Commons both, have a private and separate interest to pursue. They must be, wonderfully, disinterested, if they would not make us bear a very dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional part of the public burthens, to avoid them as much as possible themselves. The people of Britain must, <hi>in reality,</hi> be an order of superior beings, not cast in the same mould, with the common degenerate race of mortals, if the sacrifice of our interest and ease to theirs be not, extremely, welcome and alluring. But should experience teach us, that they are only mere mortals, fonder of themselves than their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the philanthropy and integrity of their representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives will be of a transcendent and matchless nature, should they not gratify the natural propensities of their constituents, in order to ingratiate themselves, and enhance their popularity.</p>
            <p>When you say, that "our government being a mixture of all these kinds, the supreme authority is vested in the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nobles, and <hi>People,</hi> that is, the King, House of Lords, and House of Commons, <hi>elected by the people,</hi> you speak unintelligibly.

            </p>
            <p>This argument will be as good, as the one, I am next going to examine.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This supreme authority (you say) extends as far as the <hi>British</hi> dominions extend. To suppose a part of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> dominions, which is not subject to the power of the British legislature, is no better sense, than to suppose a country, at one and the same time, to be and not to be a part of the <hi>British</hi> dominions. If, therefore, the colony of New-York be a part of the <hi>British</hi> dominions, the colony of New-York is subject and dependent on the supreme legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority of Great-Britain.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By "this supreme authority" I suppose you mean the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Great-Britain. I deny that it extends as far as the <hi>British</hi> dominions extend, and I have given many substantial reasons for this denial, whereas you have never offered any to prove that is does. You have begged the question, and taken
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014096_0023_0F92DCEDBA679960"/>
that for granted, which is the very point in debate. As to your general position that there must be a supreme, absolute authority lodged somewhere, I have explained, in what sense, it ought to be understood; and shewn, that the several parts of the empire, may each enjoy a separate, independent legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with regard to each other, under one common head, the King.</p>
            <p>The seeming proof you have subjoined is entirely fallacious; and depends upon the use of the terms <hi>British</hi> dominions, and <hi>British</hi> legislature, in an <hi>equivocal</hi> sense. The former may, either signify countries subject to the <hi>King,</hi> or to the <hi>legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Great-Britain. When we say French dominions, we mean countries subject to the King of France. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when we say British dominions, the most proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is, countries subject to the King of Great-Britain.

            <p>If, by the British legislature, you mean nothing more, than the Parliament of Great-Britain, it is well; but if you affix a different idea to it, you are not <hi>arbitrarily</hi> to impose it upon others. If there be any <hi>chimera</hi> in your fond imagination, which you express by that term, you must allow others the liberty to think it such. In short, if by the term, you mean an authority resident in one part of his Majesty's dominions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make laws for every other part of them; you ought not to apply it in this sense, 'till you have proved, that such an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority does really exist; especially in a controversy about that very matter.</p>
            <p>By the British dominions, I mean the countries subject to his Britannic Majesty, in his royal capacity. But the British legislature, I will suppose you intend, simply the Parliament of Great-Britain. Let us now try whether "to suppose there may be a part of his British Majesty's dominions, which is not subject to the parliament, be no better sense, than to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a country, at one and the same time to be and not to be, a part of the British dominions. It is impossible for any thing <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>not to be;</hi> but it involves no contradictions to say, that a country may be in subjection to his Britannic Majesty, and in that sense, a part of the British dominions, without
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014096_0024_0F92DCEDF3B2F470"/>
being, at all, dependent on the parliament of Great-Britain.<note n="†" place="bottom">I doubt not, you will here be disposed to cavil, by urging, that if we deny the authority of parliament, we also reject his British Majesty; since he composes a part of it; but let it be considered, that the Parliament, as such, is a political institution, not a <hi>physical</hi> being. We may deny his Majesty, in his political capacity, as a part of the legislature of Great-Britain, and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him in a similar political capacity, as a part of the legislature of New-York. This is an obvious distinction, and cannot be contested without an aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon the whole, if, by the British dominions, you mean territories subject to the Parliament, you adhere to your usual fallacy, and suppose what you are bound to prove. I deny, that we are dependent on the legislature of Great-Britain, and yet I maintain, that we are a part of the British Empire; but in this sense only, as being the free-born subjects of his Britannic Majesty.</p>
            <p>Thus have I fully examined that argument, which is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bulwark of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy; and I flatter myself, clearly refuted it. The main pillar being now broken down, the whole structure may easily be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished. I shall therefore proceed with alacrity in the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the work. But it is worthy of observation, that a cause must be extremely weak, which admits of no better supports.</p>
            <p>Your next argument (if it deserves the name) is this, <q>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation is not an inherent right in the colonies, many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have been established and subsisted long without it. The Roman colonies had no legislative authority. It was not 'till the latter period of their republic, that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of Roman citizens, among which, that of voting in Assemblies of the people, at Rome, was a principal one, were extended to the inhabitants of Italy. All the laws of the empire were enacted at Rome. Neither their colonies, nor conquered countries had any thing to do with legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The fundamental source of all your errors, sophisms and false reasonings is a total ignorance of the natural rights of mankind. Were you once to become acquainted with these, you could never entertain a thought, that all men are not, by

nature, entitled to a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rity of privileges. You would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that natural liberty is a gift of the beneficent Creator to the whole human race, and that civil liberty is founded in that; and cannot be wrested from any people, without the most manife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t violation of justice. <hi>Civil liberty, is only natural liberty, modified and secured by the sanctions of civil society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It is not a thing, in its own nature, precarious and dependent on human will and caprice; but is conformable to the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, as well as necessary to the <hi>well-being</hi> of society.</p>
            <p>Upon this principle, colonists as well as other men, have a right to civil liberty: For, if it be conducive to the happiness of society (and reason and experience testify that it is) it is evident, that every society, of whatsoever kind, has an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and perfect right to it, which can never be with-held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cruelty and injustice. The practice<note n="*" place="bottom">If her practice proves any thing, it equally proves, that she had a right to plunder them, as much as possible. This doctrine, I presume, will not be disagreable to some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There are many who would rejoice to see Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica plundered, in a like manner, provided they could be appointed the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> of Rome, towards her colonies, cannot afford the shadow of an argument against this. That mistress of the world was often unjust. And the treatment of her dependent provinces is one of the greatest blemishes in her history. Through the want of that civil li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for which we are now so warmly contending, they groaned under every species of wanton oppression. If we are wise, we shall take warning from thence; and consider a like state of dependence, as more to be dreaded, than pestilence and famine.</p>
            <p>The right of colonists, therefore, to exercise a legislative power, is an inherent right. It is founded upon the right of all men to freedom and happiness. For civil liberty cannot possibly have any existence, where the society, for whom laws are made, have no share in making them; and where the interest of their legislators is not inseparably interwoven with theirs.—Before you asserted, that the right of legislation was derived "from the indulgence or grant of the parent state<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" you should have proved two things, that all men have not a natural right to freedom, and that civil liberty is not advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to society.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The position, (you say) that we are bound by no laws, but those, to which we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, either by ourselves,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014096_0026_0F92DCF1DC4CB488"/>
or by our representatives, is a novel position, unsupported by any authoritative record of the British constitution, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern. It is republican, in its very nature; and tends to the utter subversion of the English monarchy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This position has arisen from an artful change of terms. To say, that an Englishman is not bound by any laws, but those to which the representatives of the nation have given their consent, is to say what is true. But to say, that an Englishman is bound by no laws but those to which he hath consented, in person, or by <hi>his</hi> representative, is saying what never was true, and never can be true. A great part of the people have no vote in the choice of representatives, and, therefore, are governed by laws, to which, they never consented, either by themselves, or by <hi>their</hi> representatives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The foundation of the English constitution rests upon this principle, that no laws have any validity, or binding force, without the consent and approbation of the <hi>people,</hi> given in the persons of <hi>their</hi> representatives, periodically elected by <hi>themselves.</hi> This constitutes the democratical part of the government.</p>
            <p>It is also, und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>niably, certain, that no Englishman, who can be deemed <hi>a free agent</hi> in a <hi>political</hi> view, can be bound by laws, to which he has not consented, either in person, or by <hi>his</hi> representative. Or, in other words, every Englishman (exclusive of the mercantile and trading part of the nation) who possesses a free hold, to the value of forty shillings per annum, has a right to a share in the legislature, which he exercises, by giving his vote in the election of some person, he approves of, as his representative.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The true reason (says Blackstone) of requiring any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, with regard to property in vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers, is to exclude such persons, as are <hi>in so mean a situation,</hi> that they are esteemed to have <hi>no will</hi> of their own. If these persons had votes, they would be tempted to dispose of them, under some undue influence, or other. This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger share in elections, than is consistent with general liberty. If it were probable, that every man would give his vote, freely and without influence of any kind, then, upon the true theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and genuine principles of liberty, every member of the community, however poor, should have a vote, in electing those delegates, to whose charge is committed the disposal of his property, his liberty and life. But since that can
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014096_0027_0F92DCF3F3211C80"/>
hardly be expected, in persons of indigent fortunes, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> such as are under the immediate dominion of others, all popular states have been obliged to establish certain quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, whereby, some who are suspected to have no will of their own, are excluded from voting; in order, to set other individuals, whose wills may be supposed indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, more thoroughly upon a level with each other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears, that such <q>of the people as have no vote in the choice of representatives, and therefore, are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, by laws, to which they have not consented, either by themselves or by their representatives,</q> are only those <q>persons, who are <hi>in so mean a situation,</hi> that they are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have <hi>no will</hi> of their own.</q> Every <hi>free agent,</hi> every free man, possessing a freehold of forty shillings per annum, is, by the British constitution, intitled to a vote, in the election of those who are invested with the disposal of his life, his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and property.</p>
            <p>It is therefore, evident to a demonstration, that unless eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>free agent</hi> in America be permitted to enjoy the same pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, we are entirely stripped of the benefits of the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and precipitated into an abyss of slavery. For, we are deprived of that immunity, which is the grand pillar and support of freedom.—And this cannot be done, without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect violation of the constitution, which decrees, to every <hi>free agent,</hi> a share in the legislature.</p>
            <p>It deserves to be remarked here, that those very persons in Great Britain, who are <hi>in so mean a situation,</hi> as to be excluded from a part in elections, are in more eligible circumstances, than she should be in, who have every necessary qualification.</p>
            <p>They compose a part of that society, to whose government they are subject. They are nourished and maintained by it, and partake in every other emolument, for which they are qualified. They have no doubt, most of them, relations and connexions, among those who are privileged to vote, and by that means, are not entirely without influence, in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their rulers. They are not governed by laws made expressly and exclusively for them; but by the general laws of their country; equally obligatory on the legal electors, and on the law makers themselves. So that they have nearly the same security against oppres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on, which the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have.</p>
            <p>To this we may add, that they are only under a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal prohibition, which industry and good fortune may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. They may, one day, accumulate a sufficient property to enable them to emerge out of their present state. Or,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014096_0028_0F92DCF541C15740"/>
should they die in it, their situation is not entailed upon their posterity, by a fixed and irremediable doom.—They, agreeable to the ordinary vicissitudes of human affairs, may acquire what their parents were deficient in.</p>
            <p>These considerations plainly shew, that the people in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, of all ranks and conditions, opulent as well as indigent (if subjected to the British Parliament) would be upon a less favourable footing, than that part of the people of Britain, who are <hi>in so mean a situation,</hi> that they are supposed to have no will of their own. The injustice of this must be evident to every man of common sense.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to take such a survey of the political history of the colonies, as may be necessary to cast a full light upon their present contest; and at the same time, to give the public a just conception of the profound and comprehensive knowledge you have of the dispute; the fairness and candour with which you have represented facts, and the immaculate p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rity of your intentions.</p>
            <p>But, previous to this, the following observations may not be destitute of utility:</p>
            <p>His Holiness the Pope, by virtue of being Christ's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent upon earth, piously assumed to himself a right to dispose of the territories of infidels, as he thought fit. And, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time, all Christian princes learned to imitate his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, very liberally giving and granting away the dominion and property of Pagan countries. They did not seem to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the title which Christianity gave them to the next world only; but chose to infer from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce, an exclusive right to this world also.</p>
            <p>I must refer it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ounder casuists, than I am, to determine concerning the consistency or justice of this principle. It is sufficient for my purpose to observe, that it is the only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which Queen Elizabeth and her successors under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to dispose of the lands in America. Whatever right, therefore, we may suppose to have existed, it was vested entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the crown: The nation had no co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cern in it. It is an invariable maxim, that every acquisition of foreign territory i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at the absolute disposal of the King; and, unless, he annex it to the realm, it is no part of it. And if it be once alienated, it can never be united to it without the concurrence of the proprietors.</p>
            <p>Were there any room to doubt, that the sole right of the territories in America was vested in the crown, a convincing argument might be drawn from the principle of English <hi>tenure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

By means of the <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>dal</hi> system, the King became, and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be, in a legal sense, the original proprietor, or lord paramount, of all the lands in England.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Blackstone, Volume I.</note>—Agreeable to this rule, he must have been the original proprietor of all the lands in America, and was, therefore, authorized to dispose of them in what manner he thought proper.</p>
            <p>The great enquiry, therefore, is concerning the terms on which these lands were really dispensed.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The first charter, granted by the crown, for the purpose of colonization, is</q> not <q>that of King James the first, to the two Virginia companies,</q> as you assert. Previous to that, there was one from Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raliegh, for all the territory he might discover and plant, between the 33d. And 40th. degrees of North latit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de; which was not actually possessed, by any christian prince, or inhabited by any christian people, to have, hold, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and enjoy the same, to him, his heirs, and assigns for ever, with all <hi>prerogatives, jurisdictions, royalties, privileges, franchises,</hi> thereunto belonging, by sea or land; only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, to herself, her heirs and successors, the fifth part of all gold and silver <hi>ore</hi> that might be acquired in those regions.</p>
            <p>By this grant, Queen Elizabeth relinquished the whole legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, and executive power, to Sir Walter, upon no other condition than simple homage, and the abovementioned fifth part of gold and silver ore; which shews, that the crown con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered itself, as invested with the absolute and entire disposal of the territories in America; and the passive conduct of the nation, declares its acquiescence in the same.</p>
            <p>After many successless efforts to plant a colony in Virginia, this charter was forfeited and abroga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, dated the 10th of April, 1606. This was afterwards altered and improved, by a second charter, issued in 1609. There was also a third, dated March 12, 1611-12. The mention of this last would not have answered your purpose, and therefore, you chose to pass it over in silence.</p>
            <p>In neither of these three, is there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> least reservation made of any authority to parliament. The colonies are considered in them, as entirely without the realm, and consequently, without the jurisdiction of its legislature.</p>
            <p>In the first charter from King James, there are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clauses:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:014096_0030_0F92DCF60DFC9CB8"/>
               <q>We do ordain, establish and agree, &amp;c. that each of the said colonies, shall have a council, which shall govern and order all matters and all causes, which shall arise, grow, or happen to, or within, the same; according to such <hi>lavs, ordinances,</hi> and <hi>instructions,</hi> as shall be in that behalf, given and signed with our hand, or sign manual, and pass under the privy seal of our realm of England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And that also, there shall be a council established here in England, which shall consist of thirteen persons, to be for that purpose appointed; which shall have the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior managing and direction <hi>only</hi> of, and for all matters, that shall, or may concern the government of the said several colonies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Also, we do for us, our heirs, &amp;c. declare, that all and every the persons, being our subjects, which shall dwell and inhabit within every, or any, the said several colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and every of their Children, which shall happen to be born within any of the said several colonies, shall have and enjoy all <hi>liberties, franchises and immunities</hi> within any of our <hi>other</hi> dominions, to all intents and purposes <hi>as if they had been abiding and born within our Realm of England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This latter declaration (to which there is one correspondent or similar, in every American Grant) plainly indica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, that it was not the royal intention to comprize the colonies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the realm of England. The powers committed to the two councils demonstrate the same; for they would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the idea of any other than distinct states.</p>
            <p>The King could neither exercise himself, nor empower others to exercise such an authority, as was really ves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sdiction of parliament. Such an exertion of power would have been unconstitutional and illegal, and, of course, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admissible; but we find it was never called in question, by the legislature, and we may conclude from thence, that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was universally considered, as being without the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of parliament.</p>
            <p>The second charter explains and amplifies the privileges of the company, er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </q> to be held of the King, "his heirs, and successors," in free and common socage. They were only to pay one fifth part of all the gold and silver ore, they might find, in lieu of all <hi>services.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their government was vested in a council, first appointed by the King, which, upon every necessary occasion, was to be summoned together, by the company's treasurer. But immediately after the persons appointed are named in the charter, it is declared, that <q>the said council and treasur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or any of them, shall be henceforth <hi>nominated, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, continued, displaced, changed, altered,</hi> or <hi>supplied,</hi> as death, or other several occasions shall require, <hi>out of</hi> the company of the said adventurers, by the <hi>voice</hi> of the greater part of the said company and adventurers.</q> Every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber newly elected, to be sworn into office, by the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</p>
            <p>This council had <q>full power and authority to make, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and establish all manner of <hi>orders, laws, directions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, forms</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> of government and magistracy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>This charter is also silent with respect to parliament; the authority of which is evidently precluded, by the whole tenor of it.</p>
            <p>You, Sir, took no notice of the circumstance, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouncil was to be <hi>nominated, chosen, continued,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>out of</hi> the Virginia company itself, agreeable to the voice of the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ity. You omitted this, and gave quite a different turn to the matter; but herein you acted not at all discordant with your usual practice.—Nor did you esteem it politic to transcribe the following clause: <q>that the said company, and every of them, their factors and assigns, shall be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, for the handling, ordering, and disposing of the matters and affairs of greater weight and importance, such as shall <hi>in any fort</hi> concern the weal public, and the general good of the said plantation, as namely the <hi>manner of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> from time to time, to be used, the ordering and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the lands and possessions, and the <hi>settling and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of a trade there,</hi> or such like, there shall be held and kept, every year <hi>forever,</hi> one great general and solemn as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By this charter, King James divested himself wholly, both of the legislative and executive authority;—but, for his own security, prescribed a model for their civil constitution. Their laws were not to be <hi>contrary</hi> to the laws and statutes of his realm of England;—which restriction was inserted into all the subsequent charters, with some little variation, such as, that their laws should be <q>consonant to reason, and not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014096_0033_0F92DCF912EC8738"/>
or contrary, but <hi>as near as conveniently may be</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the laws, statutes and rights of this our kingdom of England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This mode of expression, so indefinite in itself, shews that the use made of the clause, by some ministerial advocates, is by no means natural, or warrantable.—It could only be intended to set forth the British constitution, as a pattern for theirs, and accordingly we find, that upon the arrival of Sir George Yard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in Virginia, soon after this patent was procured, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was regulated, upon a new plan, that it might <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the British constitution, composed of two houses of parliament and a sovereign: The number of the council was increased, intending this body should represent the house of lords, while the house of commons was composed of burgesses, assembled from every plantation and settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the country.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There might be a great dissimilarity between the laws of Virginia and those of Great Britain, and yet not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute contrariety; so that the clause in question is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, or determinate enough to authorize the conclusion drawn from it. Besides, if the colonies were within the realm of England, there would be no necessity for any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision in favour of its laws; and if they were without (as is clearly implied by the clause itself) it must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n to suppose its jurisdiction could extend beyond its own limits.</p>
            <p>But the true interpretation may be ascertained, beyond a doubt, by the conduct of those very princes, who granted the charters. They were certainly the best judges of their own intention, and they have left us indubitable marks of it.</p>
            <p>In april 1621, about nine years after the third Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia charter was issued, a bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> was introduced into the house of commons, for indulging the subjects of England, with the privilege of fishing upon the coast of America; but the house was informed by the secretary of sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the reign of his successor Charles the first (who grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Massachusetts and Maryland charters) the same bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <q>it was unnecessary; that the colonies <hi>were without the realm and jurisdiction of parliament.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Circumstances which evidently prove, that these clauses were not inserted to render the colonies dependant on the Parliament; but only (as I have observed) to mark out a model of government, for them. If then, the colonies were, at first <hi>without the realm and jurisdiction of parliame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The settlement of New-England was the next in successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was instigated by a detestation of civil and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical tyranny. The principle design of the enterprize was to be emancipated from their sufferings, under the authority of parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Previous to their embarkation at Holland, they had sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated, with the Virginia company,<note n="†" place="bottom">This was after they had received their 3d. charter</note> for a tract of land, in <hi>contigui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

There the season compelled them to remain, and there they have prosecuted their settlements.</p>
            <p>They looked upon themselves as having reverted to a state of nature; but being willing still to enjoy the protection of their former sovereign, they executed the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</p>

its inhabitants, a few years after, purchased the claim of the patentees, with all their rights and immunities, and became an independent state by charter.</p>

               </gap>ent from the Council at Plymouth, and in a year after, by a charter from King Charles the first, dated the 4th of March, in the 4th year of his reign, by which, the adventurers and inhabitants were formed into <q>one body politic and corporate, by the name of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Company of the Massachusetts-Bay, in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</q> and cloathed with powers and privileges resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling those of the colony of New Plymouth.</p>
            <p>It happened some time before this, that there was a dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Virginia Company, by a royal proclamation, dated 15th of July, 1624, by which the colony became more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dependent on the King. The Virginians were greatly alarmed at this, and forthwith presented a remonstrance to the throne: In which they signified an apprehension of <q>designs formed against their rights and privileges.</q>—In order to banish their fears, the Lords of the Council (in a letter dated the 22d of July, 1634) gave them an assurance, by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's direction, <q>That all their <hi>estates, trade, freedom</hi> and <hi>privileges,</hi> should be enjoyed, by them, in as extensive a manner, as they enjoyed them before the recal of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's patent.</q>—Agreeable to this, their former constitution was confirmed and continued.</p>
            <p>The Maryland charter is the next in order, of which you, Sir, have made no mention.—It was granted by King Charles I. to Lord Baltimore, and contains such ample and exalted privileges, that no man in his senses can read it, without being convinced it is repugnant to every idea of dependence on Parliament.</p>
            <p>It bestows on him <q>all the country of Maryland, and the islands adjacent; together with all their commodities, <hi>jurisdictions, privileges, prerogatives, royal rights,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. of what kinds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I confine myself to these extracts, to avoid prolixity; and pass over the enumeration of those many extensive prerogatives, this charter confers; such as the appointment of all officers, civil and military; the power of making war and peace; the establishment of <hi>boroughs</hi> and <hi>cities,</hi> with all necessary immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and the like.</p>
            <p>In the 14th year of Charles the second, the two colonies, Connecticut and New-Haven, petitioned the King to unite them into one colony, which was complied with. Privileges, as valuable and extensive, as any that had been before granted, were comprized in their charter. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here was only a reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of allegiance to the King, without the smallest share of the legislative or executive power. The next year, Providence and Rhode-Island procured a charter, with privileges exactly correspondent to those of Connecticut.</p>
            <p>You are pleased to assert, "that the charter of Rhode-Island and Connecticut, are simply, matters of incorporation," and produce an extract in confirmation of this assertion.</p>
            <p>I should be astonished at so extraordinary a deviation from truth, if there were not many instances similar to it.—Not
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014096_0038_0F92DCFCCE1ACF30"/>
only, the whole tenor of their charters, but their constant practice and form of government, hitherto, declare the reverse of your assertion. But, that I may not unnecessarily prolong this letter, by a quotation of the different parts of the respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive charters, give me leave to present you with an account of the constitution of these colonies, which was laid before the House of Lords in January, 1734.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Connecticut and Rhode Island (say the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations) are charter governments, where almost the whole power of the crown is delegated to the people, who make annual election of their Assembly, their Councils and their Governors, likewise to the majority of which Assemblies, Councils and Governors, respectively, being collective bodies, the power of making laws is granted; and, as their charters are worded, they can, and do make laws, even without the Governor's assent, no negative voice being reserved to them, as Governors in said charters.—These colonies have the power of making laws, for their better government and support; and are not under any obligation, by their respective constitutions, to return au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic copies of their laws to the crown, for approbation and disallowance; or to give any account of their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor are their laws repealable, by the crown; but the validity of them depends upon their not being contrary, but, <hi>as near as may be,</hi> agreeable to the laws of England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the expression, as <hi>other</hi> our liege people of this our realm of England, or any <hi>other</hi> corporation or body politic within the same,—if any stress be laid upon the particle <hi>other,</hi> it will imply not only, that the colonies were simple mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of corporation; but that the inhabitants of them were considered as being within the realm of England.—But this cannot be admitted as true, without contradicting other clauses of the same charters.—Thus, in the preamble to that of Rhode-Island, it is said, that the first planters <q>did, by the consent of our royal progenitors, transport themselves <hi>out</hi> of this kingdom of England <hi>into</hi> America.</q>—And in each of the charters, the King stipulates, that all the children born in America, shall enjoy <q>all the liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects, within any of his dominions, as <hi>if</hi> they and every of them <hi>were</hi> born within the realm of England.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The vague and improper manner, in which this particle is used, in many other places of the several charters, will not allow it the least weight in the present instance. In the 11th
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014096_0039_0F92DCFDC6DB2850"/>
article of the third Virginia charter, there is this expression: <q>All such, and so many of our loving subjects, or any <hi>other</hi> strangers that will, &amp;c.</q>—The same rule of inference, that makes Rhode-Island and Connecticut simple corporations, will also transform the King's loving subjects into mere stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; which I apprehend cannot be done, without some degree of absurdity.</p>
            <p>In the 15th year of Charles II. Carolina was erected into a principality. A Patent dated March 24, 1663, was granted to eight lord proprietors, vesting them with all its rights, privileges, prerogatives, royalties, &amp;c. and the whole legislative and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive authority, together with the power of creating a nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The form of government was determined, by a compact between the people and the proprietors; which contained one hundred and twenty articles; and, <q>these were to be and and remain the sacred and unalterable rule and form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Carolina, for ever.</q> A Palatine was to be elected, from among the proprietaries, who was to govern the Principality during his life; and, at his demise, the surviving lords were to succeed him according to the order of seniority. The legislative power was to reside in the parliament of that country; consisting of the Palatine as sovereign; and upper House, in which the proprietors or their deputies, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and the Nobility were to sit; and a lower House <hi>composed of the Delegates of the People.</hi> There was likewise a court estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, the members of which were three Proprietaries, and the Palatine, as president; and in this court, the whole executive authority was lodged.</p>
            <p>There were also several other courts; the Chief Justice's, the High Constable's, the Chancellor's, and High Steward's Court. The principal officers of the state, in number, titles and power, resembled those of the realm of England. The proprietors of Carolina considered themselves, as possessed of every requisite, towards forming a separate, independent state; and were always extremely jealous of any encroachments.—They even disputed the King's authority to establish courts of Vice Admiralty, within their precincts; though for the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and punishment of offences, committed without them:—and always appointed an Admiral of their own. One of their Governors was deposed for <q>accepting a commission, under King William, as Judge of the Admiralty, when he had, at the same time, a commission from the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries for the same office.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Philadelphia charter was next granted; and contained
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014096_0040_0F92DCFE4EEA3108"/>
almost an equality of privileges, with that of Maryland.—There was indeed a reserve, in favour of parliament, perfectly singular and unprecedented in any foregoing charter; and which must either be rejected, or the general tenor of the grant becomes unintelligible.</p>
            <p>It happened, that the Charter of Massachusetts was vacated, by a decision in Chancery; and a new one was conferred by <hi>William and Mary.</hi> The agent for that colony, did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, 'till they had first consulted the most judicious civilians and politicians, upon the contents of it; and, then drew up an instrument, in which, they assigned the reasons of their acept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The following extract will serve to shew their sense of it, <q>the colony (say they) is now made a province; and the General Court has, with the King's approbation, as much power, in New-England, as the King and parliament have in England. They have all English privileges and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and can be touched, by <hi>no law,</hi> and by <hi>no tax;</hi> but of their own making. All the liberties of their religion are for ever secured.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You say, that "the power to levy taxes is restrained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and local purposes, only, and to be exercised, over such only, as are inhabitants and proprietors of the said province."</p>
            <p>They are impowered <q>to levy proportionable and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able assessments, rates and taxes, for our service, in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary defence and support of the government of the said province, or territory; and the protection and preservation of the inhabitants there.</q> The defence and support of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and their own protection and preservation, are the purposes, for which they are to raise supplies; and, in my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, there are no others, to which any society is under an obligation to contribute its wealth or property.</p>
            <p>I shall only make one more observation, upon this charter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is, that there was a reservation in it of liberty, for the people of England, to fish upon their coasts; which would have been useless and absurd, had that province been a part of the realm, and within the jurisdiction of parliament.</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:014096_0041_0F92DCFF2D788C78"/>An act of the 25th of Charles the second was the first, that ever imposed duties on the colonies, for any purpose; and these, as the preamble itself recites, were simply as a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trade, and were of a prohibitory nature. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danding this, it was the source of great dissatisfaction, and was one of the principal causes of the insurrection, in Virginia, under Colonel Bacon; which after his death subsided; and then the province sent agents to England, to remonstrate <q>against taxes and imposition being laid on the colony, by any authority, but that of the General Assembly.</q> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this, a declaration was obtained, under the privy seal of King Charles, dated 19th of April, 1676, to this effect, that <q>taxes ought not to be laid upon the proprietors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the colony, but by the common consent of the General Assembly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About three years after, when King Charles had occasion to raise a permanent revenue, for the support of Virginia, he did not attempt to do it by means of a parliamentary donation; but framed a Bill, and sent it there by Lord Colepepper, who was, at that time, governor, to receive the concurrence of their legislature. It was <hi>there</hi> passed into a law, and <q>
                  <hi>enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty, by, and with, the consent of the General Assembly of the colony of Virginia.</hi>
               </q> If the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians had been subjects of the realm, this could not have been done, without a direct violation of <hi>magna charta;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, that no English subject shall be taxed without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I have taken a pretty general survey of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Charters; and proved to the satisfaction of every unbiassed person, that they are intirely, discordant with that sovereignty of parliament, for which you are an advocate. The disingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your extracts (to give it no h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>her name) merits the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest censure; and will no doubt serve to discredit all your former, as well as future labours, in your favourite cause of despotism.</p>
            <p>It is true, that New-York has no Charter. But, if it could support it's claim to liberty in no other way, it might, with justice, plead the common principles of colonization: for, it would be unreasonable, to seclude one colony, from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the most important privileges of the rest. There is no need, however, of this plea: The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, among old parchments, or musty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. They are written, as with a sun beam, in the whole <hi>volume</hi> of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> never be erased or obscured by mortal power.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:014096_0042_0F92DCFFDE530408"/>The nations of Turkey, Russia, France, Spain, and all other despotic kingdoms, in the world, have an inherent right, when ever they please, to shake off the yoke of servitude, (though sanctified by the immemorial usage of their ancestors;) and to model their government, upon the principles of civil liberty.</p>
            <p>I will now venture to assert, that I have demonstrated, from the voice of nature, the <hi>spirit</hi> of the British constitution, and the charters of the colonies in general, the absolute non-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that parliamentary supremacy, for which you content. I am not apt to be dogmatical, or too confident of may own opinions; but, if I thought it possible, for me to be mistaken, when I maintain, that the parliament of Great-Britain has no sovereign authority over America, I should distrust every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of my understanding, reject every distinction between truth and falshood, and fall into an universal scepticism.</p>
            <p>Hitherto, I have reasonned against the whole authority of parliament, without even excepting the right we have conced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of regulating trade. I considered it, in its original state, as founded in the British constitution, the natural rights of society, and the several charters of the colonies. The power of regulating our trade was first exercised in the reign of Charles the second: I shall not examine upon what principle: It is enough, we have consented to it. But I shall proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the argument, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ou make use of, to establish the propriety of allowing special duties to be imposed by way to tribute, for the protection of our commerce.</p>
            <p>You argue thus, <q>Notwithstanding the large landed estates, possessed by the British subjects, in the different parts of the world; they must be considered, as a commercial, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mufacturing people. The welfare, perhaps the existence of Great-Britain, as an independent, or sovereign state, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon her manufactures and trade; and many people in America think, that her manufactures and commerce depend, in a great measure, on her intercourse with her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; insomuch, that if this should be neglected, her commerce would decline and die away; her wealth would cease, and her maritime power be at at an end. If these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations be ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

mode of raising such a revenue, as is necessary for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defence of the government, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by duties on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and exports; because these are attended with the least inconvenience to the subject, and may be so managed, as to raise a revenue, and regulate the trade at the same time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When it is considered, that Great-Britain is a maritime power; that the present flourishing state of her trade and of the trade of her colonies depends, in a great measure, upon the protection which they receive from the navy; that her own security depends upon her navy, and that it is principally, a naval protection, we receive from her, there will appear a peculiar propriety in laying the chief burthen of supporting her navy, upon her commerce; and in requesting us to bear a part of the expence, proportional to our ability, and to that protection and security which we receive from it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The supposition, that a cessation of commerce, between Great-Britain and the colonies, would be ruinous and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the former, is ushered in, as the principal argument, for her right to regulate the commerce of the whole empire. I am willing to allow it its full weight; but I cannot conceive how you can pretend, after making such an use of it, to deny it the force it ought to have, when it is urged, as affording a moral certainty, that our present measures will be successful.—If you tacitly adopt the principle, and reason from it, in one case, with what propriety can you reject it, in the other?—If the preservation of the British empire depends, in any material degree, upon the right of parliament to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the trade of the colonies, what will be the consequence if that trade ceases altogether?—You must either acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that you have adduced a very weak and foolish argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that the commercial connexion between Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the colonies is essential to her security and prosperity. You have either failed, in proving your point, or you have furnished me, with an ample confutation of all your reasoning against the probability of success, from the restrictions laid on our commerce. If our trade be necessary to the welfare of Great-Britain, she must, of course, be ruined by a discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it.</p>
            <p>But it is granted, that Great-Britain has a right to regulate the trade of the empire. The Congress <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> acknowledged it, so far as concerned their constituents. You infer from thence, that all parts of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be subject to her. They need
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014096_0044_0F92DD016D491FD8"/>
only be, so far subject, as is necessary for the end proposed, that is the regulation of their trade. If you require any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther subjection, you require <hi>means</hi> that are disproportionate to the <hi>end,</hi> which is unreasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not at all allowable.</p>
            <p>With respect to the justice of submitting to impositions, on our trade, for the purpose of raising a revenue, to support the Navy, by which it is protected, I answer, that the exclusive regulation of our commerce, for her own advantage, is a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient tribute to Great-Britain for protecting it. By this means, a vast accession of wealth is annually thrown into her coffers. It is a matter of notoriety, that the ballance of trade is very much against us. After ransacking Spain, Portugal, Holland, the English, French, Spanish, Dutch and Danish plantations, for Money and Bills of Exchange, as remittances for the commodities we take from Great-Britain; we are still always greatly in arrears to her. At a moderate computation I am well informed, that the profits she derives from us every year, exceed two millions and a half sterling; and when we reflect, that this sum will be continually increasing, as we grow more and more populous, it must be evident, that there is not the least justice in raising a revenue upon us, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of special duties.</p>
            <p>The right of Great-Britain to regulate our trade, upon the plan it is now acknowledged, is not an inconsiderable matter. It is as much as any free people can concede, and as much, as any just people would require. We are not permitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure manufactures any where else, than from Great-Britain, or Ireland. Our trade is limited and prescribed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as is most for her interest: This is a plentiful source of wealth to her, as I have heretofore shewn, and shall hereafter confirm, by the testimony of some British writers.</p>
            <p>But I have found out an argument, which I imagine will go very near convincing yourself of the absurdity of what you have offered, on this head. It is short, but conclusive, <hi>"the principal profits of our trade center in Great-Britain."</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Page 19th of your own letter.</note> How can you, my dear sir, after making this confession, entertain a single thought, that it is incumbent upon us to suffer her to raise a revenue upon our trade? Are not the <hi>principal profits</hi> a sufficient recompence for protecting it? Surely you would not allow her the whole. This would be rather too generous.—However ardent you affection to her, and however much it
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014096_0045_0F92DD025A96CEF8"/>
may be your glory to advance her imperial dignity, you ought to moderate it so far, as to permit us to enjoy some little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from our trade. Only a small portion of the profits will satisfy us. We are willing to let her have the <hi>principal</hi> share<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this you acknowledge she already has. But why will you advise us to let her exhaust the small pittance, we have reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the reward of our own industry in bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hensome reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues? This might be liberality and generosity; but it would not be prudence; and let me tell you, in this selfish, rapacious world, a little discretion is, at worth, only a <hi>venial</hi> sin. It will be expedient to be more cautious for the future. It is difficult to combat truth; and unless you redouble your vigilance, you will (as in the present instance) be extremely apt to ensnare yourself.</p>
            <p>I shall now briefly examine the excellent mode, you have proposed, for settling our disputes, finally, and effectually.—All internal taxation is to be vested, in our own legislatures, and the right of regulating trade, by duties, bounties, &amp;c. to be left to the parliament, together with the right of enacting all general laws, for all the colonies. You imagine that we should then "have all the security for our rights, liberties and properties, which human policy can give us"</p>
            <p>Here we widely differ in sentiment, my opinion is, that we should have no <q>security, besides the good will of our rulers, that is no security at all.</q> Is there no difference between one system of laws and another? Are not some more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and beneficial to the subject, better calculated to preserve his life, and personal liberty than others? It is evident they are. Suppose, instead of the present system established among us, the French laws were to be introduced, for the good of all the colonies, should we have the same security for our lives which we now have? I presume we should not. I presume also, that a revolution in our laws might and wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, gradually, take place.</p>
            <p>A fondness for power is implanted, in most men, and it is natural to abuse it, when acquired. This maxim drawn from the experience of all ages makes it the height of folly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust any set of men with power, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:014096_0046_0F92DD02E52BA000"/>
with respect to making laws for us, there is not the least neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or even propriety in in it. Our legislatures are confined to ourselves and cannot interfere, with Great-Britain. We are best acquainted with our own circumstances, and therefore best qualified, to make suitable regulations. It is of no force to object, that no particular colony has power to enact general laws for all the colonies: There is no need of such general laws. Let every colony attend to its own internal police, and all will be well. How have we manag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d heretofore? The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament has made no general laws, for our good; and yet our aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rs have been conducted, much to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ase and satisfaction. If any discord has sprung up among us, it is wholly imputable to the incursions of Great-Britain. We should be peaceable and happy, if unmolested by her: We are not so destitute of wisdom, as to be in want of her assistance, to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vise proper and salutary laws for us.</p>
            <p>The legislative power of parliament, would at any rate be useless to us, and as utility is the prime end of all laws, that power has no reason for which it should exist. It is not even requisite for preserving the connexion, between Britain and the colonies; for that is sufficiently secured, in two ways, by being united under the same king; and by the important pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of regulating our commerce, to which we have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>That i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> might be prejudicial to us, no reasonable man can deny. We may trace the evils of it, through the whole admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of justice. Judicial proceedings may be so ordered, as to render our lives and properties dependent on the will and caprice of court favourites and tools. A wide field for bribery and corruption, of every kind, would be opened; and the most enormous exactions would take shelter under the garb of law. It is unnecessary to enter into a particular detail of the different methods, in which all this might be effected; every man's own imagination will suggest to him a multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of instances.</p>
            <p>Rigorous, oppressive and tyrannical laws may be thought expedient, as instruments to humble our rebellio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This no doubt would be a work of time. The steps would be gradual and perhaps imperceptible; but they would be sure and effectual.

the least plausible foundation for it [as I have clearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved] will authorize us to apprehend the worst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The power of legislating for us, and of raising a revenue upon the articles of commerce would be a sufficient degree of slavery. It is absurd to say, that Great-Britain could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose heavy burthens, on our commerce, without immediately feeling the effect herself. She may enrich herself, by reducing us to the most lamentable state of penury and wretchedness.—We are already forbid to purchase the manufactures of any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign countries. Britain and Ireland must furnish us with the necessaries we want. Those things we manufacture among ourselves, may be disallowed. We should then be compelled to take the manufactures of Great-Britain, upon her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. We could not, in that case, do without them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever excessive the duties, laid upon them, we shall be under an inevitable necessity to purchase them. How would Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain feel the effects of those impositions, but to her own advantage? If we might withdraw our custom, and apply to other nations; if we might manufacture our own materials; those expedients would serve, as a refuge to us; and would indeed be a security against any immoderate exactions. But these resources would be cut off. There would be no alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive left us. We must submit to be drained of all our wealth, for those necessaries, which we are not permitted to get else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>As to our trade with foreign countries, the burthens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on that, however grievous, would, in like manner, affect Great-Britain, only by increasing her public treasure. Her own inhabitants would pay no part of them: They would fall solely upon ourselves. There is no immediate connection between her trade and ours of this kind: they are separate and independent; and, of course, the incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>brances on the one would not injure the other. The superfluity of our products must be exported to enable us to pay our debts to her; and we must submit to be loaded, at her discretion. If we look forward to a period not far distant, we shall perceive, that the productions of our country will infinitely exceed the demands, which Great-Britain and her connections can possibly have for them; and, as we shall then be greatly advanced in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, our wants will be proportionab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The legislative authority of Parliament would always be ready to silence our murmurs, by ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, after all, let us suppose, that the emolument which arises, from the simple and abstracted regulation of our trade, is inadequate to the protection, we derive, from the parent state; does it follow, that her just demands cannot be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unless we put it in her power to ruin us? When did the colonies refuse to contribute their proportion, towards defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expences of government?—During the war, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributious were so liberal and generous, that we were thought to have done more, than our part, and restitution was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly made.

You insinuate, that the Pennsylvania Farmer admits the right of Parliament to regulate our trade, in the same sense, you do. The very letter your extracts are taken from, is expressly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled against the revenue act, with regard to paper, glass, &amp;c. The design of that and all his subsequent papers, is to prove, that all duties, imposed upon the articles of commerce, for the purpose of raising a revenue, are to be considered, in the same light, as what you call <hi>internal</hi> taxes, and ought equally to be opposed.</p>
            <p>By the "legal authority to regulate trade," he means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than what the Congress have allowed. An autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to confine us to the use of her own manufactures, to prescribe our trade, with foreign nations, and the like. This is the power he speaks of as being "lodged in the British Parliament." And as <hi>to general duties,</hi> he means such, as the people of Great-Britain are to pay, as well as ourselves. Duties, for the purpose of a revenue, raised upon us only, he calls <hi>special</hi> duties, and says, <q>they are as much a tax upon us, as those imposed by the stamp-act.</q>

               <q> Perhaps the nature of the necessities of dependent states, caused by the policy of a governing one, for her own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, may be elucidated, by a fact, mentioned in history. When the Carthaginians were possessed of the island of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> they made a decree, that the Sardinians should not raise <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>You would persuade us also, that Mr. <hi>Pitt'</hi>s sentiment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with yours, about the regulation of trade; but this is as false as the other. When he tells them <q>to exercise every power, but that of taking money out of our pockets,</q> he does not mean, that they shall barely refrain from a <hi>manual operation</hi> upon our pockets; but that they shall exact money from us, in no way whatever. To tax the commodities, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain obliges us to take from her only, is as much taking money out of our pockets, as to tax our estates; and must be equally excluded by Mr. Pitt's prohibition.</p>
            <p>You, all along, argue upon a suppositious denial of the right of Parliament to regulate our trade. You tell us, <q>It will never give up the right of regulating the trade of the colonies;</q> and in another place <q>if we succeed, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving Great-Britain of the power of regulating our trade, the colonies will probably be soon at variance with each other.

After asserting the right of the several provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial legislatures to an exclusive power of legislation, <q>in all cases of taxation and internal policy,</q> they conclude thus: <q>But from the necessity of the case, and a regard to the

            </p>
            <p>It seems to me not impossible, that our trade may be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, as to prevent the discord and animosity, at the prospect of which you are so terrified, without the least assistance, from a <hi>revenue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I, not only disproved the existence of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary authority, of which you are so zealous an abettor. But also shewn, that the mode you have proposed, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

My next business is to vindicate the Congress, by a few natural inferences; and such reflections, on the state of our commercial conexion, with the mother country, as are necessary to shew the insignificancy of your objections to my former arguments, on this head.</p>
            <p>Since it has been proved, that the British parliament has no right, either to the legislation, or taxation of America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and since neither could be ceded, without betraying our liberties, the Congress would have acted inconsistent with their duty to their country, had they done it.

            <p>The regulation of our trade, in the sense it is now admitted, is the only power we can, with justice to ourselves, permit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All your clamours, therefore, against them, for not having drawn some proper line<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are groundless and ridiculous.

               </gap> into execution, evince a fixed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate design to exterminate the liberties of America.</p>
            <p>Mr. Grenville, during his administration, was the projector of this scheme. His conduct as a minister has been severely arraigned, by his successors in office, and by the nation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; but, notwithstanding this, a measure, which disgraces his character more, than any thing else, has been steadily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, ever since.</p>
            <p>The Stamp Act was the commencement of our misfortunes; which, in consequence of the <hi>spirited</hi> opposition made by us, was repealed. The revenue act, imposing duties on Paper, Glass, &amp;c. came next; and was also partly repealed on the same account: A part, however, was left to be the instrument of some future attack. The present minister, in conjunction with a mercenary tribe of merchants attempted to effect, by stratagem, what could not be done by an open undisguised manner of proceeding: His emissaries, every where, were set to work. They endeavored, by every possible device, to allure us into the snare. The act, passed for the purpose, was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented; and we were assured with all the parade of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended patriotism, that our liberties were in no danger. The advantage, we should receive, from the probable cheapness of English tea, was played off, with every exaggeration off fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and specious declamations, on the criminality of illicit trade, served as a gilding for the whole. Thus truth and its opposite were blended. The men, who could make just reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on the sanctity of an oath, were yet base enough to strike at the vitals of those rights, which ought to be held sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred by every rational being.</p>
            <p>It so happened, that the first tea ship arrived at Boston. The Assembly of that province, justly alarmed at the consequences, made repeated applications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the consignees, for the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>India company, requesting them to send back the tea. They, as often refused to comply. The ship was detained, till the time was elapsed, after which the tea must have been landed, and the duties paid, or it would have been seized, by the Custom-house. To prevent this, a part of the citizens of Boston assembled, proceeded to the ship, and threw the tea into the river.<note n="*" place="bottom">I shall examine the justice and policy of this proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:014096_0054_0F92DD0A5C8DAD58"/>The scheme of the ministry was disappointed, on all hands. The tea was returned from all the colonies, except South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Carolina. It was landed there; but such precautions were taken, as equally served to baffle their attempt.</p>
            <p>This abortion of their favourite plan inflamed the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ire. They breathed nothing, but vengeance against Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica: Menaces of punishment resounded, through both houses of parliament. The commons of Great-Britain spoke more in the supercilious tone of masters, than in the becoming lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of fellow subjects. To all the judicious reasonings of a Burke, or Barry, no other answer was returned, than an idle tale of <hi>lenity</hi> and <hi>severity.</hi> Much was said of their past for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and of their future resentment: This was the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the song. The Quixot minister too, promised to bring America to his feet. Humiliating idea! and such as ought to be spurned by every free-born American!</p>
            <p>Boston was the first victim to the meditated vengeance: An act was passed to block up her ports, and destroy her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, with every aggravating circumstance that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It was not left at her option to elude the the stroke, by paying for the tea; but she was also to make such satisfaction to the officers of his Majesty's revenue and others, who might have suffered as should be judged <hi>reasonable by the governor.</hi> Nor it this all, before her commerce could be restored, she must have submitted to the authority claimed and exercised by the parliament.<note n="*" place="bottom">This must be evident to every person, who has read the act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The safety of the whole depends upon the mutual protection of every part. If the sword of oppression be permitted to lop off one limb without opposition, reiterated strokes will soon dismember the whole body. Hence it was the duty and interest of all the colonies to succour and support the one which was suffering. It is sometimes sagaciously urged, that we ought to commisserate the distresses of the people of Massachusetts; but not intermeddle in their affairs, so far, as perhaps to bring ourselves into like circumstances with them. This might be good reasoning, if our neutrality would not be more dangerous, than our participation: But I am unable to conceive how the colonies in general would have any security against oppression, if they were once to content themselves, with barely <hi>pitying</hi> each other, while parliament was prose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uting and enforcing its demands. Unless they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually protect and assist each other, they must all inevitably fall a prey to their enemies.</p>
            <p>Extraordinary emergencies, require extraordinary expedients. The best mode of opposition was that in which there might be an union of councils. This was necessary to ascertain the boundaries of our rights; and to give weight and dignity to our measures, both in Britain and America. A Congress was accordingly proposed, and universally agreed to.</p>
            <p>You, Sir, triumph in the supposed <hi>illegality</hi> of this body; but, granting your supposition were true, it would be a matter of no real importance. When the first principles of civil society are violated, and the rights of a whole people are invaded, the common forms of municipal law are not to be regarded. Men may then betake themselves to the law of nature; and, if they but conform their actions, to that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>andard, all cavils against them, betray either ignorance or dishonesty. There are some events in society, to which human laws cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:014096_0056_0F92DD0BF1775098"/>
but when applied to them lose all their force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. In short, when human laws contradict or discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the means, which are necessary to preserve the essential rights of any society, they defeat the proper end of all laws, and so become null and void.</p>
            <p>But you have barely asserted, not proved this <hi>illegality.</hi> If, by the term, you mean a contrariety to law, I desire you to produce the law against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and maintain, there is none in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you mean, that there is no law, the intention of which may authorise such a convention, I deny this also. It has been always a principle of the law that subjects have a right to state their grievances, and petition the King for redress. This is explicitly acknowledged by an act of the first of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Mary; and "all prosecutions and commitments for such petitioning," are declared to be illegal. So far then the Congress was a body founded in law; for if subjects have such a right they may undoubtedly elect and depute persons from among themselves to act for them.<note n="*" place="bottom">All Lawye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The deputies, chosen in the several provinces met at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, according to appointment; and framed a set of resolves declarative of the rights of America, all which, I have by general arguments proved, are consonant to reason and nature; to the spirit of the British constitution and to the intention of our charters.

               </gap>ence of them: If this had been the case, why was no notice taken of them in the repealing act?—Why were not our complaints as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as the inducement to it? On the contrary, these are the express words of the first repeal, to which the second is also similar.—<q>Whereas the continuance of the said act would be attended <hi>with many inconveniencies;</hi> and <hi>may be productive of consequences greatly detrimental to the commercial interests of Great-Britain,</hi> may it, therefore, please your most excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and cousent, &amp;c. that from and after the first day of May, 1766, the above mentioned act, and the several matters and things, therein contained, shall be, and is, and are, hereby, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and made void, to all intents and purposes, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The inconveniences, and the ill-consequences to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, are the only reasons, given for the revocation of the act, How then can you pretend to say it was in compliance with our petitions?—You must think the complaisance of your readers very great, to imagine they will credit your assertions, at the expence of their own understandings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:014096_0058_0F92DD0E30B0E7A0"/>Neither is the use you make of the assigned reason, at all just. The consequences, so detrimental to the commercial interests of Great-Britain, are not such as would have resulted from the natural operation of the act, had it been submitted to; but from the opposition made by us, and the cessation of imports, which had taken place.</p>
            <p>A non-importation, (to which you have so violent an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) was the only thing, that procured us redress, on preceding occasions. We did not formerly, any more, than now, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ine ourselves to petitions only; but took care to adopt a more prevailing method, to wit,—a suspension of trade.</p>
            <p>But what proves, to a demonstration, that our former peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were unsuccessful is, that the grand object, they aimed at, was never obtained. This was an exemption from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary taxation.—Our addresses turned entirely upon this point: And so far were they from succeeding, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the repeal of the stamp-act, a subsequent act was passed, declaring the right of Parliament to bind us, by sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, in all cases whatsoever.—This declaration of the unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted universal authority of Parliament was a direct denial of the leading claim held up in our petition; and of course a rejection of the petition itself.</p>
            <p>The same observations are applicable to the revenue act, which, had our addresses been successful, would have been wholly not partially revoked;—and we should not, at this time, have had any occasion to renew our complaints; but should have been in a state of security and tranquillity.</p>
            <p>In my former reflections on this head, I urged many consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to shew, that there is less reason now, than ever, to expect deliverance, by means of remonstrance and entreaty.—And indeed, if we consider the vindictive spirit diffused thro' the words and actions of our oppressors, we must be convinced of this.—It impeaches the understandings of the Ministry and the Parliament, in the gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>You tell me, <q>there is also this reason why we should, at least, have tried the mode of petition and remonstrance, to obtain a removal of the grievances we complain of. The Friends of America, in England, have strongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it, as the most decent and probable means of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</q>—I wish you had been so kind, as to have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularised those friends, you speak of.—I am inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, you would have found some difficulty in this. There have been some publications, in the news-papers, said to be extracts of letters from England; but who were the authors of them? How do you know they were not written in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica? or, if they came from England, that the writers of them were really sincere friends?—I have heard one or two persons named, as the authors of some of these letters; but they were those, whose sincerity we have the greatest reason to distrust.—The general tenor of advice, from those, with whose integrity we are best acquainted, has been to place no dependence on the justice or clemency of Great-Britain; but to work out our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, by a spirited and self-denying opposition. Restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on our trade, have been expressly pointed out and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as the only probable source of redress.</p>
            <p>You say, <q>if the information from England be true, we have, by our h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

against us.</q> Pray, Sir, where did you get this information? Is there any inhabitant of the invisible world, that brings intelligence to you, in a supernatural way? There have been no arrivals from England, preceding the time you wrote your letter, that have brought any account of the proceedings of the Congress being received there, or of the consequences resulting from them.—Your information must have, either, come to you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a miraculous manner, or it must be a fiction of your own imagination.</p>
            <p>But there are other powerful reasons against trusting to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only, in our present circumstances, The town of Boston is in a very critical situation:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men, under sufferings, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely apt, either to plunge into desperation, or to grow disheartened and dejected.

Delays are extremely dangerous in affairs of such vast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
            <p>The dispute might have been spun out by ministerial artifice, till the generality of the people became careless and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and, of course, fitter to be imposed upon, and less<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to assert their rights with firmness and spirit.—The hand of bribery might have been stretched across the atlantic, and the number of domestic vipers increased among us.—The ministry and their agents here are active and subtle: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would have been neglected, that might have a tendency to deceive to ignorant and unwary, or to attract the dishonest and avaricious.—How great an influence, places, pensions and honours have upon the minds of men, we may easily discover, by contrasting the former, with the present conduct of some among ourselves.—Many, who at the time of the Stamp act were loudest in the cause of liberty, and the most ardent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the spirited proceedings, on that occasion, have now from patriots of the first magnitude dwindled into <hi>moderate men,</hi> friends to order and good government, dutiful and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous servants to the ministry.</p>
            <p>Had our petitions failed, we should have found our difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties multiplied much more, than we can imagine; and, since there was the highest probability of a failure, it would have been madness to have hazarded so much upon so unpromising a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I therefore infer, that, if the Congress had not concerted other more efficacious measures, they would have trifled away the liberties of their country; and merited censure, instead of approbation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Commercial regulations were the only peaceable means, from which we could have the least hope of success.—These they have entered into; and these I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain must succeed, if they are not treacherously or pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously infringed.</p>

            <p>These quotations clearly prove, that the colonies are of the last importance to Great-Britain.

Notwithstanding the present high cultivation of the lands, in England, that kingdom is capable of being improved, by agriculture and commerce, so as to maintain double the number of people, that it does at present. The improvements, in Scotland, within the last thirty years, are amazing.

These are stubborn facts, and notorious to every person, that has the least acquaintance, with the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two kingdoms: Had there been the vast resources you speak of, why have they not been improved to exonerate the people, and discharge the enormous debts of the nation? The guardians of the state have been a supine, negligent, and stupid pack indeed, to have overlooked, in the manner they have done, those numerous expedients, they might have fallen upon, for the relief of the public. It cannot be expected, but that a war will take place, in the course of a few years, if not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; and then, through the negligence of her rulers, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, already tottering under her burthens, will be obliged to increase them, 'till they become altogether insupportable; and she must sink under the weight of them. These considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions render it very evident, that the mighty resources you set forth, in such pompous terms, have nothing, but an <hi>imaginary</hi> existence; or they would not have been left so uncultivated in such necessitous and pressing circumstances.</p>
            <p>You think, you have nothing to do; but do mention that names of a few countries, Portugal, Russia, Turkey, &amp;c. and you have found out an easy remedy for the inconveniences flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the loss of our trade. Yet, in truth, Great-Britain carries on, as extensive a commerce with those countries and all others, as their circumstances will permit. Her trade is upon the decline with many of them. France has, in a great measure, supplanted her in Spain, Portugal and Turkey, and

Supposing, therefore, the Americans to act in this case, as they did, in the time of the stamp act; we shall then have yearly, until the final settlement of this affair, manufactures to the value of four millions sterling, left and heaped on the hands of our merchants, and master manufacturers; or we shall have workmen and poor people put out of employ, and turned adrift in that proportion. There will likewise be drawn from our home consumption, and out of our general trade and traffic, North-American commodities, to the same va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; and debts will to the immense sum above mentioned be withheld from private people here. What effects these things will produce, considering the present state of our trade, manufactures, and manufacturers, the condition of our poor at home, and the numbers of people running abroad, it don't want many words to explain and set forth. <hi>They were before severely felt,</hi> for the timé that they lasted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is apprehended, that the present situation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic is yet more liable to the impression. These are some of the difficulties and distresses, which we are, for a trial of

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014096_0065_0F92DD14195EA4E8"/>
skill, going to bring on ourselves; and which will be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually magnifying and increasing, as long as the unnatural contest shall continue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From these facts and authorities, it appears unquestionable, that the trade of Great-Britain, instead of being capable of improvement among foreign countries, is rather declining; and, instead of her being able to bear the loss of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, she stands in great need of more colonies to consume her manufactures.</p>
            <p>It is idle to talk of employing those, who might be thrown out of business, upon farms. All the lands in England, of any value, have been long ago disposed of, and are already cultivated as high as possible. The laborious farmers find it an exceeding difficult talk to pay their yearly taxes, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their families, with the bare necessaries of life;—and it would be impracticable to give employment in agriculture to any more, than are already engaged. We can have no doubt of this, if we consider the small extent of territory in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain, the antiquity of its settlement, and the vast number of people it contains. It is rather overstocked, with inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; and were it not for its extensive commerce, it could not maintain near the number it does at present. This is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged on all hands. None, but yourself, would hazard the absurdity of a denial. The emigrations from Britain, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, from the north part of it, as well as the most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic accounts, prove the contrary of your representations—Men are generally too much attached to their native countries to leave it and dissolve all their connexions, unless they are driven to it, by necessity. The swarms, that every year come over to America, will never suffer any reasonable man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, upon the strength of your word, that the people in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or Ireland, are even in tolerable circumstances.</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear wondering, when you talk of the price of grain being advanced in France, Spain and the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean; and insinuate, that Britain may be able to supply them: It will be well, if she can raise grain enough, for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so as not to feel the want of those considerable quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, she frequently gets from us. I am apt to think, she will experience some inconvenience, on this account.</p>
            <p>With respect to Ireland, you think yourself under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to point out, where she may find purchasers for her linens, so numerous and wealthy, as we are; but, unless you could do this, you must leave that country in very deplorable circumstances. It is not true, that she may do just as wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:014096_0066_0F92DD14DFB89330"/>
with her linens, upon her hands, as we can with our flax seed, upon ours. Linen is a staple manufacture of hers, and the sole means of subsistence to a large part of her inhabitants. Flax seed, as an article of commerce, is comparatively of little importance to us; but we shall stand in need of all the flax we can raise to manufacture linens for ourselves, and, therefore, shall not lose our seed by ceasing to export it. I shall say more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>Nor is it by any means a just inference, that because Ireland formerly subsisted, without a linen manufactory, she would not therefore severely feel any present obstruction to the sale of the article in question. Her burthens are now much more grievous than they formerly were: and, of course, her resources ought to be proportionably greater, or she must sink under the pressure of them. The linen manufactory is; at this time one of her most valuable resources, and could not be materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally injured or impeded, without producing the most melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly effects, The distressed condition of Ireland will not admit of any dimunition of her <hi>means;</hi> but pressingly demands an enlargement of them.</p>
            <p>It is of little moment to contest the possiblity, that that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might procure a sufficiency of flax seed, elsewhere, than from us; 'till it can be shewn, where she may find a mart for her linens, equal to the American; and this you are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling even to attempt. Yet I have credible information, that she could not obtain from Holland, much more than usual (for the reasons I before assigned) and, that she has always had, as much from the Baltic, as she could conveniently get. With regard to Canada, any considerable supply from thence, would be a work of time, and no relief to her immediate exigencies.</p>
            <p>I observed in my former pamphlet, that <q>the Dutch may withold their usual supplies: They may choose to improve the occasion, for the advancement of their own trade: They may take advantage of the scarcity of materials in Ireland, to increase and put off their own manufactures.</q> You answer it by saying, <q>you never yet knew a Holander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who would withold any thing that would fetch him a good price.</q> The force of my observation turns upon its being his interest to do it,—You should have shewn, that it would be more profitable to him, to fell it to the Irish, than to retain it, for the purposes mentioned; otherwise that very avarice, you ascribe to him, will operate, as I supposed.</p>
            <p>You are unmercifully witty, upon what I said, concerning the West-Indies; but the misfortune of it is, you have done
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014096_0067_0F92DD15C64DFBB0"/>
nothing else, than "blunder round about my meaning." I will endeavour to explain myself, in a manner more level to your capacity.</p>
            <p>The lands in the West-Indies are extremely valuable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they produce the Sugar Cane, which is a very lucrative plant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they are small, in quantity, and therefore, their propri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tors appropriate only small portions, to the purpose of raising food. They are very populous, and therefore, the food raised among themselves, goes but little way. They could not afford sufficient sustenance to their inhabitants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were chiefly or entirely applied to the production of necessari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; because they are so small in quantity, and so thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited.</p>
            <p>These are truths, which every person, acquainted with the West Indies, must acquiesce in; and should they be deprived of external succours, they must either starve, or suspend the cultivation of the sugar cane. The last is the best side of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mma; but that would cut off an annual income of several millions sterling to Great Britain: For it cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> admit of a doubt, that the chief part of the profits of the English West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies, ultimately center there.</p>
            <p>But, in order to disappoint my malice, you tell me, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada raises 400,000 bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The single Island of Jamaica would require much more. At a moderate computation, I believe there are 400,000 people in the British West Indies only: Let us allow a pound of wheat a day, upon an average, to each;<note n="†" place="bottom">This allowance cannot be thought too much, if we consider, that the negroes chiefly live upon g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

            <p>At a pound a day, every person must be supposed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, 365, lb. a year, that is, about twelve bushels. Now as there are as many people as there are bushels of wheat raised in Canada; and as each person would consume twelve bushels, it follows, that the quantity you mention, would not be above a twelfth part sufficient.</p>
            <p>But can we imagine, that all the wheat of Canada would be devoted to the use of the British West Indies? If our ports were to be blocked up, would not the French and Spanish

islands be in great distress for provisions? And have not the Canadians any near connexions among them? Would they not naturally sympathize with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do all in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to afford relief? And could they find no means to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish their inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nations?—The answer to these questions is easy: The Islands belonging to the French and Spaniards will be greatly distressed: The Canadians will be very ready and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irous to assist them; and they will contrive some expedients to communicate a large share of what their country yields.</p>
            <p>What you say concerning the lumber exported from Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, is totally false.—That country labours under many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, which have hitherto prevented the exportation of that article, but in very small quantities, and of a particular kind. The places were the lumber grows, are so far distant from the sea ports, that the expence of transportation is too great to make it worth while to ship any other than butt staves, and these must be brought quite from Lake Champlain. This disadvantage, together with the number of hands it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and the time necessary to enter extensively into any branch of trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to remove all the impediments naturally in the way, would render the situation of the West-Indians, truly pitiable, were they once necessitated to depend upon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada only, for supplies of lumber.</p>
            <p>The attention of Missisippi is entirely engrossed in raising Corn and Indigo: The advantage arising from these articles, is much greater than would result from lumber; and of course, the people of that country will never attend to the latter, in preference to the former.</p>
            <p>Thus have I proved in a full, clear, and conclusive manner, that a cessation of our trade with Britain, Ireland and the West-Indies, would be productive of the most fatal consequences to them all; and that, therefore, the peace, happiness and safety of the British Empire, are connected with the redress of our grievances; and, if they are at all consulted, our measures cannot fail of success.</p>
            <p>As to the justice of proceeding in the manner we have done, it must depend upon the <hi>necessity</hi> of such a mode of conduct. If the British parliament are claiming and exercising an unjust authority, we are right in opposing it, by every necessary means. If Remonstran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>endant upon our measures will inevitably be.</p>
            <p>Nature has disseminated her blessings variously throughout this continent: Some parts of it are favourable to some things, others to others; some colonies are best calculated for grain; others for flax and hemp; others for cotton; and others for live stock of every kind: By this means, a mutually advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous intercourse may be established between them all. If we were to turn our attention from external to internal commerce, we should give greater stability, and more lasting prosperity to our country, than she can possibly have otherwise. We should not then import the luxuries and vices of foreign climes; nor should we make such hasty strides to public corruption and depravity.</p>
            <p>Let all those lands, which are rich enough to produce flax and hemp, be applied to that purpose; and let such parts, as have been a long time settled, still continue to be appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grain, or other things they are fit for. We shall want as much of the former articles as can be raised; and perhaps, as much of the latter, as may be requisite towards the due improvement of the poorer part of our soil. Let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the colonies, which are adapted to the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of materials for manufactures, will not be employed in raising grain, but must take what they use chiefly from the other colonies; and, in return, supply their materials; by this means, and by dedicating no more of our land to the rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wheat, rye, corn, &amp;c. than is incapable of producing other things, we shall find no superfluity of those articles, and shall make a very beneficial use of all our lands. This is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable; difficulties may be started, but none which perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and industry may not overcome.</p>
            <p>The clothes we already have in use, and the goods at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the country, will, with care, be sufficient to last <hi>three

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eep as much as possible. It is unfair to judge of the future from the past. Hitherto we have paid no great attention to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have killed and exported as fast as we could obtain a sale<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When we come to attend properly to the matter, to kill but few, and to export none, we shall, in the course of two or three years, have large numbers of sheep; and wool enough to go a considerable way towards clothing ourselves.</p>
            <p>Flax and hemp, we should undoubtedly have in abundance. The immense tracts of new rich land, which may be planted with these articles, would yield immense quantities of them. What large supplies of seed do we annually export to Ireland! When we come to with-hold these, and make the cultivation of flax and hemp, a matter of serious attention, we shall soon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a plenty of them. In speaking of this matter, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your views to the single small province of New-York. You say, <q>We sow already as much flax,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently manage. Besides, it requires a rich free soil; nor will the same ground in <hi>this</hi> country, produce flax a second time, till after an interval of five or six years. If the measures of the Congress should be carried into full effect, I confess we may in a year or two, want a large quantity of hemp, for the executioner. But I fear, we must import it. It exhausts the soil too much to be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, in the old settled parts of the province.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is land enough in the other provinces, that is rich, free and new; nor is at all liable to the objections you make. As to this particular province, and any others in the same circumstances, let only such parts as are fit, be planted, with the articles in question; and let the rest be managed as before. Much more may be produced in this, than has been hitherto; but, if it could not afford a sufficie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y for itself; let it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change its grain with other colonies, that superabound with such materials.</p>
            <p>If we sow already as much flax, as we can conveniently manage, it is, because the chief of our attention is engrossed by other things; but the supposition is, that there will be less demand for them, and more for flax; and, by attending less
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014096_0072_0F92DD1A19097838"/>
to present objects, we shall have it in our power for the future, to sow and manage much more flax, than in the time past.</p>
            <p>With respect to cotton, you do not pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end to deny, that a sufficient quantity of that might be produced. Several of the southern colonies are so favorable to it, that with due cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a couple of years they would afford enough to cloath the whole continent. As to the expence of bringing it by land, the best way will be to manufacture it, were it grows; and afterwards transport it to the other colonies. Upon this plan I apprehend, the expence would not be greater, than to build and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quip large ships, to import the manufactures of Great-Britain from thence.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of transportation would be attended, with one great advantage. It would give employment and bread to a number of people; and would among other things, serve to prevent there being those terrific bands of thieves, robbers and highwaymen, which you endeavor to draw up, in such formidable array, against the Congress<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>It would however be hardly possible to block up our ports, in such a manner, as to cut off all communication between the colonies, by water. There would remain some avenues in spite of all that could be done, and we should not be idle in making proper use of them.</p>
            <p>I mentioned before, the vast quantities of skins in America, which would never let us want a warm and comfortable suit. This is one of our principal resources, and this you have passed over in silence.—A suit made of skins, would not be quite so elegant as one of broad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cloth; but it would shelter us from the inclemency of the winter, full as well.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, considering all the resources we have; and the time we shall have to prepare them, before we are in actual want; there can be no room to doubt, that we may live without the manufactures of Britain, if we are careful, frugal and industrious.</p>
            <p>But, it is said, we have no persons to manufacture our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after we have provided them. Among the swarms of emigrants, that have within these few years past, come to the coutinent; there are numbers of manufacturers, in the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary branches. These, for want of encouragement in their own occupations, have been obliged to apply themselves to other methods of getting a living; but would be glad of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to return to them. Besides these, we should soon have a plenty of workmen, from Britain and Ireland: Numbers, who would be thrown out of employ <hi>there,</hi> would be glad to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014096_0073_0F92DD1B0BB98E70"/>
to us for subsistence. They would not stay at home and be miserable, while there was any prospect of encouragement here. Neither is there any great difficulty, in acquiring a competent knowledge of the manufacturing arts. In a couple of years many of our own people might become proficient enough, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake the coarser kinds of stuffs and linens.</p>
            <p>But if it should be necessary, we have other resources besides all these. It will be impossible for the ships of Britain, to line <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude this head, with one more observation, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this, That all such, as may be deprived of business, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Once more I insist upon it, that Great-Britain can never force us to submission, by blocking up our ports; and that the consequences of such a procedure to herself, Ireland and the West-Indies, would be too fatal to admit of it. If she is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to enslave us, it must be by force of arms; and to attempt this, I again assert, would be nothing less, than <hi>the grossest infatuation, madness itself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever may be said of the disciplined troops of Britain, the event of the contest must be extremely doubtful. There is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature rise above itself, in acts of bravery and heroism. It cannot be expected, that America would yield, without a magnanimous persevering and bloody struggle. The testimony of past ages,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014096_0074_0F92DD1D141CED00"/>
and the least knowledge of mankind, must suffice to convi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> that the pulse of Americans beats high, in their country cause. Let us then suppose, the arms of Britain triumphan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and America mutilated, exhausted and vanquished. What situation will Britain then be in? What laurels will she reap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from her conquest? Alas! none. Every true friend to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded country, must shudder at the prospect of her self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying success. The condition, we should be left in would disable us from paying the six millions sterling, which is due, for the manufactures of Britain. Instead of the present millions, derived annually from our trade, we should be so distressed and reduced, as to be for many years to come, a burthen, and not an advantage. Millions are soon dispensed, in supporting fleets and armies. Much British treasure and blood would be expended in effecting our ruin.</p>
            <p>This then would be the situation of Great-Britain. Her pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt would be augmented several millions. Her merchants, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e one of the principal sources of her opulence, would many of them become bankrupt, by the loss of the vast sums due them, in America. Her manufactures would stagnate and decay, and her revenues would be considerably diminished. This continent, which is now a rich source of wealth and strength, would be debilitated and depressed.</p>
            <p>Would the ancient rivals and enemies of Britain be idle, at such a conjuncture as this? Would they not eagerly seize the opportunity to recover their former losses, and revenge the evils, they have sustained on former occasions? It will be said, this is possible, but it may not happen. I answer, causes must fail of their usual effects, if it does not. Princes and nations must cease to be ambitious and avaricious. The French from being a jealous, politic and enterprizing people, must be grown negligent, stupid and inattentive to their own interest. They never could have a fairer opportunity, or a greater temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to aggrandise themselves, and triumph over Britain, than would be here presented. Let us imagine England im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in a war with France, Spain, or any other potent neighbour, with her public debt increased, some of her best springs dried up, and America ruined; not only unable to afford her any assistance; but, perhaps fired with resentment and a sense of accumulated injuries, ready to throw itself into the arms of her enemies. In these circumstances, what would
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014096_0075_0F92DD1DD072C8F0"/>
be the fate of this unhappy kingdom? Every man of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment must be convinced, that ruin would be unavoidable.</p>
            <p>But, what reason have we to believe, the arms of Britain would prevail? It will be replied, because she can send against us some of the best troops in the world, either with respect to valour, or discipline; and because we have only a raw, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced militia to oppose them with. Discipline and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary skill are certainly matters of great importance, and give those, to whom they belong, a va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t superiority; but they do not render them invincible. Superior numbers, joined to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural intrepidity, and that animation, which is inspired by a desire of freedom, and a love of one's country, may very well over ballance those advantages.</p>
            <p>I imagine, it will be readily allowed, that Britain could not spare an army of above fifteen thousand men to send against the colonies. These would have to subdue near 600,000. The established rule of computing the number of men, capable of bearing arms in any nation, is by taking a fifth part of the whole people. By the best calculations we are supposed in America, to exceed three millions. The fifth part of three millions is 600,000. But, in order to be certain of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; let us suppose, there are only 500,000 fighting men in the colonies. Then there will be upwards of 30 Americans to one British soldier. A great disparity indeed! And such as never can be compensated by any discipline, or skill whatever! It will be objected, that these 500,000 cannot act together. I grant it; nor is there any occasion that they should: Forty thousand, will be a sufficient number to make head at a time, and these must be kept up by fresh supplies as fast as there is any diminution.</p>
            <p>Let it be remembered, that there are no large plains, for the two armies to meet in, and decide the contest, by some deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive stroke, where any advantage gained, by either side, might be prosecuted, 'till a complete victory was obtained. The circumstances of our country put it in our power, to evade a pitched battle. It will be better policy, to harrass and exhaust the soldiery, by frequent skirmishes and incursions, than to take the open field with them, by which means, they would have the full benefit of their superior regularity and skill.—Americans are better qualified, for that kind of fighting, which is most adapted to this country, than regular troops. Should the soldiery advance into the country, as they would be obliged to do, if they had any inclination to subdue us, their disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline would be of little use to them. We should, in that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Several of the colonies are now making preparation, for the worst (and indeed the best way to avoid a civil war, is to be prepared for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) They are disciplining men, as fast as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, in a few m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

A little actual service will put them very nearly upon a footing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with their enemies. The history of the Swedes and Russians, under Charles XII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Peter the Great, will teach us, how soon a people, possessed of natural bravery, may be brought to equal the most regular troops. The Swedes, at first, obtained very signal advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but, after a while, the Russians learned to defeat them with equal numbers. It is true, there was one of the greatest men, the world has seen, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Charles was, perhaps, never surpassed by any man, in courage, or skill; and his soldiers were well worthy of such a general. There is also this important circumstance, in our favour, when compared with the Russians. They were barbarous and untractable: We are civilized and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cile. They were ignorant even of the theory of war: We are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it; and, therefore, should more easily be brought to the practice of it; and be sooner taught that order and method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we are d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It is sometimes urged, that we have no experienced officers to command us. We labour under some disadvantage, in this respect; but not so great, as is believed.—There are many, who have served in the last war, with reputation, dispersed throughout the colonies. These might have the superior di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of matters; and there are men enough of known sense, and courage, who would soon make excellent officers. During the disputes, between the unfortunate <hi>Charles</hi> and the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many country gentlemen served, in the armies of the latter, and signalized themselves, for their military virtues. It is worthy of observation, that the present state of the army is not the most favourable. As is always the consequence of a long peace, there are many effeminate striplings, among the of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:014096_0077_0F92DD1F4D038B00"/>You ask me, what resources have the colonies to pay, clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th, arm and feed their troops? I refer you to the accounts, from Virginia and Marblehead, for an answer to this question. Our troops, on the spot, with us, will be much more easily maintained, than those of Britain, at such a distance. We are not so poor and incumbered, as to be unable to support those who are immediately employed in defending our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Our country abounds in provisions. We have already materials enough among us, to keep us in cloaths, longer than Britain would have any appetite to continue her hostilities.—Several of the colonies are pretty well stored with ammunition. France, Spain, and Holland would find means, to supply us with whatever we wanted.</p>
            <p>Let it not be said, that this last is a bare <hi>possibility,</hi> that France and Spain have promised not to interfere in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and that Holland has long been a faithful ally to the British nation.—There is the highest degree of probability, in the case. A more desireable object, to France and Spain, than the disu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>on of these conlonies, from Great-Britain, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined. Every dictate of policy and interest would prompt them to forward it, by every possible means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They could not take any so effectual method, to destroy the growing power of their great rival. The promises of princes and states<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are of little weight. They never bind longer, than 'till a strong temptation offers to break them; and they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make, with a sinister design. If we consult the known character of the French, we shall be disposed to conclude, that their present, seemingly, pacific and friendly disposition is merely a piece of <hi>finesse;</hi> intended to dupe administration into some violent measures with the colonies, that they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to their own advantage. The most that can be expected is, that they would refrain from an open rupture, with Britain.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They would undoubtedly take every clandestine method to introduce among us supplies of those things, which we stood in need of to carry on the dispute. They would not neglect any thing, in their power, to make the opposition on our part, as vigorous and ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tinate as our affairs would admit of.</p>
            <p>With respect to Holland, notwithstanding express engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary, her merchants, during the last war, were constantly supplying the French and Spaniards, with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary stores, and other things, they had occasion for. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me, or perhaps, more powerful motives, would influence them to assist us, in a like manner.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:014096_0078_0F92DD201731DDC0"/>But it seems to me a mark of great credulity to believe, upon the strength of their assurance, that France and Spain, would not take a still more interesting part, in the affair. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of these colonies from Britain, and the acquisition of a free trade with them are objects of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo inviting a complexion, to suffer those kingdoms to remain idle spectators of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. If they found us inclined to throw ourselves upon their protection, they would eagerly embrace the opportunity to weaken their a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tagonist and strengthen themselves.—Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to these general and prevailing inducements, there are others of a more particular nature. They would feel no small inconvenience, in the loss of those supplies, they aunually get from us; and their Islands in the West-Indies, would be in the greatest distress for want of our trade.</p>
            <p>From these reflections, it is more than probable, that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is able to support its freedom, even by the force of arms, if she be not betrayed, by her own sons. And, in whatever light we view the matter, the consequences to Great-Britain, would be too destructive, to permit her to proceed to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, unless she has lost all just sense of her own interest.</p>
            <p>You say, <q>the grand Congress, the <hi>piddling</hi> committees, through the continent, have <hi>all</hi> disclaimed their subjection to the sovereign authority of the empire: They deny the authority of parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make any laws, to bind them all. They claim an absolute independency. Great-Britain has no choice, but to declare the colonies independent states, or to try the force of arms, in order to bring them to a sense of their duty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is the common trick of ministerial writers to represent the Congress, as having made some new demands, which were unknown to former times; whereas, in truth, they have, in substance, acknowledged the only dependence on parliament which was ever intended, by their predecessors. Nor it true, that they have claimed an <hi>absolute independency.</hi> It is insulting common sense, to say so when it is notorious, that they have acknowledged the right of parliament to regulate the trade of the colonies. Any further dependence on it, is unnecessary and dangerous. They have professed allegiance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Can this be called <hi>absolute independency?</hi> Is it better for Britain to hazard the total loss these colonies, than to hold them upon these conditions? Is it preferable to make enemies of the people of America, instead

            </p>
            <p>This act shews clearly the sense of his Majesty's Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, his Council and the Assembly of this province, above <hi>eighty years</hi> ago, which was, that the supreme legislative authority and the exclusive power of taxation should, for ever, be and reside, in a Governor in chief, and Council, appointed by their Majesties, their heirs and successors, and the people, by their representatives, met and convened, in General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</p>
            <p>We may also infer, from hence, that the other colonies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enjoyed similar privileges, at that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, it would have been the height of presumption, in this province, to claim such important immunities, had not the others been in possession of the like.</p>
            <p>This act of itself confutes all, that has been said, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the novelty of our present claims, and proves, that the injurious reflections, on the Congress, for having risen, in their demands, are malicious and repugnant to truth.</p>
            <p>You have produced some expressions of the Congress and Assembly of this province, in 1765, which you lay great stress upon. The true meaning of them may be gathered, from the following passage, which is taken from the same piece, that contains the expressions in question: The Congress speak thus. <q>It is humbly submitted, whether there be not a material distinction, in reason and sound policy, at least, between the necessary exercise of parliamentary juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, in general acts, for the amendment of the common law, and the regulation of trade and commerce, through the whole empire, and the exercise of that jurisdiction, by imposing taxes, on the colonies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They allow only a power of making <hi>general acts</hi> for the amendment of the <hi>common law,</hi> and for the general regulation of trade. As to any special laws, to bind the colonies, in particular, they never intended submission to these; nor could they intend a right to impose special duties, of any kind, for
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:014096_0081_0F92DD2308FBF510"/>
the purpose of raising a revenue, which is, to all intents and purposes, a species of taxation.</p>
            <p>The resolves of our Assembly, the last day of December 1771, about three years afterwards, will serve as a full expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <q>As it is, not only, the common birthright of all his Majesty's subjects, but, is also essential to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peace, strength and prosperity of the British empire, that an <hi>exact equality of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the inmost recesses of the heart, that I am not influenced (in the part I take) by any unworthy motive—that, if I am in an error, it is my judgment, not my heart, that errs.—That I earnestly lament the unnatural quarrel, between the parent state and the colonies; and most ardently wish for a speedy reconciliation,—a perpetual and <hi>mutually</hi> beneficial union,—that I am a warm advocate for limitted monarchy, and an unfeigned well-wisher to the present Royal Family.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, I am inviolably attached to the essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial rights of mankind, and the true interests of society. I consider civil liberty, in a genuine unadulterated sense, as the greatest of terrestrial blessings. I am convinced, that the whole human race is intitled to it; and, that it can be wrested from no part of them, without the blackest and most aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated guilt.</p>
            <p>I verily believe also, that the best way to secure a permanent and happy union, between Great-Britain and the colonies, is to permit the latter to be as free, as they desire. To abridge their liberties, or to exercise any power over them, which they are unwilling to submit to, would be a perpetual source of discontent and animosity. A continual jealousy would exist on both sides.—This would lead to tyranny, on the one hand, and to sedition and rebellion, on the other. Impositions, not really grievous in themselves, would be thought so; and the murmurs arising from thence, would be considered as the effect of a turbulent ungovernable spirit. These jarring principles would, at length, throw all things into disorder; and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
