            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IF it was the arduous taſk of the firſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants to America, to fell the foreſt, plough the field, and defend it from ſavage beaſts, and more ſavage men; if it was the labour of their children, to make the wilderneſs "bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom like the roſe," guard their young ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements from invaſion, and their chartered rights from aggreſſion; if it was the lot of the elders of our day to reſiſt the oppreſſion of the mother country, ſeparate America from the Britiſh empire, give her independence and a conſtitution of government, CAN IT BE DOUBTED, that it falls to our lot to ſettle the adminiſtration of this government, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035024_0004_0FFFEA9D14D79240"/>
its powers, and give to our country a national CHARACTER.</p>
            <p>THE habits and manners of a young coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try become aſſimilated and familiarized by time and intercourſe. The neceſſary connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion for defence, commerce, and government, impart to a nation the virtues or vices of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent individuals; and time, which ripens all things, diſſeminates the prevailing "manners as they riſe," and forms the appropriate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character. That muſt be as immature manhood in a nation as in an individual, which on a ſudden aſſumes a national characteriſtic, unoriginated in experience. No extent of genius, no favourable propenſities, or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſenſations, ſo happily ſubſerve the great purpoſes of life to the individual or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as that knowledge and judgment which age and experience teach and inculcate. The obſervation is true, if applied to the individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual; more important ſtill, if applicable to ſmall communities; of the laſt conſequence, when applied to an extenſive empire. A country like the American continent, whoſe coaſt is more than ſixteen hundred miles, whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſtretches far to the wilderneſs, as it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes variety of clime, ſoil, and atmoſphere, may be ſuppoſed to predicate diſſimilarity
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035024_0005_0FFFEA9F819AB4A0"/>
of manners, habits, and even morals; and when we contemplate America, as the reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir for emigration from every clime and nation in Europe, the city of refuge for the oppreſſed of the earth, it is by no means ſtrange that this variety of manners, habits, and morals ſhould be increaſed. Abſurd then, muſt be the idea, that a NATIONAL CHARACTER ſhould be born in a day; time muſt aſſimilate, intercourſe and experience muſt familiarize American manners to produce a uniform national characteriſtic.</p>
            <p>THE time is now come when our attention ſhould be awakened to this important ſubject. Experience teaches us, there is nothing of ſuch intimate importance to the individual as a purity and conſiſtency of character. Anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy leads us to anticipate all this importance, as equally appropriate to the body politic. If it is advantageous to the individual to have a character that may conciliate the eſteem and affection of men, procure him confidence and reſpect from neighbours and acquaintance, much more beneficial is it to the community to poſſeſs the ſame advantage.</p>
            <p>A PERIOD of more than individual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood has elapſed ſince America was declared
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035024_0006_0FFFEAA1E8C750D8"/>
free and independent. This time has been filled with the moſt intereſting events that hiſtory ever recorded. We have ſeen thirteen colonies like thirteen brethren, united in ſelf-defence againſt the aggreſſions of an unfeeling parent. Inſpired with liberty they ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, diſdaining a yoke their fathers would not wear; we have ſeen them formed in a common band to defend their rights, or die in the attempt. We have been aſtoniſhed at a ſeries of ſucceſs, which for the undiſciplined ſtate of the country, and the want of proper means of defence, has never been equalled ſince the age of miracles ceaſed. An indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet parent has been compelled to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her error, to withdraw her commands, armies, and fleets; and America has drawn the boundary line againſt Britiſh rapacity, ſaying in the language of freedom, "hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhalt thou go, but no further."</p>
            <p>THE concluſion of the revolutionary war forms a period in American hiſtory that can never be forgot. Without an eſtabliſhed gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; without laws that could operate beyond mere recommendations; receiving an army, returning from victory, and unpaid for exalted ſervices; without reſources, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arrangement; the ſober good ſenſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035024_0007_0FFFEAA374707BF8"/>
joined to the advice of a WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, induced a band of heroes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the juſtice of that country they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for compenſation; and every man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his own home.</p>
            <p>HERE we ſee what has only been propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hiſtory: a nation peaceably returning to a ſtate of nature, and calmly deliberating how they would chuſe to be governed in future. The fathers of the country, the wiſe of the age the patriotic of the day, are ſoon ſelected by the free ſuffrage of the people, to meet, and deliberate on a form of government. The patience of inveſtigation appeared to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to the magnitude of the ſubject. The reſult of their deliberations are ſubmitted to the people, who, in an aſſembly of their delegates, ratified and confirmed it, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government for America. When this work was completed, the choice of the people ſelected men eminent for talents and abilities to compoſe their firſt Congreſs, and clothed them with authority, to originate laws and execute them according to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>FROM the adoption of the conſtitution to the preſent time, we have been making the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035024_0008_0FFFEAA524C39B18"/>
experiment, which no other nation has made before us, the efficacy of a REPRESENTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE DEMOCRACY unoriginated in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and free from all feudal tenures and embarraſſments, where liberty in its moſt rational latitude is enjoyed. The novelty of this ſcene, and its operation on the minds of more than three millions of people, ſcattered over ſuch an extent of territory, has been happy beyond a parallel. The conſtitution was predicated on the ſuppoſition of diſſimil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity in manners, intereſts, and feelings of thoſe, for whoſe benefit it was made; and may therefore be conſidered as the "reſult of a ſpirit of amity, mutual conceſſion, and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which the peculiarity of our political ſituation rendered indiſpenſable. Individuals, entering into ſociety, and agreeing on a form of government as the criterion of public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, neceſſarily give up a certain portion of their liberty to ſecure the reſt; but to draw the dividing line, between the power granted and the liberty retained, has ever been conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by all legiſlators as a moſt difficult taſk: and the difficulty is increaſed, when the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of manners and habits of thirteen ſtates are taken into view.</p>
            <p>THAT the federal conſtitution would meet the entire approbation of every ſtate in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035024_0009_0FFFEAA96F56DDB0"/>
union, much leſs of every individual of each ſtate, was never to be expected. Particular intereſts could never be conſidered without injury to the whole. A conſolidation of the union, in which the exiſtence, ſafety, and proſperity of the nation was involved, appears the leading ſentiment, the governing motives, in forming and ratifying the conſtitution of the federal government. A period mentioned for its reviſion or amendment, if it ſhall then be thought neceſſary, ſhews, that the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be made, whether it was adapted to the views, ſentiments, and intereſts of the American continent.</p>
            <p>THE experiment of a new government has ever formed an epoch in the character of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and perhaps the moſt ſudden altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their character have originated prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally from this ſource. The form of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is to the community, what education is to the individual. The emperor Julian, once ſaid of the French, "I like them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe like me, they are grave and ſerious:" little of this is now to be ſeen. The moſt ſudden alteration of character that can take place in a nation, is produced by a revolution; when the people paſs at once from liberty to ſlavery, or from ſlavery to liberty. What
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035024_0010_0FFFEAABDA8A9610"/>
nation ever exhibited more patriotiſm or love of liberty than the Romans, before the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Caeſars, and what people could diſcover more weakneſs or depravity, when they became ſubject to maſters? What na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Europe was more attached to monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and the perſon of their ſovereign, than the French, prior to their revolution, and what nation have ever defiled the annals of hiſtory like them, for cruelty to their king, and hatred of monarchy? If there is no ſuch ſtriking contraſt of character in Americans, it is becauſe Americans never were ſlaves. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience then proves that the character and ſpirit of a people change with their external circumſtances; and that "different govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments give alternately to the ſame nation, a character noble or baſe, firm or fickle, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageous or cowardly." Monarchy may form one character; ariſtocracy a ſecond; democ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy a third. Commerce has characterized Holland; agriculture the ſtates of Germany and Spain.</p>
            <p>THE beſt writers on the characters of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, generally have conſidered phyſical cauſes as much leſs operative in the production of characteriſtics than moral; the latter imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things as operate on the public mind,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035024_0011_0FFFEAAD66138348"/>
in the way of motives or reaſons, to induce a certain ſet of opinions, habits, and modes of conduct; and among the moral cauſes that have this influence, may be reckoned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, government, revolutions, reſources, and local connexions of a country.</p>
            <p>IT is true indeed, that air, food, and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate have their influence on animals; the brutal ſpecies of one clime may differ from the ſame ſpecies in another: yet on man, this uniformity of effect is interrupted by his reflective powers. China is remarkable for uniformity of character, yet the air and cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of that vaſt extended empire, is ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly various. Thebes and Athens were but a ſhort days journey from each other, and yet the Athenians were as remarkable for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, politeneſs, and gaiety, as the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans were for dulneſs and ruſticity. Rivers and mountains ſeparate nations, whoſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters form a perfect contraſt. Europe, Aſia, and America have not, by their various climes, changed the national character of the Jew, Turk, or Greek.</p>
            <p>NATIONAL characters, not originating in fixed moral cauſes, are ſometimes produced from cauſes accidental. If a Brutus is raiſed to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035024_0012_0FFFEAAEF182DDA0"/>
and will ſacrifice his ſon if he violates the laws; or if a WASHINGTON will ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice private intereſt to public good; ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will do much to form a national char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteriſtic; and, "whatever that is, which forms the national features, the ſucceeding generation will imbibe a deeper tincture of the ſame dye."</p>
            <p>IF we attempt to mention the moſt uſual ſources from which a national character orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inates, we muſt begin with religion, as laying the foundation.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt legiſlators of antiquity have judged it impoſſible to raiſe ſuch mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence among men, as to form a government or ſupport it, without the aid of religion. Cicero exerts all his eloquence to prove, "that a proper reverence for the gods is the only proper baſis of civil government, order, and happineſs in a commonwealth." If common want, or common danger, have united men for a time, while fear, novelty, or enthuſiaſm have been predominant, yet, when eaſe and tranquillity are reſtored, and time given for the operation of the private paſſions; inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the continuance of a regular government are ſaid not to be found, independent of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035024_0013_0FFFEAB24D26A360"/>
principles. "It is religious principle, by the ſanction of an oath, which binds a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their rulers, and rulers to the people;" and the univerſal cuſtom of demanding it from all in authority; the important light in which it has been viewed, as the ſtrongeſt ſecurity, both of veracity in aſſerting, and fidelity in promiſing, which one man can give another, is proof of the poſition; which cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom could never have obtained, without an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent opinion, deeply rooted in the minds of men, that a belief of a Deity, and a ſenſe of his being the witneſs and judge of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, was one of the ſtrongeſt engagements to act juſtly and honeſtly with one another.</p>
            <p>INFORM individuals ever ſo frequently, that their private intereſt is connected with the public good, and that hence is derived their obligation to ſupport government, law, and ſubordination, and you will find, "that the empire of ſocial laws cannot be ſeparated from the ſupports of religion." Place the origin of your property as far back as you pleaſe; let the rich tell the poor their eſtates are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended through many generations; and their reply may be this: "Your diſtinctions of property are all wrong; all men are equal; your notions of juſtice were eſtabliſhed for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035024_0014_0FFFEAB599C96508"/>
the few, at the expenſe of the many: we ſee no equality in the world, we declare war with your palaces, but peace with cottages:" come to a diviſion, for we will not be "hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of wood, or drawers of water," unleſs you are ſtrongeſt. Will you oppoſe this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by pleading the injuſtice of a new diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion? What care they for juſtice, ſince you have told them, "there is no God but reaſon, and that death is an everlaſting ſleep." They will ſay your laws of juſtice were framed by the rich to oppreſs the poor; that the wants of the former bear no proportion to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the latter; and that the fate of the moſt numerous part of every community is fixed in wretchedneſs, ſo long as the preſent ſyſtem of law and ſubordination continues. Far be it then from philoſophy to produce conviction againſt perſonal intereſt by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice: a more commanding influence is wanted, and religion alone poſſeſſes it. The baſis of government and law, is laid in the priority of religious opinions, to which all laws are allied, and by the influence of which, they alone can be maintained.</p>
            <p>UNDER the influence of religious opinions, the face of the moral world changes, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety becomes a bleſſing. Rulers preſide
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035024_0015_0FFFEAB723E97B40"/>
with ſecurity to themſelves; and are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſurrounded with the military power of the nation, to ſave their heads from the guillotine, or compelled to cruſh, by the moſt arbitrary meaſures, all competitors for power. The peaceable, inoffenſive ſubject has all the ſecurity, with regard to life, liberty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that the "ſenſe of an Almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in his own breaſt, or the ſuppoſed awe of Almighty power, in the heart of others, can poſſibly give him;" while all who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be unjuſt, contentious, and hoſtile, muſt firſt break looſe from all the ties of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and conſcience, and to come at the life, liberty, and property of others; expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the penalty of human laws, and the diſpleaſure of Heaven, and be literally fools, before they can be knaves.</p>
            <p>IF we ſuppoſe religion neceſſary to ſupport civil government, and lay the foundation of a national character; yet it muſt be granted, much of the utility of religion will depend on the nature of it. All kinds of religion that have been profeſſed in the world, have not had the ſame happy tendency on ſociety, gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and laws. A religion, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Deity, as cruel and arbitrary, armed with power, only to inflict miſery; eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035024_0016_0FFFEAB8AF3B9D20"/>
and implacable when angry; muſt excite diſguſt, and ſpread gloom and horror over the mind; ſour the human diſpoſition, and beget a dark, unſocial, ſuſpicious temper, that will pervade the whole conduct. The ſenſations man muſt feel to a being of this character, are the ſenſations of a ſlave towards his maſter. The government formed, the laws inſtituted, the habits and manners gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated, will partake of all that inhumanity and cruelty, the natural reſult of ſuch impreſſions.</p>
            <p>BUT, if the religion of a country repreſents the Deity poſſeſſed of all poſſible perfection, combined in one undivided eſſence, wherein infinite wiſdom, power, and goodneſs are unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; tenderly concerned for the welfare of his offspring; making proviſion for their temporal enjoyment and eternal felicity; the preſent witneſs and future judge of all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and who will finally reward every one according to his works: If this religion rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſents all virtue as a tranſcript of his moral perfections; and what he muſt ever be inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inculcate on all his offspring; as being in itſelf, what he loves and approves, and in the increaſe and diſplay of which, his glory, and his creatures' happineſs muſt forever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; the moſt natural conſequence of ſuch
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035024_0017_0FFFEABD001178A8"/>
conceptions, will be correſpondent ſenſations towards this Being, a love and veneration for him, as the ſource of excellence; a humble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation of his perfections; a love and good will towards all the creatures he has made. The right or wrong conceptions man has formed of his Maker, have given a caſt to all his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, principles, and conduct. The tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the reverence, to the imitation, of the Being worſhipped; whether he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived good or bad, is both eaſy and natural. Mount Gerizim had anciently, viſitants of one deſcription; the valley of Hinnom, another.</p>
            <p>WHILE ſuperſtition miſtakes the God of juſtice for the God of vengeance; and can view him in no other attitude, but with the uplifted thunderbolt, well may this account for the long catalogue of heathen deities, in ancient mythology; the abſurd rites, cruel laws, and oppreſſive cuſtoms of Pagan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity: and this may be the reaſon of that unfeeling barbarity, which, prior to chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, characterized every country of the Pagan world. A belief of lords many, and gods many; an imitation of their characters; an obedience to their commands; are, of all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the moſt ancient, and of all ſuperſtitions, the moſt miſchievous to ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:035024_0018_0FFFEABE88F3E2A8"/>BUT the religion of our country teaches us to harmonize all perfection in one Being; and explains each attribute of his nature in perfect conſiſtency with the reſt. The ſyſtem of faith produced, as the natural conſequence, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional; and the baſis of political and moral virtue, well explained, permanent and laſting. We have the proper motives in our religion, that produce conſtancy in duty; "a divine legiſlator, ſpeaking from heaven; an omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient witneſs, beholding our conduct; an omnipotent judge, declaring he will reward or puniſh us, according to juſtice." Theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives only can awe man, "ſupport integrity, check guilt; they add to morality, the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that ſhould ever attend it, and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of conſcience, they give the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of law:" Their co-operation with the virtuous diſpoſitions of good men, enſure an influence, to make them conſtant and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, in all the duties of men and citizens. If it ſhould be ſaid, that great irregularities are often found in countries that profeſs this religion, it may be replied, the irregularity proceeds not from the religion, but from the abuſe of it; and what gift of heaven has not been abuſed? If we are told how much war and bloodſhed has been occaſioned by chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, ſince it has been publiſhed; we will
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035024_0019_0FFFEAC0F0099798"/>
thank the deiſt to tell us, how much better the world would have been if chriſtianity had never been known: until which information, we beg leave to rejoice in the profeſſion of a religion, operative and commanding in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; a religion, that addreſſes all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ennobles all our faculties, and reſtrains all our unhappy propenſities; a religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing inſtitutions, which form the pillars of government, and without which, it muſt ſoon totter in ruin. By inſtitutions, I mean the public worſhip of God, on the weekly ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; the inſtitution of marriage for life; and the ſolemn promiſe of parents, in the baptiſm of their children, that they will bring them up, in the "nurture and admonition of the Lord."</p>
            <p>SUCH being the excellency of our religion, need it be ſaid, that Americans ſhould be characterized as a people, who "fear God, and regard man?" juſt, humane, generous in their dealings; ſober, reflective, determined, reſolute; patient, perſevering in all the duties of men and citizens! This character is but the natural conſequence of a firm belief in, and practice of, the duties of our religion.</p>
            <p>IF we take off our attention from the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035024_0020_0FFFEAC27B3349E8"/>
and fix it on the government of our country, another ſource will be added, from which the American character ought to be formed.</p>
            <p>NEXT in importance, to our connexion with him who made us, muſt be our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one another. Neceſſity compels us to unite in ſociety; and when united, we ſeek protection from the inſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We give up a part of our natural lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to ſecure the reſt; and if we find no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the government, we ſeek it from individuals; and by ſubmiſſion to ſome dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue, court that favour, which from the government was hoped for in vain. Thus anarchy is the immediate cauſe of tyranny. Barbarians, on this account, never enjoy lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, which requires refinement in laws and inſtitutions, and obedience to them; and ſuch a ſacrifice of private intereſt to public good, as can only reſult from reflection and experience; and grow to perfection, under a regular gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Every government ſhould further be adapted to the local ſituation and character of thoſe, for whom it is made. It was thus in ancient times among the Jews, and in mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern times among the Arabs; religion was made the principal object of government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035024_0021_0FFFEAC5C44CA5A0"/>
religion was the moſt ſingular and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing feature of their character. For the ſame reaſon, no doubt, literature characterized the government of Athens; commerce, Tyre and Carthage; navigation, Rhodes; and war, Sparta. A free government ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be diſtinguiſhed, by affording the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject liberty and ſecurity. By liberty is meant, "a right to do what the laws of ſociety have neither poſitively, nor impliedly forbidden;" and by ſecurity is meant, ſuch a limitation of the ſupreme power, and ſuch a diſtribution of the ſeveral parts of it, as beſt enſures the greateſt happineſs of the greateſt number. Perfect political ſecurity would be obtained, if the intereſt of rulers, and the ruled, could be rendered perfectly indiſtinguiſhable; and the neareſt approach to this perfection of ſecurity, that the people can have in a free government, is, when the ſeveral portions of power, which, when united, forms the ſupreme power, are ſo diſtributed and arranged, as that interference and uſurpation may be prevented. This happy diſtribution of the ſeveral portions of power, and harmonious arrangement, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent interference, are moſt pleaſingly illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in the form of government, contained in our federal conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:035024_0022_0FFFEAC9074E4128"/>THE government of the United States, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the ſupreme power into three branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: viz. the legiſlative, judicial, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: the relative importance of each branch, with limitations of their powers, is delineated, and ſpecially deſcribed in the conſtitution; by which limitations and reſtrictions, checks and balances, are formed for the mutual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole. Our government then, is a government of checks and balances, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its nature, and like the ſolar ſyſtem, can only be preſerved, when every part retains its juſt and harmonious proportion of power. This mixed form of government, has been clearly demonſtrated, by ſeveral writers, of high eminence in the literary world; and by none more forcibly, than by our beloved Chief Magiſtrate, as containing the moſt complex proviſion of liberty and ſafety for the people; and uniting the two eſſential requiſites for gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, wiſdom and ſtrength, in the higheſt, and yet ſafeſt degree.</p>
            <p>OUR national liberty, undoubtedly conſiſts in governing ourſelves, according to our nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural rights: and, as we were never ſlaves to foreigners abroad, or any claſs of men at home; ſo neither the many of any other country, nor the few of our own, have any right to dictate
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035024_0023_0FFFEA2E274DFB30"/>
to us, what government to adopt, as to form, nor how it ſhall be adminiſtered.</p>
            <p>THE conſtitution of the federal government guarantees to the individual ſtates in the union, a republican form of government, with lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to make ſuch laws, as do not interfere or oppoſe, the general adminiſtration. It grants each ſtate protection from foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and internal commotion and ſedition. It grants each individual American, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all perſonal advantages he may acquire, without injury to others; with the rights of perſonal ſecurity, property, liberty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reputation, opinion, ſpeech, and religion. But even theſe are not granted, without this neceſſary limitation; that they ſhould be ſo exerciſed and enjoyed, as may be conſiſtent with the like privileges in others. This ſeems the conſtitutional idea of equality. It does not mean that the ſame degrees of wealth, or power, ſhould be enjoyed by every individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual of the community; but that property merely ſhould be no title to power; and that power ſhould never be exerciſed, contrary to law, and the conſtitution. In ſhort, equality, under the form of government we have adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſiſts ſummarily in this, that like priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges, ſhould be extended to like perſons, in like circumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:035024_0024_0FFFEACDE66C8858"/>THESE ſeem the rights ſecured to individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, and to the ſeveral ſtates in the union, by the conſtitution of our general government; the branches of which are equally ſupreme, coequal, and coeval; deriving their power and energy from the ſame ſource—the will of the people. And ſuch is the nice adjuſtment and diſtribution of power, that each muſt, and ought fairly to exerciſe its own functions, and neither check or uſurp the powers of each other. When this is the caſe, the government is harmonious, and all that liberty is enjoyed under it, which government can give, or the moſt complex proviſion, for the liberty of the people can enſure. This ſacred palladium of American liberty, the conſtitution, like the law of teſtimonies of the Hebrew polity, is the great ſtandard of political rectitude to Americans; the polar ſtar, by which they are to be guided, in all their political diſquiſitions, and legiſlative conduct.</p>
            <p>NEED it be added, that a ſecond feature in the American character, ought to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable love of liberty; a decided pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence of a government of laws, to a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men; that they ought to guard their independence from all foreign intrigue and dictation; and their conſtitution and laws, from violation and interruption?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:035024_0025_0FFFEACF85382E80"/>THE revolution we have experienced, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but have an influence in forming our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. This revolution, for the honour of America, did not originate in a mad ambition for independence; nor in a deſire to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out government, ſubordination, and religion; but in a deſire to enjoy unimpaired, the rights of Britiſh ſubjects. When Britain aſſumed a right to tax us, without our conſent, and bind us by laws, when we were not repreſented; after petitioning in vain, we drew the ſword for preſervation, not for conqueſt; to preſerve the rights we had, rather than to acquire more. When our ſtruggle was crowned with ſucceſs, we manifeſted the principle, for which we fought, by an immediate attention to the inſtitution of a form of government, founded on the principles of liberty and equity.</p>
            <p>IT has ever been the object then, of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, to ſupport government, order, and the reign of equal laws: that anarchy ſhould be prevented; that a free, generous ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obedience to the conſtituted authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould prevail; that jealouſy ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all attempts of foreign influence; and while we are careful not to interfere in the government of other nations, no nation ſhall
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035024_0026_0FFFEAD2CE853960"/>
take greater liberties with us, than we do with them.</p>
            <p>IF from the revolution, we turn our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſources of our country, ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent impreſſions will be made on the public mind.</p>
            <p>THE ſituation of the American continent; its ſoil and climate; its extent of coaſt; its fiſheries, and other local advantages, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſignate us, as an agricultural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial nation. The earth produces the neceſſaries of life in abundance, with ſome of its luxuries; and internal commerce may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us almoſt, if not quite, independent, on any foreign clime. The raw materials, which are more than the inhabitants can manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or conſume; the fiſheries on our ſhores; the ſeamen on our capes and bays, deſignate us, as our own carriers to other nations, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocity and fair dealing can be obtained: and if not, our foreſts ſupply the materials, and our mechanics can faſhion them into wooden walls of defence; or we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſupplies from thoſe who want our prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uce, until terms of accommodation can take place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:035024_0027_0FFFEAD458C0F1D0"/>NEED we then be told, that poſſeſſing ſuch a country, and ſuch reſources; the inheritance of our fathers; that we need not haſtily ſtoop to foreign impoſition? While young we ſtood unmoved, againſt one power in Europe; ſhall we baſely ſubmit to the dictation of another? Let us rather appreciate our own country, while we are thus favoured of Heaven; and guard againſt ſelling it, "for leſs than a meſs of pottage."</p>
            <p>AND when we conſider the poſition of our country, as it reſpects Europe; that an ocean of three thouſand miles, ſeparates this happy land, from older governments; what ought we to expect leſs than this; that as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion as poſſible with other nations, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be our policy? That while they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and make peace, as intereſt dictates, we will guard againſt partiality, and attend to our own concerns. That as acceſſion of territory is not needed, ſo the deſire of domination and conqueſt, ſhall be put far from us.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe materials, a character ought to be formed; from theſe ſources it ought to originate. Americans ought to be character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, as firmly attached to the religion of their fathers; partial to the government of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035024_0028_0FFFEAD5E33D8BA0"/>
their choice; dignified in their ſubmiſſion to the conſtituted authorities; delighted with their own country, and ambitious to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely independent of any other.</p>
            <p>BUT is this thy character, my country? "If weighed in the balance, it is feared thou wilt be found wanting." Attempts are made to corrupt the fountain, from whence the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thy character ſhould flow.</p>
            <p>"We have heard with our ears, and our fathers have told us," that "righteouſneſs, exalts a nation; while ſin is a reproach to any people." This venerable maxim of ethics, has been taught us by that religion, for the enjoyment and unmoleſted profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which, our fathers left the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of connexions and friends, croſſed the Atlantic, and began a ſettlement in the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican wilderneſs. It was this religion that formed the baſis of their laws. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it the foundation of their hopes, the ſource of their conſolation in every diſtreſſing period. To tranſmit this religion, with the pure worſhip of God, and the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to their children, animated them in their labours, and conſoled them in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes. Little did they think their children
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035024_0029_0FFFEADA235EB7D0"/>
would ſo ſoon be told, their religion wanted evidence to ſupport it. That the ſcriptures were contradictory; a compoſition of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; contrived by politicians, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of tyranny, for prieſts and impoſtors. Little did thoſe venerable men, who firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated the precepts of the goſpel, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſettlements of this country think, that not two centuries would elapſe, before their aſhes would be inſulted, with publications, that "defame God, and diſhonour man." Little did they think, any of their true deſcendants would believe, "man was ſeparated from God and time from eternity," that blindneſs needs no guide, and perverſeneſs no reſtraint. Could they have conceived, that ſociety would be declared, happy without principle, and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment without religion? That the ſabbath was a nuiſance; public worſhip prieſtcraft; prayer a dictation to the Almighty, and praiſe ſuperſtition. That marriage was tyranny, property a prejudice, and the reign of law, the enforcement of arbitrary power? It was not probable believers would be multiplied, in theſe doctrines; or that a quixotic love for the univerſe, was to be expreſſed, by a hatred of that part of it we inhabit: or that to aid foreigners in their views of univerſal
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035024_0030_0FFFEADBAF602C80"/>
empire, any one American could be found willing to demoralize the world, to make way for illumination. Venality like this, is not the growth of a day: corruption, though haſty in its approach, walks not with ſuch unuſual ſtrides. "An enemy has done this," the tares appear among the wheat, may the harveſt of them be haſtened.</p>
            <p>LET us return to the ſimplicity of our fathers; to the virtuous manners of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; and take warning from that nation, "whoſe foul abominations," are breaking looſe like a torrent, and threaten Europe with another age of Gothic barbarity. Let us cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate a veneration for religion, and early ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation. Let not the wit of ſome, the ſarcaſm of others, or the unfounded aſſertions and ridicule of the many, leſſen your belief in, and practice of, that religion, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims, "peace on earth, and good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men." "Remember the ſabbath day, to keep it holy:" This is the natural barrier of vice, the great means under God, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and comfort: and let us remember, that when ſociety can be perſuaded to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the ſabbath, forſake the altar of worſhip, magnify morality to the diſparagement of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious faith, ſilent meditation, to the public
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035024_0031_0FFFEADE1B645828"/>
reverence of Deity; the world is robbed of the very means which has preſerved religion on earth, that has kept mankind in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſenſible of the God that made them, the rock of their ſalvation. Conduct this, which opens the door of licentiouſneſs, which no penal ſtatutes of the magiſtrate, or cloſet meditation of the recluſe, can ever ſhut.</p>
            <p>NEXT to an attempt to corrupt our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may be ranked the endeavours to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert our government.</p>
            <p>COULD it once be imagined, that Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans who deliberately formed and eſtabliſhed their own government; who freely chuſe and inveſt their own rulers; who ſee them poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the ſame intereſts and feelings with themſelves, ſhould ever encourage inſidious attempts to divide the people from their gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment? Conſidering the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have adopted, is there one honeſt man on the continent who does not ſee, that to magnify one branch of it to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other, is to deſtroy it? Who ever loved or ſupported his friend by halves? and who does not know, that every conſtruction
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035024_0032_0FFFEADFC6D76760"/>
of the conſtitution, which tends to magnify one branch at the expenſe of the other, tends to interrupt its harmony, and deſtroy its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? If for inſtance the executive power uſurps the legiſlative; or the legiſlative the executive; or the judicial either; ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference deſtroys the unity and energy of the whole.</p>
            <p>THAT in a mixed government, the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branch ſhould be jealous of the judicial and executive, is by no means new or unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: "Vigilance is laudable, undue jealouſy is deſtructive." It may ariſe to ſuch height as to bring on interference and conteſt for power, and finally, end in the monopoly of all power in one branch: and when ever this is the caſe, the conſtitution is violated; the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is changed; the balance of power is deſtroyed; and from being a government of laws, it becomes at once a government of men.</p>
            <p>THAT attempts have been made by foreign intrigue and inteſtine ambition, to excite this unreaſonable jealouſy; that the people have been flattered at the expenſe of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no candid American can doubt. The
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035024_0033_0FFFEAE31E8EA1C0"/>
powers veſted by the conſtitution in the exec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utive, have been examined and re-examined; and the exerciſe of this power carefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the limits preſcribed in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and when it was found that in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance has this power been exceeded, the next ſtep was, "ſo to conſtrue the conſtitution, as impliedly to charge the executive with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct exceeding its bounds. This was the ſpirit of the attack reſpecting the treaty; and the ſame ſpirit ſhewed itſelf in the amendment to the bill on foreign intercourſe. The treaty was a proper ſubject to excite jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, as it was in many parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent very unpopular; the people not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the means of judging were againſt it then; though now they ſeem generally convinced of the wiſdom and policy of the meaſure.</p>
            <p>THE views of thoſe who directed theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks on the executive, become apparent from this circumſtance; that if the conſtitution was violated, he ought to have been impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this was not done, and we have a right to conclude, that the executive acted within the pale of the conſtitution. If the executive
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035024_0034_0FFFEAE66C87DB48"/>
acted within the pale of the conſtitution, an attempt to reſtrain him in the exerciſe of conſtitutional power is interference; unleſs the conſtitution gives him too much power; and if this be the caſe, the error is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and not in him who adminiſters it.</p>
            <p>BUT will Americans ſuffer theſe attempts to go unpuniſhed? They will not; they know that a "houſe divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand;" they will puniſh attempts to divide the government. They will rally round the ſtandard of union, and will remember, that if a republican government cannot exiſt and be maintained in America, it can exiſt no where but on paper, or in the viſions of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. They will appreciate the bleſſings they enjoy, and feel the duty of tranſmitting them to poſterity. They will remember their maxim, "UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL;" and while they ſee the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpected, the laws executed, and their rulers attached to their own country and its freedom, will yield them at all times reſpect and ſupport.</p>
            <p>NEXT to the government, we have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035024_0035_0FFFEAE8D65C49F8"/>
an attempt to pervert the principles of our revolution.</p>
            <p>OUR character has been repreſented abroad as hating the country from which we origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; and that this hatred gave riſe to the revolution, and would now lead us to comply with any meaſures our pretended friends in France pleaſe to dictate. But where is the man who can be guilty of ſuch ſacrilege to the memory of thoſe heroes who fell in the cauſe of freedom as to ſay, that hatred to the mother country was the cauſe of their reſiſtance? and not rather that her unjuſt aggreſſions of power created the ſeparation? We underſtand this better in America. We fought for the rights of men and citizens; for that juſtice which was denied us in jealouſy; and when it was gained by our arms, we retired to "our vines and fig trees," determined to live "peaceably with all men." We were juſt to all who aſſiſted us, though the ſervants of none. As the iſſue of the revolutionary war gave us a rank among the nations of the earth; it has been our object to keep our faith with all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſupport our own government and laws; deal with the contending powers in Europe
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035024_0036_0FFFEAEB42A5E310"/>
on principles of honour, according to the laws of nations, and with integrity.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch reſources in our power, and at ſuch a happy diſtance from Europe, can it be believed, that we ſhall willingly interfere in their quarrels, or by any connexion, not orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inating in the moſt imperious neceſſity, have any intercourſe but what is founded in reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity and mutual good faith? IT CAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOT.</p>
            <p>AMERICANS are awakened; their eyes are opened to their intereſts and dangers; and if for a time we were inſenſible to aggreſſions and not haſty in reſentment, indignation is deferred but to collect its force; and if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, imperious neceſſity, compels us to the field in ſelf defence; Americans know a WASHINGTON yet lives, and is appointed to lead his former brethren in arms; while an ADAMS in the cabinet, holds with ſteady firmneſs the helm of ſtate. In this critical period, may the features of our national char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter appear; may the voice of every Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican join in the declaration, that the LIBERTY,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035024_0037_0FFFEAECD16717E8"/>
INDEPENDENCE, and RELIGION of our COUNTRY are INSEPARABLE.</p>
