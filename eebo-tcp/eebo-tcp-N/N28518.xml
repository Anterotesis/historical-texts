            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>IT is a ſingular injuſtice which is often exerciſed towards women, firſt to give them a very defective Education, and then to expect from them the moſt undeviating purity of conduct;—to train them in ſuch a manner as ſhall lay them open to the moſt dangerous faults, and then to cenſure them for not proving faultleſs. Is it not unreaſonable and unjuſt, to expreſs diſappointment if our daughters ſhould, in their ſubſequent lives, turn out preciſely that very kind of character for which it would be evident to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced by-ſtander that the whole ſcope and tenor of their inſtruction had been ſyſtematically prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them?</p>
                  <p>Some reflections on the preſent erroneous ſyſtem are here with great deference ſubmitted to public conſideration. The Author is apprehenſive that ſhe ſhall be accuſed of betraying the intereſts of her ſex by laying open their defects: but ſurely, an earneſt wiſh to turn their attention to objects calculated to
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:037996_0009_100FA9161FAD7B58"/>
promote their true dignity, is not the office of an enemy. So to expoſe the weakneſs of the land as to ſuggeſt the neceſſity of internal improvement, and to point out the means of effectual defence, is not treachery, but patriotiſm.</p>
                  <p>Again, it may be objected to this little work, that many errors are here aſcribed to women which by no means belong to them <hi>excluſively,</hi> and that it ſeems to confine to the ſex thoſe faults which are common to the ſpecies: but this is in ſome meaſure unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. In ſpeaking on the qualities of one ſex, the moraliſt is ſomewhat in the ſituation of the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher, who is treating on the nature of one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:—the air, ſoil, and produce of the land which he is deſcribing, cannot fail in many eſſential points to reſemble thoſe of other countries under the ſame parallel; yet it is his buſineſs to deſcant on the one without adverting to the other: and though in drawing his map he may happen to introduce ſome of the neighbouring coaſt, yet his principal attention muſt be confined to that country which he propoſes to deſcribe, without taking into account the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling circumſtances of the adjacent ſhores.</p>
                  <p>It may be alſo objected that the opinion here ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted on the ſtate of manners among the higher claſſes of our country-women, may ſeem to contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the juſt encomiums of modern travellers, who
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:037996_0010_100FA918B6A2E488"/>
generally concur in aſcribing a decided ſuperiority to the ladies of this country over thoſe of every other. But ſuch is the ſtate of foreign manners, that the comparative praiſe is almoſt an injury to <hi>Engliſh</hi> women. To be flattered for excelling thoſe whoſe ſtandard of excellence is very low, is but a degrading kind of commendation; for the value of all praiſe derived from ſuperiority depends on the worth of the competitor. The character of Britiſh ladies, with all the unparalleled advantages they poſſeſs, muſt never be determined by a compariſon with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of other nations, but by what they themſelves might be if all their talents and unrivalled opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were turned to the beſt account.</p>
                  <p>Again, it may be ſaid, that the Author is leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to expatiate on excellence than error: but the office of the hiſtorian of human manners is delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather than panegyric. Were the end in view eulogium and not improvement, eulogium would have been far more gratifying, nor would juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for praiſe have been difficult to find. Even in her own limited ſphere of obſervation, the Author is acquainted with much excellence in the claſs of which ſhe treats;—with women who, poſſeſſing learning which would be thought extenſive in the other ſex, ſet an example of deep humility to their own;—women who, diſtinguiſhed for wit and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:037996_0011_100FA91A427A3F30"/>
are eminent for domeſtic qualities;—who, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in the fine arts, have carefully enriched their underſtandings;—who, enjoying great affluence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote it to the glory of God;—who, poſſeſſing ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated rank, think their nobleſt ſtyle and title is that of a Chriſtian.—</p>
                  <p>That there is alſo much worth which is little known, ſhe is perſuaded; for it is the modeſt nature of goodneſs to exert itſelf quietly, while a few cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the oppoſite caſt ſeem, by the rumour of their exploits, to fill the world; and by their noiſe to multiply their numbers. It often happens that a very ſmall party of people, by occupying the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, ſo ſeize the public attention, and monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the public talk, that <hi>they</hi> appear to be the great body: and a few active ſpirits, provided their activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty take the wrong turn and ſupport the wrong cauſe, ſeem to fill the ſcene; and a few diſturbers of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who have the talent of thus exciting a falſe idea of their multitudes by their miſchiefs, actually gain ſtrength and ſwell their numbers by this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious arithmetic.</p>
                  <p>But the preſent work is no more intended for a panegyric on thoſe purer characters who ſeek not human praiſe becauſe they act from a higher motive, than for a ſatire on the avowedly licentious, who, urged by the impulſe of the moment or led away

                  <p>There are, however, multitudes of the young and the well-diſpoſed, who have as yet taken no decided part, who are juſt launching on the ocean of life, juſt about to loſe their own right convictions, and to counteract their better propenſities, unreluctantly yielding themſelves to be carried down the tide of popular practices, ſanguine and confident of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—To theſe the Author would gently hint, that, when once embarked, it will be no longer eaſy to ſay to their paſſions, or even to their principles, "Thus far ſhall ye go, and no further."</p>

the peril of broken promiſes or the guilt of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated vows.—But, if the obligation which Chriſtian Baptiſm impoſes be really binding;—if the ordinance have, indeed, a meaning beyond a mere ſecular tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, beyond a record of names and dates;—if it be an inſtitution by which the child is ſolemnly devoted to God as his Father, to Jeſus Chriſt as his Saviour, and to the Holy Spirit as his Sanctifier; if there be no definite period aſſigned when the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of fulfilling the duties it enjoins ſhall be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded;—if, having once dedicated our offspring to their Creator, we no longer dare to mock Him by bringing them up in ignorance of His Will and neglect of His Laws;—if, after having enliſted them under the banners of Chriſt, to fight manfully againſt the three great enemies of mankind, we are no longer at liberty to let them lay down their arms; much leſs to lead them to act as if in alliance inſtead of hoſtility with theſe enemies;—if after having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that they ſhall renounce the vanities of the world, we are not allowed to invalidate the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—if after ſuch a covenant we ſhould tremble to make theſe renounced vanities the ſupreme object of our own purſuit or of <hi>their</hi> inſtruction;—if all this be really ſo, then the Strictures on Modern Education, and on the Habits of poliſhed Life, will not be found ſo repugnant to truth, and reaſon, and

                  <p>But if on candidly ſumming up the evidence, the deſign and ſcope of the Author be fairly judged, not by the cuſtoms or opinions of the worldly, (for every Engliſh ſubject has a right to object to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or prejudiced jury,) but by an appeal to that divine law which is the only infallible rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if on ſuch an appeal her views and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhall be found cenſurable for their rigour, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in their requiſitions, or prepoſterous in their reſtrictions, ſhe will have no right to complain of ſuch a verdict, becauſe ſhe will then ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by that court to whoſe deciſion ſhe impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly ſubmits.</p>

                        <p>Addreſs to women of rank and fortune, on the effects of their influence on ſociety.—Suggeſtions for the exertion of it in various inſtances.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AMONG the talents for the application of which women of the higher claſs will be peculiarly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there is one, the importance of which they can ſcarcely rate too highly. This talent is influence. We read of the greateſt orator of antiquity, that the wiſeſt plans which it had coſt him years to frame, a woman could overturn in a ſingle day; and when one conſiders the variety of miſchiefs which an ill-directed influence has been known to produce, one is led to reflect with the moſt ſanguine hope on the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037996_0017_100FA92BCF3EDCD0"/>
beneficial effects to be expected from the ſame power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force when exerted in its true direction.</p>
                     <p>The general ſtate of civilized ſociety depends, more than thoſe are aware, who are not accuſtomed to ſcrutinize into the ſprings of human action, on the prevailing ſentiments and habits of women, and on the nature and degree of the eſtimation in which they are held. Even thoſe who admit the power of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male elegance on the manners of men, do not always attend to the influence of female principles on their character. In the former caſe, indeed, women are apt to be ſufficiently conſcious of their power, and not backward in turning it to account. But there are nobler objects to be effected by the exertion of their powers, and unfortunately, ladies, who are often unreaſonably confident where they ought to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, are ſometimes capriciouſly diffident juſt when they ought to feel where their true importance lies; and, feeling, to exert it. To uſe their boaſted power over mankind to no higher purpoſe than the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of vanity or the indulgence of pleaſure, is the degrading triumph of thoſe fair victims to luxury, caprice, and deſpotiſm, whom the laws and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the voluptuous prophet of Arabia exclude from light, and liberty, and knowledge; and it is humbling to reflect, that in thoſe countries in which fondneſs for the mere perſons of women is carried to the higheſt exceſs, <hi>they are ſlaves;</hi> and that their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037996_0018_100FA92E63BEC1C0"/>
moral and intellectual degradation increaſes in direct proportion to the adoration which is paid to mere external charms.</p>
                     <p>But I turn to the bright reverſe of this mortifying ſcene; to a country where our ſex enjoys the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of liberal inſtruction, of reaſonable laws, of a pure religion, and all the endearing pleaſures of an equal, ſocial, virtuous, and delightful intercourſe: I turn with an earneſt hope, that women, thus richly endowed with the bounties of Providence, will not content themſelves with poliſhing, when they are able to reform; with entertaining, when they may awaken; and with captivating for a day, when they may bring into action powers of which the effects may be commenſurate with eternity.</p>
                     <p>In this moment of alarm and peril, I would call on them with a "warning voice," which would ſtir up every latent principle in their minds, and kindle every ſlumbering energy in their hearts; I would call on them to come forward, and contribute their full and fair proportion towards the ſaving of their country. But I would call on them to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, without departing from the refinement of their character, without derogating from the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their rank, without blemiſhing the delicacy of their ſex: I would call them to the beſt and moſt appropriate exertion of their power, to raiſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed tone of public morals, and to awaken the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037996_0019_100FA92FEB5D0B30"/>
drowſy ſpirit of religious principle. They know too well how arbitrarily they give the law to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and with how deſpotic a ſway they fix the ſtandard of faſhion. But this is not enough; this is a low mark, a prize not worthy of their high and holy calling. For, on the uſe which women of the ſuperior claſs may be diſpoſed to make of that power delegated to them by the courteſy of cuſtom, by the honeſt gallantry of the heart, by the imperious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol of virtuous affections, by the habits of civilized ſtates, by the uſages of poliſhed ſociety; on the uſe, I ſay, which they ſhall hereafter make of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, will depend, in no low degree, the well-being of thoſe ſtates, and the virtue and happineſs, nay perhaps the very exiſtence of that ſociety.</p>
                     <p>At this period, when our country can only hope to ſtand by oppoſing a bold and noble <hi>unanimity</hi> to the moſt tremendous confederacies againſt religion, and order, and governments, which the world ever ſaw; what an acceſſion would it bring to the public ſtrength, could we prevail on beauty, and rank, and talents, and virtue, confederating their ſeveral pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to come forward with a patriotiſm at once firm and feminine for the general good! I am not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an alarm to female warriors, nor exciting female politicians: I hardly know which of the two is the moſt diſguſting and unnatural character. Propriety is to a woman what the great Roman critic ſays
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037996_0020_100FA93285C635E0"/>
action is to an orator; it is the firſt, the ſecond, the third requiſite. A woman may be knowing, active, witty, and amuſing; but without propriety ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be amiable. Propriety is the centre in which all the lines of duty and of agreeableneſs meet. It is to character what proportion is to figure, and grace to attitude. It does not depend on any one perfection; but it is the reſult of general excellence. It ſhews itſelf by a regular, orderly, undeviating courſe; and never ſtarts from its ſober orbit into any ſplendid ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centricities; for it would be aſhamed of ſuch praiſe as it might extort by any aberrations from its proper path. It renounces all commendation but what is characteriſtic; and I would make it the criterion of true taſte, right principle, and genuine feeling, in a woman, whether ſhe would be leſs touched with all the flattery of romantic and exaggerated panegyric than with that beautiful picture of correct and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant propriety, which Milton draws of our firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he delineates
<q>

                     </p>
                     <p>Even the influence of religion is to be exerciſed with diſcretion. A female Polemic wanders almoſt as far from the limits preſcribed to her ſex, as a female Machiavel or warlike Thaleſtris. Fierceneſs has made almoſt as few converts as the ſword, and both are peculiarly ungraceful in a female. Even
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037996_0021_100F7C599F509230"/>
                        <hi>religious</hi> violence has human tempers of its own to indulge, and is gratifying itſelf when it would be thought to be ſerving God. Let not the bigot place her natural paſſions to the account of Chriſtianity, or imagine ſhe is pious when ſhe is only paſſionate. Let her bear in mind that a Chriſtian doctrine is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be defended with a Chriſtian ſpirit, and not make herſelf amends by the ſtoutneſs of her ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy for the badneſs of her temper. Many becauſe they defend a doctrine with pertinacity, ſeem to fancy that they thereby acquire a kind of right to withhold the obedience which ſhould be neceſſarily involved in the principle.</p>
                     <p>But the character of a conſiſtent Chriſtian is as carefully to be maintained, as that of a fiery diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is to be avoided; and ſhe who is afraid to avow her principles, or aſhamed to defend them, has little claim to that honourable title. A profligate, who laughs at the moſt ſacred inſtitutions, and keeps out of the way of every thing which comes under the appearance of formal inſtruction, may be diſconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the modeſt, but ſpirited rebuke of a delicate woman, whoſe life adorns the doctrines which her converſation defends: but ſhe who adminiſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof with ill-breeding, defeats the effect of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. On the other hand, there is a diſhoneſt way of labouring to conciliate the favour of a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, though of characters and principles irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilably
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037996_0022_100FA937B22AF0F8"/>
oppoſite. The words may be ſo guarded as not to ſhock the believer, while the eye and voice may be ſo accommodated, as not to diſcourage the infidel. She who, with a half earneſtneſs, trims be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the truth and the faſhion; who, while ſhe thinks it creditable to defend the cauſe of religion, yet does it in a faint tone, a ſtudied ambiguity of phraſe, and a certain expreſſion in her countenance, which proves that ſhe is not diſpleaſed with what ſhe affects to cenſure, or that ſhe is afraid to loſe her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for wit, in proportion as ſhe advances her credit for piety, injures the cauſe more than he who attacked it; for ſhe proves, either that ſhe does not believe what ſhe profeſſes, or that ſhe does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence what fear compels her to believe. But this is not all: ſhe is called on not barely to repreſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, but to excite, to encourage, and to cheriſh every tendency to ſerious religion.</p>
                     <p>Some of the occaſions of contributing to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good which are daily preſenting themſelves to ladies, are almoſt too minute to be pointed out. Yet of the good which right-minded women, anxiouſly watching theſe minute occaſions, and adroitly ſeizing them, might accompliſh, we may form ſome idea by the ill-effects which we actually ſee produced, through the mere levity, careleſsneſs, and inattention (to ſay no worſe) of ſome of thoſe ladies, who are looked up to as ſtandards in the faſhionable world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:037996_0023_100FA93B58B11738"/>
I am perſuaded, if many a one, who is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminating unintended miſchief, under the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notion that there is no harm in any thing ſhort of poſitive vice, and under the falſe colours of that indolent humility, "What good can <hi>I</hi> do?" could be brought to ſee in its collected force the annual aggregate of the random evil ſhe is daily doing, by conſtantly throwing a <hi>little</hi> caſual weight into the wrong ſcale, by mere inconſiderate and unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chat, ſhe would ſtart from her ſelf-complacent dream. If ſhe could conceive how much ſhe may be diminiſhing the good impreſſions of <hi>young</hi> men; and if ſhe could imagine how little amiable levity or irreligion makes her appear in the eyes of thoſe who are older and abler, (however looſe their own principles may be,) ſhe would correct herſelf in the firſt inſtance, from pure good nature; and in the ſecond, from worldly prudence and mere ſelf-love. But on how much higher principles would ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain herſelf, if ſhe habitually took into account the important doctrine of conſequences; and if ſhe reflected that the leſſer but more habitual corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions make up by their number, what they may ſeem to come ſhort of by their weight: then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe would find that, among the higher claſs of women, <hi>inconſideration</hi> is adding more to the daily quantity of evil than almoſt all other cauſes put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

There is an inſtrument of inconceivable force, when it is employed againſt the intereſts of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. It is not reaſoning, for that may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is not learning, for luckily the infidel is not ſeldom ignorant; it is not invective, for we leave ſo courſe an engine to the hands of the vulgar; it is not evidence, for happily we have that on our ſide. It is RIDICULE, the moſt deadly weapon in the whole arſenal of impiety, and which becomes an almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring ſhaft when directed by a fair and faſhionable hand. No maxim has been more readily adopted, or is more intrinſically falſe, than that which the faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinating eloquence of a noble ſceptic of the laſt age contrived to render ſo popular, that "ridicule is the teſt of truth." It is no teſt of truth itſelf; but of their firmneſs who aſſert the cauſe of truth, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſevere teſt. This light, keen, miſſile weapon, the irreſolute, unconfirmed Chriſtian will find it harder to withſtand, than the whole heavy artillery of infidelity united.</p>
                     <p>A young man of the better ſort, having juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the world, with a certain ſhare of good diſpoſitions and right feelings, not ignorant of the evidences, nor deſtitute of the principles of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity; without parting with his reſpect for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he ſets out with the too natural wiſh of making himſelf a reputation, and of ſtanding well with the faſhionable part of the female world. He preſerves
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037996_0025_100FA93F81317B20"/>
for a time a horror of vice, which makes it not difficult for him to reſiſt the groſſer corruptions of ſociety; he can as yet repel profaneneſs; nay, he can withſtand the banter of a club. He has ſenſe enough to ſee through the miſerable fallacies of the new philoſophy, and ſpirit enough to expoſe its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. So far he does well, and you are ready to congratulate him on his ſecurity. You are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: the principles of the ardent, and hitherto promiſing adventurer are ſhaken, juſt in that very ſociety where, while he was looking for pleaſure, he doubted not of ſafety. In the company of certain women of good faſhion and no ill fame, he makes ſhipwreck of his religion. He ſees them treat with levity or deriſion ſubjects which he has been uſed to hear named with reſpect. He could confute an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, he could unravel a ſophiſtry; but he cannot ſtand a laugh. A ſneer, not at the truth of religion, for that perhaps is by none of the party diſbelieved, but at its gravity, its unſeaſonableneſs, its dulneſs, puts all his reſolution to flight. He feels his miſtake, and ſtruggles to recover his credit; in order to which, he adopts the gay affectation of trying to ſeem worſe than he really is, he goes on to ſay things which he does not believe, and to deny things which he does believe, and all to efface the firſt impreſſion, and to recover a reputation which he has committed to <hi>their</hi> hands on whoſe report he knows he ſhall
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037996_0026_100FA943273A5008"/>
ſtand or fall, in thoſe circles in which he is ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to ſhine.</p>
                     <p>That cold compound of irony, irreligion, ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſneer, which make up what the French (from whom we borrow the thing as well as the word) ſo well expreſs by the term <hi>perſiflage,</hi> has of late years made an incredible progreſs in blaſting the opening buds of piety in young perſons of faſhion. A cold pleaſantry, a temporary cant word, the jargon of the day (for the "great vulgar" have their jargon) blights the firſt promiſe of ſeriouſneſs. The ladies of <hi>ton</hi> have certain watch-words, which may be detected as indications of this ſpirit. The clergy are ſpoken of under the contemptuous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of <hi>The Parſons.</hi> Some ludicrous aſſociation is infallibly combined with every idea of religion. If a warm-hearted youth has ventured to name with enthuſiaſm ſome eminently pious character, his glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ardour is extinguiſhed with a laugh; and a drawling declaration that the perſon in queſtion is really a mighty <hi>harmleſs</hi> good creature, is uttered in a tone which leads the youth ſecretly to vow, that whatever elſe he may be, he will never be a good harmleſs creature.</p>
                     <p>Nor is ridicule more dangerous to true piety than to true taſte. An age which values itſelf on parody, burleſque, irony, and caricature, produces little that is ſublime, either in genius or in virtue; but they
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037996_0027_100FA945BB4E28D0"/>
                        <hi>amuſe,</hi> and we live in an age which <hi>muſt</hi> be amuſed, though genius, feeling, truth, and principle, be the ſacrifice. Nothing chills the ardours of devotion like a frigid ſarcaſm; and, in the ſeaſon of youth, the mind ſhould be kept particularly clear of all light aſſociations. This is of ſo much importance, that I have known perſons who, having been early accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to certain ludicrous combinations, were never able to get their minds cleanſed from the impurities contracted by this habitual levity, even after a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough reformation in their hearts and lives had taken place: their principles became reformed, but their imaginations were indelibly ſoiled. They could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from ſins which the ſtrictneſs of Chriſtianity would not allow them to commit, but they could not diſmiſs from their minds images, which her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity forbade them to entertain.</p>
                     <p>There was a time when a variety of epithets were thought neceſſary to expreſs various kinds of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and when the different qualities of the mind were diſtinguiſhed by appropriate and diſcriminating terms; when the words venerable, learned, ſagacious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, acute, pious, ingenious, elegant, agreeable, wiſe, or witty, were uſed as ſpecific marks of diſtinct characters. But the legiſlators of faſhion have of late years thought proper to compriſe all merit in one eſtabliſhed epithet, and it muſt be confeſſed to be a very deſirable one as far as it goes. This epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037996_0028_100FA94748A89D20"/>
is excluſively and indiſcriminately applied wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever commendation is intended. The word <hi>pleaſant</hi> now ſerves to combine and expreſs all moral and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual excellence. Every individual, from the graveſt profeſſors of the graveſt profeſſion, down to the trifler who is of no profeſſion at all, muſt earn the epithet of <hi>pleaſant,</hi> or muſt be contented to be nothing; and muſt be conſigned over to ridicule, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vulgar and inexpreſſive cant word of a <hi>bore.</hi> This is the mortifying deſignation of many a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, who, though of much worth and much ability, cannot perhaps clearly make out his letters patent to the title of <hi>pleaſant.</hi> For, according to this modern claſſification, there is no intermediate ſtate, but all are compriſed within the ample bounds of one or other of theſe two terms.</p>
                     <p>We ought to be more on our guard againſt this ſpirit of ridicule, becauſe, whatever may be the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the preſent day, its faults do not ſpring from the redundancies of great qualities, or the overflowings of extravagant virtues. It is well if more correct views of life, a more regular admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of laws, and a more ſettled ſtate of ſociety, have helped to reſtrain the exceſſes of the heroic ages, when love and war were conſidered as the great and ſole buſineſs of human life. Yet, if that period was marked by a romantic extravagance, and the preſent by an indolent ſelfiſhneſs, our ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037996_0029_100FA94B53B326E0"/>
is not ſo triumphantly deciſive, as, in the vanity of our hearts, we may be ready to imagine.</p>
                     <p>I do not wiſh to bring back the frantic reign of chivalry, nor to reinſtate women in that fantaſtic empire in which they then ſat enthroned in the hearts, or rather in the imaginations of men. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe is an excellent material of univerſal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which the ſagacity of latter ages has ſeized upon, and rationally applied to the buſineſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life. But let us not forget, in the inſolence of acknowledged ſuperiority, that it was religion and chaſtity, operating on the romantic ſpirit of thoſe times, which eſtabliſhed the deſpotic ſway of woman; and though ſhe now no longer looks down on her adoring votaries, from the pedeſtal to which an abſurd idolatry had lifted her, yet let her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is the ſame religion and chaſtity which once raiſed her to ſuch an elevation, that muſt ſtill furniſh the nobleſt energies of her character.</p>
                     <p>While we lawfully ridicule the abſurdities which we have abandoned, let us not plume ourſelves on that ſpirit of novelty which glories in the oppoſite extreme. If the manners of the period in queſtion were affected, and if the gallantry was unnatural, yet the tone of virtue was high; and let us remember that conſtancy, purity, and honour, are not ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themſelves, though they may unluckily be aſſociated with qualities which are ſo: and women
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037996_0030_100FA94DED43C4C0"/>
of delicacy would do well to reflect, when deſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe exploded manners, how far it be decor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to deride with too broad a laugh, attachments which could ſubſiſt on remote gratifications; or groſsly to ridicule the taſte which led the admirer to ſacrifice pleaſure to reſpect, and inclination to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; to ſneer at that purity which made ſelf-denial a proof of affection, and to call in queſtion the ſound underſtanding of him who preferred the fame of his miſtreſs to his own indulgence.</p>
                     <p>One cannot but be ſtruck with the wonderful contraſt exhibited to our view, when we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the manners of the two periods in queſtion. In the former, all the flower of Europe ſmit with a delirious gallantry; all that was young and noble, and brave and great, with a fanatic frenzy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous contempt of danger, traverſed ſeas, and ſcaled mountains, and compaſſed a large portion of the globe, at the expenſe of eaſe, and fortune, and life, for the unprofitable project of reſcuing, by force of arms, from the hands of infidels, the ſepulchre of that Saviour, whom, <hi>in the other period,</hi> their poſterity would think it the height of fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm ſo much as to name in good company: whoſe altars they deſert, whoſe temples they neglect; and though in more than one country at leaſt they ſtill call themſelves by his name, yet too many, it is to be feared, contemn his precepts, ſtill more are
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037996_0031_100FA94F757A8D40"/>
aſhamed of his doctrines, and not a few reject his ſacrifice. Too many conſider Chriſtianity rather as a political than a religious diſtinction; too many claim the appellation of Chriſtians, in mere oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that Democracy with which they conceive infidelity to be aſſociated, rather than from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of impiety for its own ſake; and dread ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion as the badge of a reprobated party, more than on account of that moral corruption which is its inſeparable concomitant.</p>
                     <p>But in an age when inverſion is the order of the day, the modern idea of improvement does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in altering, but extirpating. We do not reform, but ſubvert. We do not correct old ſyſtems, but demoliſh them; fancying that when every thing ſhall be new it will be perfect. Not to have been wrong, but to have been at all, is the crime. Excellence is no longer conſidered as an experimental thing which is to grow gradually out of obſervation and practice, and to be improved by the accumulating additions brought by the wiſdom of ſucceſſive ages. <hi>Our wiſdom</hi> is not ſlowly perfected by age and gradual growth, but a goddeſs which ſtarts at once, full grown, mature, armed cap-à-pee, from the heads of our modern thunderers. Or rather, if I may change the alluſion, a perfect ſyſtem is <hi>now</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inevitably to ſpring at once, like the fabled bird of Arabia, from the aſhes of its parent; and, like
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037996_0032_100FA95210FD1348"/>
that, can receive its birth no other way but by the deſtruction of its predeceſſor.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of clearing away what is redundant, prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is cumberſome, ſupplying what is defective, and amending what is wrong, we adopt the indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite rage for radical reform of Jack, who in altering Lord Peter's<note n="*" place="bottom">Swift's "Tale of a Tub."</note> coat, ſhewed his zeal by crying out, <q>Tear away, brother Martin, for the love of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; never mind, ſo you do but tear away.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This tearing ſyſtem has unqueſtionably rent away ſome valuable parts of that ſtrong, rich, native ſtuff, which formed the ancient texture of Britiſh manners. That we have gained much I am perſuaded; that we have loſt nothing I dare not therefore affirm. But though it fairly exhibits a mark of our improved judgment to ridicule the fantaſtic notions of love and honour in the heroic ages; let us not rejoice that that ſpirit of generoſity in ſentiment, and of ardour in piety, the exuberancies of which were then ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, are now ſunk as unreaſonably low. That revolution of manners which the unparalleled wit and genius of Don Quixote ſo happily effected, by aboliſhing extravagancies the moſt abſurd and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, was ſo far imperfect, that ſome virtues which he never meant to expoſe, fell into diſrepute with the abſurdities which he did: and it is become the turn
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037996_0033_100FA955B9AE2CA0"/>
of the preſent taſte to attach in no ſmall degree that which is ridiculous to that which is ſerious and heroic. Some modern works of wit have aſſiſted in bringing piety and ſome of the nobleſt virtues into contempt, by ſtudiouſly aſſociating them with oddity, childiſh ſimplicity, and ignorance of the world: and unneceſſary pains have been taken to extinguiſh that zeal and ardour, which, however liable to exceſs and error, are yet the ſpring of whatever is great and excellent in the human character. The novel of Cervantes is incomparable; the Tartuffe of Moliere is unequalled; but true generoſity and true religion will never loſe any thing of their intrinſic value, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe knight-errantry and hypocriſy are legitimate objects for ſatire.</p>
                     <p>But to return from this too long digreſſion, to the ſubject of female influence. Thoſe who have not watched the united operation of vanity and feeling on a youthful mind, will not conceive how much leſs formidable the ridicule of all his own ſex will be to a very young man, than that of thoſe women to whom he has been taught to look up as the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of elegance. Such an one, I doubt not, might be able to work himſelf up, by the force of genuine chriſtian principle, to ſuch a pitch of true heroiſm, as to refuſe a challenge, (and it requires more real courage to refuſe a challenge than to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one,) who would yet be in danger of relapſing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037996_0034_100FA95747764358"/>
into the dreadful puſillanimity of the world, when he is told that no woman of faſhion will hereafter look on him but with contempt. While we have cleared away the rubbiſh of the Gothic ages, it were to be wiſhed we had not retained the moſt criminal of all their inſtitutions. Why chivalry ſhould indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a madman, while its leading object, the <hi>ſingle combat,</hi> ſhould deſignate a gentleman, has not yet been explained. Nay the original motive is loſt, while the ſinful practice is continued; for the fighter of the duel no longer <hi>pretends</hi> to be a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer of the wrongs of ſtrangers; no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders himſelf as piouſly appealing to heaven for the juſtice of his cauſe; but from the ſlaviſh fear of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited reproach, often ſelfiſhly hazards the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his neareſt connections, and always comes forth in direct defiance of an acknowledged com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Almighty. Perhaps there are few oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in which female influence might be exerted to a higher purpoſe than in this, in which laws and conſcience have hitherto effected ſo little. But while the duelliſt (who perhaps becomes a duelliſt only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was firſt a ſeducer) is welcomed with ſmiles; the more hardy youth, who, becauſe he fears not man but God, declines a challenge; who is reſolved to brave diſgrace rather than commit ſin, would be treated with cool contempt by thoſe very perſons to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037996_0035_100FA959E4857108"/>
whoſe eſteem he might reaſonably look, as one of the rewards of his true and ſubſtantial fortitude.</p>
                     <p>How then is it to be reconciled with the deciſions of principle, that delicate women ſhould receive with complacency the ſucceſsful libertine, who has been detected by the wretched father or the injured huſband in a criminal commerce, the diſcovery of which has too juſtly baniſhed the unhappy partner of his crime from virtuous ſociety? Nay, if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be very handſome, or very brave, or very faſhionable, is there not ſometimes a kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable competition for his favour? But, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his popularity be derived from birth, or parts, or perſon, or (what is often a ſubſtitute for all) from his having made his way into <hi>good company,</hi> women of diſtinction ſully the ſanctity of virtue by the too viſible pleaſure they ſometimes expreſs at the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch a popular libertine, whoſe voluble ſmall-talk they admire, and whoſe ſprightly nothings they quote, and whom perhaps their very favour tends to prevent from becoming a better character, becauſe he finds himſelf more acceptable as he is.</p>
                     <p>May I be allowed to introduce a new part of my ſubject, by remarking that it is a matter of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable importance, though not perhaps ſufficiently conſidered, when any popular work, not on a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous topic, but on any common ſubject, ſuch as poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, hiſtory, or ſcience, has happened to be written
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037996_0036_100FA95DD79C28B0"/>
by an author of ſound Chriſtian principles? It may not have been neceſſary, nor prudently practicable, to have a ſingle page in the whole work profeſſedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious: but ſtill, when the living principle informs the mind of the writer, it is almoſt impoſſible but that ſomething of its ſpirit will diffuſe itſelf even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjects with which it ſhould ſeem but remotely connected. It is at leaſt a comfort to the reader, to feel that honeſt confidence which reſults from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he has put himſelf into ſafe hands; that he has committed himſelf to an author, whoſe known principles are a pledge that his reader need not be driven to watch himſelf at every ſtep with anxious circumſpection; that he need not be looking on the right hand and on the left, as if he knew there were pitfalls under the flowers which are delighting him. And it is no ſmall point gained, that on ſubjects in which you do not look to <hi>improve</hi> your religion, it is at leaſt ſecured from deterioration. If the Athenian laws were ſo delicate that they diſgraced any one who ſhewed an inquiring traveller the wrong road, what diſgrace, among Chriſtians, ſhould attach to that author, who, when a youth is inquiring the road to hiſtory or philoſophy, directs him to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy and unbelief.</p>
                     <p>In animadverting farther on the reigning evils which the times more particularly demand that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of rank and influence ſhould repreſs, Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037996_0037_100FA960A5BB2E00"/>
calls upon them to bear their decided teſtimony againſt every thing which is notoriouſly contributing to the public corruption. It calls upon them to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh from their dreſſing rooms, (and oh, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence could baniſh from the libraries of their ſons and huſbands!) that ſober and unſuſpected maſs of miſchief, which, by aſſuming the plauſible names of Science, of Philoſophy, of Arts, of Belles Lettres, is gradually adminiſtering death to the principles of thoſe who would be on their guard, had the poiſon been labelled with its own pernicious title. Avowed attacks upon revelation are more eaſily reſiſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the malignity is advertiſed. But who ſuſpects the deſtruction which lurks under the harmleſs or inſtructive names of <hi>General Hiſtory, Natural Hiſtory, Travels, Voyages, Lives, Encyclopedias, Criticiſm,</hi> and <hi>Romance?</hi> Who will deny that many of theſe works contain much admirable matter; brilliant paſſages, important facts, juſt deſcriptions, faithful pictures of nature, and valuable illuſtrations of ſcience? But while "the dead fly lies at the bottom," the whole will exhale a corrupt and peſtilential ſtench.</p>
                     <p>Novels, which chiefly uſed to be dangerous in one reſpect, are now become miſchievous in a thouſand. They are continually ſhifting their ground, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their ſphere, and are daily becoming vehicles of wider miſchief. Sometimes they concentrate their force, and are at once employed to diffuſe deſtructive
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037996_0038_100FA9633AED8688"/>
politics, deplorable profligacy, and impudent infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Rouſſeau was the firſt popular diſpenſer of this complicated drug, in which the deleterious infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſtrong, and the effect proportionably fatal. For he does not attempt to ſeduce the affections but through the medium of the principles. He does not paint an innocent woman, ruined, repenting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; but with a far more miſchievous refinement, he annihilates the value of chaſtity, and with perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſubtlety attempts to make his heroine appear almoſt more amiable without it. He exhibits a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman, the victim not of temptation but of reaſon, not of vice but of ſentiment, not of paſſion but of conviction; and ſtrikes at the very root of honour by elevating a crime into a principle. With a metaphyſical ſophiſtry the moſt plauſible, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches the heart of woman, by cheriſhing her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the erection of a ſyſtem of male virtues, to which, with a lofty dereliction of thoſe that are her more peculiar and characteriſtic praiſe, he tempts her to aſpire; powerfully inſinuating, that to this ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſyſtem chaſtity does not neceſſarily belong: thus corrupting the judgment and bewildering the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as the moſt effectual way to inflame the imagination and deprave the heart.</p>
                     <p>The rare miſchief of this author conſiſts in his power of ſeducing by falſehood thoſe who love ruth, but whoſe minds are ſtill wavering, and whoſe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037996_0039_100FA964C6ECEB30"/>
principles are not yet formed. He allures the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted to embrace vice, not becauſe they prefer vice, but becauſe he gives to vice ſo natural an air of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and ardent and enthuſiaſtic youth, too confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently truſting in their integrity and in their teacher, will be undone, while they fancy they are indulging in the nobleſt feelings of their nature. Many authors will more infallibly complete the ruin of the looſe and ill-diſpoſed, but perhaps (if I may change the figure) there never was a net of ſuch exquiſite art and inextricable workmanſhip, ſpread to entangle innocence and enſnare inexperience, as the writings of Rouſſeau: and, unhappily, the victim does not even ſtruggle in the toils, becauſe part of the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion conſiſts in imagining that he is ſet at liberty.</p>
                     <p>Some of our recent popular publications have adopted and enlarged all the miſchiefs of this ſchool, and the principal evil ariſing from them is, that the virtues they exhibit are almoſt more dangerous than the vices. The chief materials out of which theſe deluſive ſyſtems are framed, are characters who practiſe ſuperfluous acts of generoſity, while they are trampling on obvious and commanded duties; who combine inflated ſentiments of honour with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the moſt flagitious; a high tone of ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with a perpetual neglect of ſelf-denial: pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic apoſtrophes to the paſſions, but no attempt to reſiſt them. They teach, that chaſtity is only indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037996_0040_100FA9665E44E2D8"/>
attachment; that no duty exiſts which is not prompted by feeling; that impulſe is the main ſpring of virtuous actions, while laws and religion are only unjuſt reſtraints; the former impoſed by arbitrary men, the latter by the abſurd prejudices of timorous and unenlightened conſcience. Alas! they do not know that the beſt creature of impulſe that ever liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is but a wayward, unfixed, unprincipled being! that the beſt <hi>natural</hi> man requires a curb; and needs that balance to the affections which Chriſtianity alone can furniſh, and without which benevolent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities are no ſecurity to virtue. And perhaps it is not too much to ſay, in ſpite of the monopoly of benevolence to which the new philoſophy lays claim, that the <hi>human</hi> duties of the ſecond table have never once been well performed by any of the rejectors of that previous portion of the Decalogue which enjoins duty to <hi>God.</hi>—In ſome of the moſt ſplendid of theſe characters compaſſion is erected into the throne of juſtice, and juſtice is degraded into the rank of ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian virtues. Creditors are defrauded, while the money due to them is laviſhed in dazzling acts of charity to ſome object that affects the ſenſes; which fits of charity are made the ſponge of every ſin, and the ſubſtitute of every virtue: the whole indirectly tending to intimate how very <hi>benevolent people are who are not Chriſtians.</hi> From many of theſe compoſitions, indeed, Chriſtianity is ſyſtematically, and always vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037996_0041_100FA96B1ECA85C8"/>
excluded; for the law, and the prophets, and the goſpel <hi>can</hi> make no part of a ſcheme in which this world is looked upon as all in all; in which want and miſery are conſidered as evils ariſing ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from human governments, and not from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God; in which poverty is repreſented as merely a political evil, and the reſtraints which tend to keep the poor honeſt, as the moſt flagrant injuſtice. The goſpel <hi>can</hi> make no part of a ſyſtem in which the chimerical project of conſummate earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſs (founded on the pretence of loving the poor better than God loves them) would defeat the divine plan, which meant this world a ſcene of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, not of remuneration. The goſpel <hi>can</hi> have nothing to do with a ſyſtem in which ſin is reduced to a little human imperfection, and Old Bailey crimes are ſoftened down into a few engaging weakneſſes; and in which the turpitude of all the vices a man himſelf commits, is done away by his <hi>candour</hi> in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating all the vices committed by others.</p>
                     <p>But the part of the ſyſtem the moſt fatal to that claſs whom I am addreſſing is, that even in thoſe works which do not go all the length of treating marriage as an unjuſt infringement on liberty, and a tyrannical deduction from general happineſs; yet it commonly happens that the hero or heroine, who has practically violated the letter of the ſeventh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and continues to live in the allowed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037996_0042_100FA96DBAFE18B8"/>
of its ſpirit, is painted as ſo amiable and ſo benevolent, ſo tender or ſo brave; and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is repreſented as ſo <hi>irreſiſtible,</hi> (for all theſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are fataliſts,) the predominant and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin is ſo filtered and purged of its pollutions, and is ſo ſheltered and ſurrounded, and relieved with ſhining qualities, that the innocent and impreſſible young reader is brought to loſe all horror of the awful crime in queſtion, in the complacency ſhe feels for the engaging virtues of the criminal.</p>
                     <p>But there is another object to which I would direct the exertion of that power of female influence of which I am ſpeaking. Thoſe ladies who take the lead in ſociety are loudly called upon to act as the guardians of the public taſte as well as of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue. They are called upon therefore, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with the whole weight of their influence, the irruption of thoſe ſwarms of publications now dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſuing from the banks of the Danube, which, like their ravaging predeceſſors of the darker ages, though with far other arms, are overrunning civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed ſociety. Thoſe readers, whoſe purer taſte has been formed on the correct models of the old claſſic ſchool, ſee with indignation and aſtoniſhment the Huns and Vandals once more overpowering the Greeks and Romans. They behold our minds, with a retrograde but rapid motion, hurried back to the reign of "chaos and old night," by terrific and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled

                     <p>The writings of the French infidels were ſome years ago circulated in England with uncommon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and with ſome effect: <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Of the doctrines and principles here alluded to, the dreadful conſequences, not only in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy country where they originated and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally adopted, but in every part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope where they have been received, have been ſuch as to ſerve as a beacon to ſurrounding nations, if any warning can preſerve them from deſtruction. In this country the ſubject is now ſo well underſtood, that every thing that iſſues from the <hi>French</hi> preſs is received with jealouſy; and a work, on the firſt

                     <p>But let us not on account of this victory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in confident ſecurity. The modern apoſtles of infidelity and immorality, little leſs indefatigable in diſperſing their pernicious doctrines than the firſt apoſtles were in propagating goſpel truths, have indeed changed their weapons, but they have by no means deſiſted from the attack. To deſtroy the principles of Chriſtianity in this iſland, appears at the preſent moment to be their grand aim. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the aſſiſtance of the French preſs, they are now attempting to attain their object under the cloſe and more artificial veil of German literature. Conſcious that religion and morals will ſtand or fall together, their attacks are ſometimes levelled againſt the one and ſometimes againſt the other. With ſtrong occaſional profeſſions of general at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to both of theſe, they endeavour to intereſt the feelings of the reader, ſometimes in favour of ſome one particular vice, at other times on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſome one objection to revealed religion. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry as well as proſe, romance as well as hiſtory, writings on philoſophical as well as on political ſubjects, have thus been employed to inſtil the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Illuminatiſm,</hi> while incredible pains have been taken to obtain able tranſlations of every book which was ſuppoſed likely to be of uſe in corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037996_0045_100FA974933AD230"/>
the heart or miſleading the underſtanding. In many of theſe tranſlations, certain ſtronger paſſages, which, though well received in Germany, would have excited diſguſt in England, are wholly omitted, in order that the mind may be more certainly, though more ſlowly, prepared for the full effect of the ſame poiſon to be adminiſtered in a ſtronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree at another period.</p>
                     <p>Let not thoſe to whom theſe pages are addreſſed deceive themſelves, by ſuppoſing this to be a fable; and let them inquire moſt ſeriouſly whether I ſpeak truth, in aſſerting that the attacks of infidelity in Great Britain are at this moment principally directed againſt the female breaſt. Conſcious of the influence of women in civil ſociety, conſcious of the effect which female infidelity produced in France, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the ill ſucceſs of their attempts in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to their having been hitherto chiefly addreſſed to the male ſex. They are now ſedulouſly labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſtroy the religious principles of women, and in too many inſtances have fatally ſucceeded. For this purpoſe not only novels and romances have been made the vehicles of vice and infidelity, but the ſame allurement has been held out to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of our country, which was employed by the firſt philoſophiſt to the firſt ſinner-Knowledge. Liſten to the precepts of the new German enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and you need no longer remain in that ſituation
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037996_0046_100FA97843D95618"/>
in which Providence has placed you! Follow their examples, and you ſhall be permitted to indulge in all thoſe gratifications which cuſtom, not religion, has tolerated in the male ſex!</p>
                     <p>Let us jealouſly watch every deepening ſhade in the change of manners; let us mark every ſtep, however inconſiderable, whoſe tendency is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Corruption is neither ſtationary nor retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade; and to have departed from modeſty, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to have made a progreſs. It is not only aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully true, that ſince the new principles have been afloat, <hi>women</hi> have been too eagerly inquiſitive after theſe monſtrous compoſitions; but it is true alſo that, with a new and offenſive renunciation of their native delicacy, <hi>many women of character</hi> make little heſitation in avowing their familiarity with works abounding with principles, ſentiments, and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, "which ſhould not be ſo much as named among them." By allowing their minds to come in contact with ſuch contagious matter, they are ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably tainting them; and by acknowledging that they are actually converſant with ſuch corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (with whatever reprobation of the author they may qualify their peruſal of the book,) they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing in others a moſt miſchievous curioſity for the ſame unhallowed gratification. Thus they are daily diminiſhing in the young and the timid thoſe whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſcruples, by which, when a tender conſcience
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037996_0047_100FA979CC6B5628"/>
ceaſes to be intrenched, all the ſubſequent ſtages of ruin are gradually facilitated.</p>
                     <p>We have hitherto ſpoken only of the German <hi>writings;</hi> but becauſe there are multitudes who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom read, equal pains have been taken to promote the ſame object through the medium of the ſtage; and this weapon is, of all others, that againſt which it is, at the preſent moment, the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to warn the more inconſiderate of my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women.</p>
                     <p>As a ſpecimen of the German drama, it may not be unſeaſonable to offer a few remarks on the admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed play of the <hi>Stranger.</hi> In this piece the character of an <hi>adultreſs,</hi> which, in all periods of the world, ancient as well as modern, in all countries, heathen as well as chriſtian, has hitherto been held in deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and has never been introduced but to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, is for the firſt time preſented to our view in the moſt pleaſing and faſcinating colours. The heroine is a woman who forſook a huſband the moſt affectionate and the moſt amiable, and lived for ſome time in the moſt criminal commerce with her ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Repenting at length of her crime, ſhe buries herſelf in retirement. The talents of the poet dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole piece are exerted in attempting to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this woman the object not only of the compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and forgiveneſs, but of the eſteem and affection, of the audience. The injured huſband, convinced
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037996_0048_100FA97CAAC6CA58"/>
of his wife's repentance, forms a reſolution, which every man of true feeling and chriſtian piety will probably approve. He forgives her offence, and promiſes her through life his advice, protection, and fortune, together with every thing which can alleviate the miſery of her ſituation, but refuſes to replace her in the ſituation of his wife. But this is not ſufficient for the <hi>German</hi> author. His efforts are employed, and it is to be feared but too ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, in making the audience conſider the huſband as an unrelenting ſavage, while they are led by the art of the poet anxiouſly to wiſh to ſee an adultreſs reſtored to that rank of women who have not violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt ſolemn covenant that can be made with man, nor diſobeyed one of the moſt poſitive laws which has been enjoined by God.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time that this firſt attempt at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting an adultreſs in an exemplary light was made by a German dramatiſt, which forms an aera in manners; a direct vindication of adultery was for the firſt time attempted by a <hi>woman,</hi> a profeſſed admirer and imitator of the German ſuicide Werter. <hi>The female Werter,</hi> as ſhe is ſtyled by her biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, aſſerts, in a work intitled "The Wrongs of Women," that adultery is juſtifiable, and that the reſtrictions placed on it by the laws of England conſtitute one of the <hi>Wrongs of Women.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

And this leads me to dwell a little longer on this moſt deſtructive claſs in the whole wide range of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern corruptors, who effect the moſt deſperate work of the paſſions, without ſo much as pretending to urge their <hi>violence</hi> in extenuation of the guilt of indulging them. They ſolicit this very indulgence with a ſort of cold-blooded ſpeculation, and invite the reader to the moſt unbounded gratifications, with all the ſaturnine coolneſs of a geometrical calculation. Theirs is an iniquity rather of phlegm than of ſpirit: and in the peſtilent atmoſphere they raiſe about them, as in the infernal climate deſcribed by Milton,
<q>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This cool, calculating, intellectual wickedneſs eats out the very heart and core of virtue, and like a deadly mildew blights and ſhrivels the blooming promiſe of the human ſpring. Its benumbing touch communicates a torpid ſluggiſhneſs, which paralyzes the ſoul. It deſcants on depravity, and details its groſſeſt acts as frigidly as if its object were to <hi>allay</hi> the tumult of the paſſions, while it is letting them looſe on mankind, by "plucking off the muzzle" of preſent reſtraint and future accountableneſs. The ſyſtem is a dire infuſion compounded of bold
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037996_0050_100FA98302AB45F8"/>
impiety, brutiſh ſenſuality, and exquiſite folly, which creeping fatally about the heart checks the moral circulation, and totally ſtops the pulſe of goodneſs by the extinction of the vital principle. Thus not only choking the ſtream of actual virtue, but drying up the very fountain of future remorſe and remote repentance.</p>
                     <p>The ravages which ſome of the old offenders againſt purity made in the youthful heart, by the exerciſe of a fervid but licentious imagination on the paſſions, was like the miſchief effected by floods, cataracts, and volcanos. The deſolation indeed was terrible, and the ruin was tremendous: yet it was a ruin which did not <hi>infallibly</hi> preclude the poſſibility of recovery. The country, though deluged and devaſtated, was not utterly put beyond the power of reſtoration. The harveſts indeed were deſtroyed, and all was wide ſterility. But, though the crops were loſt, the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of vegetation were not abſolutely eradicated; ſo that, after a long and barren blank, fertility <hi>might</hi> finally return.</p>
                     <p>But the heart once infected with this newly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated venom, ſubtil though ſluggiſh in its operation, reſembles what travellers relate of that blaſted ſpot the dead-ſea, where thoſe devoted cities once ſtood which for their pollutions were burnt with fire from heaven. It continues a ſtagnant lake of putrefying waters. No wholeſome blade ever more ſhoots up;
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037996_0051_100FA984896F2558"/>
the air is ſo tainted that no living thing ſubſiſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its influence. Near the ſulphureous pool the very principle of life is annihilated. All is death,
<q>
                           <l>Death, unrepealable, eternal death!</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But let us take comfort. Theſe projects are not yet generally realiſed. Theſe atrocious principles are not yet adopted into common practice. Though corruptions ſeem with a confluent tide to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon us from every quarter, yet there is ſtill left among us a diſcriminating judgment. Clear and ſtrongly marked diſtinctions between right and wrong ſtill ſubſiſt. While we continue to cheriſh this ſanity of mind, the caſe is not deſperate. Though that crime, the growth of which always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits the moſt irrefragable proof of the diſſoluteneſs of public manners; though that crime, which cuts up order and virtue by the roots, and violates the ſanctity of vows, is awfully increaſing,
<q>

                        </q>
yet, thanks to the ſurviving efficacy of a holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to the operation of virtuous laws, and to the energy and unſhaken integrity with which theſe laws are <hi>now</hi> adminiſtered; and moſt of all perhaps to a ſtandard of morals which continues in force, when the principles which ſanctioned it are no more; this crime, in the female ſex at leaſt, is ſtill held in juſt
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037996_0052_100FA98720338F90"/>
abhorrence; if it be practiſed, it is not honourable; if it be committed, it is not juſtified; we do not yet affect to palliate its turpitude; as yet it hides its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred head in lurking privacy; and reprobation <hi>hitherto</hi> follows its publicity.</p>
                     <p>But on YOUR exerting your influence, with juſt application and increaſing energy, may in no ſmall degree depend whether this corruption ſhall ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be reſiſted. For, from admiring to adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſtep is ſhort, and the progreſs rapid; and it is in the moral as in the natural world; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the caſe of minds as well as of bodies, is accelerated as they approach the centre to which they are tending.</p>
                     <p>O ye to whom this addreſs is particularly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! an awful charge is, in this inſtance, committed to your hands; as you diſcharge it or ſhrink from it, you promote or injure the honour of your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the happineſs of your ſons, of both which you are the depoſitaries. And, while you reſolutely perſevere in making a ſtand againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this crime, ſuffer not your firmneſs to be ſhaken by that affectation of charity, which is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a general ſubſtitute for principle. Abuſe not ſo noble a quality as Chriſtian candour, by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employing it in inſtances to which it does not apply. Pity the wretched woman you dare not countenance; and bleſs HIM who has "made you to differ." If
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:037996_0053_100FA989C1FE8B38"/>
unhappily ſhe be your relation or friend, anxiouſly watch for the period when ſhe ſhall be deſerted by her betrayer; and ſee if, by your Chriſtian offices, ſhe can be ſnatched from a perpetuity of vice. But if, through the Divine bleſſing on your patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſhe ſhould ever be awakened to remorſe, be not anxious to reſtore the forlorn penitent to that ſociety againſt whoſe laws ſhe has ſo grievouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; and remember, that her ſoliciting ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, furniſhes but too plain a proof that ſhe is not the penitent your partiality would believe; ſince penitence is more anxious to make its peace with Heaven than with the world. Joyfully would a truly contrite ſpirit commute an earthly for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reprobation! To reſtore a criminal to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſociety, is perhaps to tempt her to repeat her crime, or to deaden her repentance for having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, as well as to injure that ſociety; while to reſtore a ſtrayed ſoul to God will add luſtre to your Chriſtian character, and brighten your eternal crown.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, there are other evils, ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perhaps tending to this, into which we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, through that ſort of faſhionable candour which, as was hinted above, is among the miſchievous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics of the preſent day; of which period per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is not the ſmalleſt evil, that vices are made to look ſo like virtues, and are ſo aſſimilated to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037996_0054_100FA98D6DC5E540"/>
them, that it requires watchfulneſs and judgment ſufficiently to analyze and diſcriminate. There are certain women of good faſhion who practiſe irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities not conſiſtent with the ſtrictneſs of virtue; while their good ſenſe and knowledge of the world make them at the ſame time keenly alive to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of reputation. They want to retain their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, without quite forfeiting their credit; but finding their fame faſt declining, they artfully cling, by flattery and marked attentions, to a few perſons of more than ordinary character; and thus, till they are driven to let go their hold, continue to prop a falling fame.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, there are not wanting women of diſtinction, of very correct general conduct, and of no ordinary ſenſe and virtue, who, confiding with a high mind on what they too confidently call <hi>the integrity of their own hearts;</hi> anxious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a good fame on the one hand, by a life free from reproach, yet ſecretly too deſirous on the other of ſecuring a worldly and faſhionable reputation; while their general aſſociates are perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and their general reſort places of ſafety; yet allow themſelves to be occaſionally preſent at the midnight orgies of revelry and gaming, in houſes of no honourable eſtimation; and thus help to keep up characters, which, without their ſuſtaining hand, would ſink to their juſt level of contempt and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037996_0055_100FA990097E38B8"/>
While they are holding out this plank to a drowning reputation, rather, it is to be feared, ſhewing their own ſtrength than aſſiſting another's weakneſs, they value themſelves, perhaps, on not partaking of the worſt parts of the amuſements which may be carrying on; but they ſanction them by their preſence; they lend their countenance to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions they ſhould abhor, and their example to the young and inexperienced, who are looking about for ſome ſuch ſanction to juſtify them in that which they were before inclined to, but were too timid to have ventured upon without the protection of ſuch unſullied names. Thus theſe reſpectable characters, without looking to the general conſequences of their indiſcretion, are thoughtleſsly employed in breaking down, as it were, the broad fence which ſhould ever ſeparate two very different ſorts of ſociety, and are becoming a kind of unnatural link between vice and virtue.</p>
                     <p>There is a groſs deception which even perſons of reputation practiſe on themſelves. They loudly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn vice and irregularity as an abſtract principle; nay, they ſtigmatize them in perſons of an oppoſite party, or in thoſe from whom they themſelves have no proſpect of perſonal advantage or amuſement, and in whom therefore they have no particular intereſt to tolerate evil. But the ſame diſorders are viewed without abhorrence when practiſed by thoſe who in
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037996_0056_100FA991A958CB08"/>
any way miniſter to <hi>their</hi> pleaſures. Refined enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, luxurious decorations, ſelect muſic, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever furniſhes any delight rare and exquiſite to the ſenſes, theſe ſoften the ſeverity of criticiſm; theſe palliate ſins, varniſh over the flaws of a broken character, and extort not pardon merely, but juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, countenance, intimacy! The more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able will not, perhaps, go all the length of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the diſreputable vice, but they affect to diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve its exiſtence in the individual inſtance; or, failing in this, they will bury its acknowledged tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude in the ſeducing qualities of the agreeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. Talents of every kind are conſidered as a commutation for a few vices, and ſuch are made a paſſport to introduce into honourable ſociety cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters whom their profligacy ought to exclude from it.</p>
                     <p>But the great object to which YOU who are, or may be mothers, are more eſpecially called, is the education of your children. If we are reſponſible for the uſe of influence in the caſe of thoſe over whom we have no immediate control, in the caſe of our children we are reſponſible for the exerciſe of acknowledged <hi>power:</hi> a power wide in its extent, indefinite in its effects, and ineſtimable in its import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

mighty privilege of forming the hearts and minds of your infant ſons. By the bleſſing of God on the principles you ſhall, as far as it depends on you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe into both ſons and daughters, they will hereafter "ariſe and call you bleſſed." And in the great day of general account, may every Chriſtian mother be enabled through divine grace to ſay, with humble confidence, to her Maker and Redeemer, <q>Behold the children whom thou haſt given me!</q>

                     <p>Chriſtianity, driven out from the reſt of the world, has ſtill, bleſſed be God! a "ſtrong hold" in this country.

                     <argument>
                        <p>On the education of women.—The prevailing ſyſtem tends to eſtabliſh the errors which it ought to correct.—Dangers ariſing from an exceſſive cultivation of the arts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is far from being the object of this ſlight work to offer a regular plan of female education, a taſk which has been often more properly aſſumed by far abler writers; but it is intended rather to ſuggeſt a few remarks on the reigning mode, which, though it has had many panegyriſts, appears to be defective, not only in a few particulars, but as a general ſyſtem. There are indeed numberleſs honourable exceptions to an obſervation which will be thought ſevere; yet the author queſtions if it be not the natural and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency of the prevailing and popular ſyſtem, to excite and promote thoſe very defects, which it ought to be the main end and object of Chriſtian education to remove; whether, inſtead of directing this important engine to attack and deſtroy vanity, ſelfiſhneſs, and inconſideration, that triple alliance in league againſt female virtue; the combined powers
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037996_0059_100FA999A9437230"/>
of inſtruction are not ſedulouſly confederated in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their ſtrength and eſtabliſhing their empire?</p>
                     <p>If indeed the <hi>material</hi> ſubſtance, if the body and limbs, with the organs and ſenſes, be really the more valuable objects of attention, then there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle room for animadverſion and improvement. But if the immaterial and immortal mind; if the heart, "out of which are the iſſues of life," be the main concern; if the great buſineſs of education be to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant ideas, to communicate knowledge, to form a correct taſte and a ſound judgment, to reſiſt evil propenſities, and, above all, to ſeize the favourable ſeaſon for infuſing principles and confirming habits; if education be a ſchool to fit us for life, and life be a ſchool to fit us for eternity; if ſuch, I repeat it, be the chief work and grand ends of education, it may then be worth inquiring how far theſe ends are likely to be effected by the prevailing ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>Is it not a fundamental error to conſider children as innocent beings, whoſe little weakneſſes may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps want ſome correction, rather than as beings who bring into the world a corrupt nature and evil diſpoſitions, which it ſhould be the great end of education to rectify? This appears to be ſuch a foundation-truth, that if I were aſked what quality is moſt important in an inſtructor of youth, I ſhould not heſitate to reply, <hi>ſuch a ſtrong impreſſion of the corruption of our nature, as ſhould inſure a diſpoſition to</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="unknown:037996_0060_100FA99DB3FDC0E0"/>
                        <hi>counteract it: together with ſuch a deep view and thorough knowledge of the human heart, as ſhould be neceſſary for developing and controuling its moſt ſecret and complicated workings.</hi> And let us remember that to <hi>know the world,</hi> as it is called, that is, to know its local manners, temporary uſages, and evaneſcent faſhions, is not to <hi>know human nature:</hi> and where this prime knowledge is wanting, thoſe natural evils which ought to be counteracted will be foſtered.</p>
                     <p>Vanity, for inſtance, is reckoned among the light and venial errors of youth; nay, ſo far from being treated as a dangerous enemy, it is often called in as an auxiliary. At worſt, it is conſidered as a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs weakneſs, which ſubtracts little from the value of a character; as a natural efferveſcence, which will ſubſide of itſelf, when the firſt ferment of the youthful paſſions ſhall have done working. But thoſe know little of the conformation of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and eſpecially of the female heart, who fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that vanity is ever exhauſted, by the mere opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time and events. Let thoſe who maintain this opinion look into our places of public reſort, and there behold if the ghoſt of departed beauty is not to its laſt flitting fond of haunting the ſcenes of its paſt pleaſures; the ſoul, unwilling (if I may borrow an alluſion from the Platonic mythology) to quit the ſpot in which the body enjoyed its former delights, ſtill continues to hover about the ſame

place, though the ſame pleaſures are no longer to be found there. Diſappointments indeed may divert vanity into a new direction; prudence may prevent it from breaking out into exceſſes, and age may prove that it is "vexation of ſpirit;" but neither diſappointment, prudence, nor age can <hi>cure</hi> it; for they do not correct the principle. Nay, the very diſappointment itſelf ſerves as a painful evidence of its protracted exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Since then there is a ſeaſon when the youthful muſt ceaſe to be young, and the beautiful to excite admiration; to grow old gracefully is perhaps one of the rareſt and moſt valuable arts which can be taught to woman. It is for this ſober ſeaſon of life that education ſhould lay up its rich reſources. However diſregarded they may hitherto have been, they will be wanted now. When admirers fall away, and flatterers become mute, the mind will be driven to retire into itſelf, and if it find no entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home, it will be driven back again upon the world with increaſed force. Yet forgetting this, do we not ſeem to educate our daughters, excluſively, for the tranſient period of youth, when it is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer life we ought to advert? Do we not educate them for a crowd, forgetting that they are to live at home? for the world, and not for themſelves? for ſhow, and not for uſe? for time, and not for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</p>

Vanity (and the ſame may be ſaid of ſelfiſhneſs) is not to be reſiſted like any other vice, which is ſometimes buſy and ſometimes quiet; it is not to be attacked as a ſingle fault, which is indulged in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a ſingle virtue; but it is uniformly to be controlled, as an active, a reſtleſs, a growing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at conſtant war with all the Chriſtian graces; which not only mixes itſelf with all our faults, but inſinuates itſelf into all our virtues too; and will, if not checked effectually, rob our beſt actions of their reward. Vanity, if I may uſe the analogy, is, with reſpect to the other vices, what feeling is in regard to the other ſenſes; it is not confined in its operation to the eye, or the ear, or any ſingle organ, but diffuſed through the whole being, alive in every part, awakened and communicated by the ſlighteſt touch.</p>
                     <p>Not a few of the evils of the preſent day ariſe from a new and perverted application of terms; among theſe, perhaps, there is not one more abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, miſunderſtood, or miſapplied, than the term <hi>accompliſhments.</hi> This word in its original meaning, ſignifies <hi>completeneſs, perfection.</hi> But I may ſafely appeal to the obſervation of mankind, whether they do not meet with ſwarms of youthful females, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from our boarding ſchools, as well as emerging from the more private ſcenes of domeſtic education, who are introduced into the world, under the broad
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037996_0063_100FA9A4B22E4C58"/>
and univerſal title of <hi>accompliſhed young ladies,</hi> of <hi>all</hi> of whom it cannot very truly and correctly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that they illuſtrate the definition by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleteneſs which leaves nothing to be added, and a perfection which leaves nothing to be deſired.</p>
                     <p>This phrenzy of accompliſhments, unhappily, is no longer reſtricted within the uſual limits of rank and fortune; the middle orders have caught the contagion, and it rages downward with increaſing violence, from the elegantly dreſſed but ſlenderly portioned curate's daughter, to the equally faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble daughter of the little tradeſman, and of the more opulent but not more judicious farmer. And is it not obvious, that as far as this epidemical mania has ſpread, this very valuable part of ſociety is declining in uſefulneſs, as it riſes in its unlucky pretenſions to elegance? And this revolution of the manners of the middle claſs has ſo far altered the character of the age, as to be in danger of rendering obſolete the heretofore common ſaying, <q>that moſt worth and virtue are to be found in the middle ſtation.</q> For I do not ſcruple to aſſert, that in general, as as far as my little obſervation has extended, this claſs of females, in what relates both to religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and to practical induſtry, falls ſhort both of the very high and the very low. Their new courſe of education, and the habits of life and elegance of dreſs connected with it, peculiarly unfits them for
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037996_0064_100FA9A790D12530"/>
the active duties of their own very important condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while, with frivolous eagerneſs and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand opportunities, they run to ſnatch a few of thoſe ſhowy acquirements which decorate the great. This is done apparently with one or other of theſe views; either to make their fortune by marriage, or if that fail, to qualify them to become teachers of others: hence the abundant multiplication of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial wives, and of incompetent and illiterate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſes. The uſe of the pencil, the performance of exquiſite but unneceſſary works, the ſtudy of foreign languages and of muſic, require (with ſome exceptions which ſhould always be made in favour of great natural genius) a degree of leiſure which belongs excluſively to affluence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe among the claſs in queſtion, whoſe own good ſenſe leads them to avoid theſe miſtaken purſuits, cannot be offended at a reproof which does not belong to them.</note> One uſe of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languages is, not that we may know what the terms which expreſs the articles of our dreſs and our table are called in French or Italian; not that we may think over a few ordinary phraſes in Engliſh, and then tranſlate them, without one foreign idiom; for he who cannot <hi>think</hi> in a language cannot be ſaid to underſtand it: but the great uſe of acquiring any foreign language is, either that it enables us occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally to converſe with foreigners unacquainted with any other, or that it is a key to the literature of the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037996_0065_100FA9ABA9703338"/>
country to which it belongs; and thoſe humbler fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males, the chief part of whoſe time is required for domeſtic offices, are little likely to fall in the way of foreigners; and ſo far from enjoying opportunities for the acquiſition of foreign literature, they have ſeldom time to poſſeſs themſelves of all that valuable knowledge which the books of their own country ſo abundantly furniſh; and the acquiſition of which would be ſo much more uſeful and honourable than the paltry acceſſions they make, by hammering out the meaning of a few paſſages in a tongue they but imperfectly underſtand, and of which they are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make no uſe.</p>
                     <p>It would be well if the reflection how eagerly this redundancy of accompliſhments is ſeized on by their inferiors, were to operate as in the caſe of other abſurd faſhions, which the great can ſeldom be brought to renounce from any other conſideration than that they are adopted by the vulgar.</p>
                     <p>But, to return to that more elevated, and, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their more extended influence only, that more important claſs of females, to whoſe uſe this little work is more immediately dedicated. Some popular authors, on the ſubject of female inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had for a time eſtabliſhed a fantaſtic code of artificial manners. They had refined elegance into inſipidity, frittered down delicacy into frivolouſneſs, and reduced manner into <hi>minauderie.</hi> But <q>to liſp,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037996_0066_100FA9AE44A2A540"/>
and to amble, and to nick-name God's creatures,</q> has nothing to do with true gentleneſs of mind; and to be ſilly makes no neceſſary part of ſoftneſs. Another claſs of cotemporary authors turned all the force of their talents to excite <hi>emotions,</hi> to inſpire <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,</hi> and to reduce all mental and moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence into <hi>ſympathy</hi> and <hi>feeling.</hi> Theſe ſofter quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were elevated at the expence of principle; and young women were inceſſantly hearing unqualified ſenſibility extolled as the perfection of their nature; till thoſe who really poſſeſſed this amiable quality, inſtead of directing, and chaſtiſing, and reſtraining it, were in danger of foſtering it to their hurt, and began to conſider themſelves as deriving their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from its exceſs; while thoſe leſs intereſting damſels, who happened not to find any of this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſibility in their <hi>hearts,</hi> but thought it credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to have it ſomewhere, fancied its ſeat was in the <hi>nerves;</hi> and here indeed it was eaſily found or feigned; till a falſe and exceſſive diſplay of feeling became ſo predominant, as to bring in queſtion the actual exiſtence of that true tenderneſs, without which, though a woman may be worthy, ſhe can never be amiable.</p>
                     <p>Faſhion then, by one of her ſudden and rapid turns, inſtantaneouſly ſtruck out real ſenſibility and the affectation of it from the ſtanding liſt of female perfections; and, by a quick touch of her magic

wand, ſhifted the ſcene, and at once produced the bold and independent beauty, the intrepid female, the hoyden, the huntreſs, and the archer; the ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms, the confident addreſs, the regimental, and the four-in-hand. Theſe ſelf-complacent heroines made us ready to regret their ſofter predeceſſors, who had aimed only at pleaſing the other ſex, while theſe aſpiring fair ones ſtruggled for the bolder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of rivalling them; the project failed; for, whereas the former had ſued for admiration, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter challenged, ſeized, compelled it; but the men, as was natural, continued to prefer the more modeſt claimant to the ſturdy competitor.</p>
                     <p>It were well if we, who have the advantage of contemplating the errors of the two extremes, were to look for truth where ſhe is commonly to be found, in the plain and obvious middle path, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remote from each exceſs; and, while we bear in mind that helpleſſneſs is not delicacy, let us alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that maſculine manners do not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſtrength of character nor vigour of intellect. Should we not reflect alſo, that we are neither to train up Amazons nor Circamans, but to form Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? that we have to educate not only rational but accountable beings? and, remembering this, ſhould we not be ſolicitous to let our daughters learn of the well-taught, and aſſociate with the well-bred? In training them, ſhould we not carefully cultivate intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,

implant religion, and cheriſh modeſty? then, whatever is delicate in manners, would be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſult of whatever is juſt in ſentiment, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect in principle: then, the decorums, the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the elegancies, and even the graces, as far as they are ſimple, pure, and honeſt, would follow as an almoſt inevitable conſequence; for to follow in the train of the Chriſtian virtues, and not to take the lead of them, is the proper place which religion aſſigns to the graces.</p>
                     <p>Whether we have made the beſt uſe of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our predeceſſors, and of our own numberleſs advantages, and whether the prevailing ſyſtem be really conſiſtent with ſound policy or with Chriſtian principle, it may be worth our while to inquire.</p>
                     <p>Would not a ſtranger be led to imagine by a view of the reigning mode of female education, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life conſiſted of one univerſal holiday, and that the grand conteſt between the ſeveral competitors was, who ſhould be moſt eminently qualified to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and carry off the prize, in the various ſhows and games which were intended to be exhibited in it? And to the exhibitors themſelves, would be not be ready to apply Sir Francis Bacon's obſervation on the Olympian victors, that they were ſo excellent in theſe unneceſſary things, that their perfection muſt needs have been acquired by the neglect of whatever was neceſſary?</p>

Before the evil is paſt redreſs, it will be prudent to reflect that in all poliſhed countries an entire devotedneſs to the fine arts has been one grand ſource of the corruption of the women; and ſo juſtly were theſe pernicious conſequences appreciated by the Greeks, among whom theſe arts were carried to the higheſt poſſible perfection, that they ſeldom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them to be cultivated to a very exquiſite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree by women of great purity of character. And if the ambition of an elegant Britiſh lady ſhould be fired by the idea that the accompliſhed females of thoſe poliſhed ſtates were the admired companions of the philoſophers, the poets, the wits, and the artiſts of Athens; and their beauty or talents the favourite ſubjects of the muſe, the lyre, the pencil, and the chiſſel; ſo that their pictures and ſtatues furniſhed the moſt conſummate models of Grecian art: if, I ſay, the accompliſhed females of our days are pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſimilar renown, let their modeſty chaſtiſe their ambition, by recollecting that theſe celebrated women are not to be found among the chaſte wives and the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037996_0072_100FA9BA7486D6A0"/>
virtuous daughters of the Ariſtides's, the Agis's, and the Phocions; but that they are to be looked for among the Phrynes, the Lais's, the Aſpaſias, and the Glyceras. I am perſuaded the Chriſtian female, whatever be her talents, will renounce the deſire of any celebrity when attached to impurity of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the ſame noble indignation with which the virtuous biographer of the above-named heroes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all diſhoneſt fame, by exclaiming, <q>I had rather it ſhould be ſaid there never was a Plutarch, than that they ſhould ſay Plutarch was malignant, unjuſt, or envious.<note n="*" place="bottom">No cenſure is levelled at the exertions of real genius, which is as valuable as it is rare; but at the abſurdity of that ſyſtem which is erecting <hi>the whole ſex</hi> into artiſts.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>And while this corruption, brought on by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive cultivation of the arts, has contributed its full ſhare to the decline of ſtates, it has always furniſhed an infallible ſymptom of their impending fall. The ſatires of the moſt penetrating and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the Roman poets corroborating the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the moſt accurate of their hiſtorians, abound with invectives againſt the depravity of manners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the corrupt habits of female education. The bitterneſs and groſs indelicacy of ſome of theſe ſatiriſts (too groſs to be either quoted or referred to) make little againſt their authority in theſe points;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037996_0073_100FA9BD52AA2ED8"/>
for how ſhocking muſt thoſe corruptions have been, and how obviouſly offenſive their cauſes, which could have appeared ſo highly diſguſting to minds not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſcandalized by ſlight deviations from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency! The famous ode of Horace, attributing the vices and diſaſters of his country to the ſame cauſe, might, were it quite free from the above objections, be produced, I will not preſume to ſay as an exact picture of the exiſting manners of this country; but may I not venture to ſay, as a prophecy, the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which cannot be very remote? It may how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be obſerved, that the modeſty of the Roman matron, and the chaſte demeanor of her virgin daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which amidſt the ſtern virtues of the ſtate were as immaculate and pure as the honour of the Roman citizen, fell a ſacrifice to the luxurious diſſipation brought in by their Aſiatic conqueſts; after which the females were ſoon taught a complete change of character. They were inſtructed to accommodate their talents of pleaſing to the more vitiated taſtes of the other ſex; and began to ſtudy every grace and every art which might captivate the exhauſted hearts, and excite the wearied and capricious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the men: till by a rapid and at length complete enervation, the Roman character loſt its ſignature, and through a quick ſucceſſion of ſlavery, effeminacy, and vice, ſunk into that degeneracy of

which ſome of the modern Italian ſtates ſerve to furniſh a too juſt ſpecimen.</p>
                     <p>It is of the eſſence of human things that the ſame objects which are highly uſeful in their ſeaſon, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and degree, become miſchievous in their exceſs, at other periods, and under other circumſtances. In a ſtate of barbariſm, the arts are among the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers; and they go on to be improved themſelves, and improving thoſe who cultivate them, till having reached a certain point, thoſe very arts which were the inſtruments of civilization and refinement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come inſtruments of corruption and decay; enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and depraving in the ſecond inſtance as certainly as they refined in the firſt. They become agents of voluptuouſneſs. They excite the imagination; and the imagination thus excited, and no longer under the government of ſtrict principle, becomes the moſt dangerous ſtimulant of the paſſions; promotes a too keen reliſh for pleaſure, teaching how to multiply its ſources, and inventing new and pernicious modes of artificial gratification.</p>
                     <p>May we not rank among their preſent corrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, the unchaſte <hi>coſtume,</hi> the impure ſtyle of dreſs, and that indelicate ſtatue-like exhibition of the female figure, which by its artfully-diſpoſed folds, its wet and adheſive drapery, ſo defines the form as to prevent covering itſelf from becoming a veil?

accompliſhments have the dangerous advantage of addreſſing themſelves more immediately to the ſenſes, and of courſe meet every where with thoſe who can in ſome meaſure appreciate as well as admire them; for all can ſee and hear, but all cannot ſcrutinize and diſcriminate. External acquirements, too recommend themſelves the more becauſe they are more rapidly as well as more viſibly progreſſive. While the mind is led on to improvement by ſlow motions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible degrees; while the heart muſt now be admoniſhed by reproof, and now allured by kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; its livelieſt advances being ſuddenly impeded by obſtinacy, and its brighteſt proſpects often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by paſſion; it is ſlow in its acquiſitions of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and reluctant in its approaches to piety. The unruly and turbulent propenſities of the mind are not ſo obedient to the forming hand as defects of manner or awkwardneſs of gait. Often when we fancy that a troubleſome paſſion is completely cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we have the mortification to find that we have "ſcotch'd" the ſnake, not killed it." One evil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtarts up before another is conquered. The ſubduing hand cannot cut off the ever-ſprouting heads ſo faſt as the prolific Hydra can re-produce them, nor fell the ſtubborn Antaeus ſo often as he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit his ſtrength, and riſe in vigorous and repeated oppoſition.</p>

Hired teachers are alſo under a diſadvantage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling tenants at rack-rent; it is their intereſt to bring in an immediate revenue of praiſe and profit, and for the ſake of a preſent rich crop, thoſe who are not ſtrictly conſcientious, do not care how much the ground is impoveriſhed for future produce. But parents, who are the lords of the ſoil, muſt look to permanent value, and to continued fruitfulneſs. The beſt effects of a careful education are often very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; they are to be diſcovered in future ſcenes, and exhibited in as yet untried connections. Every event of life will be putting the heart into freſh ſituations, and making new demands on its prudence, its firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, its integrity, or its forbearance. Thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to form and model it, cannot foreſee thoſe contingent ſituations ſpecifically and diſtinctly; yet, as far as human wiſdom will allow, they muſt enable it to prepare for them all by general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, correct habits, and an unremitted ſenſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the Great Diſpoſer of events. The young Chriſtian militant muſt learn and practiſe all his evolutions; though he does not know on what ſervice his leader may command him, by what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular foe he ſhall be moſt aſſailed, nor what mode of attack the enemy may employ.</p>
                     <p>But the contrary of all this is the caſe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acquiſitions. The maſter, it is his intereſt, will induſtriouſly inſtruct his young pupil to ſet all

her improvements in the moſt immediate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous point of view. To attract admiration is the great principle ſedulouſly inculcated into her young heart; and is conſidered as the fundamental maxim; and, perhaps, if we were required to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe the reigning ſyſtem of the brilliant education of a lady into an aphoriſm, it might be compriſed in this ſhort ſentence, <hi>To allure and to ſhine.</hi> This ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem however is the fruitful germ, from which a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yet unborn vanities, with all their multiplied ramifications will ſpring. A tender mother cannot but feel an honeſt triumph in completing thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in her daughter which will neceſſarily excite admiration; but ſhe will alſo ſhudder at the vanity that admiration may excite, and at the new ideas it will awaken; and, ſtartling as it may ſound, the labours of a wiſe mother anxious for her daughter's beſt intereſts, will ſeem to be at variance with thoſe of all her teachers. She will indeed rejoice at her progreſs, but ſhe will rejoice with trembling; for ſhe is fully aware that if all poſſible accompliſhments could be bought at the price of a ſingle virtue, of a ſingle principle, the purchaſe would be infinitely dear, and ſhe would reject the dazzling but deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive acquiſition. She knows that the ſuperſtructure of the accompliſhments can be alone ſafely erected on the broad and ſolid baſis of Chriſtian humility: nay more, that as the materials of which that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure

                        <q>To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time for every purpoſe under heaven,</q> ſaid the wiſe man; but he ſaid it before the invention of baby-balls. This modern device is a ſort of triple conſpiracy againſt the innocence, the health, and the happineſs of children; thus, by factitious amuſements, to rob them of a reliſh for the ſimple joys, the unbought delights, which naturally belong to their blooming ſeaſon, is like blotting out ſpring from the year. To ſacrifice the true and proper enjoyments of ſprightly and happy children, is to make them pay a dear and diſproportionate price for their artificial pleaſures. They ſtep at once from the nurſery to the ball-room; and, by a prepoſterous change of habits, are thinking of dreſſing themſelves, at an age when they uſed to be dreſſing their dolls. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bounding with the unreſtrained freedom of little wood nymphs, over hill and dale, their cheeks fluſhed with health, and their hearts overflowing with happineſs, theſe <hi>gay</hi> little creatures are ſhut up all the morning, demurely practiſing the <hi>pas grave,</hi> and tranſacting the ſerious buſineſs of acquiring a

new ſtep for the evening, with more coſt of time and pains than it would have taken them to acquire twenty new ideas.</p>
                     <p>Thus they loſe the amuſements which naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their ſmiling period, and unnaturally antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate thoſe pleaſures (ſuch as they are) which would come in, too much of courſe, on their introduction into faſhionable life. The true pleaſures of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood are cheap and natural; for every object teems with delight to eyes and hearts new to the enjoyment of life; nay, the hearts of healthy children abound with a general diſpoſition to mirth and joyfulneſs, even without a ſpecific object to excite it; like our firſt parent, in the world's firſt ſpring, when all was new, and freſh, and gay about him,
<q>
                           <l>they live and move,</l>
                           <l>And feel that they are happier than they know.</l>
                        </q>
Only furniſh them with a few ſimple and harmleſs materials, and a little, but not too much, leiſure, and they will manufacture their own pleaſures with more ſkill, and ſucceſs, and ſatisfaction, than they will receive from all that your money can purchaſe. Their bodily recreations ſhould be ſuch as will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their health, quicken their activity, enliven their ſpirits, what their ingenuity, and qualify them for their mental work.

                     <p>While childhood preſerves its native ſimplicity, every little change is intereſting, every gratification is a luxury; a ride or a walk will be a delightful amuſement to a child in her natural ſtate; but it will be dull and taſteleſs to a ſophiſticated little creature, nurſed in theſe forced, and coſtly, and vapid plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Alas! that we ſhould throw away this firſt grand opportunity of working into a practical habit the moral of this important truth, that the chief ſource of human diſcontent is to be looked for, not in our real but in our factitious wants; not in the demands of nature, but in the artificial cravings of deſire!</p>

worth ſaving who could not ſtand this early ſtruggle for their lives: the greater part indeed, as it might have been expected, periſhed; but the parents took comfort, that if many were loſt, the few who eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be the ſtronger for having been thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                     <p>To behold lilliputian coquettes, projecting dreſſes, ſtudying colours, aſſorting ribbands and feathers, their little hearts beating with hopes about partners and fears about rivals; and to ſee their freſh cheeks pale after the midnight ſupper, their aching heads and unbraced nerves, diſqualifying the little languid beings for the next day's taſk; and to hear the grave apology, <q>that it is owing to the wine, the crowd, the heated room of the laſt night's ball;</q> all this, I ſay, would really be as ludicrous, if the miſchief of the thing did not take off from the merriment of it, as any of the ridiculous and prepoſterous diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions in the diverting travels of Captain Lemuel Gulliver.</p>
                     <p>Under a juſt impreſſion of the evils which we are ſuſtaining from the principles and the practices of <hi>modern</hi> France, we are apt to loſe ſight of thoſe deep and laſting miſchiefs which ſo long, ſo regularly, and ſo ſyſtematically, we have been importing from the ſame country, though in another form and under another government. In one reſpect, indeed, the firſt were the more formidable, becauſe we embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the ruin without ſuſpecting it; while we defeat the malignity of the latter, by detecting the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and defending ourſelves againſt it. This is not the place to deſcant on that levity of manners, that contempt of the Sabbath, that fatal familiarity with looſe principles, and thoſe relaxed notions of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal fidelity, which have often been tranſplanted into this country by women of faſhion, as a too common effect of a long reſidence in that: but it is peculiarly ſuitable to my ſubject to advert to another domeſtic miſchief derived from the ſame foreign extraction: I mean, the riſks that have been run, and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which have been made, in order to furniſh our young ladies with the means of acquiring the French language in the greateſt poſſible purity. Perfection in this accompliſhment has been ſo long eſtabliſhed as the ſupreme object; ſo long conſidered as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant excellence to which all other excellencies muſt bow down, that it would be hopeleſs to attack a law which faſhion has immutably decreed, and which has received the ſtamp of long preſcription. We muſt therefore be contented with expreſſing a wiſh, that this indiſpenſable perfection could have been attained at the expence of ſacrifices leſs import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. It is with the greater regret I animadvert on this and ſome other prevailing practices, as they are errors into which the wiſe and reſpectable have, through want of conſideration, or rather through
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037996_0085_100FA9DD24DD9B58"/>
want of firmneſs to reſiſt the tyranny of faſhion, ſometimes fallen. It has not been unuſual when mothers of rank and reputation have been aſked how they ventured to intruſt their daughters to foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of whoſe principles they knew nothing, except that they were Roman Catholics, to anſwer, <q>That they had taken care to be ſecure on that ſubject; for that it had been ſtipulated that <hi>the queſtion of religion ſhould never be agitated between the teacher and the pupil.</hi>
                        </q> This, it muſt be confeſſed, is a moſt deſperate remedy; it is like ſtarving to death, to avoid being poiſoned. And one cannot help trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for the event of that education, from which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as far as the governeſs is concerned, is thus formally and ſyſtematically excluded. Surely it would not be exacting too much to ſuggeſt at leaſt that an attention no leſs ſcrupulous ſhould be exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſure the character of our children's inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for piety and knowledge, than is thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to aſcertain that ſhe has nothing <hi>patois</hi> in her dialect.</p>
                     <p>I would rate a correct pronunciation and an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant phraseology at their juſt price, and I would not rate them low; but I would not offer up principle as a victim to ſounds and accents.

                     </argument>
                     <p>To return, however, to the ſubject of general edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. A young lady may excel in ſpeaking French and Italian, may repeat a few paſſages from a volume of extracts; play like a profeſſor, and ſing like a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; have her dreſſing room decorated with her own drawings, tables, ſtands, ſcreens, and cabinets; nay, ſhe may dance like Sempronia* herſelf, and yet may have been very badly educated. I am far from meaning to ſet no value whatever on any or all of theſe qualifications; they are all of them elegant, and many of them properly tend to the perfecting of a polite education. Theſe things in their meaſure and degree, may be done, but there are others which ſhould not be left undone. Many things are becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but "one thing is needful." Beſides, as the world ſeems to be fully apprized of the value of whatever tends to embelliſh life, there is leſs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here to inſiſt on its importance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:037996_0088_100FA9E729C2D778"/>
But, though a well-bred young lady may lawfully learn moſt of the faſhionable arts, yet it does not ſeem to be the true end of education to make women of faſhion <hi>dancers, ſingers, players, painters, actreſſes, ſculptors, gilders, varniſhers, engravers,</hi> and <hi>embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</hi> Moſt <hi>men</hi> are commonly deſtined to ſome profeſſion, and their minds are conſequently turned each to its reſpective object. Would it not be ſtrange if they were called out to exerciſe their profeſſion, or to ſet up their trade, with only a little general knowledge of the trades of all other men, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any previous definite application to their own peculiar calling? The profeſſion of ladies, to which the bent of <hi>their</hi> inſtruction ſhould be turned, is that of daughters, wives, mothers, and miſtreſſes of families. They ſhould be therefore trained with a view to theſe ſeveral conditions, and be furniſhed with a ſtock of ideas, and principles, and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and habits, ready to be applied and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as occaſion may demand, to each of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſituations: for though the arts which merely embelliſh life muſt claim admiration; yet when a man of ſenſe comes to marry, it is a companion whom he wants, and not an artiſt. It is not merely a creature who can paint, and play, and dreſs, and dance; it is a being who can comfort and counſel him; one who can reaſon, and reflect, and feel, and judge, and act, and diſcourſe, and diſcriminate; one
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037996_0089_100FAA173955E310"/>
who can aſſiſt him in his affairs, lighten his cares, ſoothed his ſorrows, purify his joys, ſtrengthen his principles, and educate his children.</p>
                     <p>Almoſt any ornamental talent is a good thing, when it is not the beſt thing a woman has; and talents are admirable when not made to ſtand proxy for virtues. The writer of theſe pages is intimately acquainted with ſeveral ladies who, excelling moſt of their ſex in the art of muſic, but excelling them alſo in prudence and piety, find little leiſure or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, amidſt the delights and duties of a large and lovely family, for the exerciſe of this talent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret that ſo much of their own youth was waſted in acquiring an art which can be turned to ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in married life; and are now conſcientiouſly reſtricting their daughters in the portion of time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to its acquiſition.</p>
                     <p>Far be it from me to diſcourage the cultivation of any exiſting talent; but may it not be ſuggeſted to the fond believing mother, that talents, like the ſpirit of Owen Glendower, though conjured by parental partiality with ever ſo loud a voice,
<q>
                           <l>Yet will not come when you do call for them?</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>That injudicious practice, therefore, cannot be too much diſcouraged, of endeavouring to create talents which do not exiſt in nature. <hi>That their daughters ſhall learn every thing,</hi> is ſo general a maternal maxim, that even unborn daughters, of whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

I know that I am treading on tender ground; but I cannot help thinking that the reſtleſs pains we take to cram up every little vacuity of life, by crowding one new thing upon another, rather creates a thirſt for novelty than knowledge; and is but a well-diſguiſed contrivance to keep us in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>life more effectually from converſing with ourſelves.

                        </gap> but a creditable plan for promoting ſelf-ignorance. We run from one occupation to another (I ſpeak of thoſe arts to which little intellect is applied) with a view to lighten the preſſure of time; above all, we fly to them to ſave us from our own thoughts; whereas were we thrown a little more on our own hands, we might at laſt be driven, by way of ſomething to do, to try to get acquainted with our own hearts; and though our being leſs abſorbed by this buſy trifling, which dignifies its inanity with the impoſing name of occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, might render us ſomewhat more ſenſible of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037996_0091_100FA9E908179050"/>
the tedium of life; might not this very ſenſation tend to quicken our purſuit of a better? For an awful thought here ſuggeſts itſelf. If life be ſo long that we are driven to ſet at work every engine to paſs away the tediouſneſs of time; how ſhall we do to get rid of the tediouſneſs of eternity? an eternity in which not one of the acquiſitions which life has been exhauſted in acquiring, will be of the leaſt uſe? Let not then the ſoul be ſtarved by feeding it on theſe empty huſks, for it can be no more nouriſhed by them than the body can be fed with ideas and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                     <p>Among the boaſted improvements of the preſent age, none affords more frequent matter of peculiar exultation, than the manifeſt ſuperiority in the employments of the young ladies of our time over thoſe of the good houſewives of the laſt century. They glory that they are at preſent employed in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the polite arts, or in acquiring liberal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; while the others wore out their joyleſs days in adorning the manſion-houſe with hangings of hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tapeſtry and disfiguring tent-ſtitch. Moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do I allow to the reigning modes their boaſted ſuperiority; for certainly there is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> piety in bad taſte. Still, granting all the deformity of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded ornaments, one advantage attended them: the walls and floors were not vain of their decorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and it is to be feared, that the little perſon
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:037996_0092_100FA9EBCD848A70"/>
ſometimes is. The flattery beſtowed on the obſolete employments, for probably even <hi>they</hi> had their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, furniſhed leſs aliment and leſs gratification to vanity, and was leſs likely to impair the delicacy of modeſty, than the exquiſite cultivation of <hi>perſonal</hi> accompliſhments or perſonal decorations; and every mode which keeps down vanity and keeps back <hi>ſelf,</hi> has at leaſt a moral uſe. And while one admires the elegant fingers of a young lady, buſied in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or painting her ball dreſs, one cannot help ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that her alacrity may be a little ſtimulated by the animating idea <hi>how very well ſhe ſhall look in it.</hi> Nor was the induſtrious matron of Ithaca more ſoothed at her ſolitary loom with the ſweet reflection that by her labour ſhe was gratifying her filial and conjugal feelings<note n="*" place="bottom">This web a robe for poor Ulyſſes' fire,</note>, than the pleaſure-loving damſel, by the anticipated admiration which her ingenuity is procuring for her beauty.</p>
                     <p>Might not this propenſity be a little checked, and an intereſting feeling combined with her induſtry, were the fair artiſt habituated to exerciſe her ſkill in adorning ſome one elſe rather than herſelf? For it will add no lightneſs to the lighteſt head, nor vanity to the vaineſt heart, to take pleaſure in reflecting how exceedingly the gown ſhe is working will become
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037996_0093_100FA9EF740732D8"/>

This ſuggeſtion, trifling as it may ſeem, of habituating young ladies to exerciſe their taſte and devote their leiſure, not to the decoration of their own perſons, but to the ſervice of thoſe to whom they are bound by every tender tie, would not only help to repreſs vanity, but by thus aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the idea of induſtry with that of filial affection, would promote, while it gratified, ſome of the beſt affections of the heart. The Romans (and it is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying on the ſubject of Chriſtian education to be driven ſo often to refer to the ſuperiority of Pagans) were ſo well aware of the importance of keeping up a ſenſe of family fondneſs and attachment by the very ſame means which promoted ſimple and domeſtic employment, that no citizen of note ever appeared in public in any garb but what was ſpun by his wife and daughter; and this virtuous faſhion was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the days of republican ſeverity, but even in all the pomp and luxury of imperial power, Auguſtus preſerved in his own family this ſimplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                     <p>Let me be allowed to repeat, that I mean not with prepoſterous praiſe to deſcant on the ignorance or the prejudices of paſt times, nor abſurdly to regret that vulgar ſyſtem of education which rounded the little circle of female acquirements within the limits of the ſampler and the receipt book. Yet if a preference almoſt excluſive was then given to what was merely

uſeful, a preference almoſt excluſive alſo is now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to what is merely ornamental. And it muſt be owned, that if the life of a young lady, formerly, too much reſembled the life of a confectioner, it now too much reſembles that of an actreſs; the morning is all rehearſal, and the evening is all performance: and thoſe who are trained in this regular routine, who are inſtructed in order to be exhibited, ſoon learn to feel <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And the exceſſive commendation which the viſitor is expected to pay for his entertainment not only keeps alive the flame of vanity in the artiſt by conſtant fuel, but is not ſeldom exacted at a price which a veracity at all ſtrict would grudge; but when a whole circle are obliged to be competitors who ſhall flatter moſt, it is not eaſy to be at once very ſincere and very civil. And unluckily, while the age is become ſo knowing and ſo faſtidious, that if a young lady does not play like a public perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, no one thinks her worth attending to; yet if ſhe does ſo excel, ſome of the ſobereſt of the admiring circle feel a ſtrong alloy to their pleaſure, on reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The Hebrews, Egyptians, and Greeks, believed that they could more effectually teach their youth maxims of virtue, by calling in the aid of muſic and poetry; theſe maxims, therefore, they put into verſes, and theſe again were ſet to the moſt popular and ſimple tunes, which the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſang; thus was their love of goodneſs excited by the very inſtruments of their pleaſure; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     <argument>
                        <p>On the religious employment of time.—On the manner in which holidays are paſſed.—Selfiſhneſs and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſidered.—Dangers ariſing from the world.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THERE are many well-diſpoſed parents who, while they attend to theſe faſhionable acquirements, do not neglect to infuſe religious knowledge into the minds of their daughters; and having done this are but too apt to conclude that they have fully acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the important duties of education. For having, as they think, ſufficiently grounded them in religion they do not ſcruple to allow their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſpend almoſt the whole of their time exactly like the daughters of worldly people. Now, though it be one great point gained, to have imbued their young minds with the beſt knowledge, the work is not therefore accompliſhed. "What do ye more than others?" is a queſtion which, in a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſenſe, religious parents muſt be prepared to anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Such parents ſhould go on to teach children the religious uſe of time, the duty of conſecrating to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037996_0098_100FA9FD008944A0"/>
God every talent, every faculty, every poſſeſſion, and of devoting their whole lives to his glory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They</hi> ſhould be more peculiarly on their guard againſt a ſpirit of idleneſs, and a ſlovenly habitual waſting of time, becauſe this practice, by not aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a palpable ſhape of guilt, carries little alarm to the conſcience. Even religious characters are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on this ſide; for not allowing themſelves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the world in its exceſſes and diverſions, they have conſequently more time upon their hands; and inſtead of dedicating the time ſo reſcued to its true purpoſes, they ſometimes make as it were compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themſelves for their abſtinence from danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places of public reſort, by an habitual frivolouſneſs at home; by a ſuperabundance of unprofitable ſmall-talk, idle reading, and a quiet and dull fritter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of time. Their day perhaps has been more free from actual evil; but it will often be found to have been as unproductive as that of more world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly characters; and they will be found to have trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to as little purpoſe with their maſter's talents. But a Chriſtian muſt take care to keep his conſcience peculiarly alive to the unapparent, though formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, perils of unprofitableneſs.</p>
                     <p>To theſe, and to all, the author would earneſtly recommend to accuſtom their children to paſs at once from ſerious buſineſs to active and animated recreation; they ſhould carefully preſerve them from
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037996_0099_100FA9FECF8484D8"/>
thoſe long and torpid intervals between both, that languid indolence and ſpiritleſs trifling, which wears out ſuch large portions of life in both young and old. It has indeed paſſed into an aphoriſm, that activity is neceſſary to virtue, even among thoſe who are not apprized that it is alſo indiſpenſable to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So far are many parents from being ſenſible of this truth, that vacations from ſchool are not merely allowed, but appointed to paſs away in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome ſauntering and indeterminate idleneſs; and this by way of converting the holidays into pleaſure! Nay, the idleneſs is ſpecifically made over to the child's mind, as the ſtrongeſt expreſſion of the fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the parent! A diſlike to learning is thus ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematically excited by prepoſterouſly erecting indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence into a reward for application! And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of doing nothing is held out as the beſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for having done well!</p>
                     <p>Theſe and ſuch like errors of conduct ariſe from the latent but very operative principle of ſelfiſhneſs. This principle is obviouſly promoted by many habits and practices ſeemingly of little importance; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſelfiſhneſs is ſo commonly interwoven with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and inconſideration, that I have not always thought it neceſſary to mark the diſtinction. They are alternately cauſe and effect; and are produced and re-produced by reciprocal operation. They are a confederacy who are mutually promoting each
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037996_0100_100FAA005811F8D8"/>
other's ſtrength and intereſt. Ill-judging tenderneſs is in fact only a concealed ſelf-love, which cannot bear to be witneſs to the uneaſineſs which a preſent diſappointment, or difficulty, or vexation, would cauſe to a darling child, yet does not ſcruple by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gratification to ſtore up for it future miſeries, which the child will infallibly ſuffer, though it may be at a diſtant period which the mother will be ſaved the pain of beholding.</p>
                     <p>Another principle ſomething different from this, though it may properly fall under the head of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, ſeems to actuate ſome parents in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards their children: I mean, a certain ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of mind, a love of eaſe, which impoſes a voluntary blindneſs, and makes them not chooſe to ſee what will give them trouble to combat. From ſuch perſons we frequently hear ſuch expreſſions as theſe: "Children will be children:"—"My chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren I ſuppoſe are much like thoſe of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple," &amp;c. Thus we may obſerve this dangerous and deluſive principle frequently turning off with a ſmile from the firſt indications of thoſe tempers, which from their fatal tendency ought to be very ſeriouſly taken up. I would be underſtood now as ſpeaking to conſcientious parents, who conſider it as a duty to correct the faults of their children, but who, from this indolence of mind, are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly backward in <hi>diſcovering</hi> ſuch faults, and not very
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037996_0101_100FAA0529F94128"/>
well pleaſed when they are pointed out by others. Such parents will do well to take notice that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they conſider it as a duty to <hi>correct,</hi> muſt be equally a duty to endeavour to <hi>find out.</hi> And this love of eaſe is the more to be guarded againſt, as it not only leads parents into erroneous conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children, but is peculiarly dangerous to themſelves. It is a fault frequently cheriſhed from ignorance of its real character; for, not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on it the ſtrong features of deformity which mark many other vices, but on the contrary bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome reſemblance to virtue, it is frequently miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the Chriſtian graces of patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forbearance, than which nothing can be more oppoſite; theſe proceeding from the Chriſtian principle of ſelf-denial, the other from ſelf-indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                     <p>In this connection may I be permitted to remark on the practice at the tables of many families, when the children are at home for the holidays; every delicacy is forced upon them, with the tempting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, "that they cannot have this or that dainty at ſchool;" and they are indulged in irregular hours for the ſame motive, "becauſe they cannot have that indulgence at ſchool." Thus the natural ſeeds of idleneſs, ſenſuality, and ſloth, are at once che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, by converting the periodical viſit at home into a ſeaſon of intemperance, late hours, and exemption
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037996_0102_100FAA07E3F6A270"/>
from ſtudy; ſo that children are habituated, at an age when laſting aſſociations are formed in the mind, to connect the idea of ſtudy with that of hardſhip, of happineſs with gluttony, and of pleaſure with loitering, feaſting, or ſleeping. Would it not be better to make them combine the delightful idea of home, with the gratification of the ſocial affections, the fondneſs of maternal love, the kindneſs and warmth and confidence of the ſweet domeſtic attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<q>
                           <l>—And all the charities</l>
                           <l>Of father, ſon, and brother?</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will venture to ſay, that thoſe liſtleſs and vacant days, when the thoughts have no preciſe object; when the imagination has nothing to ſhape; when induſtry has no definite purſuit; when the mind and the body have no exerciſe, and the ingenuity no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition either to anticipate or to enjoy, are the longeſt, the dulleſt, and the leaſt happy, which children of ſpirit and genius ever paſs. Yes! it is a few ſhort but keen and lively intervals of animated pleaſure, ſnatched from between the ſucceſſive labours and duties of a buſy day, looked forward to with hope, enjoyed with taſte, and recollected without remorſe, which, both to men and to children, yield the trueſt portions of enjoyment. O ſnatch your offspring from adding to the number of thoſe objects of ſupreme commiſeration, who ſeek their happineſs
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037996_0103_100FAA096D5E2A90"/>
in doing nothing! Life is but a ſhort day; but it is a working day. Activity <hi>may</hi> lead to evil; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity <hi>cannot</hi> be led to good.</p>
                     <p>Young ladies ſhould alſo be accuſtomed to ſet apart a fixed portion of their time, as ſacred to the poor,<note n="*" place="bottom">It would be a noble employment and well becoming the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of their ſex, if ladies were to conſider the ſuperintendance of the poor as their immediate office. They are peculiarly fitted for it; for from their own habits of life they are more intimately acquainted with domeſtic wants than the other ſex; and in certain inſtances of ſickneſs and ſuffering peculiar to themſelves, they ſhould be expected to have more ſympathy; and they have obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly more leiſure. There is a certain religious ſociety, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſimplicity of their dreſs, manners, and language, whoſe poor are perhaps better taken care of than any other; and one reaſon may be, that they are immediately under the inſpection of the women.</note> whether in relieving, inſtructing, or working for them; and the performance of this duty muſt not be left to the event of contingent circumſtances, or the operation of accidental impreſſions; but it muſt be eſtabliſhed into a principle, and wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a habit. A ſpecific portion of time muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to it, on which no common engagement muſt be allowed to entrench. This will help to furniſh a powerful remedy for that ſelfiſhneſs whoſe ſtrong holds, the truth cannot be too often repeated, it is the grand buſineſs of Chriſtian education perpetually to attack. If we were but aware how much better
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037996_0104_100FAA0D8FFB1080"/>
it makes ourſelves to wiſh to ſee others better, and to aſſiſt in making them ſo, we ſhould find that the good done would be of as much importance by the habit it would induce in our own minds, as by its beneficial effects on others.<note n="*" place="bottom">In addition to the inſtruction of the individual poor, and the ſuperintendance of charity ſchools, ladies might be highly uſeful in aſſiſting the parochial clergy in the adoption of that excellent plan for the inſtruction of the ignorant ſuggeſted by the Biſhop of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham in his laſt admirable charge to his clergy. It is with pleaſure the author is enabled to add that the ſcheme has actually been adopted with good effect in that extenſive dioceſe.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In what relates to pecuniary bounty, it will be requiring of children a very ſmall ſacrifice, if you teach them merely to give that money to the poor which properly belongs to the parent; this ſort of charity commonly ſubtracts little from their own pleaſures, eſpecially when what they have beſtowed is immediately made up to them, as a reward for their little fit of generoſity. They will, on this plan, ſoon learn to give, not only for praiſe but for profit. The ſacrifice of an orange to a little girl, or a feather to a great one, given at the expence of their own gratification, would be a better leſſon of charity on its right ground, than a conſiderable ſum of money to be preſently replaced by the parent. And it would be habituating them early to combine two ideas which ought never to be ſeparated, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſelf-denial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:037996_0105_100FAA0F1780C8E0"/>
As an antidote to ſelfiſhneſs, as well as pride and indolence, they ſhould alſo very early be taught to perform all the little offices in their power for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; not to be inſolently calling for ſervants where there is no real occaſion; above all, they ſhould be accuſtomed to conſider the domeſtics' hours of meals and reſt as almoſt ſacred, and the golden rule ſhould be practically and uniformly enforced, even on ſo trifling an occaſion as ringing a bell through mere wantonneſs, or ſelf-love, or pride.</p>
                     <p>To check the growth of inconſiderateneſs, young ladies ſhould early be taught to diſcharge their little debts with punctuality. They ſhould be made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the cruelty of obliging trades-people to call often for the money due to them; and of hindering and detaining thoſe whoſe time is the ſource of their ſubſiſtence, under pretence of ſome frivolous engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ought to be made to bend to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and advantage of others. They ſhould conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly allow ſufficient time for the execution of their orders; and with a Chriſtian circumſpection, be careful not to drive work-people, by needleſs hurry, into loſing their reſt, or breaking the Sabbath. I have known a lady give her gown to a mantua-maker on the Saturday night, to whom ſhe would not for the world ſay in ſo many words, "You muſt work through the whole of Sunday," while ſhe was virtually compelling her to do ſo, by an injunction
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037996_0106_100FAA11B1EECE70"/>
to bring the gown home finiſhed on the Monday morning, on pain of her diſpleaſure. To theſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips numbers are continually driven by good-natured but inconſiderate employers. As theſe petty exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of inconſideration furniſh alſo a conſtant aliment to ſelfiſhneſs, let not a deſire to counteract them be conſidered as leading to too minute details; nothing is too frivolous for animadverſion, which tends to fix a bad habit in the ſuperior, or to would the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the dependant.</p>
                     <p>Would it not be turning thoſe political doctrines, which are now ſo warmly agitating, to a truly moral account, and give the beſt practical anſwer to the popular declamations on the inequality of human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, were the rich carefully to inſtruct their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſoften that inevitable inequality by the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tenderneſs of their behaviour to their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors? This diſpenſation of God, which excites ſo many murmurs, would, were it thus practically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, tend to eſtabliſh the glory of that Being who is now ſo often reviled for his injuſtice; for God himſelf is covertly attacked in many of the invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives againſt laws and governments, and the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ranks.</p>
                     <p>This diſpenſation, thus properly improved, would at once call into exerciſe the generoſity, kindneſs, and forbearance of the ſuperior; and the patience, reſignation, and gratitude of the inferior: and thus,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:037996_0107_100FAA156B9DB9C8"/>
while we were vindicating the <hi>ways</hi> of Providence, we ſhould be accompliſhing his <hi>plan,</hi> by bringing into action thoſe virtues of both claſſes which would have had little exerciſe had there been no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality in fortune. Thoſe who are ſo zealouſly contending for the privileges of rank and power, ſhould never loſe ſight of the religious duties and conſiderate virtues which the poſſeſſion of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes on themſelves; duties and virtues which ſhould ever be inſeparable from thoſe privileges. As the inferior claſſes have little real right to complain of <hi>laws,</hi> in this reſpect let the great be watchful to give them as little cauſe to complain of <hi>manners;</hi> by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully training up their children to ſupply by individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al kindneſs thoſe caſes of hardſhip which laws cannot reach: by ſuch means every leſſon of politics may be converted into a leſſon of piety; and a ſpirit of condeſcending love might win over ſome, whom a ſpirit of invective will only inflame.</p>
                     <p>It can never be too often repeated, that one of the great objects of education is the forming of habits. Among the inſtances of negligence into which even religiouſly diſpoſed parents and teachers are apt to fall, one is, that they are not ſufficiently attentive in finding intereſting employment for the Sunday. They do not make a ſcruple of ſometimes allowing their children to fill up the intervals of public worſhip with their ordinary employments and
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037996_0108_100F7C642FD3D1F8"/>
common ſchool exerciſes. They are not aware that they are thus training their offspring to an early and a ſyſtematic profanation of the Sabbath by this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; for to children, their taſks are their buſineſs; to them a French or Latin exerciſe is as ſerious an occupation as the exerciſe of a trade or profeſſion is to a man; and if they are allowed to think the one right <hi>now,</hi> they will not be brought hereafter to think that the other is wrong; for the opinions and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices fixed at this early ſeaſon are not eaſily altered. By this overſight even the friends of religion may be contributing eventually to that abolition of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, ſo devoutedly wiſhed by its enemies, as the deſired preliminary to the deſtruction of whatever is moſt dear to Chriſtians. What obſtruction would it offer to the general progreſs of youth, if all their Sunday exerciſes (which, with reading, compoſing, tranſcribing, and getting by heart, might be extended to an entertaining variety) were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apted to the peculiar nature of the day? It is not meant to impoſe on them ſuch rigorous ſtudy as ſhall convert the day they ſhould be taught to love into a day of burdens and hardſhips, or to abridge their innocent enjoyments; but it is intended merely to ſuggeſt that there ſhould be a marked diſtinction in the nature of their employments and ſtudies; for on the obſervance or neglect of this, as was before obſerved, their future notions and principles will in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:037996_0109_100FAA1AEDE79A28"/>
a good degree be formed. The goſpel, in reſcuing the Lord's day from the rigorous bondage of the Jewiſh Sabbath, never leſſened the obligation to keep it holy, nor meant to ſanction any ſecular occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Though the author, chiefly writing with a view to domeſtic inſtruction, has purpoſely avoided en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering on the diſputed queſtion, whether a ſchool or home education be beſt; a queſtion which perhaps muſt generally be decided by the ſtate of the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual home, and the ſtate of the individual ſchool; yet ſhe begs leave to ſuggeſt one remark, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly belongs to a ſchool education; namely, the general habit of converting the Sunday into a viſiting day by way of gaining time; as if the appropriate inſtructions of the Sunday were the cheapeſt ſacrifice which could be made to pleaſure. Even in thoſe ſchools, in which religion is conſidered as an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable part of inſtruction, this kind of inſtruction is almoſt excluſively limited to Sundays: how then are girls ever to make any progreſs in this moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant article, if they are habituated to loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious advantages of the ſchool, for the ſake of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more dainties for dinner abroad? This remark cannot be ſuppoſed to apply to the viſits which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren make to religious parents, and indeed it only applies to thoſe caſes where the ſchool is a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſchool, and the viſit a trifling viſit.</p>
                     <p>

Among other ſubjects which engroſs a good ſhare of worldly converſation, one of the moſt attracting is beauty. Many ladies have often a random way of talking rapturouſly on the general importance of beauty, who are yet prudent enough to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to let their own daughters find out they are handſome. Perhaps the contrary courſe might be ſafer. If the little liſtener were not conſtantly hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that beauty is the beſt gift, ſhe would not be ſo vain from fancying herſelf to be the beſt gifted. Be leſs ſolicitous, therefore, to conceal from her a ſecret which with all your watchfulneſs ſhe will be ſure to find out, without your telling; but rather ſeek to lower the general value of beauty in her eſtimation. Uſe your daughter in all things to a different ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard from that of the world. It is not by vulgar people and ſervants only that ſhe will be told of her being pretty. She will be hearing it not only from gay ladies, but from grave men; ſhe will be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the whole world around her. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote to the preſent danger is not now to be ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; it muſt be already operating; it muſt have been provided for in the foundation laid in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principle ſhe had been imbibing, before this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular temptation of beauty came in queſtion. And this general principle is an habitual indifference to flattery. She muſt have learnt not to be intoxicated by the praiſe of the world. She muſt have learnt to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037996_0111_100FAA1F5B1A1088"/>
eſtimate things by their intrinſic worth, rather than by the world's eſtimation. Speak to her with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kindneſs and commendation of plain but amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble girls; mention with compaſſion ſuch as are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome but ill-educated; ſpeak caſually of ſome who were once thought pretty, but have ceaſed to be good; make uſe of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of beauty, as ſtrong additional reaſons for making that which is little valuable in itſelf, ſtill leſs valuable. As it is a <hi>new</hi> idea which is always dangerous, you may thus break the force of this danger by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her an early introduction to this inevitable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which would become more intereſting, and of courſe more perilous by every additional year: and if you can guard againſt that fatal error of letting her ſee that ſhe is more loved on account of her beauty, her familiarity with the idea may be leſs than its novelty afterwards would prove.</p>
                     <p>But the great and conſtant danger to which young perſons in the higher walks of life are expoſed, is the prevailing turn and ſpirit of general converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Even the children of better families, who are well inſtructed when at their ſtudies, are yet at other times continually beholding the WORLD ſet up in the higheſt and moſt advantageous point of view. Seeing the world! knowing the world! ſtanding well with the world! making a figure in the world! is ſpoken of as including the whole ſum and ſubſtance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:037996_0112_100FAA223B043720"/>
advantages. They hear their education almoſt excluſively alluded to with reference to the <hi>figure</hi> it will enable them to make in the world. In almoſt all companies, they hear all that the world admires ſpoken of with admiration; rank flattered, fame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, power ſought, beauty idolized, money con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the one thing needful, and as the atoning ſubſtitute for the want of all other things; profit held up as the reward of virtue, and worldly eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the juſt and higheſt prize of lawful ambition; and after the very ſpirit of the world has been thus habitually infuſed into them all the week, one cannot expect much effect from their being coldly told now and then on Sundays, that they muſt not "love the world, nor the things of the world." To tell them once in ſeven days that it is a ſin to gratify an appetite which you have been whetting and ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preceding ſix, is to require from them a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſelf-control, which our knowledge of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of the paſſions, eſpecially in early age, ſhould have taught us is impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>This is not the place to animadvert on the uſual miſapplication of the phraſe, "knowing the world;" which term is commonly applied, in the way of pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric, to keen, deſigning, ſelfiſh, ambitious men, who ſtudy mankind in order to turn it to their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But in the true ſenſe of the expreſſion, the ſenſe which Chriſtian parents would wiſh to impreſs
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:037996_0113_100FAA25FB0EF908"/>
on their children, to know the world, is to know its emptineſs, its vanity, its futility, and its wickedneſs. To know it, is to deſpiſe it; and in this view, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Chriſtian in a village may be ſaid to know it better than a hoary courtier or wily politician; for how can they be ſaid to <hi>know</hi> it, who go on to love it, to value it, to be led captive by its allurements, to give their ſoul in exchange for its lying promiſes?</p>
                     <p>But while ſo falſe an eſtimate is often made in faſhionable ſociety of the real value of things; that is, while Chriſtianity does <hi>not</hi> furniſh the ſtandard, and human opinion <hi>does;</hi> while the multiplying our deſires is conſidered as a ſymptom of elegance, though to ſubdue them is made the grand criterion of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; while moderation is beheld as indicating a poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, though to that very poverty of ſpirit the higheſt promiſe of the Goſpel is aſſigned; while worldly wiſdom is enjoined by worldly friends, in contradiction to that aſſertion, "that the wiſdom of the world is fooliſhneſs with God;" while the praiſe of man is to be ſought in oppoſition to that aſſurance, that "the fear of man worketh a ſnare:" while theſe things are ſo, and that they are ſo in a good degree who will deny? may we not venture to affirm that a Chriſtian education, though not an impoſſible, is yet a very difficult work?</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AMONG the real improvements of modern times, and they are not a few, it is to be feared that the growth of filial obedience cannot be included. Who can forbear obſerving and regretting in a variety of inſtances, that not only ſons but daughters have adopted ſomething of that ſpirit of independence, and diſdain of control, which characteriſe the times? And is it not obvious that domeſtic manners are not ſlightly tinctured with the hue of public principles? The <hi>rights of man</hi> have been diſcuſſed, till we are ſomewhat wearied with the diſcuſſion. To theſe have been oppoſed, with more preſumption than prudence, <hi>the rights of woman.</hi> It follows, according to the natural progreſſion of human things, that the next ſtage of that irradiation which our enlighteners are
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:037996_0115_100FAA2BAB3B71A0"/>
pouring in upon us will produce grave deſcants on the <hi>rights of children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This revolutionary ſpirit in families ſuggeſts the remark, that among the faults with which it has been too much the faſhion of recent times to load the memory of the incomparable Milton, one of the charges brought againſt his private character (for with his political character we have here nothing to do) has been, that he was ſo ſevere a father as to have compelled his daughters, after he was blind, to read aloud to him, for his ſole pleaſure, Greek and Latin authors of which they did not underſtand a word. But this is in fact nothing more than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſtrict domeſtic regulations of the age in which Milton lived; and ſhould not be brought forward as a proof of the ſeverity of his individual temper. Nor indeed in any caſe ſhould it ever be conſidered as an hardſhip for an affectionate child to amuſe an afflicted parent, though it ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a heavier ſacrifice of her own pleaſure than in the preſent inſtance<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſpite of this too prevailing ſpirit, numberleſs inſtances might be adduced of filial affection truly honourable to the preſent period. And the author records with pleaſure, that ſhe has ſeen amiable young ladies of high rank conducting the ſteps of a blind but illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious parent with true filial fondneſs; and has often contemplated, in another family, the intereſting attentions of daughters who were both hands and eyes to an infirm and nearly blind father. It is but juſtice to add, that theſe examples are not taken from that middle rank of life which Milton filled, but from the daughters of the higheſt officers in the ſtate.</note>.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="unknown:037996_0116_100FAA2E4AC56E58"/>
Is the author then inculcating the harſh doctrine of parental auſterity? By no means. It drives the gentle ſpirit to artifice, and the rugged to deſpair. It generates deceit and cunning, the moſt hopeleſs and hateful in the whole catalogue of female failings. Ungoverned anger in the teacher, and inability to diſcriminate between venial errors and premeditated offence, though they may lead a timid creature to hide wrong tempers, to conceal bad actions, will not help her to ſubdue the one or correct the other. Severity will drive terrified children to ſeek, not for reformation, but for impunity. A readineſs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them promotes frankneſs. And we ſhould, above all things, encourage them to be frank, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to come at their faults. They have not more faults for being open, they only <hi>diſcover</hi> more.</p>
                     <p>Diſcipline, however, is not cruelty, and reſtraint is not ſeverity. We muſt ſtrengthen the feeble, while we repel the bold. The cultivator of the human mind muſt, like the gardener, ſtudy diverſities of ſoil. The ſkilful labourer knows that even where the ſurface is not particularly promiſing, there is often a rough ſtrong ground which will amply repay the trouble of breaking it up; yet we are often moſt taken with the ſoft ſurface, though it conceal a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:037996_0117_100FAA30E342A068"/>
depth, becauſe it promiſes preſent reward and little trouble. But ſtrong and pertinacious tempers, of which perhaps obſtinacy is the leading vice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſkillful management often turn out ſteady and ſterling characters; while from ſofter clay a firm and vigorous virtue is but ſeldom produced.</p>
                     <p>But theſe revolutions in character cannot be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mere education. Plutarch has obſerved that the medical ſcience would never be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection till poiſons ſhould be converted into phyſic. What our late improvers in natural ſcience have done in the medical world, by converting the moſt deadly ingredients into inſtruments of life and health, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity with a ſort of divine Alchymy has effected in the moral world, by that tranſmutation which makes thoſe paſſions which have been working for ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come active in the cauſe of religion. The violent temper of Saul of Tarſus which was "exceedingly mad" againſt the ſaints of God, did God ſee fit to convert into that burning zeal which enabled Paul the Apoſtle to labour ſo unremittingly for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Gentile world. Chriſtianity indeed does not ſo much give us new affections or faculties, as give a new direction to thoſe we already have. She changes that ſorrow of the world which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death, into "godly ſorrow which worketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance." She changes our anger againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we diſlike, into hatred of their ſins. "The
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037996_0118_100FAA326B6F6280"/>
fear of man which worketh a ſnare," ſhe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutes into "that fear of God which worketh ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." That religion does not extinguiſh the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but alters their object, the animated expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the fervid Apoſtle confirm—<q>Yea, what <hi>fearfulneſs;</hi> yea, what <hi>clearing of yourſelves;</hi> yea, what <hi>indignation;</hi> yea, what <hi>fear;</hi> yea, what <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement deſire;</hi> yea, what <hi>zeal;</hi> yea, what <hi>revenge!</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Corinthians, vii. 11.</note>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, by ſome of the moſt troubleſome paſſions of our nature being converted by the bleſſing of God on a religious education to the ſide of virtue, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpoſe is effected. Becauſe, if I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to change the metaphor, it is the character of the paſſions never to obſerve a neutrality. If they are no longer rebels, they become auxiliaries; and a foe ſubdued is an ally obtained. And it is the effect of religion on the paſſions, that when ſhe ſeizes the enemy's garriſon, ſhe does not deſtroy the works, ſhe does not burn the arſenal and ſpike the cannon; but the artillery ſhe ſeizes, ſhe turns to her own uſe, and plants its whole force againſt the enemy from whom ſhe has taken it.</p>
                     <p>But while I would deprecate harſhneſs, I would enforce diſcipline; and that not merely on the ground of religion, but of happineſs alſo. One reaſon not ſeldom brought forward by tender but miſtaken mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

as an apology for their unbounded indulgence, eſpecially to weakly children, is, that they probably will not live to enjoy the world when grown up, and that therefore they will not abridge the little pleaſure they may enjoy at preſent. But a ſlight degree of obſervation would prove that this is an error in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as in principle. For, omitting any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations reſpecting their future welfare, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only into their immediate intereſts; it is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable fact that children who know no control, whoſe faults encounter no contradiction, and whoſe humours experience conſtant indulgence, grow more irritable and capricious, invent wants, create deſires, loſe all reliſh for the pleaſures which they know they may reckon upon; and become perhaps more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than even thoſe children who labour under the more obvious and more commiſerated misfortune of ſuffering under the tyranny of unkind parents.</p>
                     <p>An early habitual reſtraint is peculiarly important to the future character and happineſs of women. They ſhould when very young be inured to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Inſtead of hearing their <hi>bon-mots</hi> treaſured up and repeated to the gueſts till they begin to think it dull, when they themſelves are not the little hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the theme, they ſhould be accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but little praiſe for their vivacity or their wit, though they ſhould receive juſt commendation for their patience, their induſtry, their humility, and
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:037996_0120_100FAA3917547920"/>
other qualities which have more worth than ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. They ſhould be led to diſtruſt their own judgment; they ſhould learn not to murmur at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation; but ſhould be accuſtomed to expect and to endure oppoſition. It is a leſſon with which the world will not fail to furniſh them; and they will not practiſe it the worſe for having learnt it the ſooner. It is of the laſt importance to their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in life that they ſhould early acquire a ſubmiſſive temper and a forbearing ſpirit. They muſt even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be thought wrong ſometimes, when they cannot but feel they are right. And while they ſhould be anxiouſly aſpiring to do well, they muſt not expect always to obtain the praiſe of having done ſo. But while a gentle demeanor is inculcated, let them not be inſtructed to practiſe gentleneſs merely on the low ground of its being decorous, and femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, and pleaſing, and calculated to attract human favour: but let them be carefully taught to cultivate it on the high principle of obedience to Chriſt; on the practical ground of labouring after conformity to HIM, who, when he propoſed himſelf as a perfect pattern of imitation, did not ſay, Learn of me, for I am great, or wiſe, or mighty, but "Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly:" and graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the reward ſhould accompany the practice, by encouragingly adding, "and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls." Do not teach them humility on the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:037996_0121_100FAA3BB094C098"/>
ordinary ground that vanity is <hi>unamiable,</hi> and that no one will <hi>love</hi> them if they are proud; for that will only go to correct the exterior, and make them ſoft and ſmiling hypocrites. But inform them, that "God reſiſteth the proud," while <q>them that are meek he ſhall guide in judgment, and ſuch as are gentle, them ſhall he teach his way.</q> In theſe, as in all other caſes, an habitual attention to the <hi>motives</hi> ſhould be carefully ſubſtituted in their young hearts, in the place of too much anxiety about the <hi>event</hi> of actions, and too much ſolicitude for that human praiſe which attaches to appearances as much as to realities, to ſucceſs more than to deſert.</p>
                     <p>Let me repeat, that it will be of vaſt importance not to let ſlip the earlieſt occaſions of working gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle manners into an habit on their only true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Chriſtian meekneſs. For this purpoſe I would again urge your calling in the example of our Redeemer in aid of his precepts. Endeavour to make your pupil feel that all the wonders exhibited in his life do not ſo overwhelm the awakened heart with rapture, love, and aſtoniſhment, as the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inſtances of his humility and meekneſs. Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous miracles, exerciſes of infinite power prompted by infinite mercy, are actions which we ſhould na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enough conceive as growing out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections: but ſilence under cruel mockings, patience under reproach, gentleneſs of demeanor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:037996_0122_100FAA3D381A03C8"/>
unparalleled injuries; theſe are perfections of which unaſſiſted nature not only has no conception in a Divine Being, but at which it would revolt, had not the reality been exemplified by our perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern. Healing the ſick, feeding the multitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the blind, raiſing the dead, are deeds of which we could form ſome adequate idea, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily flowing from Almighty goodneſs: but to waſh his diſciples' feet,—to preach the goſpel to the <hi>poor,</hi>—to renounce not only eaſe, for that heroes have done on human motives,—but to renounce praiſe, to forgive his perſecutors, to love his enemies, to pray for his murderers with his laſt breath;—theſe are things which, while they compel us to cry out with the Centurion, "Truly this was the Son of God," ſhould remind us alſo, that they are not only <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> but <hi>imitable</hi> parts of his character. Theſe are perfections which we are not barely to contemplate with holy awe and diſtant admiration, as if they were reſtricted to the <hi>divine</hi> nature of our Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but we muſt conſider them as ſuited to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature alſo, which he condeſcended to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate; in <hi>contemplating,</hi> we muſt <hi>imitate;</hi> and in our meaſure and degree go and do likewiſe. Elevate your thoughts for one moment to this ſtandard, and then go, if you can, and teach your children to be mild, and ſoft, and gentle on worldly grounds, on human motives, and as an external attraction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="unknown:037996_0123_100FAA3FD9AB8498"/>
There is a cuſtom among teachers, which is not the more right for being common; they are apt to beſtow an undue proportion of pains on children of the beſt capacity, as if only geniuſes were worthy of attention. They ſhould reflect that in moderate ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, carefully cultivated, we are perhaps to look for the chief happineſs and virtue of ſociety. If ſuperlative genius had been generally neceſſary, its exiſtence would not have been ſo rare; for Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence could have made thoſe talents common which we now conſider as extraordinary. Beſides, while we are conſcientiouſly inſtructing children of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate capacity, it is a comfort to reflect, that if no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will raiſe them to a high degree in the ſcale of intellectual excellence, yet they may be led on to perfection in that road in which "a way-faring man, though ſimple, ſhall not err." And when a mother feels diſpoſed to repine that her family is not likely to exhibit a groupe of future wits and growing beauties, let her conſole herſelf by looking abroad into the world, where ſhe will quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the monopoly of happineſs is not engroſſed by beauty, nor that of virtue by genius.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps mediocrity of parts was decreed to be the ordinary lot, by way of furniſhing a ſtimulus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and ſtrengthening the motives to virtuous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. For is it not obvious that moderate abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, carefully carried to that meaſure of perfection
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:037996_0124_100FAA438A2DCA08"/>
of which they are capable, often enable their poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to outſtrip, in the race of knowledge and of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, their more brilliant but leſs perſevering com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors? It is with mental endowments, as with other rich gifts of Providence: the inhabitant of the luxuriant ſouthern clime, where Nature has done every thing in the way of vegetation, indolently lays hold on this very fertility as a plea for doing nothing himſelf; ſo that the ſoil which teems with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging abundance leaves the poſſeſſor idle: while the native of the leſs genial region ſupplying by his labours the deficiencies of his lot, overtakes his more favoured competitor; by ſubſtituting induſtry for opulence, he improves the riches of his native land beyond that which is bleſſed with warmer ſuns, and thus vindicates Providence from the charge of partial diſtribution.</p>
                     <p>A girl who has docility will ſeldom be found to want underſtanding ſufficient for all the purpoſes of a uſeful, a happy, and a pious life. And it is as wrong for parents to ſet out with too ſanguine a dependance on the figure their children are to make in life, as it is unreaſonable to be diſcouraged at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſappointment. Want of ſucceſs is ſo far from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing a motive for relaxing their energy, that it is a reaſon for redoubling it. Let them ſuſpect their own plans, and reform them; let them diſtruſt their own principles, and correct them. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:037996_0125_100FAA4515139970"/>
of parents do too little; ſome do much, and miſs their reward, becauſe they look not to any ſtrength beyond their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after much is done, much will remain undone; for the entire regulation of the heart and affections is not the work of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, but the operation of divine grace. Will it be accounted enthuſiaſm to ſuggeſt <q>that the fervent effectual prayer of a righteous <hi>parent</hi> availeth much?</q> and perhaps the reaſon why ſo many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious mothers fail of ſucceſs is, becauſe they repoſe with confidence in their own ſkill and labour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking to HIM without whoſe bleſſing they do but labour in vain.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, is it not to be feared that ſome pious parents have fallen into an error of an oppoſite kind? From a full conviction that human endeavours are vain, and that it is God alone who can change the heart, they are earneſt in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but not ſo earneſt in their endeavours. Such parents ſhould be reminded, that if they do not add their exertions to their prayers, their children are not likely to be more benefited than the children of thoſe who do not add their prayers to their exertions. What God has joined, let not man preſume to ſeparate. It <hi>is</hi> the work of God, we readily acknowledge, to implant religion in the heart, and to maintain it there as a ruling principle of conduct. And is it not the ſame God which cauſes the corn to grow? Are not
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:037996_0126_100FAA47B28DDD30"/>
our natural lives conſtantly preſerved by his power? Who will deny that in him we live, and move, and have our being? But how are theſe works of God carried on? By <hi>means</hi> which he has appointed. By the labour of the huſbandman the corn is made to grow. By food the body is ſuſtained: and by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtruction God is pleaſed to work upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart. As far as <hi>we</hi> ſee of the ways of God, all his works are carried on by <hi>means.</hi> It becomes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our duty to uſe the means and truſt in God; to remember that God will not work without the means; and that the means can effect nothing without his bleſſing. <q>Paul may plant and Apollos water, but it is God muſt give the increaſe.</q> But to what does he give the increaſe?

                     <p>It is one grand object to give the young probation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er juſt and ſober views of the world on which ſhe is about to enter. Inſtead of making her boſom bound at the near proſpect of emancipation from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors; inſtead of teaching her young heart to dance with premature flutterings as the critical win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter draws near in which <hi>ſhe is to come out;</hi> inſtead of raiſing a tumult in her buſy imagination at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her firſt <hi>grown up ball;</hi> endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince her, that the world will not turn out to be
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:037996_0127_100FAA4A5CD7AEA8"/>
that ſcene of unvarying and never-ending delights which ſhe has perhaps been led to expect, not only from the ſanguine temper and warm ſpirits natural to youth, but from the value ſhe has ſeen put on thoſe ſhowy accompliſhments which have too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been fitting her for her exhibition in life. Teach her that this world is not a ſtage for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of ſuperficial talents, but for the ſtrict and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber exerciſe of fortitude, temperance, meekneſs, faith, diligence, and ſelf-denial; of her due perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which Chriſtian graces, Angels will be ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, and God the judge. Teach her that human life is not a ſplendid romance, ſpangled over with brilliant adventures, and enriched with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occurrences, and diverſified with wonderful inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; lead her not to expect that it will abound with ſcenes which will call ſhining qualities and great powers into perpetual action; and for which if ſhe acquit herſelf well ſhe will be rewarded wiſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate fame and certain commendation. But ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize her that human life is a true hiſtory, many paſſages of which will be dull, obſcure, and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting; ſome perhaps tragical; but that whatever gay incidents and pleaſing ſcenes may be interſperſed in the progreſs of the piece, yet finally "one event happeneth to all;" to all there is one awful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible cataſtrophe. Apprize her that the eſtimation which mankind forms of merit is not always juſt,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:037996_0128_100FAA4D0E1FD840"/>
nor its praiſe exactly proportioned to deſert; that the world weighs actions in far different ſcales from "the balance of the ſanctuary," and eſtimates worth by a far different ſtandard from that of the goſpel: apprize her that while her beſt intentions may be ſometimes calumniated, and her beſt actions miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, ſhe will be liable to receive commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on occaſions wherein her conſcience will tell her ſhe has not deſerved it.</p>
                     <p>Do not however give her a gloomy and diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing picture of the world, but rather ſeek to give her a juſt and ſober view of the part ſhe will have to act in it. And humble the impetuoſity of hope, and cool the ardour of expectation, by explaining to her, that this part, even in her beſt eſtate, will probably conſiſt in a ſucceſſion of petty trials, and a round of quiet duties which, however well perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they will make little or no figure in the book of Fame, will prove of vaſt importance to her in that day when <hi>another</hi> 
                        <q>book is opened, and the judgment is ſet, and every one will be judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deeds done in the body, whether they be good or bad.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Say not that theſe juſt and ſober views will cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wither her young hopes, and deaden the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſatisfactions of life. It is not true. There is, happily, an active ſpring in the mind of youth which bounds with freſh vigour and uninjured elaſticity
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:037996_0129_100FAA4FCAD1BEB0"/>
from any ſuch temporary depreſſion. It is not meant that you ſhould darken her proſpect, ſo much as that you ſhould enlighten her underſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template it. And though her feelings, taſtes, and paſſions, will all be againſt you, if you ſet before her a faithful delineation of life, yet it will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to get her judgment on your ſide. It is no unkind office to aſſiſt the ſhort view of youth with the aids of long-ſighted experience, to enable them to diſcover ſpots in the brightneſs of that life which dazzles them in proſpect, though it is probable they will after all chooſe to believe their own eyes rather than the offered glaſs.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>On female ſtudy, and initiation into knowledge.—Error of cultivating the imagination to the neglect of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—Books of reaſoning recommended.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>As this little work by no means aſſumes the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a general ſcheme of education, the author has purpoſely avoided expatiating largely on any kind of inſtruction; but ſo far as it is connected, either immediately or remotely, with objects of a moral or religious nature. Of courſe ſhe has been ſo far from thinking it neceſſary to enter into the enumeration of thoſe books which are uſeful in general inſtruction, that ſhe has forborne to mention any. With ſuch books the riſing generation is far more copiouſly and ably furniſhed than any preceding period has been; and out of an excellent variety the judicious inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or can hardly fail to make ſuch a ſelection as ſhall be beneficial to the pupil.</p>
                     <p>But while due praiſe ought not to be withheld from the improved methods of communicating the elements of general knowledge; yet is there not ſome danger that our very advantages may lead us into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:037996_0131_100FAA569876FC38"/>
by cauſing us to repoſe ſo confidently on the multiplied helps which facilitate the entrance into learning, as to render our pupils ſuperficial through the very facility of acquirement? Where ſo much is done for them, may they not be led to do too little for themſelves? May there not be a moral diſadvantage in poſſeſſing them with the notion that learning may be acquired without diligence and labour? Sound education never <hi>can</hi> be made a "primroſe path of dalliance." Do what we will, we cannot <hi>cheat</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into learning, or <hi>play</hi> them into knowledge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſmoothneſs of the modern creed. There is no idle way to any acquiſitions which really deſerve the name. And as Euclid, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the impetuous vanity of greatneſs, told his Sovereign that there was no royal way to geometry, ſo the fond mother may be aſſured that there is no ſhort cut to any other kind of learning. The tree of knowledge, as a puniſhment, perhaps, for its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been at firſt unfairly taſted, cannot now be climbed without difficulty; and this very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſerves afterwards to furniſh not only literary pleaſures, but moral advantages: for the knowledge which is acquired by unwearied aſſiduity is laſting in the poſſeſſion, and ſweet to the poſſeſſor; both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in proportion to the coſt and labour of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. And though an able teacher ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by improving the communicating faculty in
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:037996_0132_100FAA5821FF2000"/>
himſelf, (for many know what they cannot teach,) to ſoften every difficulty; yet in ſpite of the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ability with which he will ſmooth every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it is probably, among the wiſe inſtitutions of Providence, that great difficulties ſhould ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. For education is but an initiation into that life of trial to which we are introduced on our entrance into this world. It is the firſt breaking-in to that ſtate of toil and labour to which we are born, and to which ſin has made us liable; and in this view of the ſubject the acquiſition of learning may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to higher uſes than ſuch as are purely literary.</p>
                     <p>Will it not be aſcribed to a captious ſingularity if I venture to remark that real knowledge and real piety, though they may have gained in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, have ſuffered in others from that profuſion of little, amuſing, ſentimental books with which the youthful library overflows? Abundance has its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as well as ſcarcity. In the firſt place may not the multiplicity of theſe alluring little works increaſe the natural reluctance to thoſe more dry and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting ſtudies, of which, after all, the rudiments of every part of learning <hi>muſt</hi> conſiſt? And, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is there not ſome danger (though there are many honourable exceptions) that ſome of thoſe engaging narratives may ſerve to infuſe into the youthful heart a ſort of ſpurious goodneſs, a confidence of virtue, a parade of Charity? And that the benevolent actions
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037996_0133_100FAA5AE076F190"/>
with the recital of which they abound, when they are not made to flow from any ſource but feeling, may tend to inſpire a ſelf-complacency a ſelf-gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a "ſtand by, for I am holier than thou?" May they not help to infuſe a love of popularity and an anxiety for praiſe, in the place of that ſimple and unoſtentatious rule of doing whatever good we do, <hi>becauſe it is the will of God?</hi> The univerſal ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this principle would tend to purify the worldly morality of many a popular little ſtory. And there are few dangers which good parents will more carefully guard againſt than that of giving their children a mere political piety; that ſort of religion which juſt goes to make people more reſpectable, and to ſtand well with the world; a religion which is to ſave appearances without inculcating realities.<note n="*" place="bottom">An ingenious (and in many reſpects uſeful) French Treatiſe on Education, has too much encouraged this political piety; by conſidering religion as a thing of human convention, rather than of divine inſtitution; as a thing creditable, rather than command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; by erecting the doctrine of expediency in the place of Chriſtian ſimplicity; and wearing away the ſpirit of truth, by the ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of occaſional deceit, equivocation, ſubterfuge, and mental re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a certain precocity of mind which is much helped on by theſe ſuperficial modes of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for frivolous reading will produce its correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent effect, in much leſs time than books of ſolid
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:037996_0134_100FAA5E890E4490"/>
inſtruction; the imagination being liable to be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, and the feelings to be ſet a-going, much faſter than the underſtanding can be opened and the judgment enlightened. A talent for converſation ſhould be the reſult of education, not its precurſor; it is a golden fruit when ſuffered to ripen gradually on the tree of knowledge; but if forced in the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of a circulating library, it will turn out worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and vapid in proportion as it was artificial and premature. Girls who have been accuſtomed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour frivolous books, will converſe and write with a far greater appearance of ſkill as to ſtyle and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at twelve or fourteen years old, than thoſe of a more advanced age who are under the diſcipline of feverer ſtudies; but the former having early attained to that low ſtandard which had been held out to them, became ſtationary; while the latter, quietly progreſſive, are paſſing through juſt gradations to a higher ſtrain of mind; and thoſe who early begin with talking and writing like women, commonly end with thinking and acting like children.</p>
                     <p>The ſwarms of <hi>Abridgments, Beauties,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiums,</hi> which form too conſiderable a part of a young lady's library, may be conſidered in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as an infallible receipt for making a ſuperficial mind. The <hi>names</hi> of the renowned characters in hiſtory thus become familiar in the mouths of thoſe who can neither attach to the ideas of the perſon,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037996_0135_100FAA6122EA6290"/>
the ſeries of his actions nor the peculiarities of his character. A few fine paſſages from the poets (paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages perhaps which derived their chief beauty from their poſition and connection) are huddled together by ſome extract-maker, whoſe brief and diſconnected patches of broken and diſcordant materials, while they inflame young readers with the vanity of recit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither fill the mind nor form the taſte: and it is not difficult to trace back to their ſhallow ſources the hackney'd quotations of certain <hi>accompliſhed</hi> young ladies, who will be frequently found not to have come legitimately by any thing they know: I mean, not to have drawn it from its true ſpring, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal works of the author from which ſome <hi>beauty-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> has ſevered it. Human inconſiſtency in this, as in other caſes, wants to combine two irreconcileable things; it ſtrives to unite the reputation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the pleaſures of idleneſs, forgetting that nothing that is valuable can be obtained without ſacrifices, and that if we would purchaſe knowledge we muſt pay for it the fair and lawful price of time and induſtry. For this extract-reading, while it accommodates itſelf to the convenience, illuſtrates the character of the age in which we live. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite for pleaſure, and that love of eaſe and indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which is generated by it, leave little time or taſte for ſound improvement; while the vanity, which is equally a characteriſtic of the exiſting peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037996_0136_100FAA6411D25CD8"/>
puts in its claim alſo for indulgence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives to figure away by theſe little ſnatches of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, caught in the ſhort intervals of ſucceſſive amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the taſte, thus pampered with delicious morſels, is early vitiated. The young reader of theſe <hi>cluſtered beauties</hi> conceives a diſreliſh for every thing which is plain, and is impatient if obliged to get through thoſe equally neceſſary though leſs ſhowy parts of a work, in which perhaps the author gives the beſt proof of his judgment by keeping under that occaſional brilliancy of which theſe ſuperficial ſtudents are in conſtant purſuit. In all well-written books, there is much that is good which is not daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling; and theſe ſhallow critics ſhould be taught, that it is for the more tame and unintereſting parts of his work, that the judicious poet commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves thoſe flowers, whoſe beauty is defaced when they are plucked from the garland into which he had ſo ſkilfully woven them.</p>
                     <p>The remark, however, is by no means of general application; there are many valuable works which from their bulk would be almoſt inacceſſible to a great number of readers, and a conſiderable part of which may not be generally uſeful. Even in the beſt written books there is often ſuperfluous matter; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are apt to get enamoured of their ſubject, and to dwell too long on it: every perſon cannot find
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037996_0137_100FAA66B0983368"/>
time to read a longer work on any ſubject, and yet it may be well for them to know ſomething on almoſt every ſubject; thoſe, therefore, who abridge volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous works judiciouſly, render ſervice to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. But there ſeems, if I may venture the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, to be a miſtake in the <hi>uſe</hi> of abridgments. They are put ſyſtematically into the hands of youth, who have, or ought to have, leiſure for the works at large; while abridgments ſeem more immediately calculated for perſons in more advanced life, who wiſh to recall ſomething they had forgotten; who want to reſtore old ideas rather than acquire new ones; or they are uſeful for perſons immerſed in the buſineſs of the world, who have little leiſure for voluminous reading. They are excellent to refreſh the mind, but not competent to form it.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps there is ſome analogy between the mental and bodily conformation of women. The inſtructor therefore ſhould imitate the phyſician. If the latter preſcribe bracing medicines for a body of which delicacy is the diſeaſe, the former would do well to prohibit relaxing reading for a mind which is already of too ſoft a texture, and ſhould ſtrengthen its feeble tone by invigorating reading.</p>
                     <p>By ſoftneſs, I cannot be ſuppoſed to mean imbeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of underſtanding, but natural ſoftneſs of heart, together with that indolence of ſpirit which is foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037996_0138_100FAA6838AA0310"/>
by indulging in ſeducing books, and in the general habits of faſhionable life.</p>
                     <p>I mean not here to recommend books which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately religious, but ſuch as exerciſe the reaſoning faculties, teach the mind to get acquainted with its own nature, and to ſtir up its own powers. Let not a timid young lady ſtart if I ſhould venture to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to her, after a proper courſe of preparation, to ſwallow and digeſt ſuch ſtrong meat as Watt's or Duncan's little book of Logic, ſome parts of Mr. Locke's Eſſay on the Human Underſtanding, and Biſhop Butler's Analogy. Where there is leiſure, and capacity, and an able friend to comment and to counſel, works of this nature might be profitably ſubſtituted in the place of ſo much Engliſh Sentiment, French Philoſophy, Italian Love Songs, and fantaſtic German imagery and magic wonders. While ſuch enervating or abſurd books ſadly diſqualify the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for ſolid purſuit or vigorous thinking, the ſtudies here recommended would act upon the conſtitution of the mind as a kind of alterative, and, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, would help to brace the intellectual ſtamina.</p>
                     <p>This is however by no means intended to exclude works of taſte and imagination, which muſt always make the ornamental part, and of courſe a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part, of female ſtudies. It is only ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they ſhould not form them entirely and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037996_0139_100FAA6AE5069B70"/>
For what is called dry tough reading, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the knowledge it conveys, is uſeful as an habit, and wholeſome as an exerciſe. Serious ſtudy ſerves to harden the mind for more trying conflicts; it lifts the reader from ſenſation to intellect; it abſtracts her from the world and its vanities; it fixes a wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, and fortifies a weak one; it divorces her from matter; it corrects that ſpirit of trifling which ſhe naturally contracts from the frivolous turn of female converſation, and the petty nature of female employments; it concentrates her attention, aſſiſts her in a habit of excluding trivial thoughts, and thus even helps to qualify her for religious purſuits. Yes, I repeat it, there is to woman a Chriſtian uſe to be made of ſober ſtudies; while books of an oppoſite caſt, however unexceptionable they may be ſometimes found in point of expreſſion, however free from evil in its more groſs and palpable ſhapes, yet by their very nature and conſtitution they excite a ſpirit of relaxation, by exhibiting ſcenes and ideas which ſoften the mind and ſet the fancy at work; they impair its general powers of reſiſtance, and at beſt feed habits of improper indulgence, and nouriſh a vain and viſionary indolence, which lays the mind open to error and the heart to ſeduction.</p>
                     <p>Women are little accuſtomed to cloſe reaſoning on any ſubject; ſtill leſs do they inure their minds to conſider particular parts of a ſubject; they are not
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:037996_0140_100FAA6DABAEBD40"/>
habituated to turn a truth round, and view it in all its varied aſpects and poſitions; and this perhaps is one cauſe (as will be obſerved in another<note n="*" place="bottom">Chapter on Converſation.</note> place) of the too great confidence they are diſpoſed to place in their own opinions. Though their imagination is already too lively, and their judgment naturally incorrect; in educating them we go on to ſtimulate the imagination, while we neglect the regulation of the judgment. They already want ballaſt, and we make their education conſiſt in continually crowding more ſail than they can carry. Their intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being ſo little ſtrengthened by exerciſe, makes every little buſineſs appear a hardſhip to them: whereas ſerious ſtudy would be uſeful, were it only that it leads the mind to the habit of conquering dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties. But it is peculiarly hard to turn at once from the indolent repoſe of light reading, from the concerns of mere animal life, the objects of ſenſe, or the frivolouſneſs of chit chat; it is peculiarly hard, I ſay, to a mind ſo ſoftened, to reſcue itſelf from the dominion of ſelf-indulgence, to reſume its powers, to call home its ſcattered ſtrength, to ſhut out every foreign intruſion, to force back a ſpring ſo unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bent, and to devote itſelf to religious reading, to active buſineſs, to reflection, or ſelf-examination, whereas to an intellect accuſtomed to think at all,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:037996_0141_100FAA7157372550"/>
the difficulty of thinking ſeriouſly is obviouſly leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Far be it from me to deſire to make ſcholaſtic la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or female dialecticians; but there is little fear that the kind of books here recommended, if thoroughly ſtudied, and not ſuperficially ſkimmed, will make them pedants or induce conceit; for by ſhewing them the poſſible powers of the human mind, you will bring them to ſee the littleneſs of their own; and to get acquainted with the mind, and to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and inform it, does not ſeem the way to puff it up. But let her who is diſpoſed to be elated with her literary acquiſitions, check her vanity by calling to mind the juſt remark or Swift, <q>that after all her boaſted acquirements, a woman will, generally ſpeaking, be found to poſſeſs leſs of what is called learning than a common ſchool boy.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is there any fear that this ſort of reading will convert ladies into authors. The direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect will be likely to be produced by the peruſal of writers who throw the generality of readers at ſuch an unapproachable diſtance as to check pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, inſtead of exciting it. Who are thoſe ever multiplying authors, that with unparalleled fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundity are overſtocking the world with their quick-ſucceeding progeny?

And ſhe ſolaces herſelf with the conviction that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which has been given to her importunity or her neceſſities, has been offered as an homage to her genius. And this confidence inſtantly levies a freſh contribution for a ſucceeding work. Capacity and cultivation are ſo little taken into the account, that writing a book ſeems to be now conſidered as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure reſource which the idle and the illiterate have always in their power.</p>
                     <p>May the Author be indulged in a ſhort digreſſion while ſhe remarks, though rather out of its place, that the corruption occaſioned by theſe books has ſpread ſo wide, and deſcended ſo low, that not only among milleners, mantua-makers, and other trades where numbers work together, the labour of one girl is frequently ſacrificed that ſhe may be ſpared to read thoſe miſchievous books to the others; but ſhe has been aſſured by clergymen, who have witneſſed the fact, that they are procured and greedily read in the wards of our Hoſpitals! an awful hint, that thoſe who teach the poor to read, ſhould not only

take care to furniſh them with principles which will lead them to abhor corrupt books, but ſhould alſo furniſh them with ſuch books as ſhall ſtrengthen and confirm their principles<note n="*" place="bottom">The above facts furniſh no argument on the ſide of thoſe who would keep the poor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

It is earneſtly hoped that the above facts may tend to impreſs ladies with the importance of ſuperintending the inſtruction of the poor, and of making it an indiſpenſable part of their charity to give them moral and religious books.</note>. And let every Chriſtian remember, that there is no other way of entering truly into the ſpirit of that divine prayer, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions that the name of God may be "hallowed," that "his kingdom (of grace) may come," and that "his will may be done on earth as it is in heaven," than by each individual contributing according to his meaſure to accompliſh the work for which he prays; for to pray that theſe great objects may be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without contributing to their promotion by our exertions, our money, and our influence, is a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inconſiſtency.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>On the religious and moral uſe of hiſtory and geography.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT while every ſort of uſeful knowledge ſhould be carefully imparted to young perſons, it ſhould be imparted not merely for its own ſake, but alſo for the ſake of its ſubſerviency to higher things. All human learning ſhould be taught, not as an end, but a means; and in this view even a leſſon of hiſtory or geography may be converted into a leſſon of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. In the ſtudy of hiſtory, the inſtructor will accuſtom the pupil not merely to ſtore her memory with facts and anecdotes, and to aſcertain dates and epochas; but ſhe will accuſtom her alſo to trace ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to their cauſes, to examine the ſecret ſprings of action, and accurately to obſerve the operation of the paſſions. It is only meant to notice here ſome few of the moral benefits which may be derived from a judicious peruſal of hiſtory; and from among other points of inſtruction, I ſelect the following:</p>
                     <p>The ſtudy of hiſtory may ſerve to give a clearer inſight into the corruption of human nature:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="147" facs="unknown:037996_0146_100FAA7DAC178D48"/>
It may ſhow the <hi>plan</hi> of Providence in the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of events, and in the uſe of unworthy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
                     <p>It may aſſiſt in the <hi>vindication</hi> of Providence, in the common failure of virtue and the ſucceſs of vice:</p>
                     <p>It may lead to a diſtruſt of our own judgment:</p>
                     <p>It may contribute to our improvement in ſelf-knowledge.</p>
                     <p>But to prove to the pupil the important doctrine of human corruption from the ſtudy of hiſtory, will require a truly Chriſtian commentator; for, from the low ſtandard of right eſtabliſhed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of hiſtorians, who erect ſo many perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good characters who fall ſhort of the true idea of Chriſtian virtue, the unaſſiſted reader will be liable to form very imperfect views of what is real goodneſs; and will conclude, as his author ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does, that the true idea of human nature is to be taken from the medium between his beſt and his worſt characters; without acquiring a juſt notion of that prevalence of evil, which in ſpite of thoſe few brighter luminaries that here and there juſt ſerve to gild the gloom of hiſtory, tends abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to eſtabliſh the doctrine. It will indeed be continually eſtabliſhing itſelf by thoſe who, in peruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hiſtory of mankind, carefully mark the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of ſin, from the firſt timid irruption of an evil thought, to the fearleſs accompliſhment of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:037996_0147_100FAA8048CC49F0"/>
crime in which that thought has ended: from the indignant queſtion, <q>Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this great thing?<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings, viii. 13.</note>
                        </q> to the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that very enormity of which he could not endure the ſlighteſt ſuggeſtion.</p>
                     <p>In this connection may it not be obſerved, that young perſons ſhould be put on their guard againſt a too implicit belief in the flattering accounts which ſome voyage-writers are fond of exhibiting of the virtue, amiableneſs, and benignity of ſome of the countries newly diſcovered by our circumnavigators, the ſuperior goodneſs aſcribed to the Hindoos, and particularly the account of the inhabitants of the Pellew Iſlands? Theſe laſt indeed have been almoſt repreſented as having eſcaped the univerſal taint of our common nature, and would ſeem by their purity to have ſprung from another anceſtor than Adam.</p>
                     <p>One cannot forbear ſuſpecting that theſe pleaſing but ſomewhat overcharged portraits of man, in his natural ſtate, are drawn with the invidious deſign, by counteracting the doctrine of human corruption, to degrade the value and even deſtroy the neceſſity of the Chriſtian religion. That in countries profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtianity, very many are not Chriſtians will be too readily granted. Yet, to ſay nothing of the vaſt ſuperiority of goodneſs in the lives of thoſe who
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:037996_0148_100FAA82E308DB58"/>
are really governed by Chriſtianity, is there not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing even in her reflex light which guides to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er purity many of thoſe who do not profeſs to walk by it? I doubt much, if numbers of the unbelievers of a Chriſtian country, from the ſounder views and better habits derived incidentally and collaterally, as it were, from the influence of a Goſpel, the truth of which however they do not acknowledge, would not ſtart at many of the actions which theſe <hi>heathen perfectioniſts</hi> daily commit without heſitation.</p>
                     <p>The religious reader of general hiſtory will obſerve the controlling hand of Providence in the direction of events, and in turning the moſt unworthy actions and inſtruments to the accompliſhment of his own purpoſes. She will mark infinite Wiſdom directing what appears to be caſual occurrences, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of his own plan. She will point out how cauſes ſeemingly the moſt unconnected, events ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the moſt unpromiſing, circumſtances ſeemingly the moſt incongruous, are all working together for ſome final good. She will mark how national as well as individual crimes are often overruled to ſome hidden purpoſe far different from the intention of the actors: how Omnipotence can and often does, bring about the beſt purpoſes by the worſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: how the bloody and unjuſt conqueror is but "the rod of His wrath," to puniſh or to purify his offending children: how "the fury of the oppreſſor,"
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:037996_0149_100FAA868FD6CB58"/>
and the ſufferings of the oppreſſed, will one day vindicate His righteous dealings. She will unfold to the leſs enlightened reader how infinite Wiſdom often mocks the inſignificance of human greatneſs, and the ſhallowneſs of human ability, by ſetting aſide inſtruments the moſt powerful, while He works by agents comparatively contemptible. But ſhe will carefully guard this doctrine of Divine Providence, thus working out his own purpoſes through the ſins of his creatures, and by the inſtrumentality of the wicked, by calling to mind, that while the offender is but a tool in the hands of the great artificer, <q>yet woe be to him by whom the offence cometh!</q> She will explain how all the mutations and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſtates which appear to us ſo unaccountable, and how thoſe operations of Providence which ſeem to us ſo entangled and complicated, all move harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly and in perfect order: that there is not an event but has its commiſſion; not a misfortune which breaks its allotted rank; not a trial which moves out of its appointed track. While calamities and crimes ſeem to fly in caſual confuſion, all is commanded or permitted; all is under the control of a wiſdom which cannot err, of a goodneſs which cannot do wrong.</p>
                     <p>To explain my meaning by a few inſtances. When the ſpirit of the youthful reader riſes in honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at that hypocritical piety which divorced
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:037996_0150_100FAA8817644030"/>
an unoffending Queen to make way for the lawful crime of our eighth Henry's marriage with Ann Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn; and when that indignation is increaſed by the more open profligacy which brought about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the latter; the inſtructor will not loſe ſo fair an occaſion for unfolding how in the councils of the Moſt High the crimes of the king were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled to the happineſs of the country; and how, to this inauſpicious marriage, from which the heroic Elizabeth ſprung, the Proteſtant religion owed its firm ſtability.</p>
                     <p>She will explain to her, how even the conqueſts of ambition, after having deluged a land with blood, and involved the perpetrator in guilt, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent victim in ruin, may yet be made the inſtruments of opening to future generations the way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, to civilization, to Chriſtianity. She may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind her, as they are following Caeſar in his invaſion of Britain, that whereas the conqueror fancied he was only gratifying his own inordinate ambition, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flight of the Roman Eagle, immortalizing his own name, and proving that "this world was made for Caeſar;" he was in reality becoming the effectual though unconſcious inſtrument of leading a land of barbarians to civilization and to ſcience: and was in fact preparing an iſland of Pagans to embrace the religion of Chriſt. She will inform her, that when the above-named victorious nation had made
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:037996_0151_100FAA8B023A28F0"/>
Judea a Roman province, and the Jews had become their tributaries, the Romans did not know, nor did the indignant Jews ſuſpect, that this circumſtance was confirming an event the moſt important the world ever ſaw.</p>
                     <p>For when <q>Auguſtus ſent forth a decree that all the world ſhould be taxed;</q> he thought he was only enlarging his own imperial power, whereas he was acting in unconſcious ſubſervience to the decree of a higher Sovereign, and was helping to aſcertain by a public act the exact period of Chriſt's birth, and furniſhing a record of his extraction from that family from which it was predicted by a long line of Prophets that he ſhould ſpring. Herod's atrocious murder of the innocents has added an additional circumſtance for the confirmation of <hi>our</hi> faith; nay, the treachery of Judas, and the injuſtice of Pilate, were the human inſtruments employed for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
                     <p>The youth that is not armed with Chriſtian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, will be tempted to mutiny not only againſt the juſtice, but the very exiſtence of a ſuperintending Providence, in contemplating thoſe frequent inſtances which occur in hiſtory of the ill ſucceſs of the more virtuous cauſe, and the proſperity of the wicked. He will ſee with aſtoniſhment that it is Rome which triumphs, while Carthage, which had clearly the better cauſe, falls. Now and then indeed a Cicero
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:037996_0152_100FAA8D9FD58170"/>
prevails, and a Cataline is ſubdued: but often, it is Caeſar ſucceſsful againſt the ſomewhat juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pretenſions of Pompey, and againſt the ſtill clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſe of Cato. It is Octavius who triumphs, and it is over Brutus that he triumphs! It is Tiberius that is enthroned, while Germanicus falls!</p>
                     <p>Thus his faith in a righteous Providence at firſt view is ſtaggered, and he is ready to ſay, Surely it is not God that governs the earth! But on a fuller conſideration, (and here the ſuggeſtions of a Chriſtian inſtructor are peculiarly wanted), there will appear great wiſdom in this very confuſion of vice and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for it is calculated to ſend one's thoughts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to a world of retribution, the principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution being ſo imperfectly eſtabliſhed in this. It is indeed ſo far common for virtue to have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage here, in point of happineſs at leaſt, though not of glory, that the courſe of Providence is ſtill calculated to prove that God is on the ſide of virtue; but ſtill, virtue is ſo often unſucceſsful, that clearly the God of virtue, in order that his work may be perfect, muſt have in reſerve a world of retribution. This confuſed ſtate of things therefore is juſt that ſtate which is moſt of all calculated to confirm the deeply conſiderate mind in the belief of a future ſtate: for if all were even here, or very nearly ſo, ſhould we not ſay <q>Juſtice is already ſatisfied, and there <hi>needs</hi> no other world?</q> On the other hand,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:037996_0153_100FAA9180611F48"/>
if vice always triumphed, ſhould we not then be ready to argue in favour of vice rather than virtue, and to <hi>wiſh</hi> for no other world?</p>
                     <p>It ſeems ſo very important to ground young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the belief that they will not inevitably meet in this world with reward and ſucceſs according to their merit, but to habituate them to expect even the moſt virtuous attempts to be often, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſappointed, that I am in danger of tautology on this point. This fact is preciſely what hiſtory teaches. The truth ſhould be plainly told to the young reader; and the antidote to that evil, which miſtaken and worldly people would expect to ariſe from divulging this diſcouraging doctrine, is <hi>faith.</hi> The importance of faith therefore, and the neceſſity of it to real, unbending, and perſevering virtue, is ſurely made plain by profane hiſtory itſelf. For the ſame thing which happens to ſtates and kings, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to private life and to individuals.</p>
                     <p>Diſtruſt and diffidence in our own judgment ſeems to be alſo an important inſtruction to be learnt from hiſtory. How contrary to all expectation do the events therein recorded commonly turn out? and yet we proceed to foretel this and that event from the appearances of things under our own obſervation, with the ſame arrogant certainty as if we had never been warned by the monitory annals of mankind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="155" facs="unknown:037996_0154_100FAA930AA40F60"/>
There is ſcarcely one great event in hiſtory which does not, in the iſſue, produce effects upon which human foreſight could never have calculated. The ſucceſs of Auguſtus againſt his country produced peace in many diſtant provinces, who thus ceaſed to be haraſſed and tormented by this oppreſſive republic. Could this effect have been foreſeen, it might have ſobered the deſpair of Cato, and checked the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of Brutus. In politics, in ſhort in every thing except in morals and religion, all is, to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree, uncertain. This reaſoning is not meant to ſhew that Cato ought not to have <hi>fought,</hi> but that he ought not to have <hi>deſponded</hi> even after the laſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and certainly, even upon his own principles, ought not to have killed himſelf. It would be departing too much from my object to apply this argument againſt thoſe who were driven to unreaſonable diſtruſt and deſpair by the late ſucceſſes of a neighbouring nation.</p>
                     <p>But all knowledge will be comparatively of little value, if we neglect ſelf-knowledge; and of ſelf-knowledge hiſtory and biography may be made ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful vehicles. It will be to little purpoſe that our pupils become accurate critics on the characters of others, while they remain ignorant of themſelves; for while to thoſe who exerciſe a habit of ſelf-appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation a book of profane hiſtory may be made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of improvement in this difficult ſcience; ſo
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:037996_0155_100FAA96E16A17A8"/>
without this habit the Bible itſelf may, in this view, be read with little profit.</p>
                     <p>It will be to no purpoſe that the reader weeps over the fortitude of the Chriſtian hero, or the conſtancy of the martyr, if ſhe do not bear in mind that ſhe herſelf is called to endure her own common trials with ſomething of the ſame temper: if ſhe do not bear in mind that, to control irregular humours, and to ſubmit to the daily vexations of life, will require, though in a lower degree, the exertion of the ſame principle, and ſupplication for the aid of the ſame ſpirit which ſuſtained the Chriſtian hero in the trying conflicts of life, or the martyr in his agony at the ſtake.</p>
                     <p>May I be permitted to ſuggeſt a few inſtances, by way of ſpecimen, how both ſacred and common hiſtory may tend to promote ſelf-knowledge? And let me again remind the warm admirer of ſuffering piety under extraordinary trials, that if ſhe now fail in the petty occaſions to which ſhe is actually called out, ſhe would not be likely to have ſtood in thoſe more trying occaſions which excite her admiration.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe is applauding the ſelf-denying ſaint who renounced his eaſe, or choſe to embrace death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than violate his duty, let her aſk herſelf if ſhe has never refuſed to ſubmit to the paltry inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of giving up her company, or even altering her dinner-hour on a Sunday, by which trifling ſacrifice
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:037996_0156_100FAA99D37FBEB8"/>
her family might have been enabled to attend the public worſhip in the afternoon.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe reads with horror that Belſhazzar was rioting with his thouſand nobles at the very moment when the Perſian army was burſting through the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen gates of Babylon; is ſhe very ſure that ſhe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in an almoſt equally imminent moment of public danger, has not been nightly indulging in every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſſipation?</p>
                     <p>When ſhe is deploring the inconſiſtency of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, while ſhe contraſts Mark Anthony's bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and contempt of eaſe at one period, with his licentious indulgences at another; or while ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments over the intrepid ſoul of Caeſar, whom ſhe had been following in his painful marches, or admiring in his contempt of death, diſſolved in diſſolute plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with the enſnaring Queen of Egypt; let her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether ſhe herſelf has never, though in a much lower degree, evinced ſomething of the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency? whether ſhe who lives perhaps an orderly, ſober, and reaſonable life during her ſummer reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the country, does not plunge with little ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the winter into all the moſt extravagant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the capital? whether ſhe never carries about with her an accommodating kind of religion, which can be made to bend to places and ſeaſons, to cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and cuſtoms; which takes its tincture from
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:037996_0157_100FAA9B5BF6C488"/>
the faſhion without, and not its habits from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within?</p>
                     <p>While ſhe is admiring the generoſity of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in giving away kingdoms and provinces, let her, in order to aſcertain whether ſhe could imitate this magnanimity, take heed if ſhe herſelf is daily ſeizing all the little occaſions of doing good, which every day preſents to the affluent? <hi>Her</hi> call is not to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice a province; but does ſhe ſacrifice an opera ticket? She who is not doing all the good ſhe can under her preſent circumſtances, would not do all ſhe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees ſhe ſhould, in imaginary ones, were her power enlarged to the extent of her wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe is inveighing with patriotic indignation, that in a neighbouring metropolis thirty theatres were open every night in time of war and public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, is ſhe very clear, that in a metropolis which contains only three, ſhe was not almoſt conſtantly at one of them in time of war and public calamity alſo? For though in a national view it may make a wide difference whether there be in the capital three theatres or thirty, yet, as the ſame perſon can only go to one of them at once, it makes but little difference as to the quantum of diſſipation in the individual. She who rejoices at ſucceſsful virtue in a hiſtory, or at the proſperity of a perſon whoſe intereſts do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with her own, may exerciſe her ſelf-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by examining whether ſhe rejoices equally at
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037996_0158_100FAA9DFA89DAE8"/>
the happineſs of every one about her; and let her remember ſhe does not rejoice at it in the true ſenſe, if ſhe does not labour to promote it. She who glows with rapture at a virtuous character in hiſtory, ſhould aſk her own heart, whether ſhe is equally ready to do juſtice to the fine qualities of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, though ſhe may not particularly love them; and whether ſhe takes unfeigned pleaſure in the ſuperior talents, virtues, fame, and fortune of thoſe whom ſhe profeſſes to love, though ſhe is eclipſed by them?</p>
                     <p>In like manner, in the ſtudy of geography and natural hiſtory, the attention ſhould be habitually turned to the goodneſs of Providence, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapts the various productions of climates to the peculiar wants of the reſpective inhabitants. To il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate my meaning by one or two inſtances out of a thouſand. The reader may be led to admire the conſiderate goodneſs of Providence in having cauſed the ſpiry fir, whoſe ſlender foliage does not obſtruct the beams of the ſun, to grow in the dreary regions of the North, whoſe ſhivering inhabitants could ſpare none of its ſcanty rays; while in the torrid zone, the palm-tree, the plantane, and the banana, ſpread their umbrella leaves to break the almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037996_0159_100FAAA1FB7803A8"/>
fervors of a vertical ſun. How the camel, who is the ſole carrier of all the merchandiſe of Turkey, Perſia, Egypt, Arabia, and Barbary, who is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tranſport his incredible burthens through coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in which paſture is ſo rare, can ſubſiſt twenty-four hours without food, and can travel, loaded, many days without water, through dry and duſty deſerts, which ſupply none; and all this, not from the habit but from the conformation of the animal: for Naturaliſts make this conformity of powers to climates a rule of judgment in aſcertaining the native countries of animals, and always determine it to be that to which their powers and properties are moſt appropriate.</p>
                     <p>Thus the writers of natural hiſtory are perhaps unintentionally magnifying the operations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when they inſiſt that animals do not modify and give way to the influence of other climates; but here they too commonly ſtop; and here the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtructor will come in, in aid of their deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for Philoſophers too ſeldom trace up cauſes, and wonders, and bleſſings to their Author.

                     <q>
                        <p>PERSONS having been accuſtomed from their cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to learn words before they knew the ideas for which they ſtand, uſually continue to do ſo all their lives, never taking the pains to ſettle in their minds the determined ideas which belong to them. This want of a preciſe ſignification in their words, when they come to reaſon, <hi>eſpecially in moral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> is the cauſe of very obſcure and uncertain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They uſe theſe undetermined words confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, without much troubling their heads about a certain fixed meaning, whereby, beſides the eaſe of it, they obtain this advantage, that as in ſuch diſcourſe they are ſeldom in the right, ſo they are as ſeldom to be convinced that they are in the wrong, it being juſt the ſame to go about to draw thoſe perſons out of their miſtakes, who have no ſettled notions, as to diſpoſſeſs a vagrant of his habitation who has no ſettled abode.—The chief end of language being to be underſtood,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:037996_0162_100FAAAA092E76C0"/>
words ſerve not for that end when they do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in the hearer the ſame idea which they ſtand for in the mind of the ſpeaker.<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke.</note>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>I have choſen to ſhelter myſelf under the broad ſanction of the great Author here quoted, with a view to apply this rule in philology to a moral pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for it applies to the veracity of converſation as much as to its correctneſs; and as ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends unequivocal and ſimple truth, as accurate and juſt expreſſion. Scarcely any one perhaps has an adequate conception how much clear and correct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions favour the elucidation of truth; and the ſide of truth is obviouſly the ſide of morals; it is in fact one and the ſame cauſe; and it is of courſe the ſame cauſe with that of true religion alſo.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore no worthleſs part of education to ſtudy the preciſe meaning of words, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate ſignification of language. To this end I know no better method than to accuſtom young perſons very early to define common words and things; for, as definition ſeems to lie at the root of correctneſs, to be accuſtomed to define Engliſh words in Engliſh, would improve the underſtanding more than barely to know what thoſe words are called in French or Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian. Or rather, one uſe of learning other languages is, becauſe definition is often involved in etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy;
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:037996_0163_100FAAACF3FC3658"/>
that is, ſince many Engliſh words take their derivation from foreign languages, they cannot be ſo accurately underſtood without ſome knowledge of thoſe languages: but preciſion of any kind too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom finds its way into the education of women.</p>
                     <p>It is perhaps going out of my province to obſerve, that it might be well if young <hi>men</hi> alſo, before they entered on the world, were to be furniſhed with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect definitions of certain words, the uſe of which is become rather ambiguous. For inſtance; they ſhould be provided with a good definition of the word <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> in the faſhionable ſenſe, ſhewing what vices it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, and what virtues it does not include: the term <hi>good company,</hi> which even the courtly Petronius of our days has defined as ſometimes including not a few immoral and diſreputable characters: <hi>religion,</hi> which in the various ſenſes aſſigned it by the world, ſometimes means ſuperſtition, ſometimes fanaticiſm, and ſometimes a mere diſpoſition to attend on any kind of form of worſhip: the word <hi>goodneſs,</hi> which is made to mean every thing that is not notoriouſly bad; and ſometimes even that too, if what is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly bad be accompanied by good humour, pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manners, and a little alms-giving. By theſe means they would go forth armed againſt many of the falſe opinions which through the abuſe or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous meaning of words paſs ſo current in the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="165" facs="unknown:037996_0164_100FAAAE82B6A420"/>
But to return to the youthful part of that ſex which is the more immediate object of this little work. With correct definition they ſhould alſo be taught to ſtudy the ſhades of words, and this not merely with a view to accuracy of expreſſion, but to moral truth.</p>
                     <p>It may be thought ridiculous to aſſert, that morals have any connection with the purity of language, or that the preciſion of truth may be violated through defect of critical exactneſs in the three degrees of compariſon: yet how frequently do we hear from the dealers in ſuperlatives, of "moſt admirable," ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent, and "quite perfect" people, who, to plain perſons, not bred in the ſchool of exaggeration, would appear mere common characters, not riſing above the level of mediocrity! By this negligence in the juſt application of words, we ſhall be as much miſled by theſe trope and figure ladies, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade as when they panegyrize; for to a plain and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber judgment, a tradeſman may not be "the moſt good-for-nothing fellow that ever exiſted," merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible for him to execute in an hour an order which required a week; a lady may not be "the moſt hideous fright the world ever ſaw," though the make of her gown may have been obſolete for a month; nor may one's young friend's father be "a monſter of cruelty," though he may be a quiet gentleman who does not chooſe to live at watering-places,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037996_0165_100FAAB22C326848"/>
places, but likes to have his daughter ſtay at home with him in the country.</p>
                     <p>But of all the parts of ſpeech the interjection is the moſt abundantly in uſe with the hyperbolical fair ones. Would it could be added that theſe emphatical expletives (if I may make uſe of a contradictory term) were not ſometimes tinctured with profaneneſs! Though I am perſuaded that idle habit is more at the bottom of this deep offence than intended impiety, yet there is ſcarcely any error of youthful talk which wants ſeverer caſtigation. And an habit exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be rejected by poliſhed people as vulgar, even if it were not abhorred as profane.</p>
                     <p>The habit of exaggerating trifles, together with the grand female failing of mutual flattery, and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate general profeſſion of fondneſs and attachment, is inconceivably cheriſhed by the voluminous private correſpondences in which ſome girls are indulged. A facility of ſtyle, and an eaſy turn of expreſſion, are dearly purchaſed by the ſacrifice of that truth, ſobriety, and correctneſs of language, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous ſimplicity of character and manners ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in female youth.</p>
                     <p>But antecedent to this <hi>epiſtolary period</hi> of life, they ſhould have been accuſtomed to the moſt ſcrupulous exactneſs in whatever they relate. They ſhould maintain the moſt critical accuracy in <hi>facts,</hi> in <hi>dates,</hi> in <hi>numbering,</hi> in <hi>deſcribing,</hi> in ſhort, in whatever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:037996_0166_100FAAB4C8970538"/>
either directly or indirectly, cloſely or remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the great fundamental principle, <hi>Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The converſation of young females is alſo in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being overloaded with epithets. As in the warm ſeaſon of youth hardly any thing is ſeen in the true point of viſion, ſo hardly any thing is named in naked ſimplicity; and the very ſenſibility of the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is partly a cauſe of the extravagance of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. But here, as in other points, the ſacred writers, particularly of the New Teſtament, preſent us with the pureſt models; and its natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laboured ſtyle of expreſſion is perhaps not the meaneſt evidence of the truth of the goſpel. There is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole narratives, no overcharged character, no elaborate deſcription, nothing ſtudiouſly emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as if truth of itſelf were weak, and wanted to be helped out. There is little panegyric, and leſs invective; none but on great, and awful, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable occaſions. The authors record their own faults with the ſame honeſty as if they were the faults of other men, and the faults of other men with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle amplification as if they were their own. There is perhaps no book in which adjectives are ſo ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed. A modeſt ſtatement of the fact, with no colouring and little comment, is the example held out to us for correcting the exuberances of paſſion and of language, by that divine volume which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes us with the ſtill more important rule of faith
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:037996_0167_100FAAB6A6056DD0"/>
and ſtandard of practice. Nor is the truth lowered by any feebleneſs; for with all this plainneſs there is ſo much force that a few ſimple touches and artleſs ſtrokes of Scripture characters convey a ſtronger out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line of the perſon delineated, than is ſometimes given by the moſt elaborate portrait of more artificial hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected to this remark, that many parts of the ſacred writings abound in a lofty, figurative, and even hyperbolical ſtyle; this objection applies chiefly to the writings of the Old Teſtament, and to the prophetical and poetical parts of that. But this metaphorical and florid ſtyle is diſtinct from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accurate and overſtrained expreſſion we have been cenſuring; for that only is inaccuracy which leads to a falſe and inadequate conception in the reader or hearer. The lofty ſtyle of the Eaſtern, and of other heroic poetry does not ſo miſlead, for the metaphor is underſtood to be a metaphor, and the imagery is underſtood to be ornamental. The ſtyle of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament is not, it is true, plain in oppoſition to figurative, nor ſimple in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to florid; but it is plain and ſimple in the beſt ſenſe; it raiſes no falſe idea; it gives an exact im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the thing it means to convey; and its very tropes and figures, though bold, are never unnatural or affected. Even when it exaggerates, it does not miſrepreſent; if it be hyperbolical, it is ſo either in
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:037996_0168_100FAAB96C4F8950"/>
compliance with the genius of Oriental language, or in compliance with contemporary cuſtoms, or becauſe the ſubject is one which will be moſt forcibly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a bold figure. The loftineſs of the expreſſion deducts nothing from the truth of the circumſtance, and the imagery animates the reader without miſlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>On religion.—The neceſſity and duty of early inſtruction ſhewn by analogy with human learning.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT has been the faſhion of our late innovators in philoſophy, who have written ſome of the moſt bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and popular treatiſes on education, to decry the practice of early inſtilling religious knowledge into the minds of children: it has been alleged that it is of the utmoſt importance to the cauſe of truth, that the mind of man ſhould be kept free from prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and in particular, that every one ſhould be left to form ſuch judgment on religious ſubjects as may ſeem beſt to his own reaſon in maturer years.</p>
                     <p>This ſentiment has received ſome countenance from thoſe who have wiſhed, on the faireſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to encourage free inquiry in religion; but it has been puſhed to the blameable exceſs here cenſured, chiefly by the new philoſophers; who, while they profeſs only an ingenuous zeal for truth, are in fact ſlily endeavouring to deſtroy Chriſtianity itſelf, by diſcountenancing, under the plauſible pretence of free inquiry, all attention whatever to the religious education of our youth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="unknown:037996_0170_100FAAC003927D60"/>
It is undoubtedly our duty, while we are inſtilling principles into the tender mind, to take peculiar care that thoſe principles be ſound and juſt; that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion we teach be the religion of the Bible, and not the inventions of human error or ſuperſtition: that the principles we infuſe into others, be ſuch as we ourſelves have well ſcrutinized, and not the reſult of our credulity or bigotry; nor the mere hereditary, unexamined prejudices of our own undiſcerning childhood. It may alſo be granted, that it is the duty of every parent to inform the youth, that when his faculties ſhall have ſo unfolded themſelves as to enable him to examine for himſelf thoſe principles which the parent is now inſtilling, it will be his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo to examine them.</p>
                     <p>But after making theſe conceſſions, I would moſt ſeriouſly inſiſt that there are certain leading and fundamental truths; that there are certain ſentiments on the ſide of Chriſtianity, as well as of virtue and benevolence, in favour of which every child <hi>ought</hi> to be prepoſſeſſed; and may it not be alſo added, that to expect to keep the mind void of all prepoſſeſſion, even upon any ſubject, appears to be altogether a vain and impracticable attempt? an attempt which argues much ignorance of human nature.</p>
                     <p>Let it be obſerved here that we are not combating the infidel; that we are not producing evidences and arguments in <hi>favour</hi> of Chriſtianity, or trying to win
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:037996_0171_100FAAC191735C88"/>
over the aſſent of the reader to that which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; but that we are taking it for granted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Chriſtianity is true, but that we are addreſſing thoſe who believe it to be true. Aſſuming, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there are religious principles which are true, and which ought to be communicated in the moſt effectual manner, the next queſtion which ariſes ſeems to be, at what age and in what manner theſe ought to be inculcated? That it ought to be at an early period we have both the example and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt; for he himſelf attended his parents in their annual public devotions at Jeruſalem during his own infancy; and afterwards in his public mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration encouragingly ſaid, "Suffer <hi>little</hi> children to come unto me."</p>
                     <p>But here conceding for the ſake of argument what yet cannot be conceded, that ſome good reaſons <hi>may</hi> be brought in favour of delay; allowing that ſuch impreſſions as are communicated early may not be very deep; allowing them even to become totally ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced by the ſubſequent corruptions of the heart and of the world; ſtill I would illuſtrate the importance of early infuſing religious knowledge, by an alluſion drawn from the power of early habit in human learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Put the caſe, for inſtance, of a perſon who was betimes initiated in the rudiments of claſſical ſtudies. Suppoſe him after quitting ſchool to have fallen, either by a courſe of idleneſs or of vulgar
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:037996_0172_100FAAC46F6FF390"/>
purſuits, into a total neglect of ſtudy. Should this perſon at any future period happen to be called to ſome profeſſion, which would oblige him, as we ſay, to rub up his Greek and Latin; his memory ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the unobliterated though faint traces of his early purſuits, he will be able to recover his neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed learning with leſs difficulty than he could now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to learn; for he is not again obliged to ſet out with ſtudying the ſimple elements; they come back on being purſued; they are found on being ſearched for; the decayed images aſſume ſhape, and ſtrength, and colour; he has in his mind firſt principles to which to recur; the rules of grammar which he has allowed himſelf to violate, he has not however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; he will recall neglected ideas, he will reſume ſlighted habits far more eaſily than he could now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to acquire new ones. I appeal to Clergymen who are called to attend the dying beds of ſuch as have been bred in groſs and ſtupid ignorance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for the juſtneſs of this compariſon. Do they not find that theſe unhappy people have no ideas in common with them? that they poſſeſs no intelligible medium by which to make themſelves underſtood? that the perſons to whom they are addreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have no firſt principles to which they can be referred? that they are ignorant not only of the ſcience, but the language of Chriſtianity?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:037996_0173_100FAAC8202078D8"/>
But at worſt, whatever be the event to the child, though in general we are encouraged, from the tenor of Scripture and the courſe of experience, to hope that that event would be favourable, is it nothing for the parent to have acquitted himſelf of his prime duty? And will not the parent who ſo acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with better reaſon and more lively hope, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Father of mercies for the reclaiming of a prodigal, who has wandered out of that right path in which he had ſet him forward, than for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a neglected creature, to whoſe feet the Goſpel had never been offered as a light? And how different will be the dying reflections even of that parent whoſe earneſt-endeavours have been unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily defeated by the ſubſequent and voluntary perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his child, from his who will reaſonably ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his pangs by transferring the ſins of his neglected child to the number of his own tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                     <p>And to ſuch well-intentioned but ill-judging pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as really wiſh their children to be hereafter pious, but erroneouſly withhold inſtruction till the more advanced period preſcribed by the great maſter of ſplendid paradoxes<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau.</note> ſhall arrive; who can aſſure them that while they are withholding the good ſeed, the great and ever vigilant enemy, who aſſiduouſly

ſeizes hold on every opportunity which <hi>we</hi> neglect, may not be ſtocking the fallow ground with tares? Nay, who in this fluctuating ſcene of things can be aſſured, even if this were not certainly to be the caſe, that to them the promiſed period ever ſhall arrive at all? Who ſhall aſcertain to them that their now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected child ſhall certainly live to receive the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtruction? Who can aſſure them that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will live to communicate it?</p>
                     <p>It is almoſt needleſs to obſerve that parents who are indifferent about religion, much more thoſe who treat it with ſcorn, are not likely to be anxious on this ſubject; it is therefore the attention of <hi>religious</hi> parents which is here chiefly called upon; and the more ſo, as there ſeems, on this point, an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able negligence in many of theſe, whether it ariſe from indolence, falſe principles, or whatever other motive.</p>
                     <p>But independent of knowledge, it is ſomething, nay, let philoſophers ſay what they will, it is much, to give youth <hi>prepoſſeſſions</hi> in favour of religion, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their <hi>prejudices</hi> on its ſide before you turn them adrift into the world; a world in which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be completely armed with arguments and reaſons, they will be aſſailed by numbers whoſe prepoſſeſſions and prejudices, far more than <hi>their</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and reaſons, attach them to the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="unknown:037996_0175_100FAACC44F7E960"/>
Why ſhould not the Chriſtian youth furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a good cauſe with the ſame natural armour which the enemies of religion wear in a bad one? It is certain that to ſet out with ſentiments in favour of the religion of our country is no more an error or a weakneſs, than to grow up with a fondneſs for our country itſelf. Nay, if the love of our country be judged a fair principle, ſurely a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, who is "a citizen of no mean city," may lawfully have <hi>his</hi> attachments too. If patriotiſm be an honeſt prejudice, Chriſtianity is not a ſervile one. Nay, let us teach the youth to hug his prejudices rather than to acquire that verſatile and accommodat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing citizenſhip of the world, by which he may be an Infidel in Paris, a Papiſt at Rome, and a Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at Cairo.</p>
                     <p>Let me not be ſuppoſed ſo to elevate politics, or ſo to depreſs religion, as to make any compariſon of the value of the one with the other, when I obſerve, that between the true Britiſh patriot and the true Chriſtian, there will be this common reſemblance: the more deeply each of them inquires, the more will he be confirmed in his reſpective attachment, the one to his country, the other to his religion. I ſpeak with reverence of the immeaſurable diſtance; but the more the one preſſes on the firm arch of our conſtitution, and the other on that of Chriſtianity, the ſtronger he will find them both. Each chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:037996_0176_100FAACF603F2080"/>
ſcrutiny; each has nothing to dread but from ſhallow politicians, and ſhallow philoſophers; in each intimate knowledge juſtifies prepoſſeſſion; in each inveſtigation confirms attachment.</p>
                     <p>If we divide the human being into three compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent parts, the bodily, the intellectual, and the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, is it not reaſonable that a portion of care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be aſſigned to each in ſome degree adequate to its importance? Should I venture to ſay a <hi>due</hi> portion, a portion adapted to the real comparative value of each, would not that condemn in one word the whole ſyſtem of modern education? Yet the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and intellectual part being avowedly more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable than the bodily, while the ſpiritual and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part exceeds even the intellectual ſtill more than that ſurpaſſes what is corporeal; is it then acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common rules of proportion; is it acting on the principles of diſtributive juſtice; is it acting with that good ſenſe and right judgment with which the ordinary buſineſs of this world is uſually tranſacted, to give the larger proportion of time and care to that which is worth the leaſt? Is it fair that what relates to the body and the organs of the body, I mean thoſe accompliſhments which addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the eye and the ear, ſhould occupy almoſt the whole thoughts; that the intellectual part ſhould be robbed of its due proportion, and that the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual part ſhould have almoſt no proportion at all?

Is not this preparing your children for an awful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in the tremendous day when they ſhall be ſtripped of that body, of thoſe ſenſes and organs, which have been made almoſt the ſole objects of their attention, and ſhall feel themſelves left in poſſeſſion of nothing but that ſpiritual part which in education was ſcarcely taken into the account of their exiſtence?</p>
                     <p>Surely it ſhould be thought a reaſonable compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (and I am in fact undervaluing the object for the importance of which I plead) to ſuggeſt, that at leaſt two-thirds of that time which is now uſurped by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, ſhould be reſtored to the rightful owners, the underſtanding and the heart; and that the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of religious knowledge in early youth, ſhould at leaſt be <hi>no leſs</hi> an object of ſedulous attention than the cultivation of human learning or of outward embelliſhments. It is alſo reaſonable to ſuggeſt, that we ſhould in Chriſtianity, as in arts, ſciences, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, begin with the beginning, ſet out with the ſimple elements and thus "go on unto perfection."</p>
                     <p>Why in teaching to draw do you begin with ſtraight lines and curves, till by gentle ſteps the knowledge of outline and proportion be attained, and your picture be completed; never loſing ſight, however, of the elementary lines and curves? why in muſic do you ſet out with the ſimple notes, and purſue the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition through all its progreſs, ſtill in every ſtage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the notes? why in the ſcience of numbers
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:037996_0178_100FAAD5B93E3C60"/>
do you invent the ſimpleſt methods of conveying juſt ideas of computation, ſtill referring to the tables which involve the fundamental rules? why in the ſcience of quantity do men introduce the pupil at firſt to the plaineſt diagrams, and clear up one difficulty before they allow another to appear? why in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languages to the youth do you ſedulouſly infuſe into his mind the rudiments of ſyntax? why in parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is he led to refer every word to its part of ſpeech, to reſolve every ſentence into its elements, to reduce every term to its original, and from the firſt caſe of nouns, and the firſt tenſe of verbs, to explain their formations, changes, and dependencies, till the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of language become ſo grounded, that, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually recurring to the rules, the ſpeaking and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing correctly are fixed into a habit? why all this, but becauſe you uniformly wiſh him to be grounded in each of his acquirements? why, but becauſe you are perſuaded that a ſlight, and ſlovenly, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and irregular way of inſtruction will never train him to excellence in any thing?</p>
                     <p>Do young perſons then become muſicians, and painters, and linguiſts, and mathematicians, by early ſtudy and regular labour; and ſhall they become Chriſtians by accident? or rather, is not this acting on that very principle of Dogberry, at which you probably have often laughed? Is it not ſuppoſing that religion, like "reading and writing, comes by
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:037996_0179_100FAAD761349858"/>
Nature?" Shall all thoſe accompliſhments "which periſh in the uſing" be ſo aſſiduouſly, ſo ſyſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally taught? Shall all theſe habits be ſo carefully formed, ſo perſiſted in, as to be interwoven with our very make, ſo as to become as it were a part of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhall that knowledge which is to make us "wiſe unto ſalvation" be picked up at random, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily, or perhaps not picked up at all? Shall that difficult divine ſcience which requires "line upon line, and precept upon precept," here a little and there a little; which parents, even under a darker diſpenſation, were required <q>to teach their children <hi>diligently,</hi> and to talk of it when they ſat down in their houſe, and when they walked by the way, and when they lay down, and when they roſe up;</q> ſhall this knowledge be by Chriſtian parents deferred, or taught ſlightly; or be ſuperſeded by things of little comparative worth?</p>
                     <p>Shall the lively period of youth, the ſoft and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible ſeaſon when laſting habits are formed, when the ſeal cuts deep into the yielding wax, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is more likely to be clear and ſtrong; ſhall this warm and favourable ſeaſon be ſuffered to ſlide by, without being turned to the great purpoſe for which not only youth, but life, and breath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were beſtowed? Shall not that "faith without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;" ſhall not that "holineſs without which no man can ſee the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:037996_0180_100FAADB7894AE20"/>
Lord;" ſhall not that knowledge which is the foundation of faith and practice; ſhall not that charity without which all knowledge is ſounding braſs and a tinkling cymbal, be impreſſed, be incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, be enforced, as early, as conſtantly, as funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, with the ſame earneſt puſhing on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual progreſs, with the ſame conſtant reference to firſt principles, as are uſed in the caſe of thoſe arts which merely adorn human life? Shall we not ſeize the happy period when the memory is ſtrong, the mind and all its powers vigorous and active, the imagination buſy and all alive, the heart flexible, the temper ductile, the conſcience tender, curioſity awake, fear powerful, hope eager, love ardent; for incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating that knowledge, and impreſſing thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are to form the character, and fix the deſtination for eternity?</p>
                     <p>Or, if I may be allowed to addreſs another and a ſtill more dilatory claſs, who are for procraſtinating all concern about religion till we are driven to it by actual diſtreſs, like the ſailor who ſaid, "he thought it was always time enough to begin to pray when the ſtorm began." Of theſe I would aſk, ſhall we, with an unaccountable deliberation, defer our anxiety about religion till the man and woman are become ſo immerſed in the cares of life, or ſo entangled in its pleaſures, that they will have little heart or ſpirit to embrace a new principle? a principle whoſe preciſe
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:037996_0181_100FAADE463508F8"/>
object it will be to condemn that very life into which they have already embarked; nay to condemn almoſt all that they have been doing and thinking ever ſince they began to act or think? Shall we, I ſay, begin now? or ſhall we ſuffer thoſe inſtructions, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive which requires all the concentrated powers of a ſtrong and healthy mind, to be put off till the day of excruciating pain, till the period of debility and ſtupefaction? Shall we wait for that ſeaſon, as if it were the moſt favourable for religious acquiſitions, when the ſenſes ſhall have been palled by exceſſive gratification, when the eye ſhall be tired with ſeeing, and the ear with hearing? Shall we, when the whole man is breaking up by diſeaſe or decay, expect that the dim apprehenſion will diſcern a new ſcience, or the obtuſe feelings delight themſelves with a new pleaſure? a pleaſure too, not only incompatible with many of the hitherto indulged pleaſures, but one which carries with it a ſtrong intimation that thoſe pleaſures terminate in the death of the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>But, not to loſe ſight of the important analogy on which we have already dwelt ſo much; how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous would it ſeem to you to hear any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to an illiterate dying man, to ſet about learning even the plaineſt and eaſieſt rudiments of any new art; to ſtudy the muſical notes; to conjugate an aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliary verb; to learn, not the firſt problem in Euclid, but even the numeration table; and yet you do not
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:037996_0182_100FAADFCDA2D070"/>
think it abſurd to poſtpone religious inſtruction, on principles which, if admitted at all, muſt terminate either in ignorance, or in your propoſing too late to a dying man to begin to learn the totally unknown ſcheme of Chriſtianity. You do not think it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ſhould be brought to liſten to the <q>voice of this charmer,</q> when he can no longer liſten to "the voice of ſinging men and ſinging women." You do not think it unreaſonable that immortal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhould delay to devote their days to Heaven, till they have "no pleaſure in them" themſelves. You will not bring them to offer up the firſt fruits of their lips, and hearts, and lives, to their Maker, becauſe you perſuade yourſelves that he who has called himſelf a "jealous God," may however be contented hereafter with the wretched ſacrifice of decayed appetites, and the worthleſs leavings of almoſt extinguiſhed affections.</p>
                     <p>For one cannot believe that there is ſcarcely any one, except he be a decided infidel, who does not conſider religion as at leaſt a good reverſionary thing; as an object which ought always to occupy a little remote corner of his map of life; the ſtudy of which, though it is always to be poſtponed, is however not to be finally rejected; which, though it cannot conveniently come into his preſent ſcheme of life, it is intended ſomehow or other to take up before death. This awful deception ariſes, partly
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:037996_0183_100FAAE275CCA0F8"/>
from the bulk which the objects of time and ſenſe acquire in our eyes by their nearneſs; while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible realities of eternity are but faintly diſcerned by a feeble faith, through a dim and diſtant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um; and partly from a totally falſe idea of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtianity, from a fatal fancy that we can repent at any future period, and that as amendment will always be in our own power, it will be time enough to think of reforming our life, when we ſhould only think of cloſing it.</p>
                     <p>But depend upon it, that a heart long hardened, I do not mean by groſs vices merely, but by a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the world, by an habitual and exceſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in the pleaſures of ſenſe, is by no means in a favourable ſtate to admit the light of divine truth, or to receive the impreſſions of divine grace. God indeed ſometimes ſhows us by an act of his ſovereignty, that this wonderful change, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a ſinner's heart, may be produced without the intervention of human means, to ſhow that the work is HIS. But as this is not way in which the Almighty uſually deals with his creatures, it would be nearly as prepoſterous for men to act on this preſumption, as it would be to take no means for the preſervation of our lives, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt raiſed Lazarus from the dead.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I WOULD now with great deference addreſs thoſe reſpectable characters who are really concerned about the beſt intereſts of their children; thoſe to whom Chriſtianity is indeed an important conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but whoſe habits of life have hindered them from giving it its due degree in the ſcale of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Begin then with conſidering that religion is a part, and the moſt prominent part, in your ſyſtem of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Do not communicate its principles in a random deſultory way; nor ſcantily ſtint this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to only ſuch ſcraps and remnants of time as may be caſually picked up from the gleanings of other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements. <q>Will you bring to God for a ſacrifice that which coſts you nothing?</q> Let the beſt part of the day, which with moſt people is the earlieſt part, be ſteadily and invariably dedicated to this work by your children, before they are tired with their other ſtudies, while the intellect is clear, the ſpirits light, and the attention unfatigued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="186" facs="unknown:037996_0185_100FAAE8E2308488"/>
Confine not your inſtructions to mere verbal ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and dry ſyſtems; but inſtruct them in a way which ſhall intereſt their feelings; by lively images, and by a warm practical application of what they read to their own hearts and circumſtances. There ſeems to be no good reaſon that while every other thing is to be made amuſing, religion alone muſt be dry and uninviting. Do not fancy that a thing is good merely becauſe it is dull. Why ſhould not the moſt entertaining powers of the mind be ſupremely conſecrated to that ſubject which is moſt worthy of their full exerciſe? The misfortune is, that religious learning is too often rather conſidered as an act of the memory than of the heart and feelings; and that children are turned over to the dry work of getting by rote as a taſk that which they ſhould get from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and animated converſation. Teach them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as their Bleſſed Saviour taught, by intereſting parables, which while they corrected the heart, left ſome exerciſe for the ingenuity in their ſolution, and for the feelings in their application. Teach, as HE taught, by ſeizing on ſurrounding objects, paſſing events, local circumſtances, peculiar characters, apt alluſions, juſt analogy, appropriate illuſtration. Call in all creation, animate and inanimate, to your <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Do, according to your meaſure of ability, what the Holy Spirit which indited the Scriptures has done, always take the ſenſibility of the learner into your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the faculties which are to be worked upon. "For the doctrines of the Bible," as the profound and enlightened Bacon obſerves, <q>are not propoſed to us in a naked logical form, but arrayed in the moſt beautiful and ſtriking colours which creation affords.</q> By thoſe illuſtrations uſed by Him "who knew what was in man," and therefore beſt knew how to addreſs him, it was, that the unletter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed audiences of Chriſt and his Apoſtles were enabled both to comprehend and to reliſh doctrines, which would not readily have made their way to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, had they not firſt touched their hearts; and which would have found acceſs to neither the one nor the other, had they been delivered in dry, ſcholaſtic diſquiſitions. Now thoſe audiences not being learned, may be ſuppoſed to have been nearly in the ſtate of children, as to their receptive faculties, and to have required nearly the ſame ſort of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, they were more capable of being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what was ſimple, and touching, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than what was elaborate, abſtruſe, and unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Heaven and earth were made to furniſh their contributions, when man was to be taught that ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which was to make him wiſe unto ſalvation. If that be the pureſt eloquence which moſt perſuades,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:037996_0187_100FAAED35B02400"/>
then no eloquence is ſo powerful as that of Scripture: and an intelligent Chriſtian teacher will be admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mode of Scripture itſelf, how to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate its truths with <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

He will moreover, like his great Maſter, always carefully keep up a quick ſenſe of the perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt the pupil has in every religious inſtruction which is impreſſed upon him. He will teach as Paul prayed, <q>with the ſpirit, and with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo;</q> and in imitating this great model he will neceſſarily avoid the oppoſite faults of two different ſorts of inſtructors; for while ſome of our divines of the higher claſs have been too apt to preach as if mankind had only intellect, and the lower and more popular ſort as if they had only paſſions, do you borrow what is good from both, and addreſs your pupils as beings compounded of both underſtanding and affections.<note n="*" place="bottom">The zeal and diligence with which the Biſhop of London's weekly lectures have been attended by perſons of all ranks and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, but more eſpecially by that claſs to whom this little work is addreſſed, is a very promiſing circumſtance for the age.

Fancy not that the Bible is too difficult and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to be preſented in its own naked form, and that it puzzles and bewilders the youthful underſtanding. In all needful and indiſpenſable points of knowledge the darkneſs of Scripture, as a great Chriſtian philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Boyle.</note> has obſerved, <q>is but a partial darkneſs, like that of Egypt, which benighted only the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, while it left his children in clear day.</q> And if it be really the appropriate character of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it tells us itſelf that it is, <q>to enlighten the eyes of the blind,</q> and "to make wiſe the ſimple," then it is as well calculated for the youthful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed as for any other claſs; and as it was never expected that the greater part of Chriſtians ſhould be learned, ſo is learning, though of ineſtimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue in a teacher of theology, no <hi>eſſential</hi> qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a common Chriſtian; for which reaſon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truths are expreſſed with that clear and ſimple evidence adapted to the kind of aſſent which they require. He who could bring an unprejudiced heart and an unperverted will would bring to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the beſt qualification for underſtanding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them. And though they contain things which the pupil cannot comprehend, (as what anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poet, hiſtorian, or orator does not,) the teacher may addreſs to him the words which Chriſt addreſſed to Peter, <q>What I do, thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</q>

Young people who have been taught religion in a dry and ſuperficial way, who have had all its drudgeries and none of its pleaſures, will probably have acquired ſo little reliſh for it, as to conſider the continued proſecution of their religious ſtudies as a badge of their tutelage, as a mark that they are ſtill under ſubjection; and will look forward with impatience to the hour of their emancipation from the lectures on Chriſtianity. They will long for the period when its leſſons ſhall ceaſe to be delivered; will conclude that, having once attained ſuch an age, and arrived at the required proficiency, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will be accompliſhed and the labour at an end. But let not <hi>your</hi> children "ſo learn Chriſt." Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them that no ſpecific day will ever arrive on which they ſhall ſay, I <hi>have</hi> attained; but inform them, that every acquiſition muſt be followed up; knowledge muſt be increaſed; prejudices ſubdued; good habits rooted; evil ones eradicated; diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtrengthened; principles confirmed; till, going on from ſtrength to ſtrength, they come <q>to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though ſerious inſtruction will not only be unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting but irkſome if conveyed to youth in a mere didactic way, yet if their affections are ſuitably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, their hearts, ſo far from neceſſarily revolting, as ſome inſiſt they will, often receive the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:037996_0190_100FAAF287B25258"/>
truths with alacrity. It is the manner which revolts them, and not the thing.</p>
                     <p>As it is notorious that men of wit and imagination have been the moſt formidable enemies to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; while men, in whom thoſe talents have been conſecrated to God, have been ſome of her moſt uſeful champions, take particular care to preſs that ardent and ever-active power, the <hi>imagination,</hi> into the ſervice of religion; this bright and buſy faculty will be leading its poſſeſſor into perpetual peril, and is an enemy of peculiar potency till it come to be employed in the cauſe of God. It is a lion, which though worldly prudence indeed may <hi>chain</hi> ſo as to prevent outward miſchief, yet the malignity remains within; but when ſanctified by Chriſtianity, the imagination is a lion <hi>tamed;</hi> you have all the benefit of its ſtrength and its activity, diveſted of its miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. God never beſtowed that noble but reſtleſs faculty, without intending it to be an inſtrument of his own glory; though it has been too often ſet up in rebellion againſt him; becauſe, in its youthful ſtirrings, while all alive to evil, it has not been ſeized upon to fight for its rightful Sovereign, but was early enliſted with little oppoſition under the banners of the world, the fleſh, and the devil. Religion is the only ſubject in which, under the guidance of an holy and ſober-minded prudence, this diſcurſive faculty can ſafely ſtretch its powers and expand its
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:037996_0191_100FAAF6904E8B98"/>
energies. But let it be remembered, that it muſt be a ſound and genuine Chriſtianity which can alone ſo chaſtiſe and regulate the imagination, as to reſtrain it from thoſe errors and exceſſes into which a falſe, a miſtaken, an irregular religion, has too often plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its injudicious and ill-inſtructed profeſſor. To ſecure the imagination therefore on the ſafe ſide, and, if I may change the metaphor, to put it under the direction of its true pilot in the ſtormy voyage of life, is like engaging thoſe potent elements, the wind and tide, in your favour.</p>
                     <p>In your communications with young people, take care to convince them that as religion is not a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be laid aſide with the leſſon, ſo neither is it a ſingle branch of duty; ſome detached thing, which like an art or a language is to be practiſed ſeparately, and to have its diſtinct periods and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But let them underſtand, that common acts, by the ſpirit in which they are to be performed, are to be made acts of religion: that Chriſtianity may be conſidered as having ſomething of that influence over the conduct which external grace has over the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for as it is not the performance of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act which denominates any one to be graceful, grace being a ſpirit diffuſed through the whole ſyſtem which animates every ſentiment, and informs every action; as ſhe who has true perſonal grace has it uniformly, and is not ſometimes awkward and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:037996_0192_100FAAF92927EF38"/>
elegant; does not ſometimes lay it down and ſometimes take it up; ſo religion is not an occaſional act, but an indwelling principle, an in wrought habit, a pervading and informing ſpirit, from which indeed every act derives all its life, and energy, and beauty.</p>
                     <p>Give them clear views of the broad diſcrimination between practical religion and worldly morality. Show them that no good qualities are genuine but ſuch as flow from the religion of Chriſt. Let them learn that the virtues which the better ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who yet are deſtitute of true Chriſtianity, incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and practiſe, reſemble thoſe virtues which have the love of God for their motive, juſt as counterfeit coin reſembles ſterling gold; they may have, it is true, certain points of reſemblance with the others; they may be bright and ſhining; they have perhaps the image and the ſuperſcription, but they ever want the true diſtinguiſhing properties; they want ſterling value, purity, and weight. They may indeed paſs current in the traffic of this world, but when brought to the touchſtone, they will be found full of alloy; when weighed in the balance of the ſanctuary, "they will be found wanting;" they will not ſtand that final trial which is to ſeparate <q>the precious from the vile;</q> they will not <q>abide the day of <hi>his</hi> coming who is like a refiner's fire.</q>

                     <p>One error into which even ſome good people are apt to fall, is that of endeavouring to deceive young minds by temporiſing expedients. In order to allure
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:037996_0193_100FAAFB00018E70"/>
them to become religious, they exhibit falſe, or faint, or inadequate views of Chriſtianity; and while they repreſent it as it really is, as a life of ſuperior hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and advantage, they conceal its difficulties, and like the Jeſuitical Chineſe miſſionaries, extenuate, or ſink, or deny, ſuch parts of it as are leaſt allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human pride. But beſides that, the project fails with them as it did with the Jeſuits; all fraud is bad; and a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> fraud is a contradiction in terms which ought to be buried in the rubbiſh of papal deſolation.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of repreſenting to the young Chriſtian that it may be poſſible by a prudent ingenuity at once to purſue, with equal ardour and ſucceſs, worldly fame and eternal glory, would it not be more honeſt to tell him fairly and unambiguouſly that there are two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct roads between which there is a broad boundary line? that there are two irreconcileable intereſts; that he muſt forſake the one if he would cleave to the other? that there are two ſorts of characters at eternal variance? that nothing ſhort of abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion can make a confirmed Chriſtian? Point out the different ſort of promiſes annexed to theſe different ſorts of characters. Confeſs in the language of Chriſt how the man of the world often obtains (and it is the natural courſe of human things) the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence he ſedulouſly ſeeks. <q>Verily I ſay unto you they have their reward.</q> Explain the beatitudes on the other hand, and unfold what kind of ſpecific
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:037996_0194_100FAAFEA6BB40B0"/>
reward is there individually promiſed to its concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant virtue. Show your pupil that to that <q>poverty of ſpirit</q> to which the kingdom of heaven is promiſed, it would be inconſiſtent to expect that the recompence of human commendation ſhould be alſo attached; that to that "purity of heart" to which the beatific viſion is annexed, it would be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe you can unite the praiſe of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wits, or the admiration of a catch club. Theſe will be beſtowed on their appropriate and correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merits. Do not enliſt them under falſe colours. Different ſorts of rewards are attached to different ſorts of ſervices; and while you truly aſſert that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions ways are <q>ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</q> take care that you do not lead them to depend too excluſively on worldly happineſs and earthly peace, for theſe make no part of the covenant; they may be ſuperadded, but they were never ſtipulated in the contract.</p>
                     <p>But if, in order to attract the young to a religious courſe, you diſingenuouſly conceal its difficulties, while you are enlarging upon its pleaſures, you will tempt them to diſtruſt the truth of Scripture itſelf. For what will they think, not only of a few detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed texts, but of the general caſt and colour of the Goſpel when contraſted with your repreſentation of it? What notion will they conceive of <q>the ſtrait gate</q> and "narrow way?" of the amputation of a "right hand?" of the exciſion of a "right eye?"
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:037996_0195_100FAB014B209A30"/>
of the other ſtrong metaphors by which the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian warfare is ſhadowed out? of <q>crucifying the fleſh?</q> of "mortifying the old man?" of <q>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto ſin?</q> of "overcoming the world?" Do you not think their meek and compaſſionate Saviour who died for your children loved them as well as you love them? And if this were his language, ought it not to be yours? It is the language of true love; of that love with which a merciful God loved the world, when he ſpared not his own Son. Do not then try to conceal from them, that the life of a Chriſtian is neceſſarily oppoſite to the life of the world; and do not ſeek, by a vain attempt at ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, to reconcile that difference which Chriſt himſelf has pronounced to be irreconcileable.</p>
                     <p>May it not be partly owing to the want of a due introduction to the knowledge of the real nature and ſpirit of religion, that ſo many young Chriſtians, who ſet out in a fair and flouriſhing way, decline and wither when they come to perceive the requiſitions of experimental Chriſtianity? requiſitions which they had not ſuſpected of making any part of the plan.</p>
                     <p>People are no more to be cheated into religion than into learning. The ſame ſpirit which influences your oath in a court of juſtice ſhould influence your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in that court of equity—your family. Your children ſhould be told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. It is unneceſſary to add, that it muſt be done gradually and diſcreetly. We
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:037996_0196_100FAB02D31E1AA0"/>
know whoſe example we have for poſtponing that which the mind is not yet prepared to receive: <q>I have many things yet to ſay to you, but ye cannot bear them now.</q> Accuſtom them to reaſon by analogy. Explain to them that great <hi>worldly</hi> attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are never made without great ſacrifices; that the merchant cannot become rich without induſtry; the ſtateſman eminent without labour; the ſcholar learned without ſtudy; the hero renowned without danger: would it not then, on human principles, be unreaſonable to think that the Chriſtian alone ſhould obtain a triumph without a warfare? the higheſt prize with the loweſt exertions? an eternal crown without a preſent croſs? and that heaven is the only reward which the idle may reckon upon? No: though ſalvation "be the <hi>gift</hi> of God," yet it muſt be <hi>"worked out."</hi> Convince your young friends, however, that in this caſe the difficulty bears no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the prize; though in one reſpect the point of reſemblance fails, and that moſt advantageouſly for the Chriſtian; for while, even by the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable means, which are the union of talents with diligence, no human proſperity can be inſured to the worldly candidate; while the moſt ſucceſsful adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer may fail by the fault of another; while the beſt concerted project of the ſtateſman may be cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the braveſt hero loſe the battle; the brighteſt genius fail of getting bread; and while, moreover, the pleaſure ariſing from ſucceſs in theſe may be no
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:037996_0197_100FAB056B793620"/>
ſooner taſted than it is poiſoned by a more proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous rival; the perſevering Chriſtian is ſafe and certain of attaining <hi>his</hi> object; no misfortunes can defeat <hi>his</hi> hope; no competition can endanger <hi>his</hi> ſucceſs; for though another gain, he will not loſe. Nay, the ſucceſs of another, ſo far from diminiſhing his gain, is an addition to it; the more he diffuſes, the richer he grows; and that mortal hour which cuts off for ever the hopes of worldly men, crowns and conſummates his.</p>
                     <p>Beware at the ſame time of ſetting up any act of ſelf-denial or mortification as the <hi>procuring</hi> cauſe of ſalvation. This would be a preſumptuous project to <hi>purchaſe</hi> that eternal life which is declared to be the "free <hi>gift</hi> of God." This would be to ſend your children, not to the Goſpel to learn their Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but to the Monks and Aſcetics of the middle ages; it would be ſending them to Peter the Hermit, and the holy fathers of the Deſert, and not to Peter the Apoſtle and his Divine Maſter. Mortification is not the price; it is nothing more than the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a ſoul of which ſin is the diſeaſe, the diet preſcribed by the great phyſician. Without this guard the young devout Chriſtian would be led to fancy that abſtinence, pilgrimage, and penance might be adopted as the cheap ſubſtitute for the ſubdued deſire, the conquered temptation, and the obedient will; and would be almoſt in as much danger, on the one hand, of ſelf-righteouſneſs ariſing from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:037996_0198_100FAB091F430D40"/>
and mortification, as ſhe would be, on the other, from ſelf-gratification in the indulgences of the world. And while you carefully impreſs on her the neceſſity of living a life of ſtrict obedience if ſhe would pleaſe God, do not neglect to remind her alſo that a complete renunciation of her own perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances as a ground of merit, <hi>purchaſing</hi> the favour of God by their own intrinſic worth, is included in that obedience.</p>
                     <p>It is of the laſt importance, in ſtamping on young minds a true impreſſion of the genius of Chriſtianity, to poſſeſs them with a conviction that it is the purity of the motive which not only gives worth and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but which, in a Chriſtian ſenſe, gives life and ſoul to the beſt action: nay, that while a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention will be acknowledged and accepted at the final judgment, even without the act, the act itſelf will be diſowned which wanted the baſis of a pure deſign. <q>Thou didſt well that it was in thy <hi>heart</hi> to build me a temple,</q> ſaid the Almighty to that Monarch whom yet he permitted not to build it. How many ſplendid actions will be rejected in the great day of retribution, to which ſtatues and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been raiſed on earth, while their almoſt deified authors ſhall be as much confounded at their own unexpected reprobation, as at the acceptance of thoſe "whoſe life the world counted madneſs." "Depart from me, I never knew you," is not the malediction denounced on the ſceptic or the ſcoffer,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:037996_0199_100FAB0AA5F043D8"/>
but on the unfruitful worker of "miracles," on the unſanctified utterer of "prophecies;" for even acts of piety wanting the purifying principle, however they may dazzle men, offend God. Cain ſacrificed, Balaam propheſied, Rouſſeau wrote the moſt ſublime panegyric on the <hi>Son of Mary,</hi> VOLTAIRE BUILT A CHURCH! nay, ſo ſuperior was <hi>his</hi> affectation of ſanctity, that he oſtentatiouſly declared, that while others were raiſing churches to <hi>Saints,</hi> there was one man at leaſt who would erect his church to <hi>God:</hi> that God whoſe altars he was overthrowing, whoſe name he was vilifying, whoſe goſdel he was extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating, and the very name of whoſe Son he had ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pledged himſelf to blot from the face of the earth!</p>
                     <p>Though it be impoſſible here to enumerate all thoſe Chriſtian virtues which ſhould be impreſſed in the progreſs of a Chriſtian education, yet in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection I cannot forbear mentioning one which more immediately grows out of the ſubject; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that the principle which ſhould be the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable concomitant of all inſtruction, and eſpecially of religious inſtruction, is humility. As this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is inculcated in every page of the Goſpel; as it is deducible from every precept and every action of Chriſt; that is a ſufficient intimation that it ſhould be made to grow out of every ſtudy, that it ſhould be grafted on every acquiſition. It is the turning point, the leading principle indicative of the very genius of Chriſtianity. This chaſtiſing quality
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:037996_0200_100FAB0D70E8EF60"/>
ſhould therefore be conſtantly made in education to operate as the only counteraction of that <q>knowledge which puffeth up.</q> Youth ſhould be taught that as humility is the diſcriminating characteriſtic of our religion, therefore a proud Chriſtian, a haughty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of a crucified Maſter, furniſhes perhaps a ſtronger oppoſition in terms than the whole compaſs of language can exhibit. They ſhould be taught that humility being the appropriate grace of Chriſtianity, is what makes Chriſtian and Pagan virtues <hi>eſſentially</hi> different. The virtues of the Romans, for inſtance, were obviouſly founded in pride; as a proof of this, they had not even a word in their copious language to expreſs humility, but what was uſed in a bad ſenſe, and conveyed the idea of meanneſs or vileneſs. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity ſo ſtands on its own ſingle ground, is ſo far from aſſimilating itſelf to the ſpirit of other religions, that, unlike the Roman Emperor, who though he would not become a Chriſtian, yet ordered that the image of Chriſt ſhould be ſet up in the Pantheon with thoſe of the heathen gods, and be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in common with them; Chriſtianity not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects all ſuch partnerſhips with other religions, but it pulls down their images, defaces their temples, tramples on their honours, founds its own exiſtence on the ruins of ſpurious religions and ſpurious virtues, and will be every thing when it is admitted to be any thing.</p>
                     <p>Will it be going too much out of the way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that Chriſtian Britain retaliates upon Pagan
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:037996_0201_100FAB102129CEA0"/>
Rome? For if the former uſed humility in a bad ſenſe, has not the latter learnt to uſe pride in a good one? May we, without impertinence, venture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that, in the deliberations of as honourable and upright political aſſemblies as ever adorned, or, under Providence, upheld a country; in orations which leave us nothing to envy in Attic or Roman eloquence in their beſt days; it were to be wiſhed that we did not borrow from Rome an epithet which ſuited the genius of her religion, as much as it mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates againſt that of ours? The panegyriſt of the battle of Marathon, of Plataea, or of Zama, might with propriety ſpeak of a "proud day," or a <q>proud event,</q> or a "proud ſucceſs." But ſurely the Chriſtian encomiaſts of the battle of the Nile may, from their abundance, ſelect an epithet better appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to ſuch a victory—a victory which, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Europe, has perhaps preſerved that religion which ſets its foot on the very neck of pride, and in which the conqueror himſelf, even in the firſt ardors of triumph, forgot not to aſcribe the victory to AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY GOD. Let us leave to the enemy both the term and the thing; arrogant words being the only weapons in which we muſt ever vail to their decided ſuperiority.</p>
                     <p>Above all things then you ſhould beware that your pupils do not take up with a vague, general, and undefined religion; but look to it that their Chriſtianity be really the religion of Chriſt. Inſtead
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:037996_0202_100FAB13D6F4D8A8"/>
of ſlurring over the doctrines of the Croſs, as diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable appendages to our religion, which are to be got over as well as we can, but which are never to be dwelt upon, take care to make theſe your funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental articles. Do not explain away theſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and by ſome elegant periphraſis <hi>hint</hi> at a Saviour, inſtead of making him the foundation ſtone of your ſyſtem. Do not convey primary, and plain, and awful, and indiſpenſable truths elliptically, I mean as ſomething that is to be underſtood without being expreſſed; nor ſtudy faſhionable circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to avoid names and things on which our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hangs, in order to prevent your diſcourſe from being offenſive. Perſons who are thus inſtructed in religion with more good breeding than ſeriouſneſs and ſimplicity, imbibe a diſtaſte for plain ſcriptural language; and the Scriptures themſelves are ſo little in uſe with a certain faſhionable claſs of readers, that when the doctrines and language of the Bible occaſionally occur in other authors, they preſent a ſort of novelty and peculiarity which offend; and ſuch readers as diſuſe the Bible are apt to call that preciſe and puritanical which is in fact ſound and ſcriptural. Nay, it has ſeveral times happened to the author to hear perſons of ſenſe and learning ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule inſulated ſentiments and expreſſions that have fallen in their way, which they would have treated with decent reſpect had they known them to be, as they really were, texts of Scripture. This obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:037996_0203_100FAB155E1A5068"/>
is hazarded with a view to enforce the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of early communicating religious knowledge, and of infuſing an early taſte for Scripture phraſeology.</p>
                     <p>The perſons in queſtion are apt to acquire a kind of Pagan Chriſtianity, which juſt enables them to hear with complacency of the "Deity," of a <q>firſt cauſe,</q> and of "conſcience." Nay, ſome may even go ſo far as to talk of <q>the Founder of our religion,</q> of the "Author of Chriſtianity," in general terms, as they would talk of the prophet of Arabia, or the law-giver of China, of Athens, or of the Jews. But their refined ears revolt not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at the unadorned name of Chriſt; and even the naked and unqualified term of our Saviour, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, carries with it a queeriſh, inelegant, not to ſay a ſuſpicious ſound. They will expreſs a ſerious diſapprobation of what is wrong under the moral term of <hi>vice,</hi> or the forenſic term of <hi>crime;</hi> but they are apt to think that the Scripture term of <hi>ſin</hi> has ſomething fanatical in it: and, while they diſcover a great reſpect for morality, they do not much reliſh holineſs, which is indeed the ſpecific morality of a Chriſtian. They will ſpeak readily of a man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, or leaving off a vicious habit, or growing more correct in ſome individual practice; but the expreſſion of a total change of heart, they would ſtigmatize as the very ſhibboleth of a ſect, though it is the language of a Liturgy they affect to admire, and of a Goſpel which they profeſs to receive.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THOSE who are aware of the ineſtimable value of prayer themſelves, will naturally be anxious not only that this duty ſhould be earneſtly inculcated on their children, but that they ſhould be taught it in the beſt manner; and <hi>ſuch</hi> parents need little perſuaſion or counſel on the ſubject. Yet children of decent and orderly (I will not ſay of ſtrictly religious) fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are often ſo ſuperficially inſtructed in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs, that it is not unuſual, when they are aſked what prayers they uſe, to anſwer, <q>the Lord's Prayer and the <hi>Creed.</hi>
                        </q> And even ſome who are better taught, are not always made to underſtand with ſufficient clearneſs the ſpecific diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two; that the one is the confeſſion of their <hi>faith,</hi> and the other the model for their <hi>ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> By this confuſed and indiſtinct beginning, they ſet out with a perplexity in their ideas, which is not always completely diſentangled in more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="206" facs="unknown:037996_0205_100F7C674B9AB7E8"/>
An intelligent mother will ſeize the firſt occaſion which the child's opening underſtanding ſhall allow, for making a little courſe of lectures on the Lord's Prayer, taking every diviſion or ſhort ſentence ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately; for each furniſhes valuable materials for a diſtinct lecture. The child ſhould be led gradually through every part of this divine compoſition; ſhe ſhould be taught to break it into all the regular divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, into which indeed it ſo naturally reſolves itſelf. She ſhould be made to comprehend one by one each of its ſhort but weighty ſentences; to amplify and ſpread them out for the purpoſe of better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, not in their moſt extenſive and critical, but in their moſt ſimple and obvious meaning. For in thoſe condenſed and ſubſtantial expreſſions, every word is an ingot, and will bear beating out; ſo that the teacher's difficulty will not ſo much be what ſhe ſhall ſay as what ſhe ſhall ſuppreſs; ſo abundant is the expoſitory matter which this ſuccinct pattern ſuggeſts.</p>
                     <p>When the child has a pretty good conception of the meaning of each diviſion, ſhe ſhould then be made to obſerve the connection, relation, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ſeveral parts of this prayer one upon another; for there is great method and connection in it. We pray that the <q>kingdom of God may come,</q> as the beſt means to "hallow his name;" and that by us, the obedient ſubjects of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, "his will may be done." A judicious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:037996_0206_100FAB1EA42A2DC0"/>
will obſerve how logically and conſequently one clauſe grows out of another, though ſhe will uſe neither the word logical nor conſequence: for all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations ſhould be made in the moſt plain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar terms, it being words, and not things, which commonly perplex children, if, as it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the teacher, though not wanting ſenſe, want perſpicuity and ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p>The young perſon, from being made a complete miſtreſs of this ſhort compoſition, (which as it is to be her guide and model through life, too much pains cannot be beſtowed on it,) will have a clearer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, not only of its individual contents, but of prayer in general, than many ever attain, though their memory has been perhaps loaded with long and unexplained forms, which they have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſwallow in the lump without ſcrutiny. Prayer ſhould not be ſo ſwallowed. It is a regular preſcription, which ſhould ſtand analyſis and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: it is not a charm, the ſucceſsful operation of which depends on your blindly taking it, without knowing what is in it, and in which the good you receive is promoted by your ignorance of its contents.</p>
                     <p>I would have it underſtood that by theſe little comments, I do not mean that the child ſhould be put to learn dry, and to her, unintelligible, expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and here I muſt remark in general, that the teacher is ſometimes apt to relieve herſelf at the
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:037996_0207_100FAB202C6737D0"/>
child's expence, by loading the <hi>memory</hi> of a little creature on occaſions in which far other faculties ſhould be put in exerciſe. The child herſelf ſhould be made to furniſh a good part of the commentary by her anſwers; in which anſwers ſhe will be much aſſiſted by the judgment the teacher uſes in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of queſtioning. And the youthful underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when its powers are properly ſet at work, will ſoon ſtrengthen by exerciſe ſo as to furniſh reaſonable if not very correct anſwers.</p>
                     <p>Written forms of prayer are not only uſeful and proper, but indiſpenſably neceſſary. But I will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the remark, that if children are thrown <hi>excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> on the beſt forms, if they are made to commit them to memory like a copy of verſes, and to repeat them in a dry, cuſtomary way, they will produce little effect on their minds. They will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what they repeat, if we do not early open to them the important <hi>ſcheme</hi> of prayer. Without ſuch an elementary introduction to this duty, they will afterwards be either ignorant or enthuſiaſts, or both. We ſhould give them <hi>knowledge</hi> before we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them to make much progreſs in <hi>piety,</hi> and as a due preparative to it: Chriſtian inſtruction in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the ſun, who, in the courſe of his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, gives light before he gives heat. And to excite a ſpirit of devotion without infuſing that knowledge out of which it is to grow, is practically
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:037996_0208_100FAB22CA87A208"/>
reviving the popiſh maxim, that Ignorance is the mother of Devotion, and virtually adopting the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh rule, of praying in an unknown tongue.</p>
                     <p>Children, let me again obſerve, will not attend to their prayers if they do not underſtand them; and they will not underſtand them, if they are not taught to analyſe, to diſſect them, to know their component parts, and to methodiſe them.</p>
                     <p>It is not enough to teach them to conſider prayer under the general idea that it is an application to God for what they want, and an acknowledgment for what they have. This, though true in the groſs, is not ſufficiently preciſe and correct. They ſhould learn to define and to arrange all the different parts of prayer. And as a preparative to prayer itſelf, they ſhould be impreſſed with as clear an idea as the nature of the ſubject admits, of <q>HIM with whom they have to do.</q> His omnipreſence is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of all his attributes, that of which we may make the firſt practical uſe. Every head of prayer is founded on ſome great ſcriptural truths, which truths the little analyſis here ſuggeſted will material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſt to fix in their minds.</p>
                     <p>On the knowledge that "God is," that he is an infinitely holy Being, and that <q>he is the rewarder of all them that diligently ſeek him,</q> will be grounded the firſt part of prayer, which is <hi>adoration.</hi> The creature devoting itſelf to the Creator, or <hi>ſelf-dedication,</hi>
                        <pb n="210" facs="unknown:037996_0209_100FAB2566817F88"/>
next preſents itſelf. And if they are firſt taught that important truth, that as needy creatures they want help, which may be done by ſome eaſy analogy, they will eaſily be led to underſtand how naturally <hi>petition</hi> forms a moſt conſiderable branch of prayer: and divine grace being among the things for which they are to petition, this naturally ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts to the mind the doctrine of the influences of the ſpirit. And when to this is added the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which will be readily worked into an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind, that as offending creatures they want pardon, the neceſſity of <hi>confeſſion</hi> will eaſily be made intelligible to them. But they ſhould be brought to underſtand that it muſt not be ſuch a general and vague confeſſion as awakens no ſenſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal humiliation, as excites no recollection of their own more peculiar and individual faults. But it muſt be a confeſſion founded on ſelf-knowledge, which is itſelf to ariſe out of the practice of ſelf-examination: for want of this ſort of diſcriminating habit, a well-meaning but ill-inſtructed girl may catch herſelf confeſſing the ſins of ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and omitting thoſe which are more eſpecially her own. On the gladneſs of heart natural to youth, it will be leſs difficult to impreſs the delightful duty of <hi>thankſgiving,</hi> which forms ſo conſiderable a branch of prayer. In this they ſhould be habituated to recapitulate not only their general, but to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:037996_0210_100FAB29279F5750"/>
their peculiar, daily, and incidental mercies, in the ſame ſpecific manner as they ſhould have been taught to detail their <hi>wants</hi> in the petitionary, and their <hi>faults</hi> in the confeſſional part. The ſame warmth of feeling which will more readily diſpoſe them to expreſs their gratitude to God in thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, will alſo lead them more gladly to expreſs their love to their parents and friends, by adopting another indiſpenſable, and to an affectionate heart, pleaſing part of prayer, which is <hi>interceſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they have been made, by a plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous mode of inſtruction, fully to underſtand the different nature of all theſe; and when they clearly comprehend that <hi>adoration, ſelf-dedication, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, petition, thankſgiving,</hi> and <hi>interceſſion,</hi> are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct heads, which muſt not be involved in each other, you may exemplify the rules by pointing out to them theſe ſucceſſive branches in any well written form. And they will eaſily diſcern, that aſcription of glory to that God to whom we owe ſo much, and on whom we ſo entirely depend, is the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into which a Chriſtian's prayer will naturally reſolve itſelf. It is hardly needful to remind the teacher that our truly Scriptural Liturgy invariably furniſhes the example of preſenting <hi>every</hi> requeſt in the name of the great Mediator. In the Liturgy too they will meet with the beſt exemplifications of
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:037996_0211_100FAB2AB0327870"/>
prayers, exhibiting ſeparate ſpecimens of each of the diſtinct heads we have been ſuggeſting.</p>
                     <p>But in order that the minds of young perſons may, without labour or difficulty, be gradually brought into ſuch a ſtate of preparation as to be benefited by ſuch a little courſe of lectures as we have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; they ſhould, from the time when they were firſt able to read, have been employing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at their leiſure hours, in laying in a ſtore of proviſion for their preſent demands. And here the memory may be employed to good purpoſe; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt faculty which is ripened, and which is indeed perfected when the others are only beginning to unfold themſelves, this is an intimation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it ſhould be the firſt ſeized on for the beſt uſes. It ſhould therefore be devoted to lay in a ſtock of the more eaſy and devotional parts of Scripture. The Pſalms alone are an inexhauſtible ſtore-houſe of rich materials.<note n="*" place="bottom">This will be ſo far from ſpoiling the cheerfulneſs, or impeding the pleaſures of childhood, that the author knows a little girl who, before ſhe was ſeven years old, had learnt the whole Pſalter through a ſecond time; and that without any diminution of uncommon gaiety of ſpirits, or any interference with the elegant acquirements ſuited to her ſtation.</note> Children whoſe minds have been early well furniſhed from theſe, will be competent at nine or ten years old to produce from them, and to ſelect with no contemptible judgment ſuitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:037996_0212_100FAB2D55B55B98"/>
of all the parts of prayer; and will be able to extract and appropriate texts under each reſpective head, ſo as to exhibit, without help, complete ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of every part of prayer. By confining them entirely to the ſenſe, and nearly to the words of Scripture, they will be preſerved from enthuſiaſm, from irregularity, and conceit. By being obliged continually to apply for themſelves, they will get a habit in all their difficulties, of <q>ſearching the Scriptures,</q> which may be uſeful to them on fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and more trying occaſions. But I would <hi>confine</hi> them to the Bible; for were they allowed with equal freedom to ranſack other books with a view to get helps to embelliſh their little compoſitions, or rather compilations, they might be tempted to paſs off for their own what they pick up from other, which might tend at once to make them both vain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful. This is a temptation to which they are too much laid open when they get commended for any pilfered paſſage with which they decorate their little themes and letters. But in the preſent inſtance there is no danger of any ſimilar deception, for there is ſuch a ſacred ſignature ſtamped on every Scripture phraſe, that the owner's name can never be defaced or torn off from the goods, either by fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>It would be well, if in thoſe Pſalms which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were firſt directed to get by heart, an eye were
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:037996_0213_100FAB3181D99E18"/>
had to this their future application; and that they were employed, but without any intimation of your ſubſequent deſign, in learning ſuch as may be beſt turned to this account. In the 139th the firſt great truth to be imprinted on the young heart, as was before obſerved, is unfolded with ſuch a mixture of majeſtic grandeur, and ſuch an intereſting variety of intimated and local circumſtances, as is likely to ſeize on the quick and lively feelings of youth. The aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful idea that that Being whom ſhe is taught to rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is not only <hi>in general</hi> 
                        <q>acquainted with all her ways,</q> but that <q>he is about her path, and about her bed,</q> beſtows ſuch a ſenſe of real and preſent exiſtence on <hi>him</hi> of whom ſhe is apt to conceive as having his diſtant habitation only in Heaven, as will help her to realize the ſenſe of his actual preſence.</p>
                     <p>The 103d Pſalm will open to the mind rich and abundant ſources of expreſſion for gratitude and thankſgiving, and it includes ſpiritual as well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral favours. It illuſtrates the mercies of God by familiar and domeſtic images, of ſuch peculiar ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and endearment, as are calculated to ſtrike upon every chord of filial fondneſs in the heart of an affectionate child. The 51ſt ſupplies an infinite variety of matter in whatever relates to confeſſion of ſin, or to ſupplication for the aids of the Spirit. The 23d abounds with captivating expreſſions of the protecting goodneſs of their heavenly Father, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:037996_0214_100FAB3423E51258"/>
by paſtoral imagery of uncommon ſweetneſs: in ſhort the greater part of theſe beautiful compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions overflow with materials for every head of prayer.</p>
                     <p>The child who, while ſhe was engaged in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Scriptures, was not aware that there was any ſpecific object to be anſwered by it, will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards feel an unexpected pleaſure ariſing from the application of her petty labours, when ſhe is called to draw out from her little treaſury of knowledge the ſtores ſhe has been collecting; and will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find that without any freſh application to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for ſhe is now obliged to exerciſe a higher facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than memory, ſhe has lying ready in her mind the materials with which ſhe is now called upon to work. Her judgment muſt be ſet about ſelecting one or two, or more texts which ſhall contain the ſubſtance of every ſpecific head of prayer before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed; and it will be a farther exerciſe to her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to concatenate the detached parts into one regular whole, occaſionally varying the arrangement as ſhe likes; that is, changing the order, ſometimes beginning with invocation, ſometimes with confeſſion; ſometimes dwelling longer on one part, ſometimes on another. As the hardſhips of a religious Sunday are often ſo pathetically pleaded, as making one of the heavy burdens of religion; and as the friends of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are ſo often called upon to mitigate its rigours,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:037996_0215_100FAB35ABE169E8"/>
might not ſuch an exerciſe as has been here ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed help to vary its occupations?</p>
                     <p>The habits of the pupil being thus early formed, her memory, attention, and intellect being bent in a right direction, and the exerciſe invariably maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may one not reaſonably hope that her <hi>affections</hi> alſo, through divine grace, may become intereſted in the work, till ſhe will be enabled <q>to pray with the ſpirit and with the underſtanding alſo?</q> She will now be qualified to uſe a well-compoſed form with ſeriouſneſs and advantage; for ſhe will now uſe it not mechanically, but rationally. That which before appeared to her a mere maſs of good words, will now appear a ſignificant compoſition, exhibiting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and order, and beauty; and ſhe will have the farther advantage of being enabled by her improved judgment to diſtinguiſh and ſelect for her own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch as are more judicious and more ſcriptural.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE chief end to be propoſed in cultivating the underſtandings of women, is to qualify them for the practical purpoſes of life. Their knowledge is not often like the learning of men, to be reproduced in ſome literary compoſition, nor ever in any learned profeſſion; but it is to come out in conduct. A lady ſtudies, not that ſhe may qualify herſelf to become <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>orator or a pleader; not that ſhe may learn to debate, but to act. She is to read the beſt books,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037996_0221_100FAB4738AB56E8"/>
not ſo much to enable her to talk of them, as to bring the improvement which they furniſh, to the rectification of her principles, and the formation of her habits. The great uſes of ſtudy are to enable her to regulate her own mind, and to be uſeful to others.</p>
                     <p>To woman therefore, whatever be her rank, I would recommend a predominance of thoſe more ſober ſtudies, which, not having diſplay for their object, may make her wiſe without vanity, happy without witneſſes, and content without panegyriſts; the exerciſe of which will not bring celebrity, but improve uſefulneſs. She ſhould purſue every kind of ſtudy which will teach her to elicit truth; which will lead her to be intent upon realities; will give preciſion to her ideas; will make an exact mind; every ſtudy which, inſtead of ſtimulating her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, will chaſtiſe it; which will give her definite notions; will bring the imagination under dominion; will lead her to think, to compare, to combine, to methodiſe; which will confer ſuch a power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination that her judgment ſhall learn to reject what is dazzling if it be not ſolid; and to prefer, not what is ſtriking, or bright, or new, but what is juſt. That kind of knowledge which is rather fitted for home conſumption than foreign exportation, is peculiarly adapted to women.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037996_0222_100FAB49DB1F1D80"/>
It is becauſe the ſuperficial nature of their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion furniſhes them with a falſe and low ſtandard of intellectual excellence, that women have ſometimes become ridiculous by the unfounded pretenſions of literary vanity: for it is not the really learned but the ſmatterers, who have generally brought their ſex into diſcredit, by an abſurd affectation, which has ſet them on deſpiſing the duties of ordinary life. There have not indeed been wanting (but the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not now common) <hi>precieuſes ridicules,</hi> who, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a ſuperiority to the ſober cares which ought to occupy their ſex, have claimed a lofty and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious exemption from the dull and plodding drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries
<q>
                           <l>Of this dim ſpeck called earth!</l>
                        </q>
who have affected to eſtabliſh an unnatural ſeparation between talents and uſefulneſs, inſtead of bearing in mind that talents are the great appointed inſtruments of uſefulneſs; who have acted as if knowledge were to confer on woman a kind of fantaſtic ſovereignty, which ſhould exonerate her from female duties; whereas it is only meant the more eminently to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify her for the performance of them. For a woman of real ſenſe will never forget, that while the greater part of her proper duties are ſuch as the moſt mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately gifted may fulfil with credit, (ſince Providence never makes that to be very difficult, which is generally neceſſary), yet the moſt highly endowed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037996_0223_100FAB4B636C8310"/>
are equally bound to fulfil them; and the humbleſt of theſe offices, performed on Chriſtian principles, are wholeſome for the minds even of the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and tend to the caſting down of thoſe high imaginations which women of genius are too much tempted to indulge.</p>
                     <p>For inſtance; ladies whoſe natural vanity has been aggravated by a falſe education, may look down on <hi>oeconomy</hi> as a vulgar attainment, unworthy of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of an highly cultivated intellect; but this is the falſe eſtimate of a ſhallow mind. OEconomy, ſuch as a woman of fortune is called on to practiſe, is not merely the petty detail of ſmall daily expences, the ſhabby curtailments and ſtinted parſimony of a little mind operating on little concerns; but it is the exerciſe of a ſound judgment exerted in the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive outline of order, of arrangement, of diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; of regulations by which alone well governed ſocieties, great and ſmall, ſubſiſt. She who has the beſt regulated mind will, other things being equal, have the beſt regulated family. As in the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence of the univerſe, wiſdom is ſeen in its <hi>effects;</hi> and as in the viſible works of Providence that which goes on with ſuch beautiful regularity is the reſult not of chance but of deſign; ſo that management which ſeems the moſt eaſy is commonly the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the beſt concerted plan. A ſound oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is a ſound underſtanding brought into action:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037996_0224_100FAB4E023DD658"/>
it is calculation realized; it is the doctrine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion reduced to practice; it is foreſeeing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences and guarding againſt them; it is expecting contingencies and being prepared for them. The difference is, that to a narrow minded vulgar oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt the details are continually preſent; ſhe is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by their weight, and is perpetually beſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your pity for her labours and your praiſe for her exertions; ſhe is afraid you will not ſee how much ſhe is harraſſed. Little events, and trivial operations, engroſs her whole ſoul; while a woman of ſenſe, having provided for their probable recurrence, guards againſt the inconveniencies, without being diſconcerted by the caſual obſtructions which they offer to her general ſcheme.</p>
                     <p>Superior talents however are not ſo common, as, by their frequency, to offer much diſturbance to the general courſe of human affairs; and many a lady, who tacitly accuſes herſelf of neglecting her ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duties becauſe ſhe is a <hi>genius,</hi> will perhaps be found often to accuſe herſelf as unjuſtly as good St. Jerome, when he laments that he was beaten by the Angel for being too Ciceronian in his ſtyle<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Owen.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, women who are ſo puffed up with the conceit of talents as to neglect the plain duties of life, will not frequently be found to be women of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037996_0225_100FAB5109059200"/>
the beſt abilities. And here may the author be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the gratification of obſerving, that thoſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of real genius and extenſive knowledge, whoſe friendſhip have conferred honour and happineſs on her own life, have been in general eminent for oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and the practice of domeſtic virtues; and greatly ſuperior to the poor affectation of deſpiſing the duties and the knowledge of common life.</p>
                     <p>A romantic girl with a pretenſion to ſentiment, which her ſtill more ignorant friends miſtake for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, (for in the empire of the blind the one-eyed are kings) and poſſeſſing ſomething of a natural ear, has perhaps in her childhood exhauſted all the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of grief and love, and fancy, picked up in her deſultory poetical reading, in an elegy on a ſick lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net or a dead lap-dog; ſhe begins thence-forward to be conſidered as a prodigy in her little circle; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with flatterers, ſhe has no opportunity of getting to know that her ſame is derived not from her powers, but her poſition; and that when an impartial critic ſhall have made all the neceſſary deductions, ſuch as—that ſhe is a neighbour, that ſhe is a relation, that ſhe is a female, that ſhe is young, that ſhe has had no advantages, that ſhe is pretty perhaps—when her verſes come to be ſtripped of all their extraneous appendages, and the fair author is driven off her 'vantage-ground of partiality, ſex, and favour, ſhe will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037996_0226_100FAB54C06D9A98"/>
ſink to the level of ordinary capacities; while thoſe quieter women, who have meekly ſat down in the humble ſhades of proſe and prudence, by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient perſeverance in rational ſtudies, riſe afterwards much higher in the ſcale of intellect, and acquire a ſtock of ſound knowledge for far better purpoſes than mere diſplay. And, though it may ſeem a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, yet it will generally be found true, that girls who take to ſcribbling are the leaſt ſtudious. They early acquire a falſe confidence in their own unaſſiſted powers; it becomes more gratifying to their natural vanity to be always pouring out their minds on paper, than to be drawing into them freſh ideas from richer ſources. The original ſtock, ſmall perhaps at firſt, is ſoon ſpent; and the ſubſequent efforts grow more and more faint, if the mind which is continually exhauſting itſelf, be not alſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repleniſhed; till the latter compoſitions become little more than reproductions of the ſame images, a little varied and modified perhaps, and not a little diluted and enfeebled.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſelf-taught, and ſelf-dependent ſcribblers pant for the unmerited praiſe of fancy and of genius, while they diſdain the commendation of judgment, knowledge, and perſeverance which would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their reach. To extort admiration they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to boaſt of an impoſſible rapidity in compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and while they inſinuate how little time their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037996_0227_100FAB5647E0E050"/>
performances coſt them, they intend you ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer how perfect they might have made them had they condeſcended to the drudgery of application. They take ſuperfluous pains to convince you that there was neither learning nor labour employed in the work for which they ſolicit your praiſe: the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious eye too ſoon perceives it! though it does <hi>not</hi> perceive that native ſtrength and mother-wit, which in works of real genius make ſome amends for the negligence, which yet they do not juſtify. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of extolling theſe effuſions for their facility, it would be kind in friends rather to blame them for their crudeneſs: and when the young pretenders are eager to prove in how ſhort a time ſuch a poem has been ſtruck off, it would be well to regret that they had not either taken a longer time, or forborne from writing at all; as in the former caſe the work would have been leſs defective, and in the latter the writer would have diſcovered more humility and ſelf-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt.</p>
                     <p>A general capacity for knowledge, and the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the underſtanding at large, will always put a woman into the beſt ſtate for directing her purſuits into thoſe particular channels which her deſtination in life may afterwards require. But ſhe ſhould be carefully inſtructed that her talents are only means to a ſtill higher attainment, and that ſhe is not to reſt in them as an end; that merely to exerciſe them as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037996_0228_100FAB58E0BA7AA0"/>
inſtruments for the acquiſition of fame and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of pleaſure, is ſubverſive of her delicacy as a woman, and contrary to the ſpirit of a chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>Study, therefore, is to be conſidered as the means of ſtrengthening the mind, and of fitting it for high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duties, juſt as exerciſe is to be conſidered as an inſtrument for ſtrengthening the body for the ſame end. And the valetudinarian who is religiouſly punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in the obſervance of his daily rides to promote his health, and reſts in that as an end, without ſo much as intending to make his improved health an inſtrument of increaſed uſefulneſs, acts on the ſame low and ſelfiſh principle with her who reads merely for pleaſure and for fame, without any deſign of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting the more enlarged and invigorated mind to the glory of the Giver.</p>
                     <p>But there is one <hi>human</hi> conſideration which would perhaps more effectually tend to damp in an aſpiring woman the ardours of literary vanity (I ſpeak not of real genius) than any which ſhe will derive from motives of humility, or propriety, or religion; which is, that in the judgment paſſed on her performances, ſhe will have to encounter the mortifying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of having her ſex always taken into account, and her higheſt exertions will probably be received with the qualified approbation, <hi>that it is really extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary for a woman.</hi> Men of learning, who are naturally inclined to eſtimate works in proportion as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037996_0229_100FAB5CC730AAF0"/>
they appear to be the reſult of art, ſtudy, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, are apt to conſider even the happier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the other ſex as the ſpontaneous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of a fruitful but ſhallow ſoil; and to give them the ſame ſort of praiſe which we beſtow on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſallads, which often draw from us a ſort of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering commendation; not indeed as being worth much in themſelves, but becauſe by the lightneſs of the earth, and a happy knack of the gardener, theſe indifferent creſſes ſpring up in a night, and therefore one is ready to wonder they are no worſe.</p>
                     <p>As to men of ſenſe, however, they need be the leſs inimical to the improvement of the other ſex, as they themſelves will be ſure to be gainers by it; the enlargement of the female underſtanding being the moſt likely means to put an end to thoſe petty cavils and contentions for equality which female ſmatterers ſo anxiouſly maintain. I ſay ſmatterers, for between the firſt claſs of both ſexes the queſtion is much more rarely and always more temperately agitated. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation and not competition is indeed the clear prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple we wiſh to ſee reciprocally adopted by thoſe higher minds in each ſex which really approximate the neareſt to each other. The more a woman's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is improved, the more obviouſly ſhe will diſcern that there can be no happineſs in any ſociety where there is a perpetual ſtruggle for power; and the more her judgment is rectified, the more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037996_0230_100FAB5F690A12B0"/>
views will ſhe take of the ſtation ſhe herſelf was born to fill, and the more readily will ſhe accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date herſelf to it; while the moſt vulgar and ill-informed women are ever moſt inclined to be tyrants, and thoſe always ſtruggle moſt vehemently for power, who would not fail to make the worſt uſe of it when attained. Thus the weakeſt reaſoners are always the moſt poſitive in debate; and the cauſe is obvious, for <hi>they</hi> are unavoidably driven to maintain their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by violence who want arguments and reaſons to prove that they are in the right.</p>
                     <p>There is this ſingular difference between a woman vain of her wit, and a woman vain of her beauty; that the beauty, while ſhe is anxiouſly alive to her own fame, is often indifferent enough about the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of other women; and provided ſhe herſelf is ſure of your admiration, ſhe does not inſiſt on your think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is another handſome woman in the world: while ſhe who is vain of her genius, more liberal at leaſt in her vanity, is jealous for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her whole ſex, and contends for the equality of their pretenſions, in which ſhe feels that her own are involved. The beauty vindicates her own rights, the wit, the rights of women; the beauty fights for herſelf, the wit for a party; and while the more ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh though moderate beauty
<q>
                           <l>would but be Queen for life,</l>
                        </q>
                        <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037996_0231_100FAB60EF6D53B0"/>
the public ſpirited wit ſtruggles to abrogate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique law of intellect, and to enthrone
<q>
                           <l>a whole ſex of Queens.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the revival of letters in the ſixteenth and the following century, the controverſy about this equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was agitated with more warmth than wiſdom; and the proceſs was inſtituted and carried on, on the part of the female complainant, with that ſort of acrimony which always raiſes a ſuſpicion of the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any cauſe. The novelty of that knowledge which was then burſting out from the dawn of a long dark night, kindled all the ardours of the female mind, and the ladies fought zealouſly for a portion of that renown which the reputation of learning was beginning to beſtow. Beſides their own pens, they had for their advocates all thoſe needy authors who had any thing to hope from their power, their riches, or their influence; and ſo giddy did ſome of theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary ladies become by the adulation of their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous panegyriſts, that through theſe repeated draughts of inebriating praiſe, they grew to deſpiſe the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for which they had before contended, as a ſtate below their merit and unworthy of their acceptance. They now ſcorned to litigate for what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready thought they ſo obviouſly poſſeſſed, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of the palm of ſuperiority was at length conſidered as adequate to their growing claims. When court-ladies and princeſſes were the candidates,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037996_0232_100FAB638B63C580"/>
they could not long want champions to ſupport their cauſe; by theſe champions female authorities were produced as if paramount to facts; quotations from theſe female authors were conſidered as proofs, and their point-blank aſſertions ſtood for ſolid and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable arguments. In thoſe paraſites who offered this homage to female genius, the homage was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effect neither of truth, nor of juſtice, nor of conviction. It aroſe rather out of gratitude, or it was a reciprocation of flattery; it was ſometimes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it was often diſtreſs, which prompted the adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; it was the want of a patroneſs; it was the want of a dinner. When a lady, and eſpecially as it then often happened, when one who was noble or royal, ſat with gratifying docility at the foot of a profeſſor's chair; when ſhe admired the philoſopher, or took upon her to protect the theologian, whom his rivals among his own ſex were tearing to pieces, what could the grateful profeſſor or delighted theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logian do leſs in return than make the apotheoſis of her who had had the penetration to diſcern his merit and the ſpirit to reward it? Thus in fact it was not ſo much <hi>her</hi> vanity as his own that he was often flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, though ſhe was the dupe of her more deep and deſigning panegyriſt.</p>
                     <p>But it is a little unlucky for the perpetuity of that fame which the encomiaſt had made over to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs, in the never-dying records of his verſes and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037996_0233_100FAB669D42C0D0"/>
orations, that in the revolution of a century or two the very names of the flattered are now almoſt as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known as the works of the flatterers. <hi>Their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial is periſhed with them:</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">See Brantome, Pere le Moine, Monſ. Thomas, &amp;c.</note> an inſtructive leſſon, that whoever beſtows, or aſſumes a reputation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned to the merit of the claimant, will find it as little durable as ſolid. For this literary warfare which engaged ſuch troops of the ſecond-hand au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the age in queſtion in ſuch continual ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, and not a few pitched battles, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked ſo much rancour, ſo many volumes, and ſo little wit; ſo much vanity and ſo much flattery, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no uſeful or laſting effect. Thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves that their names would outlive "one half of round eternity," did not reach the end of the century in which the boaſt was made; and thoſe who offered the incenſe, and thoſe who greedily ſnuffed up its fumes, are buried in the ſame blank oblivion!</p>
                     <p>But when the temple of Janus ſeemed to have been cloſed, or when at worſt the peace was only occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally broken by a ſlight and random ſhot from the hand of ſome ſingle ſtraggler; it appears that though open rebellion had ceaſed, yet the female claim had not been renounced; it had only (if we may change the metaphor) lain in abeyance. The conteſt has
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037996_0234_100FAB6A4B2ABBF0"/>
recently been revived with added fury, and with multiplied exactions; for whereas the ancient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was merely a kind of imaginary prerogative, a ſpeculative importance, a mere titular right, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy claim to a few unreal acres of Parnaſſian terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; the revived contention has taken a more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous turn, and brings forward political as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual pretenſions: and among the innovations of this innovating period, the impoſing term of <hi>rights</hi> has been produced to ſanctify the claim of our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male pretenders, with a view not only to rekindle in the minds of women a preſumptuous vanity diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to their ſex, but produced with a view to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in their hearts an impious diſcontent with the poſt which God has aſſigned them in this world.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>they</hi> little underſtand the true intereſts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who would lift her from the important duties of her allotted ſtation, to fill with fantaſtic dignity a loftier but leſs appropriate niche. Nor do they underſtand her true happineſs, who ſeek to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late diſtinctions from which ſhe derives advantages, and to attempt innovations which would depreciate her real value. Each ſex has its proper excellencies, which would be loſt were they melted down into the common character by the fuſion of the new philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Why ſhould we do away diſtinctions which increaſe the mutual benefits and enhance the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life? Whence, but by carefully preſerving
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037996_0235_100FAB6CE357F940"/>
the original marks of difference ſtamped by the hand of the Creator, would be derived the ſuperior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of mixed ſociety? Have men no need to have their rough angles filed off, and their harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and aſperities ſmoothed and poliſhed by aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating with beings of more ſoftneſs and refinement? Are the ideas of women naturally ſo <hi>very</hi> judicious, are their principles ſo <hi>invincibly</hi> firm, are their views ſo <hi>perfectly</hi> correct, are their judgments ſo <hi>completely</hi> exact, that there is occaſion for no additional weight, no ſuperadded ſtrength, no increaſed clearneſs, none of that enlargement of mind, none of that additional invigoration which may be derived from the aids of the ſtronger ſex? What identity could advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſuperſede an enlivening oppoſition and an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting variety of character? Is it not then more wiſe as well as more honourable to move contentedly in the plain path which Providence has obviouſly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to the ſex, and in which cuſtom has for the moſt part rationally confirmed them, than to ſtray awkwardly, unbecomingly, and unſucceſsfully, in a forbidden road? Is it not deſirable to be the lawful poſſeſſors of a leſſer domeſtic territory, rather than the turbulent uſurpers of a wider foreign empire? to be good originals, rather than bad imitators? to be the beſt thing of one's own kind, rather than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior thing even if it were of an higher kind? to be excellent women rather than indifferent men?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037996_0236_100FAB6E6B4C4A20"/>
Is the author then undervaluing her own ſex?—No. It is her zeal for their true <hi>intereſts</hi> which leads her to oppoſe their imaginary <hi>rights.</hi> It is her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for their happineſs which makes her endeavour to cure them of a feveriſh thirſt for fame. A little Chriſtian humility and ſober-mindedneſs are worth all the wild metaphyſical diſcuſſion, which has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled the peace of vain women, and forfeited the reſpect of reaſonable men. And the moſt elaborate definition of ideal rights, and the moſt hardy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for attaining them, are of leſs value in the eyes of a truly amiable woman, than <q>that meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Natural propenſities beſt mark the deſignations of Providence as to their application. The fin was not more clearly beſtowed on the fiſh that he ſhould ſwim, nor the wing given to the bird that he ſhould fly, than ſuperior ſtrength of body and a firmer tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mind was given to man, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the deep and daring ſcenes of action and of council; in government, in arms, in ſcience, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and in thoſe profeſſions which demand a higher reach, and a wider range of powers. The true value of woman is not diminiſhed by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of inferiority in <hi>theſe</hi> reſpects; ſhe has other requiſites better adadted to anſwer the ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of her being, by <q>HIM who does all things
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037996_0237_100FAB710C81CC28"/>
well;</q> who ſuits the agent to the action; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates the inſtrument to the work.</p>
                     <p>Let her not then view with pining envy the keen ſatyriſt, hunting vice through all the doublings and windings of the heart; the ſagacious politician, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenates, and directing the fate of empires; the acute lawyer, detecting the obliquities of fraud; and the ſkilful dramatiſt, expoſing the pretenſions of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but let her ambition be conſoled by reflecting, that thoſe who thus excel, to all that Nature beſtows and books can teach, muſt add beſides that conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate knowledge of the world to which a delicate woman has no fair avenues, and which even if ſhe could attain ſhe would never be ſuppoſed to have come honeſtly by.</p>
                     <p>In almoſt all that comes under the deſcription of polite letters, in all that captivates by imagery or warms by juſt and affecting ſentiment, women are excellent. They poſſeſs in a high degree that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and quickneſs of perception and that nice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment between the beautiful and defective, which comes under the denomination of taſte. Both in compoſition and action they excel in details; but they do not ſo much generalize their ideas as men, nor do their minds ſeize a great ſubject with ſo large a graſp. They are acute obſervers, and accurate judges of life and manners, as far as their own ſphere of obſervation extends; but they deſcribe a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037996_0238_100FAB74B537EAA8"/>
ſmaller circle. A woman ſees the world, as it were, from a little elevation in her own garden, whence ſhe makes an exact ſurvey of home ſcenes, but takes not in that wider range of diſtant proſpects, which he who ſtands on a loftier eminence commands. Women have a certain <hi>tact</hi> which often enables them to feel what is juſt more inſtantaneouſly than they can define it. They have an intuitive penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into character, beſtowed on them by Providence, like the ſenſitive and tender organs of ſome timid animals, as a kind of natural guard to warn of the approach of danger beings who are often called to act defenſively.</p>
                     <p>In ſumming up the evidence, if I may ſo ſpeak, of the different powers of the ſexes, one may venture, perhaps, to aſſert, that women have equal <hi>parts,</hi> but are inferior in <hi>wholeneſs</hi> of mind, in the integral underſtanding: that though a ſuperior woman may poſſeſs ſingle faculties in equal perfection, yet there is commonly a juſter proportion in the mind of a ſuperior man; that if women have in an equal degree the faculty of fancy which creates images, and the faculty of memory which collects and ſtores ideas, they ſeem not to poſſeſs in equal meaſure the faculty of comparing, combining, analyſing, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating theſe ideas; that deep and patient thinking which goes to the bottom of a ſubject; nor that power of arrangement which knows how to link a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037996_0239_100FAB76400FF208"/>
thouſand connected ideas in one dependent train, without loſing ſight of the original idea out of which the reſt grow, and on which they all hang. The female too, wanting ſteadineſs in her intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al purſuits, is perpetually turned aſide by her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic taſtes and feelings. Woman in the career of genius, is the Atalanta, who will riſk loſing the race by running out of her road to pick up the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en apple; while her male competitor, without, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, poſſeſſing greater natural ſtrength or ſwiftneſs, will more certainly attain his object, by direct pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, by being leſs expoſed to the ſeductions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous beauty, and will win the race, not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling in ſpeed, but by deſpiſing the bait.<note n="*" place="bottom">What indiſpoſes even reaſonable women to concede in theſe points is, that the weakeſt man inſtantly lays hold on the conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, on the mere ground of ſex, plumes himſelf on his own individual ſuperiority; inferring, that the ſillieſt man is ſuperior to the firſt-rate woman.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Here it may be juſtly enough retorted, that, as it is allowed the education of women is ſo defective, the alleged inferiority of their minds may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for on that ground more juſtly than by aſcribing it to their natural make. And, indeed there is ſo much truth in the remark, that till women ſhall be more reaſonably educated, and till the native growth of their minds ſhall ceaſe to be ſtinted and cramped, we have no juſter ground for pronouncing that their
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037996_0240_100FAB78D99B63B0"/>
underſtanding has already reached its higheſt attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point, than the Chineſe would have for affirming that their women have attained to the greateſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection in walking, while the firſt care is, during their infancy, to cripple their feet. At leaſt, till the female ſex are more carefully inſtructed, this queſtion will always remain as undecided as to the <hi>degree</hi> of difference between the maſculine and feminine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as the queſtion between the underſtandings of blacks and whites; for until Africans and Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans are put more nearly on a par in the cultivation of their minds, the ſhades of diſtinction, if any there be, between their native powers can never be fairly aſcertained.</p>
                     <p>And when we ſee (and who will deny that we ſee it frequently?) ſo many women nobly riſing from under all the preſſure of a diſadvantageous education and a defective ſyſtem of ſociety, and exhibiting the moſt unambiguous marks of a vigorous underſtanding, a correct judgment, and a ſterling piety, it reminds one of thoſe ſhining lights which have now and then burſt out through all the "darkneſs viſible" of the Romiſh church, have diſencumbered themſelves from the gloom of ignorance and ſhaken off the fetters of prejudice, and riſen ſuperior to all the errors of a corrupt theology.</p>
                     <p>But whatever characteriſtical diſtinctions may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt; whatever inferiority may be attached to woman
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037996_0241_100FAB7B73808648"/>
from the ſlighter frame of her body, or the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed powers of her mind, from a leſs ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic education, and from the ſubordinate ſtation ſhe is called to fill in life; there is one great and leading circumſtance which raiſes her importance, and even eſtabliſhes her equality. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has exalted wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to true and undiſputed dignity; in Chriſt Jeſus, as there is neither "rich nor poor," <q>bond nor free,</q> ſo there is neither "male nor female." In the view of that immortality, which is brought to light by the goſpel, ſhe has no ſuperior. Women (to borrow the idea of an excellent prelate) make up one half of the human race; equally with men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the blood of Chriſt. In this their true dignity conſiſts; here their beſt pretenſions reſt, here their higheſt claims are allowed.</p>
                     <p>All diſputes then for pre-eminence between the ſexes have only for their object the poor precedence for a few ſhort years, the attention of which would be better devoted to the duties of life and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of eternity.</p>
                     <p>And as the final hope of the female ſex is equal, ſo are their preſent means, perhaps, more favourable, and their opportunities, often, leſs obſtructed than thoſe of the other ſex. In their Chriſtian courſe women have every ſuperior advantage, whether we conſider the natural make of their minds, their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for acquiſition in youth, or their ſubſequently
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037996_0242_100FAB7F2477E060"/>
leſs expoſed mode of life. Their hearts are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoft and flexible, open to impreſſions of love and gratitude; their feelings tender and lively: all theſe are favourable to the cultivation of a devotional ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Yet while we remind them of theſe benefits, they will do well to be on their guard leſt this very ſoftneſs and ductility lay them more open to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of temptation and error.</p>
                     <p>They have in the native conſtitution of their minds, as well as from the relative ſituations they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to fill, a certain ſenſe of attachment and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is peculiarly favourable to religion. They feel, perhaps, more intimately the want of a ſtrength which is not their own. Chriſtianity brings that ſuperinduced ſtrength; it comes in aid of their conſcious weakneſs, and offers the only true counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe to it. <q>Woman, be thou healed of thine infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</q> is ſtill the heart cheering language of a gracious Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Women alſo bring to the ſtudy of Chriſtianity fewer of thoſe prejudices which perſons of the other ſex too often early contract. Men, from their claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical education, acquire a ſtrong partiality for the manners of Pagan antiquity, and the documents of Pagan philoſophy: this, together with the impure taint caught from the looſe deſcriptions of their poets, and the licentious language even of their hiſtorians, (in whom we reaſonably look for more gravity,) oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037996_0243_100FAB81C84E4820"/>
weakens the good impreſſions of young men, and at leaſt confuſes their ideas of piety, by mixing them with ſo much heterogeneous matter. Their very ſpirits are embued all the week with the impure follies of a depraved mythology; and it is well if even on Sundays they get to hear of the "true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he has ſent." While women, though ſtruggling with the ſame natural corruptions, have commonly leſs knowledge to unknow, and few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſchemes to unlearn; they have not to ſhake off the pride of ſyſtem, and to diſencumber their minds from the ſhackles of favourite theories: they do not bring from the porch or the academy any <q>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of ſcience</q> to obſtruct their reception of thoſe pure doctrines taught on the Mount: doctrines which ought to find a readier entrance into minds uninfected with the pride of the ſchool of Zeno, or the libertiniſm of that of Epicurus.</p>
                     <p>And as women are naturally more affectionate than faſtidious; they are likely both to read and to hear with a leſs critical ſpirit than men: they will not be on the watch to detect errors, ſo much as to gather improvement; they have ſeldom that hardneſs which is acquired by dealing deeply in books of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, but are more inclined to works which quicken the devotional feelings, than to ſuch as awaken a ſpirit of doubt and ſcepticiſm. They are leſs diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider the compoſitions they peruſe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037996_0244_100FAB8382A33B60"/>
on which to ground objections and anſwers, than as helps to faith and rules of life. With theſe advantages, however, they ſhould alſo bear in mind that their impreſſions being often leſs abiding, and their reaſon leſs open to conviction, by means of the ſtrong evidences which exiſt in favour of the truth of Chriſtianity, <q>they ought therefore, to give the more earneſt heed to the things which they have heard, leſt at any time they ſhould let them ſlip.</q> Women are alſo from their domeſtic habits, in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of more leiſure and tranquillity for religious purſuits, as well as ſecured from thoſe difficulties and temptations to which men are expoſed in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of a buſtling world. Their lives are more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, leſs agitated by the paſſions, the buſineſſes, the contentions, the ſhock of opinions and of intereſts which convulſe the world.</p>
                     <p>If we have denied them the talents which might lead them to excel as lawyers, they are preſerved from the peril of having their principles warped by that too indiſcriminate defence of right and wrong, to which the profeſſors of the law are expoſed. If we ſhould queſtion their title to eminence as mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians, they are happily exempt from the danger to which men devoted to that ſcience are ſaid to be liable; namely, that of looking for demonſtration on ſubjects, which, by their very nature, are incapable of affording it. If they are leſs converſant in the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037996_0245_100FAB862D921B70"/>
powers of nature, the ſtructure of the human frame, and the knowledge of the heavenly bodies, than phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, phyſicians, and aſtronomers; they are, however, delivered from the error into which many of each of theſe have ſometimes fallen, I mean from the fatal habit of reſting in ſecond cauſes, inſtead of referring all to the firſt; inſtead of making <q>the heavens declare the glory of God, and proclaim his handy work;</q> inſtead of concluding, when they obſerve, <q>how fearfully and wonderfully we are made, marvellous are thy works, O Lord, and that my ſoul knoweth right well.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And let the weaker ſex take comfort, that in their very exemption from privileges, which they are ſometimes diſpoſed to envy, conſiſts their ſecurity and their happineſs. If they enjoy not the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of public life and high offices, do they not eſcape the reſponſibility attached to them, and the mortification of being diſmiſſed from them? If they have no voice in deliberative aſſemblies, do they not avoid the load of duty connected with ſuch privileges? Prepoſterous pains have been taken to excite in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men an uneaſy jealouſy, that their talents are neither rewarded with public honours nor emoluments in life; nor with inſcriptions, ſtatues, and mauſoleums after death. It has been abſurdly repreſented to them as a hardſhip, that while they are expected to perform duties, they muſt yet be contented to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037996_0246_100FAB89F04302D0"/>
honours, and muſt unjuſtly be compelled to renounce fame while they muſt ſedulouſly labour to deſerve it.</p>
                     <p>But for Chriſtian women to act on the low views ſuggeſted to them by their ill-judging panegyriſts; and to look up with a giddy head and a throbbing heart to honours and remunerations, ſo little ſuited to the wants and capacities of an immortal ſpirit, would be no leſs ridiculous than if Chriſtian heroes ſhould look back with envy on the pagan rewards of ovations, oak garlands, parſley crowns, and laurel wreaths. The Chriſtian hope more than reconciles Chriſtian women to theſe petty privations, by ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a nobler prize for their ambition, <q>the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus;</q> by ſubſtituting, for that popular and fluctuating voice, which may cry "Hoſanna" and "crucify" in a breath, that "favour of God which is eternal life."</p>
                     <p>If women ſhould lament the diſadvantages attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their ſex, that their character is of ſo delicate a texture as to be ſullied by the ſlighteſt breath of calumny, and that the ſtain is indelible; yet are they not led by that very circumſtance more inſtinctively to ſhrink from all thoſe irregularities to which the loſs of character is ſo much expected to be attached; and to ſhun with keener circumſpection the moſt diſtant approach towards the confines of danger? Let them not lament it as a hardſhip, but account it
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037996_0247_100FAB8C8FC406A8"/>
to be a privilege, that the delicacy of their ſex im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them more ſcrupulouſly to avoid the very appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil, and that the conſciouſneſs of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſerves to ſecure their purity, by placing them at a greater diſtance from the evil itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Though it be one main object of this little work, rather to lower than to raiſe any deſire of celebrity in the female heart; yet I would awaken it to a juſt ſenſibility to honeſt fame: I would call on women to reflect that our religion has not only made them heirs to a bleſſed immortality hereafter, but has greatly raiſed them in the ſcale of being here, by lifting them to an importance in ſociety unknown to the moſt poliſhed ages of antiquity. The religion of Chriſt has even beſtowed a degree of renown on the ſex beyond what any other religion ever did. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there are hardly ſo many virtuous women (for I reject the long catalogue whom their vices have transferred from oblivion to infamy) named in all the pages of Greek or Roman Hiſtory, as are handed down to eternal fame, in a few of thoſe ſhort chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with which the great Apoſtle to the Gentiles has concluded his epiſtles to his converts. Of "devout and honourable women," the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures record "not a few." Some of the moſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes, the moſt intereſting tranſactions, and the moſt touching converſations which are recorded of the Saviour of the world, paſſed with women. <hi>They</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:037996_0248_100FAB8E1BC62F08"/>
are the firſt remarked as having <q>miniſtered to him of their ſubſtance.</q> 
                        <hi>Theirs</hi> was the praiſe of not abandoning their deſpiſed Redeemer when he was led to execution, and under all the hopeleſs circumſtances of his ignominious death; <hi>they</hi> appear to have been the <hi>laſt</hi> attending at his tomb, and the <hi>firſt</hi> on the morning when he aroſe from it. <hi>Theirs</hi> was the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of receiving the earlieſt conſolation from their riſen Lord; <hi>theirs</hi> was the honour of being firſt commiſſioned to announce his glorious reſurrection to the world. And even to furniſh heroic confeſſors, devoted ſaints, and unſhrinking martyrs to the Church of Chriſt, has not been the excluſive honour of the bolder ſex.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>CONVERSATION.—Hints ſuggeſted on the ſubject.—On the tempers and diſpoſitions to be introduced in it.—Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to be avoided.—Vanity under various ſhapes the cauſe of thoſe errors.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE ſexes will naturally deſire to appear to each other, ſuch as each believes the other will beſt like; their converſation will act reciprocally; and each ſex will appear more or leſs rational as they perceive it will more or leſs recommend them to the other. It is therefore to be regretted, that many men, even of diſtinguiſhed ſenſe and learning, are ſo apt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſociety of ladies, as a ſcene in which to reſt their underſtandings, rather than to exerciſe them; while ladies in return, are too much addicted to make their court by lending themſelves to this ſpirit of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling; they often avoid to make uſe of what abilities they have; and affect to talk below their natural and acquired powers of mind; conſidering it as a tacit and welcome flattery to the underſtanding of men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the exerciſe of their own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="35" facs="unknown:037996_0250_100FAB94B3152600"/>
Now ſince taſtes and principles thus mutually ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; men, by keeping up converſation to its proper ſtandard, would not only call into exerciſe the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mind which women actually poſſeſs; but would even awaken in them new energies which they do not know they poſſeſs; and men of ſenſe would find their account in doing this, for their own talents would be more highly rated by companions who were better able to appreciate them. And, on the other hand, if young women found it did not often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them in the eyes of thoſe whom they might wiſh to pleaſe, to be frivolous and ſuperficial, they would become more ſedulous in correcting their own habits; whenever faſhionable women indicate a reliſh for inſtructive converſation, men will not be apt to hazard what is vain or unprofitable; much leſs will they ever preſume to bring forward what is looſe or corrupt, where ſome ſignal has not been previouſly given, that it will be acceptable, or at leaſt that it will be pardoned.</p>
                     <p>Ladies commonly bring into company minds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much relaxed by petty purſuits, rather than overſtrained by intenſe application; the littleneſs of the employments in which they are uſually engaged, does not ſo exhauſt their ſpirits as to make them ſtand in need of that relaxation from company which ſevere application or overwhelming buſineſs makes requiſite for ſtudious or public men. The due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037996_0251_100FAB97569EE4C0"/>
of this circumſtance might ſerve to bring the ſexes more nearly on a level in ſociety; and each might meet the other half way; for that degree of lively and eaſy converſation which is a neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to the learned and the buſy, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in pleaſantneſs by being made of ſo rational a caſt as would yet ſomewhat raiſe the minds of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who commonly ſeek ſociety as a ſcene of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not as a refuge from intenſe thought or exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing labour.</p>
                     <p>It is a diſadvantage even to thoſe women who keep the beſt company, that it is unhappily almoſt eſtabliſhed into a ſyſtem, by the other ſex, to poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone every thing like inſtructive diſcourſe till the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are withdrawn; their retreat ſerving as a kind of ſignal for the exerciſe of intellect. And in the few caſes in which it happens that any important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion takes place in their preſence, they are for the moſt part conſidered as having little intereſt in ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects. Strong truths, whenever ſuch happen to be addreſſed to them, are either diluted with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or kept back in part, or ſoftened to their taſte; or if the ladies expreſs a wiſh for information on any point, they are put off with a compliment, inſtead of a reaſon; and are conſidered as beings who are not expected to ſee and to judge of things as they really exiſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:037996_0252_100FAB98DE497E88"/>
Do we then wiſh to ſee the ladies, whoſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities leave them ſo incompetent, and the modeſty of whoſe ſex ought never to allow them even to be as ſhining as they are able;—do we wiſh to ſee them take the lead in metaphyſical diſquiſitions? Do we wiſh them to plunge into the depths of theological polemics,
<q>
                           <l>And find no end in wand'ring mazes loſt?</l>
                        </q>
Do we wiſh them to revive the animoſities of the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorian controverſy, or to decide the proceſs between the Jeſuits and the five propoſitions of Janſenius? Do we wiſh to enthrone them in the profeſſor's chair, to deliver oracles, harangues, and diſſertations? to weigh the merits of every new production in the ſcales of Quintilian, or to regulate the unities of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic compoſition <hi>by Ariſtotle's clock?</hi> Or renouncing thoſe foreign aids, do we deſire to behold them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated with their original powers, labouring to ſtrike out ſparks of wit, with a reſtleſs anxiety to ſhine, which generally fails, and with a laboured affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pleaſe, which never pleaſes?

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this be far from them!—But we <hi>do</hi> wiſh to ſee the converſation of well-bred women reſcued from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid common places, from unintereſting tattle, from trite and hackneyed communications, from frivolous earneſtneſs, from falſe ſenſibility, from a warm intereſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037996_0253_100FAB9B90EB19B8"/>
about things of no moment, and an indifference to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics the moſt important; from a cold vanity, from the overflowings of ſelf-love, exhibiting itſelf under the ſmiling maſk of an engaging flattery, and from all the factitious manners of artificial intercourſe. We <hi>do</hi> wiſh to ſee the time paſſed in poliſhed and intelligent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, conſidered among the beneficial, as well as the pleaſant portions of our exiſtence, and not conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, as it too frequently is, to premeditated tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, or ſyſtematic unprofitableneſs. Let us not, however, be miſunderſtood; it is not meant to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe that they ſhould affect to talk on lofty ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo much as to ſuggeſt that they ſhould bring good ſenſe, ſimplicity, and preciſion into thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubjects, of which, after all, both the buſineſs and the converſation of mankind is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure made up.</p>
                     <p>It is too well known how much the dread of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted pedantry keeps off any thing that verges to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>learned,</hi> and the terror of imputed enthuſiaſm, ſtaves off any thing that approaches to <hi>ſerious</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſo that the two topics which peculiarly diſtinguiſh us, as rational and immortal beings, are by general conſent in a good degree baniſhed from the ſociety of rational and immortal creatures. But we might almoſt as conſiſtently give up the comforts of fire becauſe a few perſons have been burnt, and the benefit of water becauſe ſome others have been
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:037996_0254_100FAB9F50A181E0"/>
drowned, as relinquiſh the enjoyments of intellectual, and the bleſſings of religious intercourſe, becauſe the learned world has ſometimes been infeſted with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and the religious world with fanatics.</p>
                     <p>As in the momentous times in which we live, it is next to impoſſible to paſs an evening in company, but the talk will ſo inevitably revert to politics, that, without any premeditated deſign, every one preſent ſhall infallibly get to know to which ſide the other inclines; why, in the far higher concern of eternal things, ſhould we ſo carefully ſhun every offered opportunity of bearing even a caſual teſtimony to the part we eſpouſe in religion? Why, while we make it a ſort of point of conſcience to leave no doubt on the mind of a ſtranger, whether we adopt the party of Pitt or Fox, ſhall we chooſe to leave it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematical whether we belong to God or Baal? Why, in religion, as well as in politics, ſhould we not act like people who, having their all at ſtake, cannot forbear now and then adverting for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the object of their grand concern, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, at leaſt, an incidental intimation of the ſide to which they belong.</p>
                     <p>Even the news of the day, in ſuch an eventful period as the preſent, may lend frequent occaſions to a woman of principle, to declare, without parade, her faith in a moral Governor of the world; her truſt in a particular Providence; her belief in the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:037996_0255_100FABA0D7DC98C8"/>
Divine Omnipotence; her confidence in the power of God, in educing good from evil, in his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked nations, not as favourites but inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; her perſuaſion that preſent ſucceſs is no proof of the divine favour; in ſhort, ſome intimation that ſhe is not aſhamed to declare that her mind is under the influence of chriſtian faith and principle. A general concurrence in exhibiting this ſpirit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided faith and holy truſt, would inconceivably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage that pert infidelity which is ever on the watch to produce itſelf: and, as we have already obſerved, if women, who derive authority from their rank or talents, did but reflect how their ſentiments are repeated and their authority quoted, they would be ſo on their guard, that general ſociety might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſcene of general improvement, and the young, who are looking for models on which to faſhion themſelves, would be aſhamed of exhibiting any thing like levity, or ſcepticiſm, or profaneneſs.</p>
                     <p>Let it be underſtood, that it is not meant to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that ſerious ſubjects ſhould make up the bulk of converſation; this, as it is impoſſible, would alſo often be improper. It is not intended to ſuggeſt that they ſhould be abruptly introduced, or unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prolonged; but only that they ſhould not be ſyſtematically ſhunned, nor the brand of fanaticiſm be fixed on the perſon who, with whatever proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hazards the introduction of them. It is evident,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037996_0256_100FABA380EC6788"/>
however, that this general dread of ſerious topics ariſes a good deal from an ignorance of the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of religion; people avoid it on the principle expreſſed by the vulgar phraſe of the danger of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with edge tools. They conceive of it as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which involves controverſy, and diſpute, and miſchief; ſomething of an inflammatory nature, which is to ſtir up ill humours; as of a ſort of party buſineſs which ſets friends at variance. So much is this notion adopted, that I have ſeen announced two works of conſiderable merit, in which it was ſtipulated as an attraction, that religion, as being likely to excite anger and party diſtinctions, ſhould be carefully excluded. Such is the worldly idea of the ſpirit of that religion, whoſe direct object it was to bring "peace and good will to men!"</p>
                     <p>Women too little live or converſe up to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; and however we have deprecated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation or pedantry, let it be remembered, that both in reading and converſing the underſtanding gains more by ſtretching, than ſtooping. If by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting itſelf it may not attain to all it deſires, yet it will be ſure to gain ſomething. The mind, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways applying itſelf to objects below its level, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and ſhrinks itſelf to the ſize, and lowers itſelf to the level, of the object about which it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: while the mind which is active expands and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037996_0257_100FABA643CAF280"/>
raiſes itſelf, grows larger by exerciſe, abler by diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and richer by communication.</p>
                     <p>But the taſte of general ſociety is not favourable to improvement. The ſeriouſneſs with which the moſt frivolous ſubjects are agitated, and the levity with which the moſt ſerious are diſpatched, bear a pretty exact proportion to each other. Society too is a ſort of magic lanthorn; the ſcene is perpetually ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In this inceſſant change, the evaneſcent faſhion of the preſent minute, which, while in many it leads to the cultivation of real knowledge, has alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times led even the gay and idle to the affection of mixing a ſprinkling of ſcience with the maſs of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. The ambition of appearing to be well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed breaks out even in thoſe triflers who will not ſpare time from their pleaſurable purſuits ſufficient for acquiring that knowledge, of which, however, the reputation is ſo deſirable. A little ſmattering of philoſophy often dignifies the purſuits of the day, without reſcuing them from the vanities of the night. A courſe of lectures (that admirable aſſiſtant for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the underſtanding) is not ſeldom reſorted to as a means to ſubſtitute the appearance of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the fatigue of application; but where this valuable help is attended merely like any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exhibition, and is not furthered by correſpondent reading at home, it often ſerves to ſet off the reality of ignorance with the affectation of ſkill. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead

of producing in converſation a few reigning ſcientific terms, with a familiarity and readineſs, which

would it not be more modeſt even for thoſe who are better informed, to avoid the common uſe of techni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal terms whenever the idea can be as well conveyed without them? For it argues no real ability to know the <hi>names</hi> of tools; the ability lies in knowing their <hi>uſe:</hi> and while it is in the thing, and not in the term, that real knowledge conſiſts, the charge of pedantry is attached to the uſe of the term, which would not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach to the knowledge of the ſcience.</p>
                     <p>In the faculty of ſpeaking well, ladies have ſuch a happy promptitude of turning their ſlender advantages to account, that there are many who, though they have never been taught a rule of ſyntax, yet, by a quick facility in profiting from the beſt books and the beſt company, hardly ever violate one; and who often exhibit an elegant and perſpicuous arrangement of ſtyle, without having ſtudied any of the laws of compoſition. Every kind of knowledge which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the reſult of obſervation, reflection, and natural taſte, ſits gracefully on women. Yet on the other hand it ſometimes happens, that ladies of no contemptible natural parts are too ready to produce, not only pedantic expreſſions, but crude notions; and ſtill oftener to bring forward obvious and hackneyed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037996_0259_100FABAB78754EE0"/>
remarks, which float on the very ſurface of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with the impoſing air of recent invention, and all the vanity of conſcious diſcovery. This is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their acquirements have not been woven into their minds by early inſtruction; what knowledge they have gotten ſtands out as it were above the very ſurface of their minds, like the <hi>appliquée</hi> of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderer, inſtead of having been interwoven with the growth of the piece, ſo as to have become a part of the ſtuff. They did not, like men, acquire what they know while the texture was forming. Perhaps no better preventive could be deviſed for this literary vanity, than <hi>early</hi> inſtruction: that woman would be leſs likely to be vain of her knowledge who did not remember the time when ſhe was ignorant. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is <hi>burnt in,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak, is ſeldom obtruſive, rarely impertinent.</p>
                     <p>Their reading alſo has probably conſiſted much in abridgments from larger works, as was obſerved in a former chapter; this makes a readier talker, but a ſhallower thinker, than the peruſal of books of more bulk. By theſe ſcanty ſketches their critical ſpirit has been excited, while their critical powers have not been formed. For in thoſe crippled mutilations they have ſeen nothing of that juſt proportion of parts, that ſkilful arrangement of the plan, and that artful diſtribution of the ſubject, which, while they prove the maſter hand of the writer, ſerve alſo to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037996_0260_100FABAF880B8648"/>
form the taſte of the reader, far more than a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed ſkeleton, or a beautiful feature or two can do. The inſtruction of women is alſo too much drawn from the ſcanty and penurious ſources of ſhort writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the eſſay kind: this, when it compriſes the beſt part of a perſon's reading, makes a ſmatterer and ſpoils a ſcholar; for though it ſupplies current talk, yet it does not make a full mind; it does not furniſh a ſtore-houſe of materials to ſtock the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, neither does it accuſtom the mind to any trains of reflection: for the ſubjects, beſides being each ſuccinctly, and, on account of this brevity, ſuperficially treated, are diſtinct and diſconnected: they ariſe out of no concatenation of ideas, nor any dependent ſeries of deduction. Yet on this pleaſant but deſultory reading, the mind which has not been trained to ſeverer exerciſe, loves to repoſe itſelf in a ſort of creditable indolence, inſtead of ſtretching its powers in the wholeſome labour of conſequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation.<note n="*" place="bottom">The writer cannot be ſuppoſed deſirous of depreciating the value of thoſe many beautiful periodical eſſays which adorn our language. But, perhaps, it might be better to regale the mind with them ſingly, at different times, than to read at the ſame ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, a multitude of ſhort pieces on diſſimilar and unconnected topics, <hi>by way of getting through the book.</hi>

                     <p>I am not diſcouraging ſtudy at a late period of life, or even ſlender knowledge; information is good at

whatever period and in whatever degree it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. But in ſuch caſes it ſhould be attended with peculiar humility: and the new poſſeſſor ſhould bear in mind, that what is freſh to her has been long known to others; and ſhe ſhould therefore be aware of advancing as novel that which is common, and obtruding as rare that which every body poſſeſſes. Some ladies are eager to exhibit proofs of their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though at the expence of their judgment, and will introduce in converſation quotations quite irrele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the matter in hand, becauſe they happen at the inſtant to recur to their recollection, or were, perhaps, found in the book they have juſt been read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Unappropriate quotations or ſtrained analogy may ſhew reading, but they do not ſhew taſte. That juſt and happy alluſion which knows by a word how to awaken a correſponding image, or to excite in the hearer the idea which fills the mind of the ſpeaker, ſhews leſs pedantry and more taſte than bare citations; and a mind imbued with elegant knowledge will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably betray the opulence of its reſources, even on topics which do not relate to ſcience or literature. Well informed perſons will eaſily be diſcovered to have read the beſt books, though they are not always detailing catalogues of authors. Though honey owes its exquiſite taſte to the fragrance of the ſweeteſt flowers, yet the ſkill of the little artificer appears in this, that the delicious ſtores are ſo admirably work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037996_0262_100FABB3FA9DA168"/>
up, as not to taſte individually of any of thoſe ſweets of the very eſſence of which it is compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But true judgment will detect the infuſion which true modeſty will not diſplay; and even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubjects paſſing through a cultivated underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borrow a flavour of its richneſs. A power of apt ſelection is more valuable than any power of general retention; and an appoſite remark, which ſhoots ſtraight to the point, demands higher powers of mind than an hundred ſimple acts of memory: for the buſineſs of the memory is only to ſtore up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials which the underſtanding is to mix and work up with its native faculties, and which the judgment is to bring out and apply. But young women who have more vivacity than ſenſe, and more vanity than vivacity, often riſk the charge of abſurdity to eſcape that of ignorance, and will even compare two authors who are totally unlike, rather than miſs the occaſion to ſhew that they have read both.</p>
                     <p>Among the arts to ſpoil converſation, ſome ladies poſſeſs that of ſuddenly diverting it from the channel in which it was beneficially flowing, becauſe ſome <hi>word</hi> uſed by the perſon who was ſpeaking has acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally ſtruck out a new train of thinking in their own minds, and not becauſe the general <hi>idea</hi> expreſſed has ſtruck out a correſponding idea, which ſort of colliſion is indeed the way of eliciting the true fire. Young ladies, whoſe ſprightlineſs has not been diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037996_0263_100FABB695FA53D8"/>
by a correct education, conſider how things may be prettily ſaid, rather than how they may be prudently or ſeaſonably ſpoken; and hazard being thought wrong, or raſh, or vain, for the chance of being reckoned pleaſant. The flowers of rhetoric captivate them more than the juſteſt deductions of reaſon; and to repel an argument they arm themſelves with a metaphor. Thoſe alſo who do not aim ſo high as eloquence, are often ſurprized that you refuſe to accept of a prejudice inſtead of a reaſon; they are apt to take up with a probability in place of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, and cheaply put you off with an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when you are requiring a proof. The ſame mode of education renders them alſo impatient of oppoſition; and if they happen to poſſeſs beauty, and to be vain of it, they may be tempted to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that as an additional proof of their being always in the right. In this caſe, they will not aſk you to ſubmit your judgment to the force of their argument, ſo much as to the authority of their charms.</p>
                     <p>The ſame fault in the mind, ſtrengthened by the ſame cauſe, (a neglected education,) leads lively wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men often to pronounce on a queſtion without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining it: on any given point they ſeldomer <hi>doubt</hi> than men; not becauſe they are more clear ſighted, but becauſe they have not been accuſtomed to look into a ſubject long enough to diſcover its depths and its intricacies; and not diſcerning its difficulties,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037996_0264_100FABB81D5E3810"/>
they conclude that it has none. Is it a contradiction to ſay, that they ſeem at once to be quick-ſighted and ſhort-ſighted? What they ſee at all, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſee at once; a little difficulty diſcourages them; and, having caught a haſty glimpſe of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they ruſh to this concluſion, that either there is no more to be ſeen, or that what is behind will not pay them for the trouble of ſearching. They purſue their object eagerly, but not regularly; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly, but not pertinaciouſly; for they want that obſtinate patience of inveſtigation which grows ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by repulſe. What they have not attained, they do not believe exiſts; what they cannot ſeize at once, they perſuade themſelves is not worth having.</p>
                     <p>Is a ſubject of moment ſtarted in company? While the more ſagacious are deliberating on its difficulties, and viewing it under all its aſpects, in order to form a competent judgment before they decide, you will often find the moſt ſuperficial woman preſent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter without heſitation. Not ſeeing the perplexities in which the queſtion is involved, ſhe wonders at the want of penetration in him whoſe very penetration keeps him ſilent. She ſecretly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes the dull perception and ſlow deciſion of him who is patiently <hi>untying</hi> the knot which ſhe fancies ſhe exhibits more dexterity by <hi>cutting.</hi> By this ſhallow ſprightlineſs, the perſon whoſe opinion was beſt worth having is diſcouraged from delivering it,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037996_0265_100FABBBCECF07E8"/>
and an important ſubject is diſmiſſed without diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by this inconſequent flippancy and voluble raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is this abundance of florid talk, from ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial matter, which has brought on ſo many of the ſex the charge of <hi>inverting</hi> the Apoſtle's precept, and being <hi>ſwift</hi> to <hi>ſpeak, ſlow</hi> to <hi>hear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For, if the great Roman Orator could obſerve, that ſilence was ſo important a part of converſation, that "there was not only an art but an eloquence in it," how peculiarly does the remark apply to the modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of youthful females! But the ſilence of liſtleſs ignorance, and the ſilence of ſparkling intelligence, are two things almoſt as obviouſly diſtinct, as the wiſdom and the folly of the tongue. An inviolable and marked attention may ſhew, that a woman is pleaſed with a ſubject, and an illuminated counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may prove that ſhe underſtands it, almoſt as unequivocally as language itſelf could do; and this, with a modeſt queſtion, is in many caſes as large a ſhare of the converſation as it is decorous for femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine delicacy to take. It is alſo as flattering an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as men of ſenſe require, for purſuing ſuch topics in the preſence of women, which they would be more diſpoſed to do, did they oftener gain by it the attention which it is natural to wiſh to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.</p>
                     <p>Yet do we not ſometimes ſee an impatience to be heard (nor is it a <hi>feminine</hi> failing only) which good
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037996_0266_100FABBF7977BF08"/>
breeding can ſcarcely ſubdue? And even when theſe incorrigible talkers are compelled to be ſilent, is it not evident that they are not liſtening to what is ſaid, but are only thinking of what they themſelves ſhall ſay when they can ſeize the firſt lucky interval for which they are ſo narrowly watching?</p>
                     <p>But converſation muſt not be conſidered as a ſtage for the diſplay of our talents, ſo much as a field for the exerciſe and improvement of our virtues; as a means for promoting the glory of our Creator, and the good and happineſs of our fellow creatures. Well-bred and intelligent Chriſtians are not, when they join in ſociety, to conſider themſelves as enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liſts like intellectual prize-fighters, in order to exhibit their own vigour and dexterity, to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit their adverſary, and to bear away the palm of victory. Truth and not triumph ſhould be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and there are few occaſions in life, in which we are more unremittingly called upon to watch our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves narrowly, and to reſiſt the aſſaults of various temptations, than in converſation. Vanity, jealouſy, envy, miſrepreſentation, reſentment, diſdain, levity, impatience, inſincerity, will in turn ſolicit to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. Conſtantly to ſtruggle againſt the deſire of being thought more wiſe, more witty, and more knowing, than thoſe with whom we aſſociate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the inceſſant exertion of Chriſtian vigilance, a vigilance which the generality are ſo far from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037996_0267_100FABC1056C88D8"/>
neceſſary in the intercourſe of common ſociety, that cheerful converſation is rather conſidered as an exemption and releaſe from it, than as an additional obligation to it.</p>
                     <p>But ſociety, as was obſerved before, is not a ſtage on which to throw down our gauntlet, and prove our own proweſs by the number of falls we give to our adverſary; ſo far from it, good breeding as well as Chriſtianity, conſiders as an indiſpenſable requiſite for converſation, the diſpoſition to bring forward to notice any talent in others, which their own modeſty, or conſcious inferiority would lead them to keep back. To do this with effect requires a penetration exerciſed to diſcern merit, and a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous candour which delights in drawing it out. There are few who cannot converſe tolerably on ſome one topic; what that is, we ſhould try to find out, and in general introduce that topic, though to the ſuppreſſion of any one on which we ourſelves are ſuppoſed to excel: and however ſuperior we may be in other reſpects to the perſons in queſtion, we may, perhaps, in that particular point, improve by them; and if we do not gain information, we ſhall at leaſt gain a wholeſome exerciſe to our humility and ſelf-denied; we ſhall be reſtraining our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity; we ſhall, if we take this courſe on juſt occaſions only, and ſo as to beware leſt we gratify the vanity of others, be giving confidence to a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037996_0268_100FABC408A925D8"/>
or cheerfulneſs to a depreſſed ſpirit. And to place a juſt remark, hazarded by the diffident, in the moſt advantageous point of view; to call the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the inattentive, the forward and the ſelf-ſufficient, to ſome quiet perſon in the company, who though of much worth, is perhaps of little note; theſe are requiſites for converſation, leſs brilliant, but far more valuable, than the power of exciting burſts of laughter by the brighteſt wit, or of extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admiration by the moſt poignant ſallies of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule.</p>
                     <p>For wit is of all the qualities of the female mind that which requires the ſevereſt caſtigation; yet the temperate exerciſe of this faſcinating quality throws an additional luſtre round the character of an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woman; for to manage with diſcreet modeſty a dangerous talent, confers a higher praiſe than can be claimed by thoſe in whom the abſence of the talent takes away the temptation to miſemploy it. To wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wit is a peculiarly perilous poſſeſſion, which nothing ſhort of the ſobermindedneſs of Chriſtianity can keep in order. Intemperate wit craves admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as its natural aliment; it lives on flattery as its daily bread. The profeſſed wit is a hungry beggar, that ſubſiſts on the extorted alms of perpetual pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric; and like the vulture in the Grecian fable, its appetite increaſes by indulgence. Simple truth and ſober approbation become taſteleſs and inſipid to the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:037996_0269_100FABC6ABE42908"/>
palate, daily vitiated by the delicious poignancies of exaggerated commendation. Under the above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, however, wit may be ſafely and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed; for <hi>chaſtiſed wit</hi> is an elegant and well-bred, and not unfeminine quality. But <hi>humour,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it degenerate into imitation, or mimicry, is very ſparingly to be ventured on; for it is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult totally to detach it from the ſuſpicion of buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonery, that a woman will be likely to loſe more of that delicacy which is her appropriate grace, than ſhe will gain in the eyes of the judicious, by the moſt ſucceſsful diſplay of humour.</p>
                     <p>But if it be true that ſome women are too apt to affect brilliancy and diſplay in their own diſcourſe, and to undervalue the more humble pretenſions of leſs ſhowy characters; it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that ſome of more ordinary abilities are now and then guilty of the oppoſite error, and fooliſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to value themſelves on not making uſe of the underſtanding they really poſſeſs. They exhibit no ſmall ſatisfaction in ridiculing women of high intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual endowments, while they exclaim with much affected humility, and much real envy, that <q>they are thankful <hi>they</hi> are not geniuſes.</q> Now, though one is glad to hear gratitude expreſſed on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet the want of ſenſe is really no ſuch great mercy to be thankful for; and it would indicate a better ſpirit, were they to pray to be enabled to make
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037996_0270_100FABCA5ACC5DE8"/>
a right uſe of the moderate underſtanding they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, inſtead of expoſing with a viſible pleaſure the imaginary or real defects of their more ſhining ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Women of the brighteſt faculties ſhould not only "bear thoſe faculties meekly," but conſider it as no derogation, cheerfully to fulfil thoſe humbler duties which make up the buſineſs of common life, always taking into the account the higher reſponſibility attached to higher gifts. While women of lower attainments ſhould exert to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſuch abilities as Providence has aſſigned them; and while they ſhould not deride excellencies which are above their reach, they ſhould not deſpond at an inferiority which did not depend on themſelves; nor, becauſe God has denied them ten talents, ſhould they forget that they are equally reſponſible for the one he <hi>has</hi> allotted them, but ſet about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting that one with humble diligence to the glory of the Giver.</p>
                     <p>Vanity, however, is not the monopoly of talents: let not a young lady, therefore, fancy that ſhe is humble, merely becauſe ſhe is not ingenious. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility is not the excluſive privilege of dulneſs. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is as conceited as wit, and ignorance many a time outſtrips knowledge in the race of vanity. Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earneſt competitions ſpring from cauſes leſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to excite them than wit and genius. Vanity inſinuates itſelf into the female heart under a variety
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:037996_0271_100FABCBE6805A90"/>
of unſuſpected forms, and ſeizes on many a little paſs which was not thought worth guarding.</p>
                     <p>Who has not ſeen as reſtleſs emotion agitate the features of an anxious matron, while peace and fame hung trembling in doubtful ſuſpenſe on the ſucceſs of a ſoup or a ſauce, on which ſentence was about to be pronounced by ſome conſummate critic, as could have been excited by any competition for lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary renown, or any ſtruggle for conteſted wit? Nor was the illuſtrious hero of Greece more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually hindered from ſleeping by the trophies of Miltiades, than many a modiſh damſel by the eclipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperiority of ſome newer decoration exhibited by her more ſucceſful friend.</p>
                     <p>There is another ſpecies of vanity in ſome women which diſguiſes itſelf under the thin veil of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected humility; they will accuſe themſelves of ſome fault from which they are remarkably exempt, and lament the want of ſome talent which they are rather notorious for poſſeſſing. This is not only a clumſy trap for praiſe, but there is a diſingenuous intention, by renouncing a quality they eminently poſſeſs, to gain credit for others in which they are really defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. All affectation involves a ſpecies of deceit. The Apoſtle when he enjoins, <q>not to think of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more highly than we ought,</q> does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us to think <hi>falſely</hi> of ourſelves, but to think "ſoberly;" and it is worth obſerving that in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037996_0272_100FABCEDC7E6730"/>
he does not uſe the word <hi>ſpeak,</hi> but <hi>think,</hi> inferring poſſibly, that it would be ſafer to <hi>ſpeak</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of ourſelves or not at all; for it is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unequivocal proof of our humility to talk even of our defects, that while we make <hi>ſelf</hi> the ſubject, in whatever way, ſelf-love contrives to be gratified, and will even be content that our faults ſhould be talked of, rather than that we ſhould not be talked of at all. Some are alſo attacked with ſuch proud fits of humility, that while they are ready to accuſe themſelves of almoſt every ſin in the lump, they yet take fire at the imputation of the ſlighteſt <hi>individual</hi> fault; and inſtantly enter upon their own vindication as warmly as if you and not themſelves, had brought forward the charge. The truth is, they ventured to condemn themſelves, in the full confidence that you would contradict them; the laſt thing they intended was that you ſhould believe them, and they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much piqued and diſappointed as when they are taken at their word.</p>
                     <p>Of the various ſhapes and undefined forms into which vanity branches out in converſation, there is no end. Out of a reſtleſs deſire to pleaſe, grows the ſpurious deſire to aſtoniſh: from vanity as much as from credulity, ariſes that ſtrong love of the marvellous, with which the converſation of the ill-educated abounds. Hence that fondneſs for dealing in narratives hardly within the compaſs of poſſibility.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037996_0273_100FABD2D01825D0"/>
Here vanity has many ſhades of gratification; thoſe ſhades will be ſtronger or weaker, whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later chance to have been an eye-witneſs of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhe recounts; or whether ſhe claim only the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-hand renown of its having happened to her friend, or the ſtill remoter celebrity of its having been witneſſed only by her friend's friend: but even though that friend only knew the man, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the woman, who actually beheld the thing which is now cauſing admiration in the company, ſtill <hi>ſelf,</hi> though in a fainter degree, is brought into notice, and the relater contrives in ſome circuitous way to be connected with the wonder.</p>
                     <p>To correct this propenſity <q>to elevate and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rehearſal.</note>,</q> it would be well in mixed ſociety to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain altogether from hazarding ſtories, which though they may not be abſolutely falſe, yet lying without the verge of probability, are apt to impeach the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the narrator; in whom the very conſciouſneſs that ſhe is not believed, excites an increaſed eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to depart ſtill farther from the ſoberneſs of truth, and induces a habit of vehement aſſeveration, which is too often called in to help out a queſtionable point<note n="†" place="bottom">This is alſo a good rule in compoſition. An event, though it may actually have happened, yet if it be out of the reach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, or contrary to the common courſe of nature, will ſeldom be choſen as a ſubject by a writer of good taſte; for he knows that a probable fiction will intereſt the feelings more than an unlikely truth. Veriſimilitude is indeed the poet's truth, but the truth of the moraliſt is of a more ſturdy growth.</note>.</p>

There is another ſhape, and a very deformed ſhape it is, in which loquacious vanity ſhews itſelf; I mean, the betraying of confidence. Though the act be treacherous, yet the fault, in the firſt inſtance, is not treachery, but vanity. It does not ſo often ſpring from the miſchievous deſire of divulging a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, as from the pride of having been truſted with it. It is the ſecret inclination of mixing <hi>ſelf</hi> with whatever is important. The ſecret would be of little value, if the revealing it did not ſerve to intimate <hi>our</hi> connexion with it; the pleaſure of its having been depoſited with us would be nothing, if others may not know it has been ſo depoſited.—When we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſee the variety of ſerious evils this principle involves, ſhall we perſiſt in aſſerting that vanity is a ſlender miſchief?</p>
                     <p>There is one offence committed in converſation of much too ſerious a nature to be overlooked, or to be animadverted on without ſorrow and indignation: I mean, the habitual and thoughtleſs profaneneſs of thoſe who are repeatedly invoking their Maker's name on occaſions the moſt trivial. It is offenſive in all its variety of aſpects;—it is very pernicious in its <hi>effects;</hi>—it is a <hi>growing</hi> evil;—thoſe who are moſt guilty of it, are from habit hardly conſcious
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037996_0275_100FABD6EF2050D8"/>
when they do it; are not aware of the ſin; and for both theſe reaſons, without the admonitions of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friendſhip, little likely to diſcontinue it.—It is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly INEXCUSABLE;—it has none of the palliatives of <hi>temptation</hi> which other vices plead, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſtands diſtinguiſhed from all others both in its nature and degree of guilt.—Like many other ſins, however, it is at once cauſe and effect; it <hi>proceeds</hi> from want of love and reverence to the beſt of Beings, and <hi>cauſes</hi> that want both in themſelves and others. Yet with all thoſe aggravations, there is, perhaps, hardly any ſin ſo frequently committed, ſo ſeldom repented of, and ſo little guarded againſt. On the ſcore of <hi>impropriety</hi> too, it is additionally offenſive, as being utterly repugnant to female deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, which often affects to be ſhocked at ſwearing in a man. Now this ſpecies of profaneneſs is not only ſwearing, but, perhaps, in ſome reſpects, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the worſt ſort; as it is a <hi>direct</hi> breach of an expreſs command, and offends againſt the <hi>very letter</hi> of that law which ſays in ſo many words, THOU SHALT NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD THY GOD IN VAIN. It offends againſt <hi>delicacy</hi> and <hi>good breeding;</hi> for thoſe who commit it, little think of the pain they are inflicting on the ſober mind, which is deeply wounded when it hears the holy name it loves diſhonoured; and it is as contrary to good
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037996_0276_100FABD98A8F1C18"/>
breeding to give pain as it is to true piety to be profane.</p>
                     <p>I would endeavour to give ſome faint idea of the groſſneſs of this offence, by an analogy (oh! how inadequate!) with which the feeling heart, even though not ſeaſoned with religion, may be touched. To ſuch I would earneſtly ſay:—Suppoſe you had ſome beloved friend,—to put the caſe ſtill more ſtrongly, a departed friend—a revered parent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,—whoſe image never occurs without awaking in your boſom ſentiments of tender love and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; how would you feel if you heard this honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed name <hi>bandied about</hi> with unfeeling familiarity and indecent levity; or at beſt, thruſt into every pauſe of ſpeech as a vulgar expletive? Does not your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate heart recoil at the thought? And yet the hallowed name of your trueſt Benefactor, your heavenly Father, your beſt Friend, who gives you all you enjoy, thoſe very friends in whom you ſo much delight, thoſe very organs with which you diſhonour him, is treated with an irreverence, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, a wantonneſs, with which you cannot bear the very thought or mention of treating a human friend. His name is impiouſly, is unfeelingly, is ungratefully ſingled out as the object of decided irreverence, of ſyſtematic contempt, of thoughtleſs levity. It is uſed indiſcriminately to expreſs anger, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037996_0277_100FABDD92E6DE00"/>
more unpardonable than all, it is wantonly uſed as a mere unmeaning expletive, which, being excited by no emotion, can have nothing to recommend it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be the pleaſure of the ſin.</p>
                     <p>Among the deep, but leſs obvious miſchiefs of converſation, <hi>miſrepreſentation</hi> muſt not be overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Self-love is continually at work, to give to all we ſay a bias in our own favour. The counterac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this fault ſhould be ſet about in the earlieſt ſtages of education. If young perſons have not been diſcouraged in the natural, but evil, propenſity to relate every diſpute they have had with others to their own advantage; if they have not been trained to the duty of doing juſtice even to thoſe with whom they are at variance; if they have not been led to aim at a complete impartiality in their little narratives, and inſtructed never to take advantage of the abſence of the other party, in order to make the ſtory lean to their own ſide more than the truth will admit; how ſhall we in advanced life look for correct habits, for unprejudiced repreſentations, for fidelity, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and unbiaſſed juſtice?</p>
                     <p>Yet, how often in ſociety, otherwiſe reſpectable, are we pained with narrations in which prejudice warps, and ſelf-love blinds! How often do we ſee, that withholding part of a truth anſwers the worſt ends of a falſehood! How often regret the unfair turn given to a buſineſs, by placing a ſentiment in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037996_0278_100FABE02F2ACC70"/>
one point of view, which the ſpeaker had uſed in another! the letter of truth preſerved where its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is violated! a ſuperſtitious exactneſs ſcrupulouſly maintained in the underparts of a detail, in order to impreſs ſuch an idea of integrity as ſhall gain credit, while the leading principle is deſignedly miſtated! nay, a new character given to a fact by a different look, tone, or emphaſis, which alters it as much as words could have done! the falſe impreſſion of a ſermon conveyed, when we do not like the preacher, or when through him we wiſh to make religion it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ridiculous! the avoiding of literal untruths, while the miſchief is better effected by the unfair quotation of a paſſage diveſted of its context! the bringing together detached portions of a ſubject, and making thoſe parts ludicrous, when connected, which were perfect in their diſtinct poſition! the inſidious uſe made of a ſentiment by repreſenting it as the <hi>opinion</hi> of him who had only brought it forward in order to expoſe it! the relating opinions which had merely been put hypothetically, as the avowed principles of him we would diſcredit! that ſubtle falſehood which is ſo made to incorporate with a certain quantity of truth, that the moſt ſkilful moral chemiſt cannot analyſe or ſeparate them! for a good <hi>miſrepreſenter</hi> knows that a ſucceſsful lie muſt have a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of truth, or it will not go down. All that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definable ambiguity and equivocation; all that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037996_0279_100FABE1B8085088"/>
deceit, which is rather implied than expreſſed; thoſe more delicate artifices of the ſchool of Loyola and of Cheſterfield, which allow us when we dare not deny a truth, yet ſo to diſguiſe and diſcolour it, that the truth we relate ſhall not reſemble the truth we heard! Theſe and all the thouſand ſhades of ſimulation and diſſimulation will be carefully guarded againſt in the converſation of vigilant Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is ſurpriſing to mark the common devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſtrict veracity which ſpring, not from enmity to truth, not from intentional deceit, not from malevolence or envy, or the leaſt deſign to injure, but from mere levity, habitual inattention, and a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent notion that it is not worth while to be correct in ſmall things. But here the doctrine of habits comes in with great force, and in that view no error is ſmall. The cure of this diſeaſe in its more inveterate ſtages being next to impoſſible, its prevention ought to be one of the earlieſt objects of education.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Chapter on the Uſe of Definitions.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The grievous fault of groſs and obvious detraction which infects converſation, has been ſo heavily and ſo juſtly condemned by divines and moraliſts, that the ſubject is exhauſted. But there is an error of an oppoſite complexion, which we have before noticed, and againſt which the peculiar temper of the times requires that young ladies of a better caſt ſhould be
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037996_0280_100FABE487C75928"/>
guarded. From the narrowneſs of their own ſphere of obſervation, they are ſometimes addicted to accuſe of uncharitableneſs, that diſtinguiſhing judgment which, reſulting from a ſound penetration and a zeal for truth, forbids perſons of a very correct principle to be indiſcriminately prodigal of commendation without inquiry, and without diſtinction. There is an affectation of candour, which is almoſt as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous as calumny itſelf; nay, if it be leſs injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in its individual application, it is, perhaps, more alarming in its general principle, as it lays waſte the ſtrong fences which ſeparate good from evil. They know (though they ſometimes calumniate) that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny is wrong; but they have not been told that flattery is wrong alſo; and youth, being apt to fancy that the direct contrary to wrong muſt neceſſarily be right, are apt to be driven into violent extremes. The dread of being only ſuſpected of one fault, makes them actually guilty of the other; and to avoid the charge of harſhneſs or of envy, they plunge into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity. In this they are actuated either by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound judgment or an unſound principle.</p>
                     <p>In this age of high-minded independence, when our youth are apt to ſet up for themſelves, and every man is too much diſpoſed to be his own legiſlator without looking, as his ſtandard, to the eſtabliſhed law of the land; and to ſet up for his own divine, without looking to the revealed will of God; by a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037996_0281_100FABE72798F680"/>
candour equally vicious with our vanity, we are alſo complaiſantly led to <hi>give</hi> the latitude we <hi>take:</hi> and it is become too frequent a phraſe in the mouths of our <hi>tolerating</hi> young ladies, when ſpeaking of their more erring and miſled acquaintance, to offer for them this flimſy vindication, <q>that what they do is right if it appear right to <hi>them:</hi>
                        </q>—<q>if <hi>they</hi> ſee the thing in that light, and act up to it with ſincerity, they cannot be materially wrong.</q> But the ſtandard of truth, juſtice, and religion, muſt neither be elevated nor depreſſed, in order to accommodate it to actual circumſtances: it muſt never be lowered to palliate error, to juſtify folly, or to vindicate vice. Good-natured young people often ſpeak favourably of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, or extravagantly of common characters, from one of theſe motives; either their own views of excellence are low, or they ſpeak reſpectfully of the undeſerving, to purchaſe for themſelves the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tenderneſs and generoſity; or they laviſh unſparing praiſe on almoſt all alike, in the uſurious hope of buying back univerſal commendation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; or in thoſe captivating characters in which the ſimple and maſculine language of truth is ſacrificed to the jargon of affected ſoftneſs; and in which ſmooth and pliant manners are ſubſtituted for intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic worth, the inexperienced are too apt to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> virtues, and to <hi>forgive</hi> vices. But they ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guard againſt the error of making <hi>manner</hi> the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037996_0282_100FABEAD6BEBD18"/>
criterion of merit, and of giving unlimited credit to ſtrangers for poſſeſſing every perfection, only becauſe they bring into company the engaging exterior of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring gentleneſs. They ſhould alſo remember that it is an eaſy, but not an honeſt way of obtaining the praiſe of candour, to get into the ſoft and popular habit of ſaying of all their acquaintance, when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, that <hi>they are ſo good!</hi> True Chriſtian candour conceals faults, but it does not invent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. It tenderly forbears to expoſe the evil which may belong to a character, but it dares not aſcribe to it the good which does not exiſt. To correct this propenſity to falſe judgment and inſincerity, it would be well to bear in mind, that while every good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, come from what ſource it may, and every good quality, be it found in whomſoever it will, deſerves its fair proportion of diſtinct and willing commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet no character is GOOD in the true ſenſe of the word which is not RELIGIOUS.</p>
                     <p>In fine—to recapitulate what has been ſaid, with ſome additional hints:—Study to promote both intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual and moral improvement in converſation; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring into it a diſpoſition to bear with others, and to be watchful over yourſelf; keep out of ſight any prominent talent of your own, which, if indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might diſcourage or oppreſs the feeble-minded. If you know any one preſent to poſſeſs any particular weakneſs or infirmity, never exerciſe your wit by
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037996_0283_100FABEC5DF50970"/>
maliciouſly inventing occaſions which may lead her to expoſe or betray it; but give as favourable a turn as you can to the follies which appear, and kindly help her to keep the reſt out of ſight. Never gratify your own humour, by hazarding what you ſuſpect may wound any one preſent in their perſons, connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, profeſſions in life, or religious opinions; and do not forget to examine whether the laugh your wit has raiſed be never bought at this expence. Give credit to thoſe who, without your kindneſs, will get none; do not talk <hi>at</hi> any one whom you dare not talk <hi>to,</hi> unleſs from motives in which the golden rule will bear you out. Seek neither to ſhine nor to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; and if you ſeek to pleaſe, take care that it be in order to convert the influence you may gain by pleaſing to the good of others. Cultivate true polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for it grows out of true principle, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Goſpel of Chriſt; but avoid thoſe feigned attentions which are not ſtimulated by good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and thoſe ſtated profeſſions of fondneſs which are not dictated by eſteem. Remember, that the praiſe of being thought <hi>amiable</hi> by ſtrangers, may be bought too dear, if it be bought at the expence of truth and ſimplicity: remember, that Simplicity is the firſt charm in manner, as Truth is in mind; and could Truth make herſelf viſible, ſhe would appear inveſted in Simplicity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:037996_0284_100FABF07077B700"/>
Remember alſo, that true good nature is the ſoul, of which politeneſs is only the garb. It is not that artificial quality which is taken up by many when they go into ſociety, in order to charm thoſe whom it is not their particular buſineſs to pleaſe; and is laid down when they return home to thoſe to whom to appear amiable is a real duty. It is not that faſcinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but deceitful ſoftneſs, which, after having acted over a hundred ſcenes of the moſt lively ſympathy and tender intereſt with every ſlight acquaintance; after having exhauſted every phraſe of feeling, for the trivial ſickneſſes or petty ſorrows of multitudes who are ſcarcely known, leaves it doubtful whether a grain of real feeling or genuine ſympathy be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the deareſt connections; and which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes a woman to her immediate friends with little affection, and to her own family with little attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>True good nature, that which alone deſerves the name, is not a holiday ornament, but an every-day habit. It does not conſiſt in ſervile complaiſance, or diſhoneſt flattery, or affected ſympathy, or unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied aſſent, or unwarrantable compliance, or eternal ſmiles. Before it can be allowed to rank with the virtues, it muſt be wrought up from a humour into a principle, from an occaſional diſpoſition into a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. It muſt be the reſult of an equal and well-governed mind, not the ſtart of caſual <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037996_0285_100FAC1A9433AD38"/>
trick of deſigning vanity, or the whim of capricious fondneſs. It is compounded of kindneſs, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, forgiveneſs, and ſelf-denial; <q>it ſeeketh not its own,</q> but muſt be capable of making continual ſacrifices of its own taſtes, humours, and ſelf-love; but among the ſacrifices it makes, it muſt never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude its integrity. Politeneſs on the one hand, and inſenſibility on the other, aſſume its name and wear its honours; but they aſſume the honours of a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, without the merit of a victory; for polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſubdues nothing, and inſenſibility has nothing to ſubdue. Good nature of the true caſt, and under the foregoing regulations, is above all price in the common intercourſe of domeſtic ſociety; for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary quality, which is conſtantly brought into action by the perpetually recurring though minute events of daily life, is of higher value than more brilliant qualities which are more ſeldom called into uſe. And, indeed, Chriſtianity has given that new turn to the character of all the virtues, that perhaps it is the beſt teſt of the excellence of many that they have little brilliancy in them. The Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has degraded ſome ſplendid qualities from the rank they held, and elevated thoſe which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure into diſtinction.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>On the danger of an ill-directed Senſibility.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN conſidering the human character with a view to its improvement, it is prudent to endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the natural bent of the mind, and having found it, to direct your force againſt that ſide on which the warp lies, that you may leſſen by counteraction the defect which you might be promoting, by applying your aid in a contrary direction. But the misfortune is, people who mean better than they judge, are apt to take up a ſet of general rules, good perhaps in themſelves, and originally gleaned from experience and obſervation on the nature of human things, but not applicable in all caſes. Theſe rules they keep by them as noſtrums of univerſal efficacy, which they therefore often bring out for uſe in caſes to which they do not apply. For to make any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy effectual, it is not enough to know the medicine, you muſt ſtudy the conſtitution alſo; if there be not a congruity between the two, you may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring one patient by the means which are requiſite to raiſe and reſtore another, whoſe temperament is of a contrary deſcription.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="unknown:037996_0287_100FABF3413BA898"/>
It is of importance in forming the female charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thoſe on whom this taſk devolves ſhould poſſeſs ſo much penetration as accurately to diſcern the degree of ſenſibility, and ſo much judgment as to accommodate the treatment to the individual charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. By conſtantly ſtimulating and extolling feelings naturally quick, thoſe feelings will be rendered too acute and irritable. On the other hand, a calm and equable temper will become obtuſe by the total want of excitement; the former treatment converts the feelings into a ſource of error, agitation and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the latter ſtarves their native energy, deadens the affections, and produces a cold, dull, ſelfiſh ſpirit; for the human mind is an inſtrument which will loſe its ſweetneſs if ſtrained too high, and will be deprived of its tone and ſtrength if not ſufficiently, raiſed.</p>
                     <p>It is cruel to chill the precious ſenſibility of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous ſoul, by treating with ſupercilious coldneſs and unfeeling ridicule every indication of a warm, tender, diſintereſted, and enthuſiaſtic ſpirit, as if it exhibited ſymptoms of a deficiency in underſtanding or prudence. How many are apt to intimate, with a ſmile of mingled pity and contempt, that when ſuch a one knows the world, that is, in other words, when ſhe ſhall be grown cunning, ſelfiſh, and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſhe will be aſhamed of her preſent glow of honeſt warmth, and of her lovely ſuſceptibility of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037996_0288_100FABF4C8666400"/>
heart. May ſhe never know the world, if the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it muſt be acquired at ſuch an expence! But to ſenſible hearts, every indication of genuine feeling will be dear, for they will know that it is this temper which, by the guidance of the Divine ſpirit, may make her one day become more enamoured of the beauty of holineſs; which, with the co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of principle, and under its direction, will render her the lively agent of Providence in diminiſhing the miſery that is in the world; into which miſery this temper will give her a quicker intuition than colder characters poſſeſs. It is this temper which, when it is touched and purified by a <q>live coal from the altar,</q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah, vi. 6.</note> will give her a keener taſte for the ſpirit of religion, and a quicker zeal in diſcharging its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But let it be remembered likewiſe, that as there is no quality in the female character which will be ſo likely to endanger the peace, and to expoſe the virtue of the poſſeſſor; ſo there is none which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to have its luxuriances more carefully watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and its wild ſhoots more cloſely lopped.</p>
                     <p>For young women of affections naturally warm, but not carefully diſciplined, are in danger of incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an unnatural irritability; and while their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs falls a victim to the exceſs of uncontrolled feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they are liable at the ſame time to indulge a
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037996_0289_100FABF7697C29B8"/>
vanity of all others the moſt prepoſterous, that of being vain of their very defect. They have heard ſenſibility highly commended, without having heard any thing of thoſe bounds and fences which were intended to confine it, and without having been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with that principle which would have given it a beneficial direction; conſcious that they poſſeſs the quality itſelf in the extreme, and not aware that they want all that makes that quality ſafe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, they plunge headlong into thoſe ſins and miſeries from which they conceitedly imagine, that not principle but coldneſs has preſerved the more ſober-minded and well-inſtructed of their ſex.</p>
                     <p>But as it would be foreign to the preſent deſign to expatiate on thoſe criminal exceſſes which are ſome of the ſad effects of ungoverned paſſion, it is only intended here to hazard a few remarks on thoſe lighter conſequences of it, which conſiſt in the loſs of comfort without ruin of character, and the privation of much of the happineſs of life without involving any very cenſurable degree of guilt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit. Let it, however, be incidentally remarked, and let it be carefully remembered, that if no women have riſen ſo high in the ſcale of moral excellence as thoſe whoſe natural warmth has been conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly governed by its true guide, and directed to its true end; ſo none have furniſhed ſuch deplorable inſtances of extreme depravity as thoſe who, through
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037996_0290_100FABFB1E32E560"/>
the ignorance or the dereliction of principle, have been abandoned by the exceſs of this very temper to the violence of ungoverned paſſions and uncontrolled inclinations. Perhaps, if we were to inquire into the remote cauſe of ſome of the blackeſt crimes which ſtain the annals of mankind, profligacy, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and eſpecially ſuicide, we might trace them back to this original principle, an ungoverned Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all the fine theories in proſe and verſe to which this topic has given birth, it will be found that very exquiſite ſenſibility contributes ſo little to <hi>happineſs,</hi> and may yet be made to contribute ſo much to <hi>uſefulneſs,</hi> that it may, perhaps, be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as beſtowed for an exerciſe to the poſſeſſor's own virtue, and as a keen inſtrument with which ſhe may better work for the good of others.</p>
                     <p>Women of this caſt of mind are leſs careful to avoid the charge of unbounded extremes, than to eſcape at all events the imputation of inſenſibility. They are little alarmed at the danger of <hi>exceeding,</hi> though terrified at the ſuſpicion of <hi>coming ſhort,</hi> of what they take to be the extreme point of feeling. They will even reſolve to prove the warmth of their ſenſibility, though at the expence of their judgment, and ſometimes alſo of their juſtice. Even when they earneſtly deſire to <hi>be</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> right, they are apt to employ the wrong inſtrument to accompliſh the right
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037996_0291_100FABFCE4C577A8"/>
end. They employ the paſſions to do the work of the judgment; forgetting, or not knowing, that the paſſions were not given us to be uſed in the ſearch and diſcovery of truth, which is the office of a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more diſcriminating faculty; but that they were given to animate us to warmer zeal in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and practice of truth, when the judgment ſhall have pointed out what <hi>is</hi> truth.</p>
                     <p>Through this natural warmth, which they have been juſtly told is ſo pleaſing, but which, perhaps, they have not been told will be continually expoſing them to peril and to ſuffering, their joys and ſorrows are exceſſive. Of this extreme irritability, as was before remarked, the ill-educated learn to boaſt as if it were a decided indication of ſuperiority of ſoul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of labouring to reſtrain it as the exceſs of a temper which ceaſes to be amiable, when it is no longer under the control of the governing faculty. It is misfortune enough to be born more liable to ſuffer and to ſin, from this conformation of mind; it is too much to nouriſh the evil by unreſtrained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; it is ſtill worſe to be proud of ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading a quality.</p>
                     <p>Flippancy, impetuoſity, reſentment, and violence of ſpirit, grow out of this diſpoſition, which will be rather promoted than corrected, by the ſyſtem of education on which we have been animadverting; in which ſyſtem, emotions are too early and too much
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037996_0292_100FAC00CF1F42F8"/>
excited, and taſtes and feelings are conſidered as too excluſively making up the whole of the female cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: in which the judgment is little exerciſed, the reaſoning powers are ſeldom brought into action, and ſelf-knowledge and ſelf-denial ſcarcely included.</p>
                     <p>The propenſity of mind which we are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if unchecked, lays its poſſeſſors open to unjuſt prepoſſeſſions, and expoſes them to all the danger of unfounded attachments. In early youth, not only love at firſt ſight, but alſo friendſhip, of the ſame ſudden growth, ſprings up from an ill-directed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; and in after-life, women under the powerful influence of this temper, conſcious that they have much to be borne with, are too readily inclined to ſelect for their confidential connections, flexible and flattering companions, who will indulge and perhaps admire their faults, rather than firm and honeſt friends, who will reprove and would aſſiſt in curing them. We may adopt it as a general maxim, that an obliging, weak, yielding, complaiſant friend, full of ſmall attentions, with little religion, little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and much natural acquieſcence and civility, is a moſt dangerous, though generally a too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired confidante: ſhe ſoothes the indolence, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the vanity of her friend, by reconciling her to her faults, while ſhe neither keeps the underſtanding nor the virtues of that friend in exerciſe; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds from her every uſeful truth, which by opening
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037996_0293_100FAC0365A3E128"/>
her eyes might give her pain. Theſe obſequious qualities are the "ſoft green"<note n="*" place="bottom">Burke's "Sublime and Beautiful."</note> on which the ſoul loves to repoſe itſelf. But it is not a refreſhing or a wholeſome repoſe: we ſhould not ſelect, for the ſake of preſent eaſe a ſoothing flatterer, who will lull us into a pleaſing oblivion of our failings, but a friend, who, valuing our ſoul's health above our immediate comfort, will rouſe us from torpid indulgence to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, vigilance, and virtue.</p>
                     <p>An ill-directed ſenſibility alſo leads a woman to be injudicious and eccentric in her <hi>charities;</hi> ſhe will be in danger of proportioning her bounty to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effect which the diſtreſſed object produces on her ſenſes: and ſhe will be more liberal to a ſmall diſtreſs preſenting itſelf to her own eyes, than to the more preſſing wants and better claims of thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of which ſhe only hears the relation. There is a ſort of ſtage effect which ſome people require for their charities; ſhe will be apt alſo to deſire, that the object of her compaſſion ſhall have ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and amiable in it, ſuch as ſhall furniſh pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing images and lively pictures to her imagination, and engaging ſubjects for deſcription; forgetting, that in her charities, as well as in every thing elſe, ſhe is to be a "follower of Him who pleaſed not himſelf;" forgetting, that the moſt coarſe and diſguſting object
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037996_0294_100FAC05433F40C8"/>
is as much the repreſentative of Him, who ſaid, <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ye do it to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye do it unto me,</q> as the moſt intereſting: nay the more uninviting and repulſive caſes may be better teſts of the principle on which we relieve, than thoſe which abound in pathos and intereſt, as we can have leſs ſuſpicion of our motive in the latter caſe than in the former. But, while we ought to neglect neither of theſe ſuppoſed caſes, yet the leſs our feelings are caught by pleaſing circumſtances, the leſs will be the danger of our indulging ſelf-complacency, and the more likely ſhall we be to do what we do for the ſake of Him who has taught us, that no deeds but what are performed on that principle, <q>ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed at the reſurrection of the juſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But through the want of that governing principle which ſhould direct her ſenſibility, a tender-hearted woman, whoſe hand, if ſhe be actually ſurrounded with ſcenes and circumſtances to call it into action, is
<q>
                           <l>Open as day to melting charity;</l>
                        </q>
nevertheleſs may utterly fail in the great and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive duty of Chriſtian love, for ſhe has feelings which are acted upon ſolely by local circumſtances and preſent events. Only remove her into another ſcene, diſtant from the wants ſhe has been relieving; place her in the lap of indulgence, ſo entrenched with eaſe and pleaſure, ſo immerſed in the ſoftneſs of life, that diſtreſs no longer finds any acceſs to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037996_0295_100FAC07E9A35510"/>
but through the faint and dull medium of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant repreſentation; remove her from the ſight and ſound of that miſery which, when preſent, ſo tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected her—ſhe now forgets that miſery exiſts; as ſhe hears but little, and ſees nothing of want and ſorrow, ſhe is ready to fancy that the world is grown happier than it was: in the meantime, with a quiet conſcience and a thoughtleſs vanity, ſhe has been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing on ſuperfluities that money which ſhe would cheerfully have given to a charitable caſe, had ſhe not forgotten that any ſuch were in exiſtence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Pleaſure</hi> had blocked up the avenues through which miſery uſed to find its way to her heart; and now, when again ſuch a caſe forces itſelf into her preſence, ſhe laments with real ſincerity that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is gone which ſhould have relieved it.</p>
                     <p>In the meantime, perhaps, other women of leſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſympathy, but whoſe ſympathies are under bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regulation, or who act from a principle which requires little ſtimulus, have, by an habitual courſe of ſelf-denial, by a conſtant determination to refuſe themſelves unneceſſary indulgences, and by guarding againſt that diſſolving PLEASURE which melts down the firmeſt virtue that allows itſelf to baſk in its beams, have been quietly furniſhing a regular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for miſeries, which their knowledge of the ſtate of the world teaches them are every where to be found, and which their obedience to the will of God
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037996_0296_100FAC0B9F150800"/>
tells them it is their duty both to find out and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; a general expectation of being liable to be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon for acts of charity, will lead the conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly charitable always to be prepared.</p>
                     <p>On ſuch a mind as we have been deſcribing, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> alſo will operate with peculiar force, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than in the article of charity. Old eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed inſtitutions, whoſe continued exiſtence muſt depend on the continued bounty of that affluence to which they owed their origin, will be ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, as preſenting no variety to the imagination, as having by their uniformity ceaſed to be intereſting, there is now a total failure of thoſe ſprings of mere ſenſitive feeling which ſet the charity a-going, and thoſe ſudden emotions of tenderneſs and guſts of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which once were felt, muſt now be excited by newer forms of diſtreſs.—As age comes on, that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which has been the effect of mere feeling, grows cold and rigid, on account alſo of its having been often diſappointed in its high expectations of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and ſubſequent merit of thoſe it has relieved; and by withdrawing its bounty, becauſe ſome of its objects have been undeſerving, it gives clear proof that what it beſtowed was for its own gratification; and now finding that ſelf-complacency at an end, it beſtows no longer. Probably too the cauſe of ſo much diſappointment may have been, that ill choice of the objects to which feeling, rather than a diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037996_0297_100FAC0D2751A898"/>
judgment has led. The ſummer ſhowers of mere ſenſibility ſoon dry up, while the living ſpring of Chriſtian charity flows alike in all ſeaſons.</p>
                     <p>The impatience, levity, and fickleneſs, of which women have been ſomewhat too generally accuſed, are perhaps in no ſmall degree aggravated by the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and frivolouſneſs of female purſuits. The ſort of education they commonly receive, teaches girls to ſet a great price on ſmall things. Beſides this, they do not always learn to keep a very correct ſcale of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees for rating the value of the objects of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and attachment; but by a kind of unconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous idolatry, they rather make a merit of loving <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely</hi> things and perſons which ought to be loved with moderation and in a ſubordinate degree the one to the other. Unluckily, they conſider moderation as ſo neceſſarily indicating a cold heart and narrow ſoul, and they look upon a ſtate of indifference with ſo much horror, that either to love or hate with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy is ſuppoſed by them to proceed from a higher ſtate of mind than is poſſeſſed by more ſteady and equable characters. Whereas it is in fact the crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion of a warm but well-directed ſenſibility, that while it is capable of loving with energy, it muſt be enabled, by the judgment which governs it, to ſuit and adjuſt its degree of intereſt to the nature and excellence of the object about which it is intereſted; for unreaſonable prepoſſeſſion, diſproportionate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037996_0298_100FAC0FC767DBD8"/>
and capricious or precarious fondneſs, is not ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>Exceſſive but unintentional <hi>flattery</hi> is another fault into which a ſtrong ſenſibility is in danger of leading its poſſeſſor. A tender heart and a warm imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſpire to throw a ſort of radiance round the object of their love, till people are dazzled by a brightneſs of their own creating. The worldly and faſhionable borrow the warm language of ſenſibility without having the really warm feeling; and young ladies get ſuch a habit of ſaying, and eſpecially of writing, ſuch over obliging and flattering things to each other, that this mutual politeneſs, aided by the ſelf-love ſo natural to us all, and by an unwillingneſs to ſearch into our own hearts, keeps up the illuſion, and we get a habit of taking our character from the good we <hi>hear</hi> of ourſelves, which others aſſume, but do not very well know, rather than from the evil we <hi>feel</hi> in ourſelves, and which we therefore ought to be thoroughly acquainted with.</p>
                     <p>Ungoverned ſenſibility is apt to give a wrong direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its anxieties; and its affection often falls ſhort of the true end of friendſhip. If the object of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard happen to be ſick, what inquiries! what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions! what an accumulation is made of caſes in which the remedy its fondneſs ſuggeſts has been ſucceſsful! What an unaffected tenderneſs for the periſhing body! Yet is this ſenſibility equally alive
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037996_0299_100FAC13CD437E18"/>
to the immortal intereſts of the ſufferer? Is it not ſilent and at eaſe when it contemplates the deareſt friend perſiſting in opinions eſſentially dangerous; in practices unqueſtionably wrong? Does it not view all this, not only without a generous ardour to point out the peril, and reſcue the friend; but if that friend be ſuppoſed to be dying, does it not even make it the <hi>criterion</hi> of kindneſs to let her die undeceived? What a want of true ſenſibility, to feel for the pain, but not for the danger of thoſe we love! Now ſee what ſort of ſenſibility the Bible teaches! <q>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke him, and ſhalt not ſuffer ſin upon him<note n="*" place="bottom">Leviticus, xix. 17.</note>.</q> But let that tenderneſs which ſhrinks from the idea of expoſing what it loves to a momentary pang, figure to itſelf the bare poſſibility, that the object of its own fond affection may not be the object of its own fond affection may not be the object of the Divine favour! Let it ſhrink from the bare conjecture, that <q>the familiar friend with whom it has taken ſweet counſel,</q> is going down to the gates of death, unrepenting, unprepared, and yet unwarned.</p>
                     <p>But mere human ſenſibility goes a ſhorter way to work. Not being able to give its friend the pain of hearing her faults or of knowing her danger, it works itſelf up into the quieting deluſion that no
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:037996_0300_100FAC16647FE710"/>
danger exiſts, at leaſt not for the objects of its own affection; it gratifies itſelf by inventing a ſalvation ſo comprehenſive as ſhall take in all itſelf loves with all their faults; it creates to its own fond heart an ideal and exaggerated divine mercy, which ſhall pardon and receive all in whom this blind ſenſibility has an intereſt, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</p>
                     <p>In regard to its application to religious purpoſes, it is a teſt that ſenſibility has received its true directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when it is ſupremely turned to the love of God: for to poſſeſs an overflowing fondneſs for our fellow-creatures and fellow-ſinners, and to be cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the Eſſence of goodneſs and perfection, is an inconſiſtency to which the feeling heart is awfully liable. God has himſelf the firſt claim to the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility he beſtowed. "He <hi>firſt</hi> loved us:" this is a <hi>natural</hi> cauſe of love, <q>He loved us while we were ſinners:</q> this is a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> cauſe. He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to love us though we neglect his favours, and ſlight his mercies: this would wear out any earthly kindneſs. He forgives us, not petty neglects, not occaſional ſlights, but grievous ſins, repeated offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, broken vows, and unrequited love. What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man friendſhip performs offices ſo calculated to touch the ſoul of ſenſibility?</p>
                     <p>Thoſe young women in whom feeling is indulged to the excluſion of reaſon and examination, are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037996_0301_100FAC17EC060CD0"/>
liable to be the dupes of prejudice, raſh deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and falſe judgment. The underſtanding hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but little power over the will, their affections are not well poized, and their minds are kept in a ſtate ready to be acted upon by the fluctuations of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate impulſes; by ſudden and varying impreſſions; by caſual and contradictory circumſtances; and by emotions excited by every accident. Inſtead of being guided by the broad views of general truth, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one fixed principle, they are driven on by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of the moment. And this impetuoſity blinds the judgment as much as it miſleads the conduct; ſo that for want of a habit of cool inveſtigation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, they meet every event without any previouſly formed opinion or rule of action. And as they do not accuſtom themſelves to appreciate the real value of things, their attention is as likely to be led away by the under parts of a ſubject, as to ſeize on the leading feature. The ſame eagerneſs of mind which hinders the operation of the diſcriminating faculty, leads alſo to the error of determining on the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an action by its ſucceſs, and to that of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the event of an undertaking decide on its juſtice or propriety: it alſo leads to that ſuperficial and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous way of judging which faſtens on exceptions, if they make in one's own favour, as grounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, while they lead us to overlook received and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037996_0302_100F7C6BC7D93760"/>
general rules which tend to eſtabliſh a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>Open-hearted, indiſcreet girls, often pick up a few ſtrong notions, which are as falſe in themſelves as they are popular among the claſs in queſtion: ſuch as, "that warm friends muſt make warm enemies;"—that <q>the generous love and hate with all their hearts;</q>—that <q>a reformed rake makes the beſt huſband;</q>—that <q>there is no medium in marriage, but that it is a ſtate of exquiſite happineſs or exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite miſery;</q> with many other doctrines of equal currency and equal ſoundneſs! Theſe they conſider as axioms, and adopt as rules of life. From the two firſt of theſe oracular ſayings, girls are in no ſmall danger of becoming unjuſt through the very warmth of their hearts: for they will get a habit of making their eſtimate of the good or ill qualities of others, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in proportion to the greater or leſs degree of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they themſelves have received from them. Their eſtimation of general character is thus formed on inſulated and partial grounds; on the accidental circumſtance of perſonal predilection or perſonal pique. Kindneſs to themſelves or their friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves all poſſible excellence; neglect, all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defects. Friendſhip and gratitude can and ſhould go a great way; but as they cannot convert vice into into virtue, ſo they ought never to convert truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to falſehood. And it may be the more neceſſary to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037996_0303_100FAC1D2EEBDF10"/>
be upon our guard in this inſtance, becauſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idea of gratitude may miſlead us, by converting injuſtice, into the ſemblance of a virtue. Warm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſhould therefore be limited to the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſenſe of our own individual obligations which are real, rather than employed to give an impreſſion of general excellence in the perſon who has obliged us, which may be imaginary. A good man is ſtill good, though it may not have fallen in his way to oblige or ſerve <hi>us,</hi> nay, though he may have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or even unintentionally hurt us: and ſin is ſtill ſin, though committed by the perſon in the world to whom we are the moſt obliged, and whom we moſt love.</p>
                     <p>We come next to that fatal and moſt indelicate, nay groſs maxim, that <q>a reformed rake makes the beſt huſband;</q> an aphoriſm to which the principles and the happineſs of ſo many young women have been ſacrificed. It goes upon the prepoſterous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, not only that effects do not follow cauſes, but that they oppoſe them; on the ſuppoſition, that habitual vice creates rectitude of character, and that ſin produces happineſs: thus flatly contradicting what the moral government of God uniformly exhibits in the courſe of human events, and what Revelation ſo evidently and univerſally teaches.</p>
                     <p>For it ſhould be obſerved, that the reformation is generally, if not always ſuppoſed to be brought about
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:037996_0304_100FAC20E6B94CB0"/>
by the all-conquering force of female charms. Let but a profligate young man have a point to carry by winning the affections of a vain and thoughtleſs girl; he will begin his attack upon her heart by undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her religious principles, and artfully removing every impediment which might have obſtructed her receiving the addreſſes of a man without character. And while he will lead her not to hear without ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule the mention of that change of heart which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teaches and experience proves the power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace can work on a vicious character; while he will teach her to ſneer at a change which he would treat with contempt, becauſe he denies the poſſibility of ſo ſtrange and miraculous a converſion; yet he will not ſcruple to ſwear, that the power of her beauty has worked a revolution in his own looſe practices which is equally complete and inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing it poſſible that his reformation were genuine, it would even then by no means involve the truth of her propoſition, that paſt libertiniſm inſures future felicity; yet many a weak girl, confirmed in this palatable doctrine by examples ſhe has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired of thoſe ſurpriſing reformations ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently effected in the laſt ſcene of moſt of our come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, has not ſcrupled to riſk her earthly and eternal happineſs with a man, who is not aſhamed to aſcribe to the influence of her beauty that power of changing
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:037996_0305_100FAC23847163E0"/>
the heart which he impiouſly denies to Omnipotence itſelf.</p>
                     <p>As to the laſt of theſe practical aphoriſms, that <q>there is no medium in marriage, but that it is a ſtate of exquiſite happineſs or exquiſite miſery;</q> this, though not equally ſinful, is equally deluſive: for marriage is only one modification of human life, and human life is not commonly in itſelf a ſtate of exquiſite extremes; but is for the moſt part that mixed and moderate ſtate, ſo naturally dreaded by thoſe who ſet out with fancying this world a ſtate of rapture, and ſo naturally expected by thoſe who know it to be a ſtate of probation and diſcipline. Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, therefore, is only one condition, and often the beſt condition of that imperfect ſtate of being which, though ſeldom very exquiſite, is often very tolerable; and which may yield much comfort to thoſe who do not look for conſtant tranſport. But unfortunately, thoſe who find themſelves diſappointed of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing raptures they had anticipated in marriage, diſdaining to ſit down with ſo poor a proviſion as comfort, and ſcorning the acceptance of that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate lot which Providence commonly beſtows with a view to check deſpondency and to repreſs preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; give themſelves up to the other alternative; and, by abandoning their hearts to diſcontent, make to themſelves that miſery with which their fervid ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations had filled the oppoſite ſcale.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:037996_0306_100FAC2669307AB8"/>
The truth is, theſe young ladies are very apt to pick up their opinions, leſs from the divines than the poets; and the poets, though it muſt be confeſſed they are ſome of the beſt embelliſhers of life, are not <hi>quite</hi> the ſafeſt conductors through it: for in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling through a wilderneſs, though we avail our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the harmony of ſinging-birds to render the grove delightful, yet we never think of following them as guides to conduct us through its labyrinths.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe women, in whom the natural defects of a warm temper have been ſtrengthened by an education which foſters their faults, are very dextrous in avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves of a hint, when it favours a ruling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, ſooths vanity, indulges indolence, or grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies their love of power. They have heard ſo often from their favourite ſentimental authors, and their more flattering male friends, <q>that when Nature denied them ſtrength, ſhe gave them faſcinating graces in compenſation; that their ſtrength con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in their weakneſs;</q> and that <q>they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with arts of perſuaſion which ſupply the abſence of force, and the place of reaſon;</q> that they learn, in time, to pride themſelves on that very weakneſs, and to become vain of their imperfections; till at length they begin to claim for their defects, not only pardon, but admiration. Hence they get to cheriſh a ſpecies of feeling which, if not checked, terminates in exceſſive ſelfiſhneſs; they learn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037996_0307_100FAC29598DA810"/>
their inability to bear contradiction as a proof of their tenderneſs; and to indulge in that ſort of irritability in all that relates to themſelves, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably leads to the utter excluſion of all intereſt in the ſufferings of others. Inſtead of exerciſing their ſenſibility in the wholeſome duty of relieving diſtreſs and viſiting ſcenes of ſorrow, that ſenſibility itſelf is pleaded as a reaſon for their not being able to endure ſights of wo, and for ſhunning the diſtreſs it ſhould be exerted in removing. That exquiſite ſenſe of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which God implanted in the heart as a ſtimulus to quicken us in relieving the miſeries of others, is thus introverted, and learns to conſider <hi>ſelf</hi> not as the agent, but the object of compaſſion. Tenderneſs is made an excuſe for being hard-hearted; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of drying the weeping eyes of others, this falſe delicacy reſerves its ſelfiſh tears for the more elegant and leſs expenſive ſorrows of the melting novel or the pathetic tragedy.</p>
                     <p>When feeling ſtimulates only to ſelf-indulgence; when the more exquiſite affections of ſympathy and pity evaporate in ſentiment, inſtead of flowing out in active charity, and affording aſſiſtance, protection, or conſolation to every ſpecies of diſtreſs; it is an evidence that the feeling is of a ſpurious kind; and inſtead of being nouriſhed as an amiable tenderneſs, it ſhould be ſubdued as a fond and baſe ſelf-love.</p>

That idleneſs, to whoſe cruel inroads many women of fortune are unhappily expoſed, from not having been trained to conſider wholeſome occupation, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertion, and ſyſtematic employment, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the indiſpenſable duties of life, lays them open to a thouſand evils of this kind, from which the uſeful and the buſy are exempted: and, perhaps, it would not be eaſy to find a more pitiable object than a woman with a great deal of time and a great deal of money on her hands, who, never having been taught the conſcientious uſe of either, ſquanders both at random, or rather moulders both away, without plan, without principle, and without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; all whoſe projects begin and terminate in ſelf: who conſiders the reſt of the world only as they may be ſubſervient to her gratification; and to whom it never occurred, that both her time and money were given for the gratification and good of others.</p>
                     <p>It is not much to the credit of the other ſex, that they now and then lend themſelves to the indulgence of this ſelfiſh ſpirit in their wives, and cheriſh by a kind of falſe fondneſs thoſe faults which ſhould be combated by good ſenſe and a reaſonable counterac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſlothfully preferring a little falſe peace, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of precarious quiet, and the reputation of good nature, to the higher duty of forming the mind, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principles, and ſtrengthening the character of

her with whom they are connected. Perhaps too, a little vanity in the huſband helps out his good nature; he ſecretly rewards himſelf for his ſacrifice by the conſciouſneſs of his ſuperiority; he feels a ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in his patient condeſcenſion to her weakneſs, which tacitly flatters his own ſtrength: and he is, as it were, paid for ſtooping by the increaſed ſenſe of his own tallneſs. Seeing alſo, perhaps, but little of other women, he gets to believe that they are all pretty much alike, and that, as a man of ſenſe, he muſt content himſelf with what he takes to be the common lot. Whereas, in truth, by his miſplaced indulgence, he has rather <hi>made</hi> his own lot than <hi>drawn</hi> it; and thus, through an indolent deſpair in the huſband of being able to effect any improvement by oppoſition, it happens, that many a helpleſs, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and daudling wife acquires a more powerful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendancy than the moſt diſcreet and amiable woman; and that the moſt abſolute female tyranny is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe ſickly and capricious humours.</p>
                     <p>The poets again, who, to do them juſtice, are always ready to lend a helping hand when any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is to be done, have contributed their full ſhare towards confirming theſe feminine follies: they have ſtrengthened by adulatory maxims, ſung in ſeducing ſtrains, thoſe faults which their talents and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence ſhould have been employed in correcting.

                     </argument>
                     <p>PERHAPS the intereſts of true friendſhip, elegant converſation, mental improvement, ſocial pleaſure, maternal duty, and conjugal comfort, never received ſuch a blow as when Faſhion iſſued out that arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and univerſal decree, that <hi>every body muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with every body;</hi> together with that conſequent, authoritative, but rather inconvenient clauſe, that <hi>every body muſt alſo go every where every night.</hi> The devout obedience paid to this law is incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the very being of friendſhip; for as the circle of acquaintance expands, and it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expanding, the affections will be beaten out into ſuch thin lamina as to leave little ſolidity remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The heart which is continually exhauſting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in profeſſions grows cold and hard. The feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of kindneſs diminiſh in proportion as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it becomes more diffuſe and indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. The very traces of <q>ſimplicity and godly ſincerity</q> in a delicate female, wear away imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly by conſtant colliſion with the world at large. And perhaps no woman takes ſo little intereſt in the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037996_0314_100FAC3AADDB6140"/>
happineſs of her real friends, as ſhe whoſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are inceſſantly evaporating in univerſal civilities; as ſhe who is ſaying fond and flattering things at random to a circle of five hundred people every night.</p>
                     <p>The decline and fall of animated and inſtructive converſation has been in a good meaſure effected by this barbarous project of aſſembling <hi>en maſſe.</hi> An excellent prelate,<note n="*" place="bottom">The late Biſhop of Horne.</note> with whoſe friendſhip the author was long honoured, and who himſelf excelled in the art of converſation, uſed to remark, that a few years had brought about a great revolution in the manners of ſociety; that it uſed to be the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, previouſly to going into company, to think that ſomething was to be communicated or received, taught or learnt; that the powers of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were expected to be brought into exerciſe, and that it was therefore neceſſary to quicken the mind, by reading and thinking, for the ſhare the individual might be expected to take in the general diſcourſe; but that knowledge, and taſte, and wit, and erudition, ſeemed now to be ſcarcely conſidered as neceſſary materials to be brought into the pleaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commerce of the world; becauſe now there was little chance of turning them to much account; and therefore he who poſſeſſed them, and he who poſſeſſed them not, were nearly on a footing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="unknown:037996_0315_100FAC3D537CA9A8"/>
It is obvious alſo that multitudinous aſſemblies are ſo little favourable to that <hi>cheerfulneſs</hi> which it ſhould ſeem to be their very end to promote, that if there were any chemical proceſs by which the quantum of ſpirits animal or intellectual could be aſcertained, the diminution would be found to have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably great, ſince the transformation of man and woman from a ſocial to a gregarious animal.</p>
                     <p>But if it be true that friendſhip, ſociety, and cheerfulneſs, have ſuſtained ſo much injury by this change of manners, how much more pointedly does the remark apply to family happineſs!</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the known fluctuation of manners and the mutability of language, could it be foreſeen, when the Apoſtle Paul exhorted <q>married women to be keepers <hi>at home,</hi>
                        </q> that the time would arrive when that very phraſe would be ſelected to deſignate one of the moſt decided acts of diſſipation? Could it be foreſeen that when a fine lady ſhould ſend out a notification that on ſuch a night ſhe ſhall be AT HOME, theſe two ſignificant words (beſides intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rarity of the thing) would preſent to the mind an image the moſt <hi>undomeſtic</hi> which language can convey? My country readers, who may require to have it explained that theſe two magnetic words now poſſeſs the powerful influence of drawing together every thing <hi>fine</hi> within the ſphere of their attraction, may need alſo to be apprized, that the gueſts after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037996_0316_100FAC41090255E0"/>
are not aſked what was <hi>ſaid</hi> by the company, but whether the <hi>crowd</hi> was prodigious, the rule for deciding on the merit of a faſhionable ſociety not being by the taſte or the ſpirit, but by the <hi>ſcore</hi> and the <hi>hundred.</hi> The queſtion of pleaſure, like a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary queſtion, is now carried by numbers. And when two parties modiſh, like two parties political, are run one againſt another on the ſame night, the ſame kind of mortification attends the leader of a defeated minority, the ſame triumph attends the exulting carrier of ſuperior numbers, in the one caſe as in the other.</p>
                     <p>An eminent divine has ſaid, that <q>perſeverance in prayer will either make a man leave off ſinning, or a continuance in ſin will make him leave off prayer.</q> This remark may be accommodated to thoſe ladies who, while they are devoted to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the world, yet retain conſiderable ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the inſtruction of their daughters. But if they are really in earneſt to give them a Chriſtian education, they muſt themſelves renounce a diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life. Or if they reſolve to purſue the chace of pleaſure, they muſt renounce this prime duty. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries cannot unite. The moral nurture of a tall daughter can no more be adminiſtered by a mother whoſe time is abſorbed by crowds abroad, than the phyſical nurture of her infant offspring can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by her in a perpetual abſence from home.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037996_0317_100FAC4291068158"/>
And is not that a prepoſterous affection which leads a mother to devote a few months to the inferior du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of furniſhing aliment to the mere animal life, and then to deſert her poſt when the more important mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and intellectual cravings require ſuſtenance? This great object is not to be effected with the ſhreds and parings rounded off from the circle of a diſſipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life; but in order to its adequate execution, the mother ſhould carry it on with the ſame ſpirit and perſeverance at home, which the father thinks it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be exerting abroad in his public duty or profeſſional engagements.</p>
                     <p>The uſual vindication (and in theory it has a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſound) which has been offered for the large portion of time ſpent by women in acquiring orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental talents is, that they are calculated to make the poſſeſſor love home, and that they innocently fill up the hours of leiſure. The plea has indeed ſo promiſing an appearance, that it is worth inquiring whether it be in fact true. Do we then, on fairly purſuing the inquiry, diſcover that thoſe who have ſpent moſt time in ſuch light acquiſitions, are really remarkable for loving home or ſtaying quietly there? or that when there, they are ſedulous in turning time to the beſt account? I ſpeak not of that ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and reſpectable claſs of women, who, applying (as many of them do) theſe elegant talents to their true purpoſe, employ them to fill up the vacancies of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037996_0318_100FAC469BF983A8"/>
better occupations, and to embelliſh the leiſure of a life actively good. But do we <hi>generally</hi> ſee that even the moſt valuable and ſober part of the reigning fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male acquiſitions leads their poſſeſſor to ſcenes moſt favourable to the enjoyment of them? to ſcenes which we ſhould naturally ſuppoſe ſhe would ſeek, in order to the more effectual cultivation of ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional pleaſures?</p>
                     <p>Would not thoſe delightful purſuits, botany and drawing, for inſtance, ſeem likely to court the fields, the woods, and gardens of the paternal ſeat, as more congenial to their nature, and more appropriate to their exerciſe, than barren watering places, deſtitute of a tree, or an herb, or a flower, and not affording an hour's interval from ſucceſſive pleaſures, to profit by the ſcene even if it abounded with the whole ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable world, from the <q>Cedar of Lebanon to the Hyſſop on the wall.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the mention of watering places, may the author be allowed to ſuggeſt a few remarks on the evils which have ariſen from the general conſpiracy of the gay to uſurp the regions of the ſick; and from their converting the health-reſtoring fountains, meant as a refuge for diſeaſe, into the reſorts of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for thoſe who have no diſeaſe but idleneſs?</p>
                     <p>This inability of ſtaying at home, as it is one of the moſt infallible, ſo it is one of the moſt dangerous ſymptoms of the reigning mania. It would be more

tolerable, did this epidemic malady only break out, as formerly, during the winter, or ſome one ſeaſon. Heretofore, the tenantry and the poor, the natural dependents on the rural manſions of the opulent, had ſome definite period to which they might joyfully look forward for the approach of thoſe patrons, part of whoſe buſineſs in life it is to influence by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to inſtruct by their example, to ſooth by their kindneſs, and to aſſiſt by their liberality, thoſe whom Providence, in the diſtribution of human lots, has placed under their more immediate protection. Though it would be far from truth to aſſert that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated people are never charitable, yet I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that diſſipation is inconſiſtent with the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of charity. That affecting precept followed by ſo gracious a promiſe, <q>Never turn away thy face from any poor man, and then the face of the Lord ſhall never be turned away from thee,</q> cannot lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mean that we ſhould <hi>give</hi> to all, as then we ſhould ſoon have nothing left to give: but it ſeems to intimate the habitual attention, the duty of inquiring out all caſes of diſtreſs, in order to judge which are fit to be relieved; now for this inquiry, for this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the diſſipated have little taſte and leſs leiſure.</p>
                     <p>Let a reaſonable conjecture (for calculation would fail!) be made of how large a diminution of the general good has been effected in this ſingle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, by cauſes, which, though they do not ſeem
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037996_0320_100FAC4C240C7C30"/>
important in themſelves, yet make no inconſiderable part of the miſchief ariſing from modern manners: and I ſpeak now to perſons who <hi>intend</hi> to be charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What a deduction will be made from the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of charity, by a circumſtance apparently trifling, when we conſider what would be the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial effects of that regular bounty which muſt almoſt unavoidably reſult from the evening walks of a great and benevolent family among the cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their own domain: the thouſand little acts of, comparatively, unexpenſive kindneſs which the <hi>ſight</hi> of petty wants and difficulties would excite; wants, which will ſcarcely be felt in the relation; and which will probably be neither ſeen, nor felt, nor fairly repreſented, in their long abſences, by an agent. And what is even almoſt more than the good done, is the habit of mind kept up in thoſe who do it. Would not this habit, exerciſed on the Chriſtian principle, that "even a cup of cold water," given upon <hi>right motives,</hi> ſhall not loſe its reward; while the giving "all their goods to feed the poor," without the true <hi>principle</hi> of charity, ſhall profit them nothing; would not this habit, I ſay, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the beſt part of the education of daughters<note n="*" place="bottom">It would be a pleaſant ſummer amuſement for our young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of fortune, if they were to preſide at ſuch ſpinning feaſts as are inſtituted at Nun<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional approximations of the rich and poor, for the purpoſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and inſtruction, and annual meetings for the purpoſe of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pleaſure, would do much towards wearing away diſcontent, and contribute to reconcile the lower claſs to that ſtate in which it has pleaſed God to place them.</note>?</p>

But tranſplant this wealthy and bountiful family periodically to the frivolous and unintereſting buſtle of the watering place; there it is not denied that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent public and faſhionable acts of charity may make a part, (and it is well they do) of the buſineſs and amuſement of the day; with this latter, indeed, they are ſometimes good-naturedly mixed up. But how ſhall we compare the regular ſyſtematical good theſe perſons would be doing at their own home, with the light, and amuſing, and buſtling bounties of the public place? The illegal raffle at the toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, may relieve, it is true, ſome diſtreſs, but this diſtreſs though it may be real, and though if real, it ought to be relieved, is far leſs eaſily aſcertained than the wants of the poor round a perſon's own door, or the debts of a diſtreſſed tenant. How ſhall we compare the broad ſtream of bounty which ſhould be flowing through and refreſhing whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, with the penurious current of the ſubſcription breakfaſt for the needy muſician, in which the price
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037996_0322_100FAC506FA7D058"/>
of the gift is taken out in the diverſion, and in which pleaſure dignifies itſelf with the name of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? How ſhall we compare the attention, and time, and zeal which would otherwiſe, perhaps, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the village ſchool, ſpent in hawking about benefit tickets for a broken player, while the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the benefactreſs, perhaps, is rewarded by ſcenes in which her charity is not always repaid by the purity of the exhibition?</p>
                     <p>Far be it from the author to wiſh to check the full tide of charity wherever it is diſpoſed to flow! Would ſhe could multiply the already abundant ſtreams, and behold every ſource purified! But in the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts there are many who are able and willing to give. In the ſequeſtered, though populous village, there is, perhaps only one affluent family: the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs which they do not <hi>behold,</hi> will probably not be attended to: the diſtreſs which <hi>they</hi> do not relieve will probably not be relieved at all: the wrongs which <hi>they</hi> do not redreſs will go unredreſſed: the oppreſſed whom <hi>they</hi> do not reſcue will ſink under the tyranny of the oppreſſor. Through their own rural domains too, charity runs in a clearer current, and is under leſs ſuſpicion of being polluted by that muddy tincture which it is ſometimes apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in paſſing through the impure ſoil of the world.</p>

But to return from this too long digreſſion: the old ſtanding objection formerly brought forward by the prejudices of the other ſex, and too eagerly laid hold on as a ſhelter for indolence and ignorance by ours, was, that intellectual accompliſhments too much abſorbed the thoughts and affections, took women off from the neceſſary attention to domeſtic duties, and ſuperinduced a contempt or neglect of whatever was uſeful.—But it is peculiarly the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the preſent day to detect abſurd opinions, and expoſe plauſible theories by the ſimple and deciſive anſwer of experiment; and it is preſumed that this popular error, as well as others, is daily receiving the refutation of actual experience. For it cannot ſurely be maintained on ground that is any longer tenable, that acquirements truly rational are calculated to draw off the mind from real duties. Whatever removes prejudices, whatever ſtimulates induſtry, whatever rectifies the judgment, whatever corrects ſelf-conceit, whatever purifies the taſte, and raiſes the underſtanding, will be likely to contribute to moral excellence: to woman moral excellence is the grand object of education; and of moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, domeſtic life is to woman the proper ſphere.</p>
                     <p>Count over the liſt of females who have made ſhipwreck of their fame and virtue, and have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the moſt lamentable examples of the derelic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of family duties; and the number will not be
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037996_0324_100FAC5715083760"/>
found conſiderable who have been led aſtray by the purſuit of knowledge. And if a few deplorable inſtances of this kind be produced, it will commonly be found that there was little infuſion into the minds of ſuch women of that correcting principle without which all other knowledge only "puffeth up."</p>
                     <p>The time nightly expended in late female vigils is expended by the light of far other lamps than thoſe which are fed by the ſtudent's oil; and if families <hi>are</hi> to be found who are neglected through too much ſtudy in the miſtreſs, it will probably be proved to be Hoyle, and not Homer, who has robbed her children of her time and affections. For one family which has been neglected by the mother's paſſion for books, an hundred have been deſerted through her paſſion for play. The huſband of a faſhionable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will not often find that the library is the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the expences of which involve him in debt or diſgrace. And for one literary ſlattern, who now manifeſts her indifference to her huſband by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of her perſon, there are ſcores of elegant ſpendthrifts who ruin theirs by exceſs of decoration.</p>
                     <p>May I digreſs a little while I remark, that I am far from aſſerting that literature has never filled wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with vanity and ſelf-conceit; the contrary is too obvious: but I will aſſert, that in general thoſe whom books are ſuppoſed to have ſpoiled, would have been ſpoiled in another way without them. She who is a
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:037996_0325_100FAC589BCEA700"/>
vain pedant becauſe ſhe has read much, has probably that defect in her mind which would have made her a vain fool if ſhe had read nothing. It is not her having more knowledge, but leſs ſenſe, which makes her inſufferable; and ignorance would have added little to her value, for it is not what ſhe has, but what ſhe wants, which makes her unpleaſant. Theſe inſtances too furniſh only a freſh argument for the general cultivation of the female mind. The wider diffuſion of ſound knowledge, would remove that temptation to be vain which may be excited by its rarity.</p>
                     <p>But while we would aſſert that a woman of a cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated intellect is not driven by the ſame neceſſity as others into the giddy whirl of public reſort; who but regrets that real cultivation does not <hi>inevitably</hi> preſerve her from it? No wonder that inanity of character, that vacuity of mind, that torpid igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſhould plunge into diſſipation as their natural refuge; ſhould ſeek to bury their inſignificance in the crowd of preſſing multitudes, and hope to eſcape analyſis and detection in the undiſtinguiſhed maſſes of mixed aſſemblies! <hi>There</hi> attrition rubs all bodies ſmooth, and makes all ſurfaces alike; thither ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and external accompliſhments naturally fly as to their proper ſcene of action; as to a field where competition in ſuch trifles is in perpetual exerciſe; where the laurels of admiration are to be won, where
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037996_0326_100FAC5B60C2B030"/>
the trophies of vanity may be carried off triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly.</p>
                     <p>It would indeed be matter of little comparative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, if this corrupt air were breathed only by thoſe whoſe natural element it ſeems to be; but who can forbear lamenting that the power of faſhion attracts into this impure and unwholeſome atmoſphere, minds alſo of a better make, of higher aims and ends, of more ethereal temper? that it attracts even thoſe who, renouncing enjoyments for which they have a genuine taſte, and which would make them really happy, neglect ſociety they love and purſuits they admire, in order that they may <hi>ſeem</hi> happy and <hi>be</hi> faſhionable in the chace of pleaſures they deſpiſe, and in company they diſapprove! But no correctneſs of taſte, no depth of knowledge, will infallibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a woman from this contagion, unleſs her heart be impreſſed with a deep Chriſtian conviction that ſhe is reſponſible for the application of knowledge as well as for the dedication of time.</p>
                     <p>This contagion is ſo deep, ſo wide, and fatal, that if I were called upon to aſſign the predominant cauſe of the greater part of the misfortunes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the great and gay in our days, I ſhould not look for it principally in any obviouſly great or ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtance; not in the practice of notorious vices, not originally in the dereliction of Chriſtian principle; but I ſhould without heſitation aſcribe it
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037996_0327_100FAC5F55DADD28"/>
to a growing, regular, ſyſtematic ſeries of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to an inceſſant, boundleſs, and not very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputable DISSIPATION. Other corruptions, though more formidable in appearance, are yet leſs fatal in ſome reſpects, becauſe they leave us intervals to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on their turpitude, and ſpirit to lament their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; but diſſipation is the more hopeleſs, as by engroſſing almoſt the entire life, and enervating the whole moral and intellectual ſyſtem, it leaves neither time for reflection, nor ſpace for ſelf-examination, nor temper for the cheriſhing of right affections, nor leiſure for the operation of ſound principles, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval for regret, nor vigour to reſiſt temptation, nor energy to ſtruggle for amendment.</p>
                     <p>The great maſter of the ſcience of pleaſure among the ancients, who reduced it into a ſyſtem, which he called <hi>the chief good of man,</hi> directed that there ſhould be interval enough between the ſucceſſion of delights to ſharpen inclination; and accordingly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted periodical days of abſtinence; well knowing that gratification was beſt promoted by previous ſelf-denial. But ſo little do our votaries of faſhion under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true nature of pleaſure, that one amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is allowed to overtake another without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, either for recollection of the paſt or prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the future. Even on their own ſelfiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, therefore, nothing can be worſe underſtood than this continuity of enjoyment: for to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:037996_0328_100FAC61F3196FA8"/>
of labour is the purſuit carried, that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures exhauſt inſtead of exhilarating, and the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions require to be reſted from.</p>
                     <p>For, not to argue the queſtion on the ground of religion, but merely on that of preſent enjoyment; look abroad and ſee who are the people that complain of wearineſs, liſtleſſneſs, and dejection. You will not find them among the claſs of ſuch as are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done with work, but with pleaſure. The natural and healthful fatigues of buſineſs may be recruited by ſimple and cheap gratifications; but a ſpirit worn down with the toils of amuſement, requires pleaſures of poignancy; varied, multiplied, ſtimulating!</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved by medical writers, that that ſober exceſs in which many indulge, by eating and drinking a little too much at every day's dinner and every night's ſupper, more effectually undermines the health, than thoſe more rare exceſſes by which others now and then break in upon a life of general ſobriety. This illuſtration is not introduced with a deſign to recommend occaſional deviations into groſs vice, by way of a pious receipt for mending the morals; but merely to ſuggeſt that there is a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that thoſe who are ſometimes driven by unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted paſſion into irregularities which ſhock their cooler reaſon, are more liable to be rouſed to a ſenſe of their danger, than perſons whoſe perceptions of evil are blunted through a round of ſyſtematical,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:037996_0329_100FAC637AAE27E0"/>
unceaſing, and yet not ſcandalous diſſipation. And when I affirm that this ſyſtem of regular indulgence relaxes the ſoul, enſlaves the heart, bewitches the ſenſes, and thus diſqualifies for pious thought or uſeful action, without having any thing in it ſo groſs as to ſhock the conſcience; and when I hazard an opinion that this ſtate is more formidable, becauſe leſs alarming, than that which bears upon it a more determined character of evil, I no more mean to ſpeak of the latter in ſlight and palliating terms, than I would intimate, becauſe the ſick ſometimes recover from a fever, but ſeldom from a palſy, that a fever is therefore a ſafe or a healthy ſtate.</p>
                     <p>But there ſeems to be an error in the firſt concoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of which the ſubſequent errors ſucceſſively grow. Firſt then, as has been obſerved before, the ſhowy education of women tends chiefly to qualify them for the glare of public aſſemblies: ſecondly, they ſeem in many inſtances to be ſo educated, with a view to the greater probability of their being ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly married: thirdly, it is alleged in vindication of thoſe diſſipated practices, that daughters can only be ſeen and admirers procured at balls, operas, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: and that therefore, by a natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, balls, operas, and aſſemblies muſt be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up without intermiſſion till the object be effected. For the accompliſhment of this object it is that all this complicated machinery had been previouſly ſet a-going, and kept in motion with an activity not at
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:037996_0330_100FAC661A9D1C40"/>
all ſlackened by the diſordered ſtate of the ſyſtem; for ſome machines, inſtead of being ſtopped, go faſter becauſe the true ſpring is out of order; the only difference being that they go wrong, and ſo the increaſed rapidity adds only to the quantity of error.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo, as we have already remarked, an error to fancy that the love of pleaſure exhauſts itſelf by indulgence, and that the very young are chiefly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to it. The contrary appears to be true. The deſire often grows with the purſuit in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as motion is quickened by the continuance of the gravitating force.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, it cannot be thought unfair to trace back the exceſſive fondneſs for amuſement to that mode of education we have elſewhere reprobated. Few of the accompliſhments, falſely ſo called, aſſiſt the developement of the faculties: they do not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the judgment, nor bring into action thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which fit the heart and mind for the occupations of life; they do not prepare women to love home, to underſtand its occupations, to enliven its uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to fulfil its duties, to multiply its comforts: they do not lead to that ſort of experimental logic, if I may ſo ſpeak, compounded of obſervation and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which makes up the moral ſcience of life and manners. Talents which have <hi>diſplay</hi> for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject deſpiſe the narrow ſtage of home: they demand mankind for their ſpectators, and the world for their theatre.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="unknown:037996_0331_100FAC692B9758F8"/>
While one cannot help ſhrinking a little from the idea of a delicate young creature, lovely in perſon and engaging in mind and manners, ſacrificing nightly at the public ſhrine of Faſhion, at once the votary and the victim; one cannot help figuring to oneſelf how much more intereſting ſhe would appear in the eyes of a man of feeling, did he behold her in the more endearing ſituations of domeſtic life. And who can forbear wiſhing, that the good ſenſe, good taſte, and delicacy of the men had rather led them to prefer ſeeking companions for life in the almoſt ſacred quiet of a virtuous home? <hi>There</hi> they might have had the means of ſeeing and admiring thoſe amiable beings in the beſt point of view: <hi>there</hi> they might have been enabled to form a juſter eſtimate of female worth, than is likely to be obtained in ſcenes where ſuch qualities and talents as might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add to the ſtock of domeſtic comfort muſt neceſſarily be kept in the back ground, and where ſuch only <hi>can</hi> be brought into view as are not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly calculated to inſure the certainty of home delights.</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>O! did they keep their perſons freſh and new,</l>
                        <l>How would they pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</l>
                        <l>And win by rareneſs!</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>But by what unaccountable infatuation is it that men too, even men of ſenſe, join in the confederacy
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:037996_0332_100FAC6CE2B519F0"/>
againſt their own happineſs, by looking for their home companions in the reſorts of vanity? Why do not ſuch men riſe ſuperior to the illuſions of faſhions? why do they not uniformly ſeek her who is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in <hi>their</hi> families in the boſom of her own? in the practice of every domeſtic duty, in the exerciſe of every amiable virtue, in the exertion of every elegant accompliſhment? thoſe accompliſhments of which we have been reprobating, not the poſſeſſion, but the application? <hi>there</hi> they would find her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting them to their true end, to enliven buſineſs, to animate retirement, to embelliſh the charming ſcene of family delights, to heighten the intereſting plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſocial intercourſe, and, riſing to their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt object, to adorn the doctrine of God her Saviour.</p>
                     <p>If, indeed, woman were more outſide, form and face only, and if <hi>mind</hi> made up no part of her compoſition, it would follow that a ball-room was quite as appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate a place for chooſing a wife, as an exhibition room for chooſing a picture. But, inaſmuch as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not mere portraits, their value not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable by a glance of the eye, it follows that a different mode of appreciating their value, and a different place for viewing them antecedent to their being individually ſelected, is deſirable. The two caſes differ alſo in this, that if a man ſelect a picture for himſelf from among all its exhibited competitors,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:037996_0333_100FAC6F82ED30F8"/>
and bring it to his own houſe, the picture being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, he is able to <hi>fix</hi> it there: while the wife, picked up at a public place, and accuſtomed to inceſſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, will not, it is probable, when brought home, ſtick ſo quietly to the ſpot where he fixes her; but will eſcape to the exhibition-room again, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be diſplayed at every ſubſequent exhibition, juſt as if ſhe were not become private property, and had never been definitively diſpoſed of.</p>
                     <p>It is the novelty of a thing which aſtoniſhes us, and not its abſurdity: objects may be ſo long kept before the eye that it begins no longer to obſerve them; or may be brought into ſuch cloſe contact with it, that it does not diſcern them. Long habit ſo reconciles us to almoſt any thing, that the groſſeſt improprieties ceaſe to ſtrike us when they once make a part of the common courſe of action. This, by the way, is a ſtrong reaſon for carefully ſifting every opinion and every practice before we let them incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate into the maſs of our habits, after which they will be no more examined.—Would it not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prepoſterous for a young man to ſay he had fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a lady would dance a better minuet, becauſe he had ſeen her behave devoutly at Church, and <hi>therefore</hi> had choſen her for his partner? and yet he is not thought at all abſurd when he intimates that he choſe a partner for life becauſe he was pleaſed with her at a ball. Surely the place of chooſing and the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:037996_0334_100FAC71098C7D10"/>
motive of choice, would be juſt as appropriate in one caſe as in the other, and the miſtake, if the judgment failed, not <hi>quite</hi> ſo ſerious.</p>
                     <p>There is, among the more elevated claſſes of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, a certain ſet of perſons who are pleaſed exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to call themſelves, and whom others by a ſort of compelled courteſy are pleaſed to call, <hi>the fine world.</hi> This ſmall detachment conſider their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with reſpect to the reſt of mankind, juſt as the ancient Grecians did theirs; that is, as the Grecians thought there were but two ſorts of beings, and that all who were not Grecians were barbarians; ſo this <hi>certain ſet</hi> conceives of ſociety as reſolving itſelf into two diſtinct claſſes, the <hi>fine world</hi> and the <hi>people;</hi> to which laſt claſs they turn over all who do not belong to their little <hi>coterie,</hi> however high their rank, or fortune, or merit. Celebrity, in their eſtimation, is not beſtowed by birth or talents, but by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with <hi>them.</hi> They have laws, immunities, privileges, and almoſt a language of their own; they form a kind of diſtinct <hi>caſt,</hi> and with a ſort of <hi>eſprit du corps</hi> detach themſelves from others, even in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſociety, by an affectation of diſtance and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and only whiſper and ſmile in their own little groups of the initiated; their confines are jealouſly guarded, and their privileges are incommunicable.</p>
                     <p>In this ſociety a young man loſes his natural cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which, whatever it might have been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:037996_0335_100FAC74E41AEF68"/>
is melted down and caſt into the one prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mould of Faſhion; all the ſtrong, native, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating qualities of his mind being made to take one ſhape, one ſtamp, one ſuperſcription! However varied and diſtinct might have been the materials which nature threw into the crucible, plaſtic Faſhion takes care that they ſhall all be the ſame, or at leaſt appear the ſame, when they come out of the mould. A young man in ſuch an artificial ſtate of ſociety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the voluptuous eaſe, refined luxuries, ſoft accommodations, obſequious attendance, and all the unreſtrained indulgencies of a faſhionable club, is not to be expected after marriage to take very cordially to a home, unleſs very extraordinary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are made to amuſe, to attach, and to intereſt him: and he is not likely to lend a very helping hand to the happineſs of the union, whoſe moſt laborious exertions have hitherto been little more than a ſelfiſh ſtratagem to reconcile health with pleaſure. Exceſs of gratification has only ſerved to make him irritable and exacting; it will of courſe be no part of his project to make ſacrifices, he will expect to receive them: and what would appear incredible to the <hi>Paladins</hi> of gallant times, and the <hi>Chevaliers Preux</hi> of more heroic days, even in the neceſſary buſineſs of eſtabliſhing himſelf for life, he ſometimes is more diſpoſed to expect attentions than to make advances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="unknown:037996_0336_100FAC7786472D80"/>
Thus the indolent ſon of faſhion, with a thouſand fine, but dormant qualities, which a bad tone of manners forbids him to bring into exerciſe; with real energies which that tone does not allow him to diſcover, and an unreal apathy which it commands him to feign; with the heart of an hero, perhaps, if called into the field, affects at home the manners of a Sybarite; and he who, with a Roman, or what is more, with a Britiſh valour, would leap into the gulph at the call of public duty,
<q>
                           <l>Yet in the ſoft and piping time of peace,</l>
                        </q>
when faſhion has reſumed her rights, would murmur if a roſe leaf lay double under him.</p>
                     <p>The clubs above alluded to, as has been ſaid, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and cheriſh luxurious habits, from their perfect eaſe, undreſs, liberty, and inattentions to the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of rank: they promote a love of play, and in ſhort, every temper and ſpirit which tends to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domeſticate; and what adds to the miſchief is, all this is attained at a cheap rate compared with what may be procured at home in the ſame ſtyle.</p>
                     <p>Theſe indulgencies, and this habit of mind, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo much gratification of the paſſions, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can never hope ſucceſsfully to counteract the evil by ſupplying at home gratifications in a ſuperior degree, which are of the ſame kind. If ſhe ſhould attempt this, in a little time ſhe will find that thoſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:037996_0337_100FAC790DA91DB8"/>
paſſions, to which ſhe has truſted for making plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant the married life of her huſband, will crave the ſtill higher pleaſures of the club; and while theſe are purſued, ſhe will be conſigned over to ſolitary even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at home, or driven back to the old diſſipations.</p>
                     <p>To conquer the paſſion for club gratifications, a woman muſt not ſtrive to feed it with ſufficient ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſame kind in her ſociety, either at home or abroad; ſhe muſt ſupplant and overcome it by a paſſion of a different nature, which Providence has kindly planted within us, I mean by inſpiring him with the love of fire-ſide enjoyments. But to qualify herſelf for adminiſtering theſe, ſhe muſt cultivate her underſtanding and her heart, and her temper, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring at the ſame time that modicum of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuited to his taſte, which may qualify her for poſſeſſing, both for him and for herſelf, greater varieties of ſafe recreation.</p>
                     <p>One great cauſe of the want of attachment in theſe modiſh couples is, that by living in the world at large, they are not driven to depend on each other as the chief ſource of comfort. Now it is pretty clear, in ſpite of modern theories, that the very frame and being of ſocieties, whether great or ſmall, public or private, is jointed and glued together by dependence. Thoſe attachments which ariſe from, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted by, a ſenſe of mutual wants, mutual affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mutual benefit, and mutual obligation, are the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:037996_0338_100FAC7BB82BCA90"/>
cement which ſecure the union of the family as well as of the ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately, when two young perſons of the above deſcription marry, the union is ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered rather as the end than the beginning of an engagement: the attachment of each to the other is rather viewed as an object already completed, than as one which marriage is to confirm more cloſely. But the companion for life is not always choſen from the pureſt motive; ſhe is ſelected, perhaps, becauſe ſhe is admired by other men, rather than becauſe ſhe poſſeſſes in an eminent degree thoſe peculiar qualities which are likely to conſtitute the individual happineſs of the man who chooſes her. Vanity uſurps the place of affection; and indolence ſwallows up the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Not happineſs, but ſome eaſy ſubſtitute for happineſs, is purſued; and a choice which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite envy, rather than produce ſatisfaction, is adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the means of effecting it.</p>
                     <p>The pair, not <hi>matched but joined,</hi> ſet out ſeparately with their independent and individual purſuits; whether it made a part of their original plan or not, that they ſhould be indiſpenſably neceſſary to each other's comfort, the ſenſe of this neceſſity, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not very ſtrong at firſt, rather diminiſhes than increaſes by time; they live ſo much in the world, and ſo little together, that to ſtand well with their <hi>own ſet</hi> continues the favourite project of each;
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:037996_0339_100FAC7FC997CB98"/>
while to ſtand well with each other is conſidered as an under-part of the plot in the drama of life. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, did they ſtart in the conjugal race with the fixed idea that they were to look to each other for their chief worldly happineſs, not only principle, but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and even ſelfiſhneſs, would convince them of the neceſſity of ſedulouſly cultivating each other's eſteem and affection as the grand means of promoting that happineſs. But vanity, and the deſire of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and applauſe, ſtill continue to operate. Even after the huſband is brought to feel a perfect indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for his wife, he ſtill likes to ſee her decorated in a ſtyle which may ſerve to juſtify his choice. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages her to ſet off her perſon, not ſo much for his own gratification as that his ſelf-love may be flattered, by her continuing to attract the admiration of thoſe whoſe opinion is the ſtandard by which he meaſures his fame, and which fame is to ſtand him in the ſtead of happineſs.

And in theſe cold abſtracted <hi>têtes-â-têtes,</hi> they often take as little pains to entertain each other, as if the one was preciſely the only hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being in the world in whoſe eyes the other did not feel it neceſſary to appear agreeable.</p>

                     <p>It may ſeem a contradiction to have aſſerted that beings of all ages, tempers, and talents ſhould with ſuch unremitting induſtry follow up any way of life if they did not find ſome enjoyment in it; yet I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the boſoms of theſe inceſſant hunters in the chace of pleaſure, whether they are really happy.

No.—In the full tide and torrent of diverſion, in the full blaze of gaiety,

But there is an anxious reſtleſſneſs excited by the purſuit, which, if not intereſting, is buſtling. There is the dread and partly the diſcredit of being ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having one hour unmortgaged, not only to ſucceſſive, but contending engagements; this it is, and not the pleaſure of the engagement itſelf, which is the object. There is an agitation in the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which impoſes itſelf on the vacant heart for happineſs. There is a tumult kept up in the ſpirits which is a buſy though treacherous ſubſtitute for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The multiplicity of ſolicitations ſooths vanity. The very regret that they cannot be all accepted has its charms; for dignity is flattered becauſe refuſal implies importance, and pre-engagement intimates celebrity. Then there is the joy of being invited when others are neglected; the triumph of ſhowing one's leſs modiſh friend that one is going where ſhe cannot come; and the feigned regret at being <hi>obliged</hi> to go, aſſumed before her who is half wild at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to ſtay away. Theſe are ſome of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemental ſhifts for happineſs with which vanity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives to feed her hungry followers; too eager to be nice.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:037996_0342_100FAC869BE72C58"/>
the actual place is never taken into the account of enjoyment: the ſcene of which is always ſuppoſed to lie in any place where her votaries happen not to be. Pleaſure has no preſent tenſe: but in the houſe which her purſuers have juſt quitted, and in the houſe to which they are juſt haſtening, a ſtranger might conclude the ſlippery goddeſs had really fixed her throne, and that her worſhippers conſidered the exiſting ſcene, which they ſeemed compelled to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but from which they were eager to eſcape, as really detaining them from ſome poſitive joy to which they were flying in the next crowd; till, if he met them there, he would find the component parts of each preciſely the ſame. He would hear the ſame ſtated phraſes interrupted, not anſwered, by the ſame ſtated replies; the unfiniſhed ſentence <q>driven adverſe to the winds</q> by preſſing multitudes; the ſame warm regret mutually exchanged by two friends (who had been expreſsly denied to each other all the winter) that they had not met before; the ſame ſoft and ſmiling ſorrow at being torn away from each other now; the ſame anxiety to renew the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with perhaps the ſame ſecret reſolution to avoid it.

                        <p>On public amuſements.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not propoſed to enter the long conteſted field of controverſy as to the individual amuſements which may be conſidered as ſafe and lawful for thoſe women of the higher claſs who make a ſtrict profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity. The judgment they will be likely to form for themſelves on this ſubject, and the plan they will conſequently adopt, will depend much on the clearneſs or obſcurity of their religious views, and on the greater or leſs progreſs they have made in their Chriſtian courſe. It is in their choice of amuſements that you get in ſome meaſure to know the real diſpoſitions of mankind. In their <hi>buſineſs,</hi> in the leading employments of life, their path is in a good degree chalked out for them: there is in this reſpect a ſort of general character wherein the greater part, more or leſs, muſt coincide. But in their pleaſures the choice is voluntary, the taſte is ſelf-directed, the propenſity is independent; and of courſe the habitual ſtate, the genuine bent and bias of the temper, are moſt likely to be ſeen in thoſe purſuits which every man is at liberty to chooſe for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:037996_0346_100FAC92598FD2C0"/>
When a truly religious principle ſhall have acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a degree of force as to produce that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious and habitual improvement of time before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, it will diſcover itſelf by an increaſing indifference and even deadneſs to thoſe pleaſures which are intereſting to the world at large. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under the predominating influence of ſuch a principle, will begin to diſcover that the ſame thing which in itſelf is innocent may yet be comparatively wrong. She will begin to feel that there are many amuſements and employments which, though they have nothing cenſurable in themſelves, yet if they be allowed to entrench on hours which ought to be dedicated to ſtill better purpoſes; or if they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to an undue length; or above all, if by ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and relaxing her mind and diſſipating her ſpirits, they ſo indiſpoſe her for better purſuits as to render ſubſequent duties a burden, become in that caſe clearly wrong for her, whatever they may be for others. Now as temptations of this ſort are the peculiar dangers of better kind of characters, the ſacrifice of ſuch little gratifications as may <hi>have no great harm in them,</hi> come in among the daily calls to ſelf-denial in a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>The fine arts, for inſtance, polite literature, elegant ſociety, theſe are among the lawful, and liberal, and becoming recreations of higher life; yet if even theſe be cultivated to the neglect or excluſion of ſeverer
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:037996_0347_100FAC9541880B48"/>
duties; if they interfere with ſerious ſtudies, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualify the mind for religious exerciſes, it is an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that they have been too much indulged; and, under ſuch circumſtances, it might be the part of Chriſtian circumſpection to inquire if the time devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them ought not to be abridged. Above all, a tender conſcience will never loſe ſight of one ſafe rule of determining in all doubtful caſes: if the point be ſo nice that though we hope upon the whole there <hi>may</hi> be no harm in engaging in it, we may at leaſt be always quite ſure that there <hi>can</hi> be no harm in letting it alone. The adoption of this ſimple rule would put a period to much unprofitable caſuiſtry.</p>
                     <p>The principle of being reſponſible for the uſe of time once fixed in the mind, the conſcientious Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian will be making a continual progreſs in the great art of turning time to account. In the firſt ſtages of her religion ſhe will have abſtained from pleaſures which began a <hi>little</hi> to wound the conſcience, or which aſſumed a queſtionable ſhape; but ſhe will probably have abſtained with regret, and with a ſecret wiſh that conſcience <hi>could</hi> have permitted her to keep well with pleaſure and religion too. But you may diſcern in her ſubſequent courſe that ſhe has reached a more advanced ſtage, by her beginning to neglect even ſuch pleaſures or employments as have no moral turpitude in them, but are merely what are called innocent. This relinquiſhment ariſes, not ſo
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:037996_0348_100FAC97DC863B18"/>
much from her feeling ſtill more the reſtraints of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as from the improvement in her religious taſte. Pleaſures cannot now attach her merely from their being innocent, unleſs they are intereſting alſo, and to be intereſting they muſt be conſonant to her ſuperinduced views. She is not contented to ſpend a large portion of her time harmleſsly, it muſt be ſpent profitably alſo. Nay, if ſhe be indeed earneſtly <q>preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the mark,</q> it will not be even enough for her that her preſent purſuit be good, if ſhe be convinced that it might be ſtill better. Her contempt of ordinary enjoyments will increaſe in a direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to her increaſed reliſh for thoſe pleaſures which religion enjoins and beſtows. So that at length if it were poſſible to ſuppoſe that an angel could come down to take off as it were the interdict, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite her to reſume all the pleaſures ſhe had renounced, and to reſume them with complete impunity, ſhe would reject the invitation, becauſe ſhe would deſpiſe, from an improvement in her ſpiritual taſte, thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights from which ſhe had at firſt abſtained through fear. Till her will and affections come heartily to be engaged in the ſervice of God, the progreſs will not be comfortable; but when once they are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, the attachment to this ſervice will be cordial, and her heart will not deſire to go back and toil again in the drudgery of the world. For her religion has
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037996_0349_100FAC996403D940"/>
not ſo much given her a new creed, as a new heart, and a new life.</p>
                     <p>As her views are become new, ſo her tempers, diſpoſitions, taſtes, actions, purſuits, choice of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, choice of amuſements, are new alſo; her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of time is changed; her turn of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is altered; <q>old things are paſſed away, all things are become new.</q> In diſſipated and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſociety, ſhe will ſeldom fail to feel a ſort of unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which will produce one of theſe two effects; ſhe will either, as proper ſeaſons preſent themſelves, ſtruggle hard to introduce ſuch ſubjects as may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others; or, ſuppoſing that ſhe finds herſelf unable to effect this, ſhe will, as far as ſhe prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can, abſent herſelf from all unprofitable kind of ſociety. Indeed her manner of conducting herſelf under theſe circumſtances may ſerve to furniſh her with a teſt of her own ſincerity. For while people are contending for a little more of this amuſement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pleading for a little extenſion of that gratification, and fighting in order that they may hedge in a little more territory to their pleaſure ground, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a kind of evidence againſt themſelves, that they are not yet <q>renewed in the ſpirit of their mind.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It has been warmly urged as an objection to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain religious books, and particularly againſt a recent work of high worth and celebrity, by a diſtinguiſhed
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:037996_0350_100FAC9D447A4550"/>
layman<note n="*" place="bottom">Practical View, &amp;c. by Mr. Wilberforce.</note>, that they have ſet the ſtandard of ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al higher than reaſon or even than Chriſtianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Theſe works do indeed elevate the general tone of religion to a higher pitch than is quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to thoſe who are at infinite pains to conſtruct a comfortable and comprehenſive plan, which ſhall unite the queſtionable pleaſures of this world with the promiſed happineſs of the next. I ſay it has been ſometimes objected, even by thoſe readers who on the whole greatly admire the particular work alluded to, that it is unreaſonably ſtrict in the preceptive and prohibitory parts; and eſpecially that it individually and ſpecifically forbids certain faſhionable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with a ſeverity not to be found in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and is ſcrupulouſly rigid in condemning diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions againſt which nothing is ſaid in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; each objector, however, is ſo far reaſonable, as only to beg quarter for her own favorite diverſion, and generouſly abandons the defence of thoſe in which ſhe herſelf has no pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But theſe objectors do not ſeem to underſtand the true genius of Chriſtianity. They do not conſider that it is the character of the Goſpel to exhibit a ſcheme of principles, of which it is the tendency to infuſe ſuch a ſpirit of holineſs as muſt be utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible, not only with cuſtoms decidedly vicious,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:037996_0351_100FACA020328DC0"/>
but with the very ſpirit of worldly pleaſure. They do not conſider that Chriſtianity is neither a table of ethics, nor a ſyſtem of opinions, nor a bundle of rods to puniſh, nor an exhibition of rewards to allure, nor a ſcheme of reſtraints, nor merely a code of laws; but it is a new principle infuſed into the heart by the word and the ſpirit of God, out of which principle will inevitably grow right opinions, renewed affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, correct morals, and holy habits, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable deſire of pleaſing God, and a conſtant fear of offending him. A real Chriſtian, whoſe heart is once thoroughly imbued with this principle, can no more return to the amuſements of the world, than a philoſopher can be refreſhed with the diverſions of the vulgar, or a man be amuſed with the recreations of a child. The New Teſtament is not a mere ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-book: it is not a table where every offence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed, and its correſponding penalty annexed: it is not ſo much a <hi>compilation,</hi> as a <hi>ſpirit</hi> of laws: it does not ſo much prohibit every individual wrong practice, as ſuggeſt a temper and general principle with which every wrong practice is incompatible. It did not, for inſtance, ſo much attack the then reigning and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt faſhions, which were probably, like the faſhions of other countries, temporary and local; but it ſtruck at that worldlineſs, which is the root and ſtock from which all corrupt faſhions proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="unknown:037996_0352_100FACA1A9854D90"/>
The prophet Iſaiah, who addreſſed himſelf more particularly to the Iſraelitiſh women, inveighed not only againſt vanity, luxury, and immodeſty, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; but with great propriety blamed even thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe inſtances of each, to which the women of rank in the particular country he was addreſſing were eſpecially addicted; nay, he enters into the minute detail<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah, chap. iii.</note> of their very perſonal decorations, and brings ſpecific charges againſt their levity and extravagance of apparel; meaning, however, chiefly to cenſure the turn of character which theſe indicated. But the Goſpel of Chriſt, which was to be addreſſed to all ages, ſtations, and countries, ſeldom contains any ſuch detailed animadverſions; for though many of the cenſurable modes which the prophet ſo ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, continued probably to be ſtill prevalent in Jeruſalem in the days of our Saviour, yet how little would it have ſuited the univerſality of his miſſion, to have confined his preaching to ſuch local, limited, and fluctuating cuſtoms! not but that there are many texts which actually <hi>do</hi> define the Chriſtian conduct as well as temper, with ſufficient particularity to ſerve as a condemnation of many practices which are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and often to point pretty directly at them.</p>
                     <p>Had Peter, on that memorable day when he added three thouſand converts to the Church by a ſingle
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037996_0353_100FACA47A3EE768"/>
ſermon, narrowed his ſubject to a remonſtrance againſt this diverſion, or that public place, or the other vain amuſement, it might indeed have ſuited the caſe of ſome of the female Jewiſh converts who were at preſent; but ſuch reſtrictions as might have been appropriate to them, would probably not have applied to the caſes of the Parthians and Medes, of which his audience was partly compoſed; or ſuch as might have belonged to them would have been totally inapplicable to the Cretes and Arabians; or again, thoſe which ſuited theſe would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Elamites and Meſopotamians. By ſuch partial and circumſcribed addreſſes, his multifarious audience, compoſed of all nations and countries, would not have been, as we are told they were, "pricked to the heart." But when he preached on the broad ground of general <q>repentance and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins in the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</q> it was no wonder that they all cried out <q>What ſhall we do?</q> Theſe collected foreigners, at their return home, muſt have found very different uſages to be corrected in their different countries; of courſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed reſtriction of the popular abuſes at Jeruſalem, would have been of little uſe to ſtrangers returning to their reſpective nations. The ardent Apoſtle, therefore, acted more conſiſtently in communicating to them the large and comprehenſive ſpirit of the Goſpel, which ſhould at once involve all their ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:037996_0354_100FACA871901470"/>
and ſeparate duties, as well as reprove all their ſcattered and ſeparate corruptions; for the whole always includes a part, and the greater involves the leſs. Chriſt and his diſciples, inſtead of limiting their condemnation to the peculiar vanities repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Iſaiah, embraced the very ſoul and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of them all, in ſuch exhortations as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: "Be ye not conformed to the world:"—<q>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</q>—<q>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</q> Our Lord and his Apoſtles, whoſe future unlimited audience was to be made up out of the whole world, attacked the evil <hi>heart,</hi> out of which all thoſe incidental, local, and popular corruptions proceeded.</p>
                     <p>In the time of Chriſt and his immediate followers, the luxury and intemperance of the Romans had ariſen to a pitch before unknown in the world; but as the ſame Goſpel which its Divine Author and his diſciples were then preaching to the hungry and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, was afterwards to be preached to high and low, not excepting the Roman Emperors themſelves; the large precept, <q>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God,</q> was likely to be of more general uſe, than any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exhortation to temperance, to thankfulneſs, to moderation as to quantity or expence; which laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:037996_0355_100FACAA00F748B0"/>
muſt always be left in ſome degree to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and circumſtances of the individual.</p>
                     <p>When the Apoſtle of the Gentiles viſited the "Saints of Caeſar's houſehold," he could hardly fail to have heard, nor could he have heard without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, of ſome of the faſhionable amuſements in the court of Nero. He muſt have reflected with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar indignation on many things which were prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the Circenſian games: yet, inſtead of prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this corrupt tree, and ſingling out even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human gladiatorial ſports for the object of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, he laid his axe to the root of all ſin, by preaching to them that Goſpel of Chriſt of which "he was not aſhamed;" and ſhewing to them that believed, that <q>it was the power of God and the wiſdom of God.</q> It is ſomewhat remarkable, that about the very time of his preaching to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the public taſte had ſunk to ſuch an exceſs of depravity, that the very women engaged in thoſe ſhocking encounters with the gladiators.</p>
                     <p>But, in the firſt place, it was better that their right practice ſhould grow out of the right prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and next, his ſpecifically reprobating theſe diverſions might have had this ill effect, that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages, ſeeing that they in their amuſements came ſomewhat ſhort of thoſe dreadful exceſſes of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Romans, would only have plumed themſelves on their own comparative ſuperiority; and on this

principle, even the bull-fights of Madrid might have had their panegyriſts. The truth is, the Apoſtle knew that ſuch abominable corruptions could never ſubſiſt together with Chriſtianity, and in fact, the honour of aboliſhing theſe barbarous diverſions, was reſerved for Conſtantine, the firſt Chriſtian emperor.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Apoſtles, by inveighing againſt ſome <hi>particular</hi> diverſions might have ſeemed to ſanction all which they did not actually cenſure: and as, in the lapſe of time and the revolution of governments, cuſtoms change and manners fluctuate; had a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute reprehenſion of the faſhions of the then exiſting age been publiſhed in the New Teſtament, that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcripture muſt in time have become obſolete, even in that very ſame country, when the faſhions themſelves ſhould have changed. Paul and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtles knew that their epiſtles would be the oracles of the Chriſtian world, when theſe tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diverſions would be forgotten. In conſequence of this knowledge, by the univerſal precept to avoid <q>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life,</q> they have prepared a laſting antidote againſt the <hi>principle</hi> of all corrupt pleaſures, which will ever remain equally applicable to the looſe faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all ages, and of every country, to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to vindicate diverſions, which are in themſelves unchriſtian, on the pretended ground that
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:037996_0357_100FACAF4E0B4A88"/>
they are not ſpecifically condemned in the goſpel, would be little leſs abſurd than if the heroes of New-market ſhould bring it as a proof that their periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal meetings are not condemned in Scripture, becauſe St. Paul, when writing to the Corinthians, did not ſpeak againſt theſe, or becauſe in availing himſelf of the Iſthmian games, as a happy illuſtration of the Chriſtian race, he did not drop any cenſure on the practice itſelf: a practice which was indeed as much more pure than the races of Chriſtian Britain, as the moderation of being contented with the triumph of a crown of leaves, is ſuperior to that criminal ſpirit of gambling which iniquitouſly enriches the victor by beggaring the competitor.</p>
                     <p>Local abuſes, as we have ſaid, were not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a book whoſe inſtructions were to be of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and laſting application. As a proof of this, little is ſaid in the Goſpel of the then prevailing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of polygamy; nothing againſt the ſavage cuſtom of expoſing children, or even againſt ſlavery; nothing expreſsly againſt ſuicide or duelling; the laſt Gothic cuſtom, indeed, did not exiſt among the crimes of <hi>Paganiſm.</hi> But is there not an implied prohibition againſt polygamy in the general denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt adultery? Is not expoſing of children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in that charge againſt the Romans, that "they were without natural affection?" Is there not a ſtrong cenſure againſt ſlavery conveyed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:037996_0358_100FACB2490E5C00"/>
to <q>do unto others as you would have them do unto you?</q> and againſt ſuicide and duelling, in the general prohibition againſt murder, which is ſtrongly enforced by the ſolemn manner in which murder is traced back to its firſt ſeed of anger, in the ſermon on the mount?</p>
                     <p>Thus it is clear, that when Chriſt ſent the Goſpel to all nations, he meant that that Goſpel ſhould proclaim thoſe prime truths, general laws, and fundamental doctrines, which muſt neceſſarily involve the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of all individual, local, and inferior errors; errors which could not have been ſpecifically guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt, without having a diſtinct Goſpel for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry country, or without ſwelling the divine volume into ſuch inconvenient length as would have defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one great end of its promulgation<note n="*" place="bottom">"To the <hi>poor</hi> the Goſpel is preached." Luke, vii. 22.</note>. And while its leading principles are of univerſal application, it muſt always, in ſome meaſure, be left to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preacher, and to the conſcience of the hearer, to examine whether the life and habits of thoſe who profeſs it are conformable to its ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Divine Spirit which indited the Holy Scriptures, is promiſed to purify the hearts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the natures of repenting and believing Chriſtians; and the compoſitions it inſpired are in ſome degree analogous to the workmanſhip it effects. It prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:037996_0359_100FACB4F15983B0"/>
the vicious practices of the apoſtolical days, by prohibiting the paſſions and principles which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them gratifying; and ſtill working in like manner on the hearts of real Chriſtians, it corrects the taſte which was accuſtomed to find its proper gratification in the reſorts of vanity; and thus ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually provides for the reformation of the habits, and infuſes a reliſh for rational and domeſtic enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and for whatever can adminiſter pleaſure to that ſpirit of peace, and love, and hope, and joy, which animates and rules the renewed heart of the true Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>But there is a portion of Scripture which, though to a ſuperficial reader it may ſeem but very remotely connected with the preſent ſubject, yet to readers of another caſt, ſeems to ſettle the matter beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: In the parable of the great ſupper, this important truth is held out to us, that even things <hi>good in themſelves</hi> may be the means of our eternal ruin, by drawing our hearts from God, and cauſing us to make light of the offers of the Goſpel. One invited gueſt had bought an eſtate, another had made a purchaſe equally blameleſs of oxen; a third had married a wife, an act not illaudable in itſelf. They had all different reaſons; but they all agreed in this, <hi>to decline the invitation to the ſupper.</hi> The worldly poſſeſſions of one, the worldly buſineſs of another, and what ſhould be particularly attended to, the love
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:037996_0360_100FACB8A467E688"/>
to his deareſt relative, of a third, (a love by the way not only allowed but commanded in Scripture) were brought forward as excuſes for not attending to the important buſineſs of religion. The conſequence, however, was the ſame to all. <q>None of thoſe which were bidden ſhall taſte of my ſupper.</q> If then things <hi>innocent,</hi> things <hi>neceſſary,</hi> things <hi>laudable,</hi> things <hi>commanded,</hi> become ſinful, when by unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or exceſſive indulgence they detain the heart and affections from God, how vain will all thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſarily be rendered, which are urged by the advocates for certain amuſements, on the ground of their <hi>harmleſſneſs;</hi> if thoſe amuſements ſerve (not to mention any poſitive evil which may belong to them) in like manner to draw away the thoughts and affections from all ſpiritual objects!</p>
                     <p>To conclude; when this topic happens to become the ſubject of converſation, inſtead of addreſſing ſevere and pointed attacks to young ladies on the ſin of attending places of diverſion, would it not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter firſt to endeavour to excite in them that principle of Chriſtianity, with which ſuch diverſions ſeem not quite compatible; as the phyſician, who viſits a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in an eruptive fever, pays little attention to thoſe ſpots which to the ignorant appear to be the diſeaſe, except indeed ſo far as they ſerve as indications to let him into its nature, but goes ſtraight to the root of the malady? He attacks the fever, he lowers
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:037996_0361_100FACBA2B4587A8"/>
the pulſe, he changes the ſyſtem, he corrects the general habit; well knowing that if he can but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the vital principle of health, the ſpots, which were nothing but ſymptoms, will die away of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p>In inſtructing others we ſhould imitate our Lord and his Apoſtles, and not always aim our blow at each particular corruption; but making it our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to convince our pupil that what brings forth the evil fruit ſhe exhibits, cannot be a branch of the true vine; we ſhould thus avail ourſelves of individual corruptions, for impreſſing her with a ſenſe of the neceſſity of purifying the common ſource from which they flow—a corrupt nature. Thus making it our grand buſineſs to rectify the heart, we purſue the true, the compendious, the only method of univerſal holineſs.</p>
                     <p>I would, however, take leave of thoſe amiable and not ill-diſpoſed young perſons, who complain of the rigour of human prohibitions, and declare <q>they meet with no ſuch ſtrictneſs in the Goſpel,</q> by aſking them, with the moſt affectionate earneſtneſs, if they can conſcientiouſly reconcile their nightly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at every public place which they frequent, with ſuch precepts as the following: <q>Redeeming the time:</q>—"Watch and pray:"—<q>Watch, for ye know not at what time your Lord cometh:</q>—"Abſtain from all <hi>appearance</hi> of evil:"—<q>Set your

affections on things above;</q>—<q>Be ye ſpiritually minded:</q>—<q>Crucify the fleſh with its affections and luſts?</q> And I would venture to offer one criterion, by which the perſons in queſtion may be enabled to decide on the poſitive innocence and ſafety of ſuch diverſions; I mean, provided they are ſincere in their ſcrutiny and honeſt in their avowal. If on their return at night from thoſe places they find they can retire, and <q>commune with their own hearts;</q> if they find the love of God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with undiminiſhed force on their minds; if they can "bring every thought into ſubjection," and concentrate every wandering imagination; if they can ſoberly examine into their own ſtate of mind: I do not ſay if they can do all this perfectly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction; (for who can do this at any time?) but if they can do it with the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pray with the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of fervour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world in as great a <hi>meaſure</hi> as at other times; and if they can lie down with a peaceful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having avoided in the evening <q>that temptation</q> which they had prayed not to be <q>led into</q> in the morning, they may then more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hope that all is well, and that they are not ſpeaking falſe peace to their hearts.<note n="*" place="bottom">If I might preſume to recommend a book which of all others expoſes the inſignificance, vanity, littleneſs, and emptineſs of the world, I ſhould not heſitate to name Mr. Law's <hi>
                              <q>Serious Call to a devout and holy Life.</q>
                           </hi> Few writers, except Paſcal, have directed ſo much acuteneſs of reaſoning, and ſo much pointed wit to this object. He not only makes the reader afraid of a worldly life on account of its ſinfulneſs, but aſhamed of it on account of its folly. Few men perhaps have had a deeper inſight into the human heart, or have more ſkilfully probed its corruptions: yet on points of doctrine his views do not ſeem to be juſt; and his diſquiſitions are often unſound and fanciful; ſo that a <hi>general</hi> peruſal of his works would neither be profitable or intelligible. To a faſhionable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man immerſed in the vanities of life, or to a buſy man overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with its cares, I know no book ſo applicable, or likely to exhibit with equal force the vanity of the ſhadows they are purſuing. But even in this work he is not a ſafe guide to evangelical light; and in many of his others he is highly viſionary and whimſical: and I have known ſome excellent perſons who were firſt led by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable genius to ſee the wants of their own hearts, and the utter inſufficiency of the world to fill up the craving void, who, though they became eminent for piety and ſelf-denial, have had their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs abridged, and whoſe minds have contracted ſomething of a monaſtic ſeverity by an unqualified peruſal of Mr. Law.

As the <hi>mortified Apoſtle of the holy and ſelf-denying Baptiſt,</hi> preaching repentance becauſe the kingdom of Heaven is at hand, Mr. Law has no ſuperior.

                     <argument>
                        <p>A worldly ſpirit incompatible with the ſpirit of Chriſtianity.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>Is it not whimſical to hear ſuch complaints againſt the ſtrictneſs of religion as we are frequently hearing, from beings who are voluntarily purſuing, as has been ſhewn in the preceding Chapters, a courſe of life which Faſhion makes infinitely more laborious? How really burdenſome would Chriſtianity be if ſhe enjoined ſuch ſedulous application, ſuch unremitting labours, ſuch a ſucceſſion of fatigues! if religion commanded ſuch hardſhips and ſelf-denial, ſuch days of hurry, ſuch evenings of exertion, ſuch nights of broken reſt, ſuch perpetual ſacrifices of quiet, ſuch exile from family delights, as Faſhion impoſes, then indeed the ſervice of Chriſtianity would no longer merit its preſent appellation of being a <q>
                           <hi>reaſonable</hi> ſervice:</q> then the name of perfect ſlavery might be juſtly applied to that which we are told in the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful language of our church, is <q>a ſervice of perfect freedom:</q> a ſervice, the great object of which is <q>to deliver us from the bondage of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:037996_0365_100FACC3B16566A8"/>
corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A worldly temper, by which I mean a diſpoſition to prefer worldly pleaſures, worldly ſatisfactions, and worldly advantages, to the immortal intereſts of the ſoul; and to let worldly conſiderations actuate us inſtead of the dictates of religion in the concerns of ordinary life; a worldly temper, I ſay, is not, like almoſt any other fault, the effect of paſſion or the conſequence of ſurpriſe when the heart is off its guard. It is not excited incidentally by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of external circumſtances on the infirmity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but it is the vital ſpirit, the eſſential ſoul, the living principle of evil. It is not ſo much an act, as a ſtate of being; not ſo much an occaſional com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, as a tainted conſtitution of mind. If it do not always ſhow itſelf in extraordinary exceſſes, it has no perfect intermiſſion. Even when it is not immediately tempted to break out into overt and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific acts, it is at work within, ſtirring up the heart to diſaffection againſt holineſs, and infuſing a kind of moral diſability to whatever is intrinſically good. It infects and depraves all the powers and faculties of the ſoul; for it operates on the underſtanding by blinding it to whatever is ſpiritually good; on the will, by making it averſe from God; on the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by diſordering and ſenſualizing them; ſo that one may almoſt ſay to thoſe who are under the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:037996_0366_100FACC5384384C8"/>
dominion of this ſpirit, what was ſaid to the hoſts of Joſhua, "Ye <hi>cannot</hi> ſerve the Lord."</p>
                     <p>This worldlineſs of mind is not at all commonly underſtood, and for the following reaſon:—People ſuppoſe that in this world our chief buſineſs is with the things of this world, and that to conduct the buſineſs of this world well, that is, conformably to moral principles, is the chief ſubſtance of moral and true goodneſs. Religion, if introduced at all into the ſyſtem, only makes its occaſional, and if I may ſo ſpeak, its holiday appearance. To bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into every thing, is thought incompatible with the due attention to the things of this life. And ſo it would be, if by religion were meant <hi>talking</hi> about religion. The phraſe, therefore, is: <q>One cannot always be praying; we muſt mind our buſineſs and ſocial duties as well as our devotion.</q> Worldly buſineſs being thus ſubjected to worldly, though in ſome degree moral, maxims, the mind during the conduct of buſineſs grows worldly; and a continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſing worldly ſpirit dims the ſight and relaxes the moral principle on which the affairs of the world are conducted, as well as indiſpoſes the mind for all the exerciſes of devotion.</p>
                     <p>But this temper, as far as relates to <hi>buſineſs,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the ſemblance of goodneſs; ſo that thoſe who have not right views are apt to miſtake the carrying on the affairs of life on a tolerably moral principle,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:037996_0367_100FACC7DEAC14D0"/>
for religion. They do not ſee that the evil lies not in their ſo carrying on buſineſs, but in their not carrying on the things of this life in ſubſerviency to thoſe of eternity; in their not carrying them on with the unintermitting idea of reſponſibility. The evil does not lie in their not being always on their knees, but in their not bringing their religion from the cloſet into the world: in their not bringing the ſpirit of the Sunday's devotions into the tranſactions of the week: in not transforming their religion from a dry, and ſpeculative, and inoperative ſyſtem, into a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and influential, and unceaſing principle of action.</p>
                     <p>Though there are, bleſſed be God! in the moſt exalted ſtations, women who adorn their Chriſtian profeſſion by a conſiſtent conduct; yet are there not others who are labouring hard to unite the irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable intereſts of earth and heaven? who, while they will not relinquiſh one jot of what this world has to beſtow, yet by no means renounce their hopes of a better? who do not think it unreaſonable that their indulging in the fulleſt poſſeſſion of preſent pleaſure ſhould interfere with the moſt certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of future glory? who, after living in the moſt unbounded gratification of eaſe, vanity, and luxury, fancy that heaven muſt be attached of courſe to a life of which Chriſtianity is the outward profeſſion, and which has not been ſtained by any flagrant or diſhonourable act of guilt?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="unknown:037996_0368_100FACCAB0188000"/>
Are there not many who, while they entertain a reſpect for religion, (for I addreſs not the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or the licentious,) while they believe its truths, obſerve its forms, and would be ſhocked not to be thought religious, are yet immerſed in this life of diſqualifying worldlineſs? who, though they make a conſcience of going to the public worſhip once on a Sunday, and are ſcrupulouſly obſervant of the other rites of the Church, yet heſitate not to give up all the reſt of their time to the very ſame purſuits and pleaſures which occupy the hearts and lives of thoſe looſer characters whoſe enjoyment is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by any dread of a future account? and who are acting on the wiſe principle of <q>the children of this world</q> in making the moſt of the preſent ſtate of being from the conviction that there is no other to be expected?</p>
                     <p>It muſt be owned, indeed, that faith in unſeen things is at times ſadly weak and defective even in the truly pious; and that it is ſo, is the ſubject of their grief and humiliation. O! how does the real Chriſtian take ſhame in the coldneſs of his belief, in the lowneſs of his attainments! How deeply does he lament that <q>when he would do good, evil is preſent with him!</q>—<q>that the life he now lives in the fleſh, is</q> not, in the degree it ought to be, "by faith in the ſon of God!" Yet one thing is clear; however weak his belief may ſeem to be, it is
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:037996_0369_100FACCE70654C28"/>
evident that his actions are mainly governed by it; he evinces his ſincerity to others by a life in ſome good degree analogous to the doctrines he profeſſes: while to himſelf he has this conviction, that faint as his confidence may be at times, yet at the worſt of times he would not exchange that faint meaſure of truſt and hope for all the actual pleaſures and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his moſt ſplendid acquaintance; and as a proof of his ſincerity he never ſeeks the cure of his dejection, where they ſeek theirs, in the world, but in God.</p>
                     <p>But as to the faith of worldly perſons, however ſtrong it may be in ſpeculation, however orthodox their creed, one cannot help fearing that it is a little defective in ſincerity: for if there were in the mind a full perſuaſion of the truth of revelation, and of the eternal bliſs it promiſes, would it not be obvious to them that there muſt be more diligence for its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment? We diſcover great ardor in carrying on worldly projects, becauſe we believe the good which we are purſuing is real, and will reward the trouble of the purſuit: we believe that good to be attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by diligence, and prudently proportion our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs to this conviction: and therefore where we ſee perſons profeſſing a lively faith in a better world, yet labouring little to obtain an intereſt in it, can we forbear ſuſpecting that their belief, not only of their own title to eternal happineſs, but of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:037996_0370_100FACD1179765F0"/>
happineſs itſelf, is not well grounded? and that, if they were to "examine themſelves truly," the faith would be found to be much of a piece with the practice?</p>
                     <p>Even that very taſte for enjoyment which leads the perſons in queſtion to poſſeſs themſelves of the qualifications for the pleaſures of the preſent ſcene; that underſtanding which leads them to acquire ſuch talents as may enable them to reliſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of gaiety here, ſhould induce thoſe who are really looking for a future ſtate of happineſs, to wiſh to acquire ſomething of the taſte, and temper, and talents, which may be conſidered as qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for its enjoyment. The neglect to do this muſt proceed from one of theſe two cauſes; either they muſt think their preſent courſe a ſafe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per courſe; or they muſt think that death is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome ſudden and ſurpriſing alteration in the human character. But the office of death is to tranſport us to a new ſtate, not to transform us to a new nature: the ſtroke of death is intended to effect our deliverance out of this world, and our introduction into another; but it is not likely to effect any ſudden and ſurpriſing or total change in our hearts or our taſtes: ſo far from this, that we are aſſured in Scripture, <q>that he that is filthy will be filthy ſtill, and he that is holy will be holy ſtill.</q> Though we believe that death will complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:037996_0371_100FACD2A1B6F370"/>
cleanſe the holy ſoul from its remaining pollutions, that it will exchange defective ſanctification into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity, entangling temptation into complete free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, want and pain into health and fruition, doubts and fears into perfect ſecurity, and oppreſſive wearineſs into everlaſting reſt; yet there is no magic in the wand of death which will convert an unholy ſoul into a holy one. And it is awful to reflect, that ſuch tempers as have the allowed predominance here will maintain it for ever; that ſuch as the will is when we cloſe our eyes upon the things of time, ſuch it will be when we open them on thoſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The mere act of death no more fits us for heaven, than the mere act of the maſon who pulls down our old houſe fits us for a new one. If we die with our hearts running over with the love of the world, there is no promiſe to lead us to expect that we ſhall riſe with them full of the love of God: death indeed will ſhew us to ourſelves ſuch as we are, but will not make us ſuch as we are not: and it will be too late to be acquiring ſelf-knowledge when we can no longer turn it to any account but that of tormenting ourſelves. To illuſtrate this truth ſtill farther by an alluſion familiar to the perſons I addreſs: the drawing up the curtain at the theatre, though it ſerves to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to the entertainments behind it, does not create in us any new faculties to underſtand or to
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:037996_0372_100FACD55559A708"/>
reliſh thoſe entertainments: theſe muſt have been long in acquiring: they muſt have been provided beforehand, and brought with us to the place, if we would reliſh the pleaſures of it; for the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can only operate on that taſte we carry to it. It is too late to be acquiring when we ought to be enjoying.</p>
                     <p>That ſpirit of prayer and praiſe, thoſe diſpoſitions of love, meekneſs, <q>peace, quietneſs, and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</q> that indifference to the faſhion of a world which is paſſing away; that longing after deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from ſin, that deſire of holineſs, together with all the ſpecific marks of our having <q>the fruits of the ſpirit</q> here, muſt ſurely make ſome part of our qualification for the enjoyment of a world, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of which are all ſpiritual. And who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing comparable to the awful ſurpriſe of a ſoul long immerſed in the indulgences of vanity and pleaſure, yet all the while lulled by the ſelf-compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a religion of mere forms: who, while it counted upon heaven as a thing of courſe, had made no preparation for it! Who can conceive any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe comparable to that of ſuch a ſoul on ſhutting its eyes on a world of ſenſe, of which all the objects and delights were ſo congenial to its nature, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on a world of ſpirits of which all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of enjoyment are of a nature new, unknown, ſurpriſing, and ſpecifically different? pleaſures more

inconceivable to its apprehenſion and more unſuitable to its taſte, than the gratifications of one ſenſe are to the organs of another, or than the moſt exquiſite works of genius to abſolute imbecility of mind.</p>
                     <p>While we would with deep humility confeſs that we cannot purchaſe heaven by any works or right diſpoſitions of our own; while we gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it muſt be purchaſed for us by <q>Him who loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his blood;</q> yet let us remember that we have no reaſon to expect we could be capable of enjoying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a heaven ſo purchaſed without heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. When thoſe perſons who are apt to expect as much comfort from religion as if their hearts were not full of the world, now and then, in a fit of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty or low ſpirits, complain that Chriſtianity does not make them as good and as happy as they were led to expect from that aſſurance, that <q>great peace have they who love the Lord,</q> and that <q>they who wait on him ſhall want no manner of thing that is good;</q> when they lament that the paths of religion are not thoſe "paths of pleaſantneſs" they were led to expect; their caſe reminds one of a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated phyſician, who uſed to ſay, that the reaſon why his preſcriptions, which commonly cured the poor and the temperate, did ſo little good among his rich luxurious patients, was, that while he was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to remove the diſeaſe by medicines, of which
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037996_0374_100FACDBAB7EB460"/>
they only took drams, grains, and ſcruples; they were inflaming it by a multiplicity of injurious ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they ſwallowed by ounces, pounds, and pints.</p>
                     <p>Theſe faſhionable Chriſtians ſhould be reminded, that there was no half engagement made for them at their baptiſm; that they are not partly their own and partly their Redeemer's. He that is <q>bought with a price,</q> is the ſole property of the purchaſer. Faith does not conſiſt merely in ſubmitting the opinions of the underſtanding, but the diſpoſitions of the heart: religion is not a ſacrifice of ſentiments, but of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it is not the tribute of fear extorted from a ſlave, but the voluntary homage of love paid by a child.</p>
                     <p>Neither does a Chriſtian's piety conſiſt in living in retreat, and railing at the practices of the world, while, perhaps, her heart is full of the ſpirit of that world at which ſhe is raiſing: but it conſiſts in <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing</hi> the ſpirit of the world and oppoſing its prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, even while her duty obliges her to live in it.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the ſpirit or the love of the world confined to thoſe only who are making a figure in it; nor are its operations bounded by the precincts of the metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, nor the limited regions of firſt-rate rank and ſplendor. She who inveighs againſt the luxury and exceſſes of London, and ſolaces herſelf in her own comparative ſobriety, becauſe her more circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037996_0375_100FACDE4B5D6898"/>
fortune compels her to take up with the ſecond-hand pleaſures of ſucceſſive watering-places, which pleaſures ſhe purſues with avidity, is governed by the ſame ſpirit: and ſhe whoſe ſtill narrower opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtint her to the petty diverſions of her provincial town, if ſhe be buſied in ſwelling and enlarging her ſmaller ſphere of vanity and idleneſs, however ſhe may comfort herſelf with her own comparative good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by railing at the unattainable pleaſures of the watering-place, or the ſtill more unapproachable joys of the capital, is governed by the ſame ſpirit: for ſhe who is as vain, as diſſipated, and as extravagant as actual circumſtances admit, would be as vain, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated, and as extravagant as the gayeſt objects of her invective now are, if ſhe could change places with them. It is not merely by what we do that we can be ſure the ſpirit of the world has no dominion over us, but by fairly conſidering what we ſhould proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do if more were in our power.</p>
                     <p>The worldly Chriſtian, if I may be allowed ſuch a contradiction in terms, muſt not imagine that ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits herſelf of her religious obligations by her mere weekly oblation of prayer. There is no covenant by which communion with God is reſtricted to an hour or two on the Sunday: ſhe does not acquit herſelf by ſetting apart a few particular days in the year for the exerciſe of a periodical devotion, and then flying back to the world as eagerly as if ſhe were reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:037996_0376_100FACE11F191EE0"/>
herſelf with large intereſt for her ſhort fit of ſelf-denial; the ſtream of pleaſure running with a more rapid current, from having been interrupted by this forced obſtruction. And the avidity with which one has ſeen certain perſons of a ſtill leſs correct character than the claſs we have been conſidering, return to a whole year's carnival, after the ſelf-impoſed penance of a Paſſion week, gives a ſhrewd intimation that they conſidered the temporary abſtraction leſs as an act of penitence for the paſt, than as a purchaſe of indemnity for the future. Such bare-weight proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants prudently condition for retaining the Popiſh doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of indulgences, which they buy, not indeed of the late ſpiritual court of Rome, but of that ſecret, ſelf-acquitting judge, which ignorance of its own turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and of the ſtrict requirements of the divine law, has eſtabliſhed ſupreme in the tribunal of every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart.</p>
                     <p>But the practice of ſelf-examination is impeded with one clog, which renders it peculiarly inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to the gay and worldly: for the royal prophet (who was, however, himſelf as likely as any one to be acquainted with the difficulties peculiar to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) has annexed as a concomitant to <q>communing with our own heart,</q> that we ſhould <hi>"be ſtill."</hi> Now this clauſe of the injunction renders the other part of it not a little inconſiſtent with the preſent habits of faſhionable life, of which <hi>ſtillneſs</hi> is clearly
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:037996_0377_100FACE3D01157A0"/>
not one of the conſtituents. It would, however, greatly aſſiſt thoſe who do not altogether decline the practice, if they were to eſtabliſh into a rule the habit of detecting certain ſuſpicious practices, by realizing them, as it were, to their own minds, through the means of drawing them out in detail, and of placing them before their eyes clothed in language; for there is nothing that ſo effectually expoſes an abſurdity which has paſſed muſter for want of ſuch an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as giving it ſhape and form. How many things which now work themſelves into the habit, and paſs current, would then ſhock us by their palpable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency! Who, for inſtance, could ſtand the ſight of ſuch a debtor and creditor account as this:—<hi>Item;</hi> So many card-parties, balls and operas due to me in the following year, for ſo many manuals and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paid beforehand during the laſt ſix days in Lent? With how much indignation ſoever this ſuggeſtion may be treated; whatever offence may be taken at ſuch a combination of the ſerious and the ludicrous; however we may revolt at the idea of ſuch a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with our Maker, when put into ſo many words; does not the habitual courſe of ſome go near to real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize ſuch a ſtatement?</p>
                     <p>But "a Chriſtian's <hi>race,</hi>" as a venerable Prelate<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Hopkins.</note> obſerves; "is not run at ſo many <hi>heats,</hi>" but is a

conſtant courſe and progreſs by which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gaining ground upon ſin, and approaching nearer to the kingdom of God.</p>
                     <p>Am I then ridiculing this pious ſecluſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſinners? Am I then jeſting at that <q>troubled ſpirit</q> which God has declared is his <q>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice?</q> God forbid! Such reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements have been the practice, and continue to be the comfort of ſome of the ſincereſt Chriſtians; and <hi>will</hi> continue to be reſorted to as long as Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, as long as the world, ſhall laſt. It is well to call off the thoughts, even for a ſhort time, not only from ſin and vanity, but even from the lawful purſuits of buſineſs, and the laudable concerns of life; and, at times, to annihilate, as it were, the ſpace which divides us from eternity:
<q>
                           <l>'Tis greatly wiſe to talk with our paſt hours,</l>
                           <l>And aſk them what report they bore to heaven,</l>
                           <l>And how they might have borne more welcome news.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet as to thoſe who ſeek a ſhort annual retreat as a mere form; who dignify with the idea of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous retirement a week in which it is rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable to be ſeen in town; who retire with an unabated reſolution to return to the maxims, the pleaſures, and the ſpirit of that world which they do but mechanically renounce; is it not to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſuch a ſhort ſeceſſion, which does not even pretend to ſubdue the principle, but merely ſuſpends
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:037996_0379_100FACE84B925F30"/>
the act, may only ſerve to ſet a keener edge on the appetite for the pleaſures they are quitting? Is it not to be feared that the bow may fly back with redoubled violence from having been unnaturally bent? that by varniſhing over a life of vanity with the tranſient externals of a formal and temporary piety, they may the more dangerouſly ſkin over the troubleſome ſoreneſs of a tender conſcience, by laying
<q>
                           <l>This flattering unction to the ſoul?</l>
                        </q>
For is it not among the deluſions of a worldly piety to conſider Chriſtianity as a thing which cannot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſafely be omitted, but which is to <hi>be got over;</hi> a certain quantity of which is, as it were, to be taken in the lump, with long intervals between the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? to conſider religion as impoſing a ſet of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, which <hi>muſt</hi> be occaſionally encountered in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to procure a peaceable enjoyment of the long reſpite? that theſe ſevere conditions thus fulfilled, the acquitted Chriſtian having paid the annual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a rigorous requiſition, ſhe may now law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully return to her natural ſtate; and the old reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being adjuſted, ſhe may begin a new ſcore, and receive the reward of her punctual obedience, in the reſumed indulgence of thoſe gratifications which ſhe had for a ſhort time laid aſide as a hard taſk to pleaſe a hard maſter: but this taſk performed, and the maſter appeaſed, the mind may diſcover its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:037996_0380_100FACEC4B9604C8"/>
bent, in joyfully returning to the objects of its real choice? Whereas, is it not clear on the other hand, that if the religious exerciſes had produced the effect which it is the nature of true religion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, the penitent <hi>could</hi> not return with her old ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine alacrity to thoſe habits of the world, from which the pious weekly manuals through which ſhe has been labouring with the punctuality of an alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac as to the day, and the accuracy of a beadroll as to the number, was intended by the devout authors to reſcue their reader?</p>
                     <p>I am far from inſinuating that this literal ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration ought to be prolonged throughout the year, or that all the days of buſineſs are to be made equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days of ſolemnity and continued meditation. This earth is a place in which a much larger portion of a common Chriſtian's time muſt be aſſigned to action than to contemplation. Women of the higher claſs were not ſent into the world to ſhun ſociety, but to improve it. They were not deſigned for the cold and viſionary virtues of ſolitudes and monaſteries, but for the amiable, and endearing, and uſeful offices of ſocial life: they are of a religion which does not impoſe idle auſterities, but enjoins active duties; a religion of which the moſt benevolent actions require to be ſanctified by the pureſt motives; a religion which does not condemn its followers to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively eaſy taſk of ſecluſion from the world, but
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:037996_0381_100FACEEE74EB6B0"/>
aſſigns them the more difficult province of living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted in it; a religion which, while it forbids them to "follow a multitude to do <hi>evil,</hi>" includes in that prohibition the ſin of doing <hi>nothing,</hi> and which moreover enjoins them to be followers of him <q>who went about doing <hi>good.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But may we not reaſonably contend, that though the ſame ſequeſtration is not required, yet that the ſame <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> which one hopes is thought neceſſary by all during the occaſional humiliation, muſt, by every real Chriſtian, be extended through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the periods of the year? And when that is really the caſe, when once the ſpirit of religion ſhall indeed govern the heart, it will not only animate her religious actions and employments, but will gradually extend itſelf to the chaſtiſing her converſation, will diſcipline her thoughts, influence her common buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſanctify her very pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>But it ſhould ſeem that many, who entertain a <hi>general</hi> notion of Chriſtian duty, do not conſider it as of univerſal and unremitting obligation, but rather as a duty binding at times on all, and always on ſome. To the attention of ſuch we would recommend that very explicit addreſs of our Lord on the ſubject of ſelf-denial, the temper directly oppoſed to a worldly ſpirit: <q>And he ſaid unto them ALL, if any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs DAILY.</q> Thoſe who think ſelf-denial
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:037996_0382_100FACF06DEA9F98"/>
not of <hi>univerſal</hi> obligation, will obſerve the word <hi>all,</hi> and thoſe who think the obligation not <hi>conſtant</hi> will attend to the term <hi>daily.</hi> Theſe two little words cut up by the root all the occaſional religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances grafted on a worldly life; all tranſient, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical, and temporary acts of piety, which ſome would commute for habitual thoughtleſſneſs.</p>
                     <p>There is indeed ſcarcely a more pitiable being than one who, inſtead of making her religion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming principle of all ſhe does, has only juſt enough to keep her in continual fear; who drudges through her ſtinted exerciſes with a ſuperſtitious kind of terror, while her general life ſhows that the love of holineſs is not the governing principle in her heart: who ſeems to ſuffer all the pains and penalties of Chriſtianity, but is a ſtranger to <q>that liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt has made us free.</q> Let it not be thought a ludicrous invention, if the author hazard the producing a real illuſtration of theſe remarks, in the inſtance of a lady of this ſtamp, who, returning from church on a very cold day, and remarking with a good deal of ſelf-complacency how much ſhe had ſuffered in the performance of her duty, comforted herſelf with emphatically adding, <q>that ſhe hoped however it would <hi>anſwer.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But there is no permanent comfort in any religion, ſhort of that by which the diligent Chriſtian ſtrives that all his actions ſhall have the love of God for
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:037996_0383_100FACF30F717DC0"/>
their motive, and the glory of God, as well as his own ſalvation, for their end; while to go about to balance one's good and bad actions one againſt the other, and to take comfort in the occaſional predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the former, while the cultivation of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which they ſhould ſpring is neglected, is not the road to all thoſe peaceful fruits of the ſpirit to which true Chriſtianity conducts the humble and penitent believer.</p>
                     <p>But I am aware that a better caſt of characters than thoſe we have been contemplating; that even the amiable and the well-diſpoſed, who, while they want courage to reſiſt what they have too much prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to think right, and too much ſenſe to juſtify, will yet plead for the <hi>palliating</hi> ſyſtem, and accuſe theſe remarks of unneceſſary rigour. They will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <q>that really they are as religious as they can be; they wiſh they were better; they have little ſatisfaction in the life they are leading, yet they cannot break with the world; they cannot fly in the face of cuſtom; it does not become individuals like them to oppoſe the torrent of faſhion.</q> Beings ſo intereſting, abounding with engaging qualities; who not only feel the beauty of goodneſs, but rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the truths of Chriſtianity, and are awfully look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a general judgment, one is grieved to hear lament "that they only do as others do," when they are perhaps themſelves of ſuch rank and importance
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:037996_0384_100FACF5B88F8DA0"/>
that if they would begin to do right, others would be brought to do as they did. One is grieved to hear them indolently aſſert, that <q>they wiſh it were otherwiſe,</q> when they poſſeſs the power to <hi>make</hi> it otherwiſe, by ſetting an example which they know would be followed. One is ſorry to hear them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with declaring, that <q>they have not the courage to be ſingular,</q> when they muſt feel, by ſeeing the influence of their example in worſe things, that there would be no ſuch great ſingularity in piety itſelf, if once <hi>they</hi> became ſincerely pious. Beſides, this diffidence does not break out on other occaſions. They do not bluſh to be quoted as the oppoſers of an old mode or the inventors of a new one. Nor are they equally backward in being the firſt to appear in a ſtrange faſhion, ſuch an one as often excites wonder, and ſometimes even offends againſt delicacy. Let not then diffidence be pleaded as an excuſe only on occaſions wherein courage would be virtue.</p>
                     <p>Will it be thought too harſh a queſtion if we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſk theſe gentle characters who are thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching themſelves in the imaginary ſafety of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding multitudes, and who ſay <q>we only do as others do,</q> whether they are willing to run the tremendous riſk of conſequences, and <hi>to fare as others fare?.</hi>
                     </p>

But while theſe plead the authority of Faſhion as a ſufficient reaſon for their conformity to the world, one who has ſpoken with a paramount authority has poſitively ſaid, "Be ye <hi>not</hi> conformed to the world." Nay, it is urged as the very badge and diſtinction by which the character oppoſite to the Chriſtian is to be marked, <q>that the friendſhip of the world is <hi>enmity</hi> with God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Temptation to conform to the world was never perhaps more irreſiſtible than in the days which immediately preceded the Deluge. And no man could ever have pleaded the <hi>faſhion</hi> in order to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a criminal aſſimilation with the reigning manners, with more propriety than the Patriarch Noah. He had the two grand and contending objects of terror to encounter which we have; the fear of ridicule, and the fear of deſtruction; the dread of ſin, and the dread of ſingularity. Our cauſe of alarm is at leaſt equally preſſing with his; for it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, even while he was actually obeying the Divine command in providing the means of his future ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he <hi>ſaw</hi> any actual ſymptoms of the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin. So that in one ſenſe <hi>he</hi> might have truly pleaded as an excuſe for ſlackneſs of preparation, "that all things continued as they were from the beginning;" while many of us, though the ſtorm is begun, never think of providing the refuge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though we have had a fuller revelation, have ſeen
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:037996_0386_100FACF978850A38"/>
Scripture illuſtrated, prophecy fulfilling, with every awful circumſtance that can either quicken the moſt ſluggiſh remiſſneſs, or confirm the feebleſt faith.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the Patriarch's plea for following the faſhion was ſtronger than you can produce. While you muſt ſee that many are going wrong, he ſaw that none were going right. <q>All fleſh had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his way before God;</q> whilſt, bleſſed be God! you have ſtill inſtances enough of piety to keep you in countenance. While you lament that <hi>the world</hi> ſeduces you, (for every one has a little world of his own,) your world perhaps is only a petty neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, a few ſtreets and ſquares; but the Patriarch had really the contagion of a whole united world to reſiſt; he had literally the example of the whole face of the earth to oppoſe. The "fear of man" alſo would then have been a more pardonable fault, when the lives of the ſame individuals who were likely to excite reſpect or fear was prolonged many ages, than it can be in the ſhort period now aſſigned to human life. How lamentable then that opinion ſhould operate ſo powerfully when it is but the breath of a being ſo frail and ſo ſhort-lived,
<q>
                           <l>That he doth ceaſe to be,</l>
                           <l>Ere one can ſay he is.</l>

You who find it ſo difficult to withſtand the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual allurement of one modiſh acquaintance, would if you had been in the Patriarch's caſe have conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:037996_0387_100FACFB03DC72F8"/>
the ſtruggle to be quite ineffectual, and ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſuppoſed fruitleſſneſs of reſiſtance. <q>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</q> would you not have ſaid? <q>or at moſt my little family of eight perſons can never hope to ſtop this torrent of corruption; I lament the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of oppoſition; I deplore the neceſſity of conformity with the prevailing ſyſtem; but it would be a fooliſh preſumption to hope that <hi>one</hi> family can effect a change in the ſtate of the world.</q> In your own caſe, however, it is not certain to how wide an extent the hearty union of even fewer perſons in ſuch a cauſe might reach: at leaſt is it nothing to do what the Patriarch did? was it nothing to preſerve himſelf from the general deſtruction? was it nothing to deliver his own ſoul? was it nothing to reſcue the ſouls of his whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?</p>
                     <p>A wiſe man will never differ from the world in trifles.

A diſcreet Chriſtian will take due pains to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he is right before he will preſume to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular: but from the inſtant he is perſuaded that the Goſpel is true, and the world of courſe wrong, he will no longer riſk his ſafety by following multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, or his ſoul by ſtaking it on human opinion. All our moſt dangerous miſtakes ariſe from our not conſtantly referring our practice to the ſtandard of ſcripture, inſtead of the mutable ſtandard of human opinion, by which it is impoſſible to fix the real value of characters. For this latter ſtandard in ſome caſes determines thoſe to be good who do not run all the lengths in which the notoriouſly bad allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Goſpel has an univerſal, the world has a local ſtandard of goodneſs: in certain ſocieties certain vices alone are diſhonourable, ſuch as covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and cowardice; while thoſe ſins of which our Saviour has ſaid, that they which commit them "ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God," detract nothing from the reſpect ſome perſons receive. Nay, thoſe very characters whom the Almighty has expreſsly declared "He will Judge<note n="*" place="bottom">Hebrews, xiii. 4.</note>," are received, are admired, are careſſed, in that which calls itſelf the beſt company.</p>
                     <p>But to weigh our actions by one ſtandard now, when we know they will be judged by another
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:037996_0389_100FAD01C98ACF60"/>
hereafter, would be reckoned the height of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in any tranſactions but thoſe which involve the intereſts of eternity. "How readeſt thou?" is a more ſpecific direction than any comparative view of our own habits with the habits of others: and at the final bar it will be of little avail that our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have riſen above thoſe of bad men, if our views and principles ſhall be found to have been in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Nor is <hi>their</hi> practice more commendable, who are ever on the watch to pick out the worſt actions of good men, by way of juſtifying their own conduct on the compariſon. The faults of the beſt men, <q>for there is not a juſt man upon the earth who ſinneth not,</q> can in no wiſe juſtify the errors of the worſt: and it is not invariably the example of even good men that we muſt take for our unerring rule of conduct: nor is it by a ſingle action that either they or we ſhall be judged; for in that caſe who could be ſaved? but it is by the general preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of right principles and good habits; by the predominance of holineſs and righteouſneſs, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in the life, and by the power of humility, faith and love in the heart.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>On the leading doctrines of Chriſtianity.—The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of human nature.—The doctrine of redemption.—The neceſſity of a change of heart, and of the divine influences to produce that change.—With a ſketch of the Chriſtian character.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE author having in this little work taken a view of the falſe notions often imbibed in early life from a bad education, and of their pernicious effects; and having attempted to point out the reſpective reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to theſe; ſhe would now draw all that has been ſaid to a point, and declare plainly what ſhe humbly conceives to be the ſource whence all theſe falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and this wrong conduct really proceed: The prophet Jeremiah ſhall anſwer: <q>It is becauſe they have forſaken the fountain of living waters, and have hewn out to themſelves ciſterns, broken ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns that can hold no water.</q> It is an ignorance paſt belief of what Chriſtianity really is: the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, therefore, and the only remedy that can be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with any proſpect of ſucceſs, is RELIGION, and by Religion ſhe would be underſtood to mean the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="unknown:037996_0391_100FAD05EA1047B0"/>
It has been before hinted, that Religion ſhould be taught at an early period of life; that children ſhould be <hi>brought up</hi> 
                        <q>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</q> The <hi>manner</hi> in which they ſhould be taught has likewiſe with great plainneſs been ſuggeſted; that it ſhould be done in ſo lively and familiar a manner as to make Religion amiable, and her ways to appear, what they really are, <q>ways of pleaſantneſs.</q> And a ſlight ſketch has been given of the genius of Chriſtianity, by which her amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would more clearly appear. But this, being a ſubject of ſuch vaſt importance, compared with which every other ſubject ſinks into nothing; it ſeems not ſufficient to ſpeak on the doctrines and duties of Chriſtianity in <hi>detached</hi> parts, but it is of importance to point out, though in a brief manner, the mutual dependence of one doctrine upon another, and the influence which theſe doctrines have upon the heart and life, ſo that the <hi>duties</hi> of Chriſtianity may be ſeen to grow out of its <hi>doctrines:</hi> by which it will appear that Chriſtian virtue differs <hi>eſſentially</hi> from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: it is of a quite different kind: the plant itſelf is different, it comes from a different root, and grows in a different ſoil.</p>
                     <p>It will be ſeen how the humbling doctrine of the corruption of human nature, which has followed from the corruption of our firſt parents, makes way for the bright diſplay of redeeming love. How from
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:037996_0392_100FAD08D0D616D0"/>
the abaſing thought that <q>we are all as ſheep going aſtray, every one in his own way:</q> that none <hi>can</hi> return to the ſhepherd of our ſouls, <q>except the Father draw him:</q> that <q>the natural man <hi>cannot</hi> receive the things of the ſpirit, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned:</q> how from this humiliating view of the <hi>helpleſſneſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>corruption</hi> of human nature, we are to turn to that animating doctrine, the offer of <hi>divine aſſiſtance.</hi> So that, though human nature will appear from this view in a deeply degraded ſtate, and conſequently <hi>all</hi> have cauſe for humility, yet not one has cauſe for deſpair: the diſeaſe indeed is dreadful, but a phyſician is at hand, both able and willing to ſave us: though we are naturally <q>without ſtrength, our help is laid upon one that is mighty.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſhould obſerve then, that the doctrines of our Saviour are, if I may ſo ſpeak, like his coat, all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into one piece. We ſhould get ſuch a view of their reciprocal dependence as to be perſuaded that without a deep ſenſe of our own corruptions we can never ſeriouſly believe in a Saviour, becauſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and acceptance belief in Him muſt always ariſe from the conviction of our want of Him; that without a firm perſuaſion that the Holy Spirit can alone reſtore our fallen nature, repair the ruins of ſin, and renew the image of God upon the heart, we never ſhall be brought to ſerious, humble prayer
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:037996_0393_100FAD0B7216E040"/>
for repentance and reſtoration; and that, without this repentance there is no ſalvation: for though Chriſt has died for us, and conſequently to Him alone we muſt look as a Saviour, yet he has himſelf declared that he will ſave none but true penitents.</p>

                        <head>ON THE DOCTRINE OF HUMAN CORRUPTION.</head>
                        <p>To come now to a more particular ſtatement of theſe doctrines.—When an important edifice is about to be erected, a wiſe builder will dig deep, and look well to the foundations, knowing that without this the fabric will not be likely to ſtand. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian religion, out of which the whole ſtructure may be ſaid to ariſe, appears to be the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the fall of man from his original ſtate of righteouſneſs; and of the corruption and helpleſſneſs of human nature, which are the conſequences of this fall, and which is the natural ſtate of every one born into the world. To this doctrine it is important to conciliate the minds, more eſpecially of young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are peculiarly diſpoſed to turn away from it as a moroſe, unamiable, and gloomy idea: they are apt to accuſe thoſe who are more ſtrict and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, of unneceſſary ſeverity, and to ſuſpect them of thinking unjuſtly ill of mankind. Some of the reaſons which prejudice the inexperienced againſt the doctrine in queſtion appear to be the following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="179" facs="unknown:037996_0394_100FAD0F5B2B4AB0"/>
Young perſons themſelves have ſeen little of the world. In pleaſurable ſociety the world puts on its moſt amiable appearance; and that ſoftneſs and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banity which prevail, particularly amongſt perſons of faſhion, are liable to be miſtaken for more than they are really worth. The oppoſition to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in the young, ariſes partly from ingenuouſneſs of heart, partly from a habit of indulging themſelves in favourable ſuppoſitions reſpecting the world, rather than of purſuing truth, which is always the grand thing to be purſued; and partly from the popularity of the tenet, <hi>that every body is ſo wonderfully good!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This error in youth has however a ſtill deeper foundation, which is their not having a right ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of moral good and evil, in conſequence of their already partaking of the very corruption which is ſpoken of; they are therefore apt to have no very ſtrict ſenſe of duty, or of the neceſſity of a right and religious motive to every act.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, young people uſually do not know themſelves. Not having yet been much expoſed to temptation, owing to the prudent reſtraints in which they have been kept, they little ſuſpect to what lengths in vice they themſelves are liable to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, nor how far others actually are carried who are ſet free from thoſe reſtraints.</p>
                        <p>Having laid down theſe as ſome of the cauſes of error on this point, I proceed to obſerve on what ſtrong grounds the doctrine itſelf ſtands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="180" facs="unknown:037996_0395_100FAD11F52681A0"/>
Profane hiſtory abundantly confirms this truth: the hiſtory of the world being in fact little elſe than the hiſtory of the crimes of the human race. Even though the annals of remote ages lie ſo involved in obſcurity, that ſome degree of uncertainty attaches itſelf to many of the events recorded, yet this one melancholy truth is always clear, that moſt of the miſeries which have been brought upon mankind, have proceeded from this general depravity.</p>
                        <p>The world we now live in furniſhes abundant proof of this truth. In a world formed on the deceitful theory of thoſe who aſſert the innocence and dignity of man, almoſt all the profeſſions, ſince they would have been rendered uſeleſs by ſuch a ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, would not have exiſted. Without ſin we may nearly preſume there would have been no ſickneſs; ſo that every medical profeſſor is a ſtanding evidence of this ſad truth. Sin not only brought ſickneſs but death into the world; conſequently every funeral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a more irrefragable argument than a thouſand ſermons. Had man perſevered in his original inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, there could have been no litigation, for there would be no conteſts about property in a world where none would be inclined to attack it. Profeſſors of law, therefore, from the attorney who proſecutes for a treſpaſs, to the pleader who defends a criminal, or the judge who condemns him, loudly confirm the doctrine. Every victory by ſea or land ſhould teach
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:037996_0396_100FAD1381B61858"/>
us to rejoice with humiliation, for conqueſt itſelf brings a terrible, though ſplendid atteſtation to the truth of the fall of man.</p>
                        <p>Even thoſe who deny the doctrine, act univerſally more or leſs on the principle. Why do we all ſecure our houſes with bolts, and bars, and locks? Do we take theſe ſteps to defend our lives or property from any <hi>particular</hi> fear? from any ſuſpicion of this neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or that ſervant, or the other invader? No:—It is from a practical conviction of the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity; from a conſtant, pervading, but undefined dread of impending evil ariſing from the ſenſe of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral corruption. Are not priſons built, and laws enacted, on the ſame practical principle?</p>
                        <p>But not to deſcend to the more degraded part of our ſpecies. Why in the faireſt tranſaction of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is nothing executed without bonds, receipts, and notes of hand? Why does not a perfect confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>dignity of human nature</hi> aboliſh all theſe ſecurities; if not between enemies, or people indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to each other, yet at leaſt between friends and kindred, and the moſt honourable connections? Why, but becauſe of that univerſal ſuſpicion between man and man, which, by all we ſee, and hear, and feel, is become interwoven with our very make? Though we do not entertain any <hi>individual</hi> ſuſpicion, nay, though we have the ſtrongeſt <hi>perſonal</hi> confidence, yet the acknowledged principle of conduct has this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:037996_0397_100FAD178F292638"/>
for its baſis. <q>I will take a receipt, though it were from my brother,</q> is the eſtabliſhed voice of mankind; or, as I have heard it more artfully put, by a fallacy of which the very diſguiſe diſcovers the principle, <q>Think every man honeſt, but deal with him as if you knew him to be otherwiſe.</q> And as, in a ſtate of innocence, the beaſts, it is preſumed, would not have bled for the ſuſtenance of man, ſo their parchments would not have been wanted as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his ſecurity againſt his fellow man.<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Butler diſtinctly declares this truth to be evident, from experience as well as Revelation, "that this world exhibits as idea of a RUIN;" and <hi>he</hi> will hazard much who ventures to aſſert that Butler defended Chriſtianity upon principles unconſonant to <hi>reaſon, philoſophy,</hi> or <hi>ſound experience.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>But the grand arguments for this doctrine muſt be drawn from the Holy Scriptures: and theſe, beſides implying it almoſt continually, expreſsly aſſert it; and that in inſtances too numerous to be all of them brought forward here. Of theſe may I be allowed to produce a few? <q>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually:</q>—<q>God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for <hi>all fleſh</hi> had corrupted his way upon the earth. And it <hi>repented</hi> the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it <hi>grieved him at his</hi>
                              <pb n="183" facs="unknown:037996_0398_100FAD1A2DA8EB48"/>
                              <hi>heart.</hi>

                           </q> This is a picture of mankind <hi>before</hi> the flood; and the doctrine receives additional confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture, when it ſpeaks of the times which followed after that tremendous judgment had taken place. The Pſalms abound in lamentations on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of man. <q>They are <hi>all</hi> gone aſide; there is <hi>none</hi> that doeth good, no not <hi>one.</hi>
                           </q>—<q>In <hi>thy</hi> ſight,</q> ſays David, addreſſing the Moſt High, "ſhall <hi>no man living</hi> be juſtified." Job, in his uſual lofty ſtrain of interrogation, aſks, <q>What is man that he ſhould be clean, and he that is born of a woman that he ſhould be righteous? Behold the heavens are not clean in <hi>His</hi> ſight, how much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity like water?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor do the Scriptures ſpeak of this corruption as ariſing only from occaſional temptation, or from mere extrinſic cauſes. The wiſe man tells us, that <q>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs is bound up in the <hi>heart of a child:</hi>
                           </q> the prophet Jeremiah aſſures us, <q>the <hi>heart</hi> is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked:</q> and David plainly ſtates the doctrine: <q>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me.</q> Can language be more explicit?</p>
                        <p>The New Teſtament corroborates the Old. Our Lord's reproof of Peter ſeems to take the doctrine for
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:037996_0399_100FAD1BB54FE360"/>
granted: <q>Thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God but thoſe that be of <hi>man;</hi>
                           </q> clearly intimating, that the <hi>ways of man</hi> are oppoſite to the ways of God. And our Saviour, in that affecting diſcourſe to his diſciples, obſerves to them that, as they were by his grace made <hi>different</hi> from others, therefore they muſt expect to be hated by thoſe who were ſo unlike them. And it ſhould be particularly obſerved, as another proof that the world is wicked, that our Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered "<hi>the world</hi>" as oppoſed to him and to his diſciples. <q>If <hi>ye</hi> were of the world, the world would love its own; but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</q>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">John, xv. 19.</note> St. John, writing to his Chriſtian church, ſtates the ſame truth: <q>We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Man in his natural and unbelieving ſtate is likewiſe repreſented as in a ſtate of <hi>guilt,</hi> and under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Almighty God. <q>He that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God <hi>abideth</hi> on him.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here, however, if it be objected, that the heathen who never heard of the Goſpel will not aſſuredly be judged by it; the Saviour's anſwer to ſuch curious inquirers concerning the ſtate of others is, <q>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</q> It is enough for us
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:037996_0400_100FAD1E53C9CFA8"/>
to believe that God will judge all men according to their opportunities. But with whatever mercy he may judge thoſe who, living in a land of darkneſs, are without knowledge of his revealed law, <hi>our</hi> buſineſs is not with them, but with ourſelves. It is <hi>our</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to conſider what mercy he will extend to thoſe who, living in a Chriſtian country, abounding with means and ordinances, where the Goſpel is preached in its purity; it is <hi>our</hi> buſineſs to inquire how he will deal with thoſe who ſhut their eyes to its beams, who cloſe their ears to its truths. For an unbeliever, who has paſſed his life in the meridian of Scripture light, or for an outward but unfruitful profeſſor of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, I know not what hope the Goſpel holds out.</p>
                        <p>The natural ſtate of man is again thus deſcribed: <q>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God; (awful thought!) for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed <hi>can</hi> be. So then they that are in the fleſh <hi>cannot</hi> pleaſe God.</q> What the Apoſtle means <hi>by being in the fleſh,</hi> is evident by what follows; for ſpeaking of thoſe whoſe hearts were changed by Divine grace, he ſays, <q>But ye are <hi>not</hi> in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you:</q> that is, you are now not in your natural ſtate: the change that has paſſed on your minds by the influence of the Spirit of God is ſo great, that your ſtate may properly be called being in the ſpirit. It may be further obſerved that the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:037996_0401_100FAD20F86FC4E8"/>
ſame Apoſtle, writing to the churches of Galatia, tells them, that the natural corruption of the human heart is continually oppoſing the ſpirit of holineſs which influences the regenerate. <q>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other:</q> which paſſage by the way, at the ſame time that it proves the corruption of the heart, proves the neceſſity of divine influences. And the Apoſtle, with reſpect to himſelf, freely confeſſes and deeply laments the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this corrupt principle: <q>O wretched man that I am!</q> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>It has been objected by ſome who have oppoſed this doctrine, that the ſame Scriptures which ſpeak of mankind as being <hi>ſinners,</hi> ſpeak of ſome as being <hi>righteous;</hi> and hence they would argue, that though this depravity of human nature may be <hi>general,</hi> yet it cannot be <hi>univerſal.</hi> This objection when, examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſerves only, like all other objections againſt the truth, to eſtabliſh that which it was intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. For what do the Scriptures aſſert reſpecting the righteous? That there are ſome whoſe principles, views, and conduct, are ſo different from the reſt of the world, and from what theirs themſelves once were, that theſe perſons are honoured with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar title of the "ſons of God." But no where do the Scriptures aſſert that even theſe are <hi>ſinleſs;</hi> on the contrary their <hi>faults</hi> are frequently mentioned;
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:037996_0402_100FAD24AB014AE8"/>
and perſons of this claſs are moreover repreſented as thoſe on whom a great <hi>change</hi> has paſt: as having been formerly "dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;" but as "being now <hi>called out</hi> of darkneſs into light;" as "<hi>tranſlated</hi> into the kingdom of God's dear Son;" as "having <hi>paſſed</hi> from death to life." And St. Paul put this matter paſt all doubt, by expreſsly aſſerting, that <q>
                              <hi>they were all</hi> by nature the children of wrath even as others.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>It might be well to aſk certain perſons who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the doctrine in queſtion, and who alſo ſeem to talk as if they thought there were many ſinleſs peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world, how they expect that ſuch ſinleſs people will be ſaved? (though indeed to talk of an <hi>innocent</hi> perſon being <hi>ſaved</hi> is a palpable contradiction in terms; it is talking of curing a man already in health.) "Undoubtedly," ſuch will ſay, <q>they will be received into thoſe abodes of bliſs prepared for the righteous.</q>—But be it remembered, there is but <hi>one way</hi> to theſe bliſsful abodes, and that is, through Jeſus Chriſt: <q>For there is none other name given among men whereby we muſt be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> If we aſk whom did Chriſt come to ſave? the Scripture directly anſwers, <q>He came into the world to ſave <hi>ſinners:</hi>

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:037996_0403_100FAD2632B4B298"/>
which no man could number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes:</q> that one of the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants informed him who they were: <q>Theſe are they who come out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; therefore are they before the throne of God, and ſerve Him day and night in his Temple; and He that ſitteth on the throne ſhall dwell among them; they ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhall the ſun light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb which is in the midſt of them ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them to living fountains of waters, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>We may gather from this deſcription what theſe glorious and happy beings once were: they were <hi>ſinful</hi> creatures: their robes were not <hi>ſpotleſs:</hi> 
                           <q>They had <hi>waſhed</hi> them, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</q> They are likewiſe generally repreſented as having been once a <hi>ſuffering</hi> people: they came out of great tribulation. They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as having overcome the great tempter of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, "by the blood of the Lamb*:" as they who
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:037996_0404_100FAD290C328730"/>
"follow the Lamb whereſoever he goeth:" as <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from among men.</q>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xiv. 4.</note> And their <hi>employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the regions of bliſs is a farther confirmation of the doctrine of which we are treating. <q>The great multitude,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c. we are told, <q>ſtood and cried with a loud voice, Salvation to our God, who ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb!</q> Here we ſee they aſcribe their ſalvation to Chriſt, and conſequently their preſent happineſs to his atoning blood. And in another of their celeſtial anthems, they ſay in like manner: <q>Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by Thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation.</q>
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. v. 9.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>By all this it is evident, that men of any other deſcription than <hi>redeemed ſinners</hi> muſt gain admittance to heaven ſome other way than that which the Scriptures point out; and alſo that when they ſhall arrive there, ſo different will be their employment, that they muſt have an anthem peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is more adapted to <q>the caſting down of high imaginations,</q> and to promote humility, than this reflection, that heaven is always in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pointed out not as the reward of the innocent,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:037996_0405_100F7C73825847E0"/>
but as the hope of the penitent. This, while it is calculated to "exclude boaſting," the temper the moſt oppoſite to the Goſpel, is yet the moſt ſuited to afford comfort; for were heaven promiſed as the reward of innocence, who could attain to it? but being, as it is, the promiſed portion of faith and repentance, who is compelled to miſs it?</p>
                        <p>It is urged that the belief of this doctrine of our corruption produces many ill effects, and therefore it ſhould be diſcouraged.—That it does <hi>not</hi> produce thoſe ill effects, when not miſunderſtood or partially repreſented, we ſhall attempt to ſhow: at the ſame time let it be obſerved, if it be really <hi>true</hi> we muſt not reject it on account of any of theſe ſuppoſed ill conſequences. Truth may often be attended with diſagreeable effects, but if it be truth it muſt ſtill be purſued. If, for inſtance, treaſon ſhould exiſt in a country, every one knows the diſagreeable effects which will follow ſuch a conviction; but our <hi>not believing</hi> ſuch treaſon to exiſt, will not prevent ſuch effect following it; on the contrary, our believing it may prevent the conſequences.</p>
                        <p>It is objected, that this doctrine debaſes human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that finding fault with the building is only another way of finding fault with the architect. To the firſt part of this objection it may be remarked, that if man be really a corrupt, fallen being, it is proper to repreſent him as ſuch: the fault then lies
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:037996_0406_100FAD2FA16554E8"/>
in the <hi>man,</hi> and not in the <hi>doctrine,</hi> which only ſtates the <hi>truth.</hi> As to the inference which is ſuppoſed to follow, namely, that it throws the fault upon the Creator, it proceeds upon the falſe ſuppoſition that man's preſent corrupt ſtate is the ſtate in which he was originally created: and alſo that God has left him unavoidably to periſh in it, whereas although "in Adam we die, in Chriſt we ſhall be made alive."</p>
                        <p>It is likewiſe objected, that as this doctrine muſt give us ſuch a bad opinion of mankind, it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently produce ill-will, hatred, and ſuſpicion. But it ſhould be remembered, that it gives us no worſe an opinion of other men than it gives us of ourſelves; ſuch views of ourſelves have a very ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effect, inaſmuch as they have a tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>humility;</hi> and humility is not likely to produce ill-will to others, <q>for only from pride cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:</q> and as to the views it gives us of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it repreſents us as <hi>follow ſufferers;</hi> and ſurely the conſideration that we are <hi>companions in miſery</hi> is not calculated to produce hatred. The truth is, theſe effects have actually followed from a falſe and partial view of the ſubject.</p>
                        <p>Old perſons who have ſeen much of the world, and who have little religion, are apt to be ſtrong in their belief of man's actual corruption; but not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up on Chriſtian grounds, this belief in them
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:037996_0407_100FAD312A603C70"/>
ſhows itſelf in a narrow and malignant temper; in uncharitable judgment, and harſh opinions.</p>
                        <p>Suſpicion and hatred alſo are the uſes to which Rochefaucault and the other French philoſophers have converted this doctrine: their acute minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitively found the corruption of man, and they ſaw it without its concomitant and correcting doctrine: they allowed man to be a depraved creature, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed his high original: they found him in a low ſtate, but did not conceive of him as having fallen from a better. They repreſent him rather as a brute than an apoſtate; not taking into the account that his preſent degraded nature and depraved faculties are not his original ſtate: that he is not ſuch as he came out of the hands of his Creator, but ſuch as he has been made by ſin. Nor do they know that he has not even now loſt all remains of his primitive dignity, but is ſtill capable of a reſtoration more glorious
<q>
                              <l>Than is dreamt of in their philoſophy.</l>
                           </q>
Perhaps, too, they know from what they <hi>feel,</hi> all the <hi>evil</hi> to which man is inclined; but they do not know, for they have not felt, all the good of which he is capable by the ſuperinduction of the divine principle: thus they aſperſe human nature inſtead of repreſenting it fairly, and in ſo doing it is <hi>they</hi> who calumniate the great Creator.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="193" facs="unknown:037996_0408_100FAD33C92D8878"/>
The doctrine of corruption is likewiſe accuſed of being a gloomy, diſcouraging doctrine, and an enemy to joy and comfort. Now ſuppoſe this objection true in its fulleſt extent. Is it any way unreaſonable that a being fallen into a ſtate of ſin, under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Almighty God, ſhould feel <hi>ſeriouſly alarmed</hi> at being in ſuch a ſtate? Is the condemned criminal blamed becauſe he is not <hi>merry?</hi> And would it be eſteemed a kind action to perſuade him that he is <hi>not</hi> condemned in order to make him ſo?</p>
                        <p>But this charge is <hi>not</hi> true in the ſenſe intended by thoſe who bring it forward. Thoſe who believe this doctrine are <hi>not</hi> the moſt gloomy people. When, indeed, any one by the influence of the Holy Spirit is brought to view his ſtate as it really is, a ſtate of guilt and danger, it is natural that <hi>fear</hi> ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in his mind, but it is ſuch a fear as impels him "to flee from the wrath to come:" it is ſuch a fear as moved Noah to <q>prepare an ark to the ſaving of his houſe.</q> Such an one will likewiſe feel <hi>ſorrow;</hi> not however <q>the ſorrow of the world which worketh death,</q> but that godly ſorrow which worketh repentance: ſuch an one is in a proper ſtate to receive the glorious doctrine we are next about to contemplate; namely,</p>

                        <head>THAT GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVED ON HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE.</head>
                        <p>Of this doctrine it is of the laſt importance to form juſt views, for as it is the only doctrine which can keep the humble penitent from deſpair, ſo, on the other hand, great care muſt be taken that falſe views of it do not lead us to preſumption. In order to underſtand it rightly, we muſt not fill our minds with our own reaſonings upon it, which is the way in which ſome good people have been miſled, but we muſt betake ourſelves to the Scriptures, wherein we ſhall find the doctrine ſtated ſo plainly as to ſhew that the miſtakes have not ariſen from a want of clearneſs in the ſcriptures, but from a deſire to make it bend to ſome favourite notions. While it has been rejected by ſome, it has been ſo mutilated by others, as hardly to retain any reſemblance to the Scripture doctrine of redemption. We are told in the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſage laſt quoted <hi>its ſource,</hi>—the love of God to a loſt world:—<hi>who</hi> the Redeemer was—the Son of God:—the <hi>end</hi> for which this plan was formed and executed.—<q>That whoſoever believed in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</q> There is nothing ſurely in all this to promote gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:037996_0410_100FAD3903EFCC18"/>
If kindneſs and mercy have a tendency to win and warm the heart, here is every incentive to joy and cheerfulneſs. Chriſtianity looks kindly towards all, and with peculiar tenderneſs on ſuch, as, from humbling views of their own unworthineſs, might be led to fancy themſelves excluded:—we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly told, that "Chriſt died for <hi>all:</hi>"—that <q>he taſted death for <hi>every</hi> man:</q>—that <q>he died for the ſins of the <hi>whole world.</hi>
                           </q> Accordingly he has commanded that his Goſpel ſhould be <q>preached to <hi>every creature;</hi>
                           </q> which is in effect declaring that not a ſingle human being is excluded; for to preach the Goſpel is to offer a Saviour:—and the Saviour in the plaineſt language offers himſelf to all,—declaring to "all the ends of the earth"—<q>look unto me and be ſaved.</q> It is therefore an undeniable truth, that no one will periſh for <hi>want</hi> of a Saviour, but for <hi>rejecting</hi> him.</p>
                        <p>But to ſuppoſe that becauſe Chriſt has <hi>died</hi> for the "ſins of the whole world," the whole world will therefore be <hi>ſaved,</hi> is a moſt fatal miſtake: in the ſame book which tells us that "Chriſt died for all," we have likewiſe this awful admonition: <q>Strait is the gate, and <hi>few</hi> there be that find it;</q> which, whether it be underſtood of the immediate reception of the Goſpel, or of the final uſe which was too likely to be made of it, gives no encouragement to hope that <hi>all</hi> will entitle themſelves to its reward.
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:037996_0411_100FAD3B9FAC5278"/>

                        <p>It is much to be feared that ſome, in their zeal to defend the Goſpel doctrines of free grace, have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially injured the Goſpel doctrine of holineſs: ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Chriſt has done all in ſuch a ſenſe, as that there is nothing left for us to do.—But do the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hold out this language?—<q>Come, for all things are ready,</q> is the Goſpel call; in which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that at the ſame time that it tells us that <q>all things are ready,</q> it nevertheleſs tells us that we muſt "<hi>come.</hi>" Food being <hi>provided</hi> for us will not benefit us except we <hi>partake</hi> of it.—It will not avail us that "Chriſt our paſſover is <hi>ſacrificed</hi> for us," unleſs "we <hi>keep</hi> the feaſt."—We muſt <hi>make uſe</hi> of <q>the fountain which is opened,</q> if we would be <hi>purified.</hi>

                        <p>It is the more neceſſary to inſiſt on this in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, as there is a worldly and faſhionable, as well as a low and ſectarian Antinomianiſm: there la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably

prevails in the world an unwarranted aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Salvation, founded on a ſlight, vague, and general confidence in what Chriſt has done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, as if the great object of his doing and ſuffering had been to emancipate <hi>us</hi> from all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to duty and obedience; and as if, becauſe he died for ſinners, we might therefore ſafely and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably go on to live in ſin, contenting ourſelves with now and then a tranſient, formal, and unmeaning avowal of our unworthineſs, our obligation, and the all-ſufficiency of <hi>his</hi> atonement. By this quit-rent, of which all the coſt conſiſts in the acknowledgment, the ſenſual, the worldly, and the vain, hope to find a refuge in heaven, when driven from the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world. But this indolent Chriſtianity is no where taught in the Bible. The faith inculcated <hi>there</hi> is not a lazy, profeſſional faith, but that faith which "produceth <hi>obedience,</hi>" that faith which "worketh by love," that faith of which the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal language is—"<hi>Strive</hi> that you may enter in;"—"So <hi>run</hi> that you may obtain;"—<q>So <hi>fight</hi> that you may lay hold on eternal life:</q>—that faith which directs us "not to be weary in well doing;"—which ſays, "<hi>Work</hi> out your own ſalvation:"—never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting at the ſame time <q>that it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do.</q>—Are thoſe rich ſupplies of grace which the Goſpel offers; are thoſe abundant aids of the ſpirit which it promiſes,

tendered to the <hi>ſlothful?</hi>—No.—God will have all his gifts improved. Grace muſt be uſed, or it will be withdrawn.

                        <head>THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.</head>
                        <p>We are perpetually reminded of our utter inability to help ourſelves, that we may ſet the higher value on thoſe gracious aids which are held out to us. We are taught that <q>we are not ſufficient to <hi>think</hi> any thing as of ourſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</q> And when we are told that <q>if we live after the fleſh, we ſhall die,</q> we are at the ſame time reminded, that it is <q>through the <hi>ſpirit</hi> that we muſt mortify the deeds of the body.</q> We are likewiſe caution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we "grieve not the Holy Spirit of God:" that we "quench not the Spirit." By all which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and many others of like import, we are taught that, while we are to aſcribe with humble gratitude every good thought, word, and work, to the influence of the Holy Spirit, we are not to look on ſuch influences as ſuperſeding our own exertions: and it is plain that we <hi>may</hi> reject the gracious offers of aſſiſtance, ſince otherwiſe there would be no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to caution us <hi>not</hi> to do it. The Scriptures have illuſtrated this in terms which are familiar indeed, but which are therefore only the more condeſcending, and endearing. <q>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</q> Obſerve, it is not ſaid if
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:037996_0416_100FAD4A1BA73558"/>
any man will not liſten to me, I will force open the door. But if we refuſe admittance to ſuch a gueſt, we muſt abide by the conſequences.</p>
                        <p>This ſublime doctrine of divine aſſiſtance is the more to be prized, not only on account of our own helpleſſneſs, but from the additional conſideration of the powerful adverſary with whom the Chriſtian has to contend: an article of our faith by the way, which is growing into general diſrepute among the politer claſſes of ſociety. Nay, there is a kind of ridicule attached to the very ſuggeſtion of the ſubject, as if it were exploded on full proof of its being an abſolute abſurdity, utterly repugnant to the liberal ſpirit of an enlightened age. And it requires no ſmall neatneſs of expreſſion and periphraſtic ingenuity to get the very mention tolerated.—<hi>I mean the Scripture doctrine of the exiſtence and power of our great ſpiritual enemy.</hi> It is conſidered by the faſhionable ſceptic as a vulgar invention, which ought to be baniſhed with the belief in dreams, and ghoſts, and witchcraft:—by the faſhionable Chriſtian, as an ingenious allegory, but not as a literal truth; and by almoſt all, as a doctrine which, when it happens to be introduced at Church, has at leaſt nothing to do with the <hi>pews,</hi> but is by common conſent made over to the <hi>aiſles,</hi> if indeed it muſt be retained at all.</p>
                        <p>May I, with great humility and reſpect, preſume to ſuggeſt to our divines that they would do well not
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:037996_0417_100FAD4CB8A8E5E8"/>
to lend their countenance to theſe modiſh curtailments of the Chriſtian faith; nor to ſhun the introduction of this doctrine when it conſiſts with their ſubject to bring it forward. A truth which is ſeldom brought before the eye, imperceptibly grows leſs and leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; and if it be an unpleaſing truth, we grow more and more reconciled to its abſence, till at length its intruſion becomes offenſive, and we learn in the end to renounce what we at firſt only neglected. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome coarſe and ranting enthuſiaſts have been fond of uſing tremendous terms with a violence and frequency, which might make it ſeem to be a gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to them to denounce judgments and anticipate torments, can <hi>their</hi> coarſeneſs or vulgarity make a true doctrine falſe, or an important one trifling? If ſuch preachers have given offence by their uncouth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of managing an awful doctrine, that indeed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes a caution to treat the ſubject more diſcreetly, but it is no juſt reaſon for avoiding the doctrine. For to keep a truth out of ſight becauſe it has been abſurdly handled or ill-defended, might in time be aſſigned as a reaſon for keeping back, one by one, every doctrine of our holy Church; for which of them has not had imprudent advocates or weak champions?</p>
                        <p>Be it remembered that the doctrine in queſtion is not only interwoven by alluſion, implication, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect aſſertion throughout the whole Scripture, but
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:037996_0418_100FAD4E43B2DA88"/>
that it ſtands prominently perſonified at the opening of the New as well as the Old Teſtament. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's temptation of our Lord, in which he is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented figuratively, but viſibly and palpably, ſtands on the ſame ground of authority with other events which are received without repugnance. And it may not be an unuſeful obſervation to remark, that the very refuſing to believe in an evil ſpirit, may be conſidered as one of his own ſuggeſtions; for there is not a more dangerous illuſion than to believe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the reach of illuſions, nor a more alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temptation than to fancy that we are not liable to be tempted.</p>
                        <p>But the dark cloud raiſed by this doctrine will be diſpelled by the cheering certainty that our bleſſed Saviour having himſelf <q>been tempted like as we are, is able to deliver thoſe who are tempted.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to return.—From this imperfect ſketch we may ſee how ſuitable the religion of Chriſt is to fallen man! How exactly it meets every want! No one needs now periſh becauſe he is a ſinner, provided he be willing to forſake his ſins; for <q>Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners:</q> and <q>He is now exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance and forgiveneſs of ſin.</q> Which paſſage, be it obſerved, may be conſidered as pointing out to us the <hi>order</hi> in which he beſtows his bleſſings; he gives firſt <hi>repentance,</hi> and then <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi>
                        </p>

We may likewiſe ſee how much the character of a true Chriſtian riſes above every other: that there is a wholeneſs, an integrity, a completeneſs in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian character: that a few natural, pleaſing qualities, not caſt in the mould of the Goſpel, are but as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fragments, or well-turned ſingle limbs, which for want of that beauty which ariſes from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of parts, for want of that connection of the members with the living head, are of little compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive excellence. There may be amiable qualities which are not Chriſtian graces: and the Apoſtle, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enumerating every ſeparate article of attack or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with which a Chriſtian warrior is to be accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, ſums up the matter by directing that we put on "the <hi>whole</hi> armour of God." And this <hi>completeneſs</hi> is inſiſted on by all the Apoſtles. One prays that his converts may <q>ſtand <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>complete</hi> in the whole will of God:</q> another enjoins that they be <q>
                              <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> wanting nothing.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now we are not to ſuppoſe that they expected any convert to be <hi>without faults;</hi> they knew too well the conſtitution of the human heart; but Chriſtians muſt have no fault in their <hi>principle;</hi> their views muſt be direct, their propoſed <hi>ſcheme</hi> muſt be fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; their <hi>intention</hi> muſt be ſingle; their <hi>ſtandard</hi> muſt be lofty; their <hi>object</hi> muſt be right; their <q>
                              <hi>mark</hi> muſt be the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</q>—There muſt be no <hi>allowed</hi> evil, no <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted</hi>
                           <pb n="205" facs="unknown:037996_0420_100FAD55049781B0"/>
defection, no <hi>tolerated</hi> impurity. Though they do not riſe as high as they ought, nor as they wiſh, in the ſcale of perfection, yet the ſcale itſelf muſt be correct, and the deſire of aſcending perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: they muſt count the degrees they have already attained as nothing. Every grace muſt be kept in exerciſe, conqueſts once made over an evil propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt not only be maintained but extended. And in truth, Chriſtianity ſo compriſes contrary, and as it may be thought irreconcilable excellences, that thoſe which ſeem ſo incompatible as to be incapable by nature of being inmates of the ſame breaſt, are almoſt neceſſarily involved in the Chriſtian character.</p>
                        <p>For inſtance; Chriſtianity requires that our faith be at once fervent and ſober; that our love be both ardent and laſting; that our patience be not only he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic but gentle: ſhe demands dauntleſs zeal and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine humility; active ſervices and complete ſelf-renunciation; high attainments in goodneſs, with deep conſciouſneſs of defect; courage in reproving, and meekneſs in bearing reproof; a quick perception of what is ſinful; with a willingneſs to forgive the offender; active virtue ready to <hi>do</hi> all, and paſſive virtue ready to <hi>bear</hi> all.—We muſt ſtretch every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the ſervice of our Lord, and yet bring every thought into obedience to Him: while we aim to live in the exerciſe of every Chriſtian grace, we muſt account ourſelves unprofitable ſervants: we muſt
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:037996_0421_100FAD56DA3D9EF0"/>
                           <hi>ſtrive</hi> for the crown, yet receive it as a <hi>gift,</hi> and then lay it at our Maſter's feet: while we are buſily trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world with our Lord's talents, we muſt "commune with our heart, and be ſtill:" while we ſtrive to practiſe the pureſt diſintereſtedneſs, we muſt be contented though we meet with ſelfiſhneſs in return; and while laying out our lives for the good of mankind, we muſt ſubmit to reproach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring, and to ingratitude without reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And to render us equal to all theſe ſervices, Chriſtianity beſtows not only the precept, but the power; ſhe does what the great poet of Ethics la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that Reaſon could not do, <q>ſhe lends us arms as well as rules.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>For here, if not the worldly and the timid, but the humble and the well-diſpoſed ſhould demand with fear and trembling, <q>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</q> Revelation makes its own reviving anſwer: "My grace is ſufficient for thee."</p>
                        <p>It will be well here to diſtinguiſh that there are two ſorts of Chriſtian profeſſors, one of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to ſpeak of Chriſtianity as if it were a mere ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of doctrines, with little reference to their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on life and manners; while the other conſider it as exhibiting a ſcheme of human duties independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent on its doctrines. For though the latter ſort may admit the doctrines, yet they contemplate them as a
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:037996_0422_100FAD5AA76E2D60"/>
ſeparate and diſconnected ſet of opinions, rather than as an influential principle of action.—In violation of that beautiful harmony which ſubſiſts in every part of Scripture between practice and belief, the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous world furniſhes two ſorts of people, who ſeem to enliſt themſelves, as if in oppoſition, under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Saint Paul and Saint James, as if thoſe two great champions of the Chriſtian cauſe had fought for two maſters. Thoſe who affect reſpectively to be the diſciples of each, treat faith and works as if they were oppoſite intereſts, inſtead of inſeparable points. Nay, they go farther, and ſet Saint Paul at variance with himſelf.</p>
                        <p>Now inſtead of reaſoning on the point, let us refer to the Apoſtle in queſtion, who definitively ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles the diſpute. The Apoſtolical order and method in this reſpect deſerve notice and imitation; for it is obſervable that the earlier parts of moſt of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles abound in the <hi>doctrines</hi> of Chriſtianity, while thoſe latter chapters, which wind up the ſubject, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit all the <hi>duties</hi> which grow out of them, as the natural and neceſſary productions of ſuch a living root. But this alternate mention of doctrine and practice, which ſeemed likely to <hi>unite,</hi> has on the contrary formed a ſort of line of ſeparation between theſe two orders of believers, and introduced a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and mutilated ſyſtem. Thoſe who would make Chriſtianity conſiſt of doctrines only, dwell, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, on the firſt eleven chapters of the Epiſtle to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:037996_0423_100FAD5C2FDF18B0"/>
the Romans, as containing excluſively the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel. While the mere moraliſts, who wiſh to ſtrip Chriſtianity of her lofty and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate attributes, delight to dwell on the <hi>twelfth</hi> chapter, which is a table of duties, as excluſively as if the preceding chapters made no part of the ſacred Canon. But Paul himſelf, who was at leaſt as ſound a theologian as any of his commentators, ſettles the matter another way, by making the duties of the twelfth grow out of the doctrines of the antecedent <hi>eleven,</hi> juſt as any other conſequence grows out of its cauſe. And as if he ſuſpected that the indiviſible union between them might poſſibly be overlooked, he links the two diſtinct diviſions together by a logical "therefore," with which the twelfth begins:—"I beſeech you <hi>therefore,</hi>" (that is, as the effect of all I have been inculcating,) <q>that you preſent your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living ſacrifice, acceptable to God,</q> &amp;c. and then goes on to enforce on them, as a conſequence of what he had been preaching, the practice of every Chriſtian virtue. This combined view of the ſubject ſeems, on the one hand, to be the only means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the ſubſtitution of Pagan morality for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian holineſs; and on the other, of ſecuring the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doctrine of juſtification by faith, from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful danger of Antinomian licentiouſneſs; every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man obligation being thus grafted on the living ſtock of a divine principle.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>On the duty and efficacy of prayer.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is not propoſed to enter largely on a topic which has been exhauſted by the ableſt pens. But as a work of this nature ſeems to require that ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a ſubject ſhould not be overlooked, it is intended to notice in a ſlight manner a few of thoſe many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and popular objections which are brought forward againſt the uſe and efficacy of prayer, even by thoſe who would be unwilling to be ſuſpected of impiety and unbelief.</p>
                     <p>There is a claſs of objectors who ſtrangely profeſs to withhold homage from the Moſt High, not out of contempt, but reverence. They affect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the uſe of prayer as derogatory to the omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, aſſerting that it looks as if we thought he ſtood in need of being informed of our wants; and as derogatory to his goodneſs, as implying that he needs to be put in mind of them.</p>
                     <p>But is it not enough for ſuch poor frail beings as we are to know, that God himſelf does not conſider prayer as derogatory either to his wiſdom or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And ſhall <hi>we</hi> erect ourſelves into judges of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:037996_0425_100FAD6187355640"/>
what is conſiſtent with the attributes of HIM before whom angels fall proſtrate with ſelf-abaſement? Will he thank ſuch defenders of his attributes, who, while they profeſs to reverence, ſcruple not to diſobey him? It ought rather to be viewed as a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to prayer, that we are addreſſing a Being, who knows our wants better than we can expreſs them, and whoſe preventing goodneſs is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to relieve them.</p>
                     <p>It is objected by another claſs, and on the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ground of humility too, though we do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find the objector himſelf quite as humble as his plea, that it is arrogant in ſuch inſignificant beings as we are to preſume to lay our petty neceſſities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Great and Glorious God, who cannot be expected to condeſcend to the multitude of trifling and even interfering requeſts which are brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him by his creatures. Theſe and ſuch like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections ariſe from mean and unworthy thoughts of the Great Creator. It ſeems as if thoſe who make them conſidered the Moſt High as <q>ſuch an one as themſelves;</q> a Being, who can perform a certain quantity of buſineſs, but who would be overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an additional quantity. Or at beſt, is it not conſidering the Almighty in the light, not of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God, but of a great man, of a miniſter, of a king, who, while he ſuperintends great and national concerns, is obliged to neglect ſmall and individual
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:037996_0426_100FAD655DA4C690"/>
petitions, becauſe he cannot ſpare that leiſure and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which ſuffice for every thing? They do not conſider him as that infinitely glorious Being who, while he beholds at once all that is doing in heaven and in earth, is at the ſame time as attentive to the prayer of the poor deſtitute, as preſent to the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſighing of the priſoner, as if theſe forlorn crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were the objects of his undivided attention.</p>
                     <p>Theſe critics, who are for ſparing the Supreme Being the trouble of our prayers, and, if I may ſo ſpeak without profaneneſs, would relieve Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of part of his burden, by aſſigning to his care only ſuch a portion as may be more eaſily managed, ſeem to have no conception of his attributes.</p>
                     <p>They forget that infinite wiſdom puts him as eaſily within reach of all knowledge, as infinite power does of all performance: that he is a Being in whoſe plans complexity makes no difficulty, and multiplicity no confuſion: that to ubiquity diſtance does not exiſt; that to infinity ſpace is annihilated; that paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and future, are diſcerned more accurately at one glance of his eye, to whom a thouſand years are as one day, than a ſingle moment of time or a ſingle point of ſpace can be by ours.</p>
                     <p>To the other part of the objection founded on the ſuppoſed interference (that is, irreconcilableneſs) of one man's petitions with thoſe of another, this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:037996_0427_100FAD66E5DFCD00"/>
ſeems to ſuggeſt itſelf: firſt, that we muſt take care that when we aſk, we do not "aſk amiſs;" that, for inſtance, we aſk chiefly, and in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified manner, only for ſpiritual bleſſings to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others; and in doing this the prayer of one man <hi>cannot</hi> interfere with that of another. Next, in aſking for temporal and inferior bleſſings, we muſt <hi>qualify</hi> our petition even though it ſhould extend to deliverance from the ſevereſt pains, or to our very life itſelf, according to that example of our Saviour: <q>Father, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> let this cup paſs from me. <hi>Nevertheleſs, not my will,</hi> but thine, be done.</q> By thus qualifying our prayer, we exerciſe ourſelves in an act of reſignation to God; we profeſs not to wiſh what will interfere with his benevolent plan, and yet we may hope by prayer to ſecure the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far as it is conſiſtent with it. Perhaps the reaſon why this objection to prayer is ſo ſtrongly felt, is the too great diſpoſition to pray for merely temporal and worldly bleſſings, and to deſire them in the moſt unqualified manner, not ſubmitting to be without them, even though the granting them ſhould be inconſiſtent with the general plan of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
                     <p>Another claſs continue to bring forward, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly as if it had never been anſwered, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted argument, that ſeeing God is immutable, no petitions of ours can ever change Him: that events
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:037996_0428_100FAD6999669FE0"/>
themſelves being ſettled in a fixed and unalterable courſe, and bound in a fatal neceſſity, it is folly to think that we can diſturb the eſtabliſhed laws of the univerſe, or interrupt the courſe of Providence by our prayers: and that it is abſurd to ſuppoſe theſe firm decrees can be reverſed by any requeſts of ours.</p>
                     <p>Without entering into the wide and trackleſs field of fate and free will, from which purſuit I am kept back equally by the moſt profound ignorance and the moſt invincible diſlike, I would only obſerve, that theſe objections apply equally to all human acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as to prayer. It may therefore with the ſame propriety be urged, that ſeeing God is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and his decrees unalterable, therefore our <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> can produce no change in Him or in our own ſtate. Weak as well as impious reaſoning. It may be queſtioned whether the modern French and German philoſophers might not be prevailed upon to acknowledge the exiſtence of God, if they might make ſuch an uſe of his attributes. The truth is, and it is a truth diſcoverable without any depth of learning, all theſe objections are the offspring of <hi>pride.</hi> Poor, ſhort-ſighted man cannot reconcile the omniſcience and decrees of God with the efficacy of prayer; and, becauſe <hi>he</hi> cannot reconcile them, he modeſtly concludes they are irreconcilable. How much more wiſdom as well as happineſs reſults from an humble chriſtian ſpirit! Such a plain practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:037996_0429_100FAD6C3B11A0B8"/>
text as, <q>Draw near unto God, and he will draw near unto you,</q> carries more conſolation, more true knowledge of his wants and their remedy to the heart of a penitent ſinner, than all the <hi>tomes</hi> of caſuiſtry which have puzzled the world ever ſince the queſtion was firſt ſet afloat by its original propounders.</p>
                     <p>And as the plain man only got up and walked, to prove there was ſuch a thing as motion, in anſwer to the philoſopher who denied it: ſo the plain Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, when he is borne down with the aſſurance that there is no efficacy in prayer, requires no better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to repel the aſſertion than the good he finds in prayer itſelf.</p>
                     <p>All the doubts propoſed to him reſpecting God, do not ſo much affect him as this one doubt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf: <q>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.</q> For the chief doubt and difficulty of a Chriſtian conſiſts, not ſo much in a diſtruſt of God's ability and willingneſs to anſwer the prayer of the upright, as in a diſtruſt of his own up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and of the quality of the prayer which he offers up.</p>
                     <p>Let the ſubjects of a dark fate maintain a ſullen, or the ſlaves of a blind chance a hopeleſs ſilence, but let the child of a compaſſionate Almighty Father ſupplicate his mercies with an humble confidence, inſpired by the aſſurance, that <q>the very hairs of
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:037996_0430_100FAD6FF6023BA0"/>
his head are numbered.</q> Let him take comfort in that individual and minute attention, without which not a ſparrow falls to the ground, as well as in that heart-cheering promiſe, that, as <q>the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous,</q> ſo are <q>his ears open to their prayers.</q> And as a pious Biſhop has obſerved, <q>Our Saviour has as it were hedged in and incloſed the Lord's Prayer with theſe two great fences of our faith, God's <hi>willingneſs</hi> and his <hi>power</hi> to help us:</q> the preface to it aſſures us of the one, which, by calling God by the tender name of "Our Father," intimates his <hi>readineſs</hi> to help his children: and the animating concluſion, "Thine is the <hi>power,</hi>" reſcues us from every unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving doubt of his <hi>ability</hi> to help us.</p>
                     <p>A Chriſtian knows, becauſe he feels, that prayer is, though in a way to him inſcrutable, the medium of connection between God and his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the means appointed by him to draw down his bleſſings upon us. The Chriſtian knows, that prayer is the appointed means of uniting two ideas, one of the higheſt magnificence, the other of the moſt profound lowlineſs, within the compaſs of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; namely, that it is the link of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <q>the High and Lofty One who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth eternity,</q> and that heart of the <q>contrite in which he delights to dwell.</q> He knows that this inexplicable union between Beings ſo unſpeakably,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:037996_0431_100FAD729EB52138"/>
ſo eſſentially different, can only be maintained by prayer.</p>
                     <p>The plain Chriſtian, as was before obſerved, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not explain why it is ſo; but while he <hi>feels</hi> the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, he is contented to let the learned <hi>define</hi> it; and he will no more poſtpone prayer till he can produce a chain of reaſoning on the manner in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives benefit from it, than he will poſtpone eating till he can give a ſcientific lecture on the nature of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion: he is contented with knowing that his meat has nouriſhed him; and he leaves to the philoſopher, who may chooſe to defer his meal till he has elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his treatiſe, to ſtarve in the interim. The Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian feels better than he is able to explain, that the functions of his ſpiritual life can no more be carried on without habitual prayer, than thoſe of his natural life without frequent bodily nouriſhment. He feels renovation and ſtrength grow out of the uſe of the appointed means, as neceſſarily in the one caſe as in the other. He feels that the health of his ſoul can no more be ſuſtained, and its powers kept in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vigour by the <hi>prayers</hi> of a diſtant day, than his body by the <hi>aliment</hi> of a diſtant day.</p>
                     <p>But there is one motive to the duty in queſtion, far more conſtraining to the true believer than all others that can be named; more imperious than any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on its utility, than any convictions of its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, even than any experience of its conſolations.
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:037996_0432_100FAD7587F6B628"/>
Prayer is the command of God; the plain, poſitive, repeated injunction of the Moſt High, who declares, "He will be inquired of." This is enough to ſecure the obedience of the Chriſtian, even though a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe were not, as it always is, attached to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But in this caſe the promiſe is as clear as the precept: "<hi>Aſk,</hi> and ye ſhall <hi>receive;</hi>"—<q>
                           <hi>Seek,</hi> and ye ſhall <hi>find:</hi> this is enough for the plain Chriſtian. As to the <hi>manner</hi> in which prayer is made to coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide with the general ſcheme of God's plan in the government of human affairs; how God has left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty to reconcile our prayer with his own predetermined will, the Chriſtian does not very criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally examine, his preciſe and immediate duty being to pray and not to examine; and probably this being among the ſecret things which belong to God,</q> and not to us, it will lie hidden among thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs myſteries which we ſhall not fully underſtand till faith is loſt in ſight.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it is enough for the humble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to be aſſured, that the Judge of all the earth is doing right: it is enough for him to be aſſured in that word of God "which cannot lie," of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs actual inſtances of the efficacy of prayer in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining bleſſings and averting calamities, both national and individual; it is enough for him to be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed experimentally, by that internal evidence which is perhaps paramount to all other evidence, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

he has received from prayer when all other comforts have failed:—and above all, to end with the ſame motive with which we began, the only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive indeed which <hi>he</hi> requires for the performance of any duty,—it is motive enough for him, that <hi>thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> For when a ſerious Chriſtian has once got a plain unequivocal command from his Maker on any point, he never ſuſpends his obedience while he is amuſing himſelf with looking about for ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate motives of action. Inſtead of curiouſly analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the nature of the duty, he conſiders how he ſhall beſt fulfil it: for on theſe points at leaſt it may be ſaid without controverſy, that <q>the ignorant (and here who is <hi>not</hi> ignorant?) <hi>have nothing to do with the law but to obey it.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others there are who perhaps not controverting any of theſe premiſes, yet neglect to build practical conſequences on the admiſſion of them; who neither denying the duty nor the efficacy of prayer, yet go on to live either in the irregular obſervance or the total neglect of it, as appetite, or pleaſure, or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or humour, may happen to predominate; and who by living almoſt without prayer, may be ſaid "to live almoſt without God in the world." To ſuch we can only ſay, that they little know what they loſe. The time is haſtening on when they will look upon thoſe bleſſings as invaluable, which now they think not worth aſking for. <q>O that they
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:037996_0434_100FAD7B07508F00"/>
were wife! that they underſtood this! that they would conſider their latter end!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are again others, who it is to be feared, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once lived in the habit of prayer, yet not having been well-grounded in thoſe principles of faith and repentance on which genuine prayer is built, have by degrees totally diſcontinued it. "They do not find," ſay they, <q>that their affairs proſper the better or the worſe; or perhaps they were unſucceſsful in their affairs even before they dropt the practice, and ſo had no encouragement to go on.</q> They do not <hi>know</hi> that they had no encouragement; they do not <hi>know</hi> how much worſe their affairs might have gone on, had they diſcontinued it ſooner, or how their prayers helped to retard their ruin. Or they do not <hi>know</hi> that perhaps "they aſked amiſs," or that, if they had obtained what they aſked, they might have been far more unhappy. For a true believer never "reſtrains prayer," becauſe he is not certain he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains every individual requeſt; for he is perſuaded that God, in compaſſion to our ignorance, ſometimes in great mercy withholds what we deſire, and often diſappoints his moſt favored children by giving them, not what they aſk, but what he knows is really good for them. The froward child, as a pious prelate<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Hall.</note> obſerves, cries for the ſhining blade, which the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:037996_0435_100FAD7C8F72A6A0"/>
parent withholds, knowing it would cut his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                     <p>Thus to perſevere when we have not the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of viſible ſucceſs, is an evidence of tried faith. Of this holy perſeverance Job was a noble inſtance. Defeat and diſappointment rather ſtimulated than ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>his</hi> prayers. Though in a vehement ſtrain of paſſionate eloquence he exclaims, <q>I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment:</q> yet ſo perſuaded was he of the duty of continuing this holy importunity, that he perſiſted againſt human hope, till he attained to that pitch of unſhaken faith, by which he was enabled to break out into that ſublime apoſtrophe, <q>Though he ſlay me, I will truſt in him.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But may we not ſay that there is a conſiderable claſs, who not only bring none of the objections which we have ſtated againſt the uſe of prayer; who are ſo far from rejecting, that they are exact and regular in the performance of it: who yet take it up on as low ground as is conſiſtent with their ideas of their own ſafety; who, while they conſider prayer as an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable form, believe nothing of that change of heart which it is intended to produce? Many who yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here ſcrupulouſly to the letter, are ſo far from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſpirit of this duty, that they are ſtrongly inclined to ſuſpect thoſe of hypocriſy who adopt the true ſcriptural views of prayer. Nay, as even the
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:037996_0436_100FAD80A3957388"/>
Bible may be ſo wreſted as to be made to ſpeak al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any language in ſupport of almoſt any opinion, theſe perſons lay hold on Scripture itſelf to bear them out in their own ſlight views of this duty; and they profeſs to borrow from it the ground of that cenſure which they caſt on the more ſerious Chriſtians. Among the many paſſages which have been made to convey a meaning foreign to its original deſign, none has been ſeized upon with more avidity by ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than the pointed cenſures of our Saviour on thoſe "who for a pretence make long prayers;" as well as on thoſe <q>who uſe vain repetitions, and think they ſhall be heard for much ſpeaking.</q> Now the things here intended to be reproved, were the hypocriſy of the Phariſees and the ignorance of the heathen, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the error of all thoſe who depended on the ſucceſs of their prayers, while they imitated the deceit of the one or the folly of the other. But our Saviour never meant thoſe ſevere reprehenſions ſhould cool or abridge the devotion of pious Chriſtians, to which they do not apply.</p>
                     <p>More or fewer words, however, ſo little conſtitute the value of prayer, that there is no doubt but one of the moſt affecting ſpecimens on record is the ſhort petition of the Publican; full fraught as it is with that ſpirit of contrition and ſelf-abaſement which is the very principle and ſoul of prayer. And this perhaps is the beſt model for that ſudden lifting up
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:037996_0437_100FAD838FF2AC10"/>
of the heart which we call ejaculation. But I doubt, in general, whether the few haſty words to which theſe frugal petitioners would ſtint the ſcanty devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others, will be always found ample enough to ſatisfy the humble penitent, who, being a ſinner, has much to confeſs; who, hoping he is a pardoned ſinner, has much to acknowledge. Such an one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cannot always pour out the fullneſs of his ſoul within the preſcribed abridgments. Even the ſincereſt Chriſtian, when he wiſhes to find his heart warm, has often to lament its coldneſs. Though he feel that he has received much, and has therefore much to be thankful for, yet he is not able at once to bring his wayward ſpirit into ſuch a poſture as ſhall fit it for the ſolemn buſineſs; for ſuch an one has not merely his form to repeat, but he has his peace to make. A devout ſupplicant too will labour to affect and warm his mind with a ſenſe of the attributes of God, in imitation of the holy men of old. Like Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat, he will ſometimes enumerate <q>the power, and the might, and the mercies of the Moſt High,</q> in order to ſtir up the ſentiments of awe and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and humility in his own ſoul.<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Chron. xx. 5, 6.</note> He has the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Saviour, whoſe heart dilated with the expreſſion of the ſame holy affections: <q>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth.</q> A
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:037996_0438_100FAD8629BDDA20"/>
heart thus warmed with divine love cannot always ſcrupulouſly limit itſelf to the mere <hi>buſineſs</hi> of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if I may ſo ſpeak. The humble ſupplicant, though he be no longer <hi>governed</hi> by a love of the world, yet grieves to find that he cannot totally exclude it from his thoughts. Though he has on the whole, a deep ſenſe of his own wants, and of God's abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant fullneſs to ſupply them, yet when he moſt wiſhes to be rejoicing in thoſe ſtrong motives for love and gratitude, alas! even then he has to mourn that his thoughts are gone aſtray after ſome <q>trifle lighter than vanity itſelf.</q> The beſt Chriſtian is but too liable, during the temptations of the day, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by "the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life," and is not always brought without effort to reflect that he is but duſt and aſhes. How can even good perſons, who are juſt come perhaps from liſtening to the flattery of their fellow-worms, acknowledge before God, without any preparation of the heart, that they are miſerable ſinners? They require a little time, to impreſs on their own ſouls the ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſin they are making to Him, without which brevity and not length might conſtitute hypocriſy. Even the ſincerely pious have in prayer grievous wanderings to lament, from which others miſtaking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe the advanced Chriſtian to be exempt. Such wanderings that, as an old divine has obſerved, it would exceedingly humble a good man, could he,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:037996_0439_100FAD87B15B9AD8"/>
after he had prayed, be made to ſee his prayers writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down, with interlineations of all the vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent thoughts which had thruſt themſelves in amongſt them. So that ſuch an one will indeed, from a ſenſe of theſe diſtractions, feel deep occaſion with the prophet to aſk forgiveneſs for <q>the iniquity of his <hi>holy</hi> things:</q> and would find cauſe enough for humiliation every night, had he to lament the ſins of his prayers only.</p>
                     <p>We know that ſuch a brief petition as, <q>Lord help my unbelief,</q> if the ſupplicant be in ſo happy a frame, and the prayer be darted with ſuch ſtrong faith that his very ſoul mounts with the petition, may ſuffice to draw down a bleſſing which may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from the more prolix petitioner: yet, if by prayer we do not mean a mere form of words, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be long or ſhort; if the true definition of prayer be, that it is <hi>the deſire of the heart;</hi> if it be that ſecret communion between God and the ſoul which is the very breath and being of religion; then is the Scripture ſo far from ſuggeſting that ſhort meaſure of which it is accuſed, that it expreſsly ſays, "Pray without ceaſing:"—"Pray evermore:"—<q>I will that men pray every where;</q>—<q>Continue inſtant in prayer.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If ſuch "repetitions" as theſe objectors repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, ſtir up deſires as yet unawakened, for <q>
                           <hi>vain</hi> repetitions</q> are ſuch as awaken or expreſs no new
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:037996_0440_100FAD8A95F33B70"/>
deſire, and ſerve no religious purpoſe, then are "re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions" not to be condemned. And if it be true that our Saviour gave the warning againſt <q>long prayers</q> in the ſenſe theſe allege; if he gave the caution againſt vain repetitions in the ſenſe theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; then he broke his own rule in both inſtances: for once we are told <q>he continued <hi>all night</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God.</q> And again, in a moſt awful criſis of his life, it is expreſsly ſaid, <q>He prayed the <hi>third time</hi> uſing the <hi>ſame words.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxvi. 44.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as it is the effect of prayer to <hi>expand</hi> the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections as well as <hi>ſanctify</hi> them, the benevolent Chriſtian is not ſatisfied to commend himſelf alone to the Divine favour. The heart which is full of the love of God, will overflow with love to its neighbour. All that are near to himſelf he wiſhes to bring near to God. Religion makes a man ſo liberal of ſoul, that he cannot endure to reſtrict any thing, much leſs divine mercies, to himſelf: he ſpiritualizes the ſocial affections, by adding inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to perſonal prayer: for he knows, that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning for others is one of the beſt methods of exerciſing and enlarging our love and charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. It is unneceſſary to produce any of the numberleſs inſtances with which Scripture abounds, on the efficacy of interceſſion: I ſhall
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:037996_0441_100FAD8D456D8E90"/>
confine myſelf to a few obſervations on the benefits it brings to him who offers it.—When we pray for the objects of our deareſt regard, it purifies love: when we pray for thoſe with whom we have worldly intercourſe, it ſmooths down the ſwellings of envy, and bids the tumults of ambition ſubſide: when we pray for our country, it ſanctifies patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm: when we pray for thoſe in authority, it adds a divine motive to human obedience: when we pray for our enemies, it ſoftens the ſavageneſs of war, and mollifies hatred into ſorrow. And we can beſt learn, nay, we can only learn, the difficult duty of forgiving thoſe who have offended us, when we bring ourſelves to pray for them to Him whom we ourſelves daily offend. When thoſe who are the faithful followers of the ſame Divine Maſter pray for each other, the reciprocal interceſſion beſt real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izes that beautiful idea of <q>the Communion of Saints.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some are for confining their interceſſions only to the good, as if none but perſons of merit were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to our prayers. Merit! who has it? Deſert! who can plead it? in the ſight of God, I mean. Who ſhall bring his own piety, or the piety of others, in the way of <hi>claim</hi> before a Being of ſuch tranſcendent holineſs, that <q>the heavens are not clean in his ſight?</q> And if we wait for perfect holineſs as a preliminary to prayer, when ſhall ſuch
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:037996_0442_100FAD9109C40FA0"/>
erring creatures pray <hi>at all</hi> to HIM <q>who chargeth the Angels with folly!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In cloſing this little work with the ſubject of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory prayer, may the Author be allowed to avail herſelf of the feeling its ſuggeſts to her own heart? And while ſhe earneſtly implores that Being, who can make the meaneſt of his creatures inſtrumental to his glory, to bleſs this humble attempt to thoſe for whom it was written, may ſhe, without preſumption entreat that this work of Chriſtian Charity may be reciprocal, and that thoſe who peruſe theſe pages, may put up a petition for her, that in the great day to which we are all haſtening, ſhe may not be found to have ſuggeſted to others what ſhe herſelf did not believe, or to have recommended what ſhe did not deſire to practiſe? In that awful day of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deciſion, may both the reader and the writer be pardoned and accepted, <q>not for any works of righteouſneſs which they have done,</q> but through the merits of the GREAT INTERCESSOR.</p>
