            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> following Charges and Proofs reſpecting the Conduct of <hi>PETER LANDAIS,</hi> when he commanded the Frigate Alliance while joined with the Squadron that was, by his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty ſupported in Europe in the late war, under the Flag and Commiſſion of the United States, were officially tranſmitted to this country (ſoon after the date) in order to be laid before the Sovereignty. But as he <hi>(PETER LANDAIS)</hi> was broke at Boſton, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of public ſervice by a Court Martial, for matters totally different, and of a <hi>ſubſequent date,</hi> it is to be preſumed that the Beard of Admiralty had not, at that time, received the Proofs now in queſtion. They were lodged for ſafety, by the owner, in the Office of Foreign Affairs, where they ſtill remain, in original. They would have been buried in oblivion, if he <hi>(PETER LANDAIS)</hi> had not publiſhed in the New-York papers of the <hi>31</hi>ſt October, <hi>1787,</hi> that their exiſtence was <hi>"AN UNTRUTH."</hi> They are now made public, that the world may judge reſpecting his Character, and what Credit may be given to his aſſertions.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>(COPY.)</head>
               <p>WE, the Officers, &amp;c. of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſquadron now at the Texel, this 30th day of October, 1779, do atteſt and declare, upon our words of honor, as gentlemen, that all the following Articles, which we ſubſcribe, reſpecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of PETER LANDAIS, Captain of the frigate Alliance, are really and truly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact. In Witneſs whereof, we hereunto ſign our names and qualities; and will, at any time hereafter, be ready to prove the ſame upon oath, if required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Captain of the Alliance did not take the ſteps in his power, to prevent his ſhip from getting foul of the Bon Homme Richard, in the Bay of Biſcay; for, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of putting his helm a-weather and bearing up, to make way for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer (which was his duty), he left the deck to load his piſtols.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When in chace of a ſhip (ſuppoſed an Engliſh Eaſt-Indiaman), on the — day of Auguſt, 1779, Captain Landais did not do his utmoſt to overtake that ſhip, which he might eaſily have done before night; but put his helm a-weather, and bore away ſeveral times in the day, after the Alliance had gained the wake of the chace, and was overtaking her very faſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Captain Landais behaved with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect and impertinence towards the Commander in Chief of the ſquadron, on frequent occaſions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He diſobeyed his ſignals.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He very ſeldom anſwered any of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He expreſſed his fears and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of being taken on the coaſt of Ireland; and inſiſted on leaving ſight of it immediately, when we had cruiſed there only two days.</p>
               <p n="7">7. His ſeparation from the ſquadron, the firſt time, muſt have happened either through ignorance or deſign; becauſe tho' he diſtinctly ſaw the ſignal for the courſe before night, yet he altered it, firſt two, and then four points of the compaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore morning.</p>
               <p n="8">8. His ſeparation from the ſquadron, the ſecond time, muſt alſo have happened through ignorance or deſign; becauſe, the wind being at N. W. and the other ſhips, to <hi>his knowledge,</hi> lying to, and being aſtern of the Alliance, what leſs than ſeparation could be the conſequence of his obſtinacy, in ordering the weather main brace to be hauled in, and the ſhip to be ſteered S. W. and S. W. by S. in the trough of the ſea; which was done from ten at night 'till morning: and he would not then permit the ſhip to be tacked, in order to rejoin the ſquadron, as was propoſed to him by the officers.</p>
               <p n="9">9. On the morning of the 23d Sept. when the Bon Homme Richard, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the Spurn, came in ſight of the Alliance and Pallas, off Flamborough Head, Captain Landais diſtinctly told Captain Cottineau, that if it was, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, a fifty-gun ſhip, they muſt run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; altho' he muſt have been ſure that the Pallas, <hi>from her heavy ſailing,</hi> muſt have fallen a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020436_0004_0FAF0BDB21B95CA0"/>10. In the afternoon of the ſame day, Captain Landais paid no attention to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, particularly the ſignal of preparation and for the line, which was made with great care, and very diſtinctly, on board the Bon Homme Richard.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Altho' the Alliance was a long way ahead of the Bon Homme Richard, when bearing down on the Baltic fleet, yet Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Landais lay out of gun-ſhot to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, until the Bon Homme Richard had paſſed by and cloſely engaged the Serapis; and then, inſtead of coming to cloſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Counteſs of Scarborough, the Alliance fired at very long ſhot.</p>
               <p n="12">12. He continued to windward, and, a conſiderable time after the action began, fell aſtern and ſpoke the Pallas; leaving the Counteſs of Scarborough in the wake of the ſhips engaged, and at free liberty to rake the Bon Homme Richard.</p>
               <p n="13">13. After the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis were made faſt along-ſide of each other, as in the margin, (which was not done till an hour after the engagement began) Captain Landais, <hi>out of muſket-ſhot,</hi> raked the Bon Homme Richard with croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar and grape ſhot, &amp;c. which killed a number of men, diſmounted ſundry guns, put out the ſide-lights, and ſilenced all the twelve-pounders.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The Alliance then ran down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pallas and Counteſs of Scarbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, that were, at the time, engaged at a conſiderable diſtance to leeward of the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis, and Captain Landais hovered about there out of gun-ſhot, and without firing, 'till ſome time after the Counteſs of Scarborough had ſtruck; and then bore down, under his top-ſails, and ſpoke, firſt the prize, and then the Pallas, aſking a number of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="15">15. At laſt Captain Landais made ſail, under his top-ſails, to work up to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but made tacks before he (being within the range of grape ſhot, and, <hi>at the longeſt,</hi> three quarters of an hour before the Serapis ſtruck) fired a ſecond broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide into the Bon Homme Richard's lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board quarter, the latter part whereof was fired when the Alliance was not more than three points abaſt the Bon Homme Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's beam, altho' many tongues had cried from the Bon Homme Richard, that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Landais was firing into the wrong ſhip, and prayed him to lay the enemy along-ſide. Three large ſignal lanthorns, with proper ſignal wax candles in them, and well lighted, had alſo, previouſly to his firing, been hung over the bow, quarter and waiſt of the Bon Homme Richard, in a horizontal line, which was the ſignal of reconnoiſance; and the ſhips, the one hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a high poop, and being all black, the other having a low ſtern, with yellow ſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were eaſily diſtinguiſhable, it being full moon.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Alliance then paſſed at a very conſiderable diſtance along the larboard or off-ſide of the Bon Homme Richard, and having tacked and gained the wind, ran down again to leeward, and, in croſſing the Bon Homme Richard's bow, Captain Landais raked her with a third broadſide, after being conſtantly called to from the Bon Homme Richard, not to fire, but to lay the enemy along-ſide.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Sundry men were killed and wounded by the broadſides mentioned in the two laſt articles.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Captain Landais never paſſed on the off-ſide of the Serapis, nor could that ſhip ever bring a gun to bear on the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at any time during the engagement.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The leaks of the Bon Homme Richard increaſed much after being fired upon by the Alliance; and as the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſhot which the Bon Homme Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard received under the water, were under the larboard bow and quarter, they muſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020436_0005_0FAF0BDBD513C468"/>
have come from the Alliance, for the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis was on the other ſide.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Several people on board the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance told Captain Landais, at different times, that he fired upon the wrong ſhip; others refuſed to fire.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The Alliance only fired three broadſides while within gun-ſhot of the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The morning after the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Captain Landais acknowledged on board the Serapis, that he raked each time with grape-ſhot, which he knew would ſcatter.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Captain Landais has acknowledged ſince the action, that he would have thought it no harm if the Bon Homme Richard had ſtruck, for it would have given him an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to re-take her, and to take the Serapis.</p>
               <p n="24">24. He has frequently declared that he was the only American in the Squadron, and that he was not under the orders of Captain Jones.</p>
               <p n="25">25. In coming into the Texel, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that if Captain Jones ſhould hoiſt a broad pendant, he would, <hi>to vex him,</hi> hoiſt another.</p>

It being night, I thought it not prudent to go along-ſide in the time of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Being in this boat near, I had an opportunity of ſeeing ſome part of the Alliance's behaviour, above three quarters of an hour after the action began with the Richard and Serapis. The Alliance was to windward of them, and appeared to be lying to, about one mile diſtance. At the ſame time, the Pallas was engaging the Counteſs of Scarborough to leeward of the Alliance, out of my ſight. Preſently, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Pallas and Counteſs of Scarborough had ceaſed firing, the Alliance bore down for them, and diſappeared out of my ſight. What ſhe did there, I can't tell; but ſhe was gone, as near as I can judge, one hour and three-quarters, and then appeared to me to be going up to aſſiſt the Bon Homme Richard, but was half-an-hour from that time before ſhe fired; and, after ſhe got up to the Richard and Serapis, ſhe fired, and then ſtood off from them to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſome ways and, as near as I can judge, was gone better than half an hour, then returned back to the Richard and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis, and fired again.</p>

the Alliance begin the engagement, either with the Serapis or the Counteſs of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough; having remarked, juſt before I went to the main-top (where I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a detachment during the action), that ſhe appeared to me to be very near them. M. Landais had preſſed ſail, during the whole afternoon, without orders. M. Cottineau hailed us, and aſked what ſtation he ſhould take during the action, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to M. Jones, that M. Landais, inſtead of forming the rear, as it had been agreed, took the van, which was his (M. Cottineau's), from him. M. Jones, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, made the ſignal for forming the line; and I well recollect that he cauſed a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeuvre to be made, in order that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance might clearly ſee his ſignal; but M. Landais, <hi>as uſual,</hi> paid no attention to it; and we all thought the Alliance engaged a long time before us.</p>
               <p>After taking my ſtation in the main-top, I thought no more of the Alliance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the main-top-ſail hid her from me. A little while after the Serapis hailed us, and I then perceived the Serapis and the Counteſs of Scarborough pretty nigh each other. We immediately began the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the Serapis, and I did not perceive the Alliance till about two hours afterwards, when I ſaw her rake us with her whole broadſide, a little to larboard of us; and, at the ſame time, I heard a hundred voices hailing the Alliance, and telling them, that it was on board the Bon Homme Richard that ſhe was firing; a moment afterwards ſhe paſſed us on our larboard ſide, and it was with difficulty, that I hindered the people whom I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from firing on her. I hailed M. Landais as loud as I could, ſaying to him, "I beg you will not ſink us." I at the ſame time thought that M. Landais was taking the advantage of our circumſtances to deſtroy M. Jones, and thereby ſave himſelf the trouble he muſt have expected for having diſobeyed M. Jones, in chaſing without orders, and in edging off, to ſhape a contrary courſe, when the ſignal was made to chaſe; and on ſeveral other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſuch as refuſing to come on board the Bon Homme Richard to conſult on the neceſſary operations, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Alliance then came athwart our bow, and began afreſh to cannonade us ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmartly; I then had not the leaſt doubt of his intention to ſink us, and ſhould have fired on the Alliance, in preference to the Serapis, but that the main-top-ſail and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſails concealed her from us. At the inſtant when they cried that the Serapis had ſtruck, I came down, and was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Alliance had killed us a number of people, and, amongſt others, an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer who was on the forecaſtle. In my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, there was not a ſoul on board the Bon Homme Richard, who did not believe that M. Landais knew us before he fired, as we were higher out of water than the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis; that it was moon-light, and that we had made the ſignal by which we muſt have been known, during the action.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Lieutenant of the Counteſs of Scarborough told me, ſome days ſince, that he had remarked, during the action with the Pallas, that the Alliance was for ſome time athwart and to windward of them; that as ſoon as the Scarborough had ſtruck, the Alliance came and hailed them, and aſked them, what veſſel that was, which was engaged? He was anſwered, that it was the Serapis. He aſked her force, but they would not tell him; he then tacked and ſhaped his courſe, under his top-ſails <hi>only,</hi> to join us.</p>

               <p>WHEREAS ſince the campaign of 1779, there have been various and partial reports ſecretly ſpread againſt the private and ſocial character of Commodore Paul Jones, formerly commanding the ſquadron of the Bon Homme Richard; and as, among other hearſays and groundleſs ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I have ſometimes heard that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned Officer had formally giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Lie to M.

But this having been diſcovered to the Britiſh Miniſter by ſome of Mr. Arthur Lee's papers, of which they had got poſſeſſion juſt before Mr. Paul Jones arrived at Paris, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Alliance being on the point to be concluded, he conſented to their aſſigning over the property of that ſhip to the King of France. Among the political reaſons which operated this arrangement, was the great oppoſition made to the equipment of the Indien, by the Britiſh Ambaſſador in Holland. The command of the Indien was, however, reſerved for Mr. Paul Jones, till (ſubſequent to his campaign of 1779) he had made an arrangement of a plan with the Count de Maurepas, which promiſed much greater importance to the common cauſe, and required his immediate return to America. After this, his Majeſty lent the uſe of the Indien to the Prince de Luxembourg for three years, and the Prince <hi>chartered her,</hi> for the term pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to Mr. Gillon, of South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, under the commiſſion of that State.

Captain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dais, in reply, told me very pertly, that Captain Jones had no buſineſs at all to give orders, or to concern himſelf with any of thoſe veſſels, for that both of them had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received proper inſtructions from him; and that the orders he had given were agreeable to the direction he had received from Captain Jones. I told him
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020436_0014_0FAF0BE26BBDC4E8"/>
I was of opinion no Commander in the ſquadron, except Captain Jones, was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to ſend away a prize, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſe of her, when in his preſence, but by virtue of particular orders obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him for that purpoſe. Captain Landais, in a <hi>ſneering</hi> manner, again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he would let Captain Jones know, that he had as good a right to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch prizes as he had; that they were Captains of equal rank; and that the only difference between them was ſeniority on the part of Captain Jones, which he held of little conſideration: and at laſt Colonel Wibert, who had accompanied me on board, and myſelf returned on board the Bon Homme Richard, totally unable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Captain Jones what Captain Landais had ordered with reſpect to thoſe two ſhips. A ſhort time after this, a ſignal was made on board the Commodore's ſhip, for the Captains of the ſquadron to come on board. Captain Cottineau and Captain Ricot accordingly came on board. Captain Landais not obeying, Captain Jones deſired me to go again on board the Alliance, and deliver Captain Landais a letter which he then handed to me, and which I underſtood contained an order for him to come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on board; accordingly I went on board the Alliance, and delivered Captain Landais the letter, which he took with him to the cabin, and in a few minutes returned and delivered me another for Captain Jones: this I brought inſtantly on board, and delivered to him. It contained a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond refuſal on the part of Captain Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dais, and very much offended the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had politely obeyed the ſignal, and were then waiting for him. Captain Jones, chagrined by the obſtinacy or that Officer, would have proceeded to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had in view, without paying any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attention to him; but being ſtill anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to have his opinion on and approbation of the meaſure, conjointly with the other Officers of the ſquadron, a further at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to obtain his company was reſolved on; for this purpoſe (at the deſire of Captain Jones) Captain Cottineau, Mr. Chamillard and myſelf went on board the Alliance, to try the effect of perſuaſion upon Captain Landais; but in vain did thoſe gentlemen repreſent to him the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity there was for his joining in conſultation with his brother Officers; that the good of the ſervice demanded his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, as an enterprize of ſome moment was to be deliberated on; but, alas! in vain did they waſte an hour and more in arguments to this end; in vain did they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to perſuade him; in vain did they entreat him; in vain did they tell him what he had to dread from the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his obſtinately perſiſting to diſobey the orders of his Commanding Officer. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of paying polite attention to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given him, he, on the contrary, not only diſregarded it, but gave himſelf the liberty to ſpeak of Captain Jones in terms highly diſreſpectful and inſolent, and ſaid he would ſee him on ſhore, when they muſt kill one or other, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>On the 23d September laſt, when the ſignal for a general chaſe was given to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Baltic fleet, the Alliance Frigate was the headmoſt ſhip of our ſquadron, and continued to keep a-head until ſhe began to near the enemy, when Captain Landais very unexpectedly and agreeably ſurpriſed Capt. Jones by hauling his ſhip's wind, thereby politely leaving room for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to approach the largeſt ſhip, which he inſtantly engaged; Capt. Landais ſtill keeping at a reſpectful diſtance from his commander, which reſpect he however continued to preſerve, mal-a-propos, until very late in the engagement. The action had laſted more than an hour, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis and Bon Homme Richard had been made faſt along-ſide each other by Captain Jones, head and ſtern together, for ſome time before I received the wound which obliged me to quit the deck, at which time the Bon Homme Richard ſtill continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with a force much ſuperior to herſelf; and altho' ſhe had been moſt ſeverely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her enemy, ſhe nevertheleſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to hug her in cloſe embrace. The
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020436_0015_0FAF0BE358A288A8"/>
behaviour of our conſorts upon this day was very myſterious, but that of Captain Landais was of ſuch a caſt, as, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt unavoidably announce him to the public a man devoid of conduct—a man of infamous principles—or, a rank coward.</p>

               <p>The following extract of a Letter from Dr. Franklin to Capt. Landais, dated Paſſy, March 12, 1780, and which he has publiſhed, will ſerve to give a further inſight into his character:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>NO one has ever learned the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I formed of you from the enquiry made into your conduct—I kept it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to myſelf—I have not even hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in my letters to America, becauſe I would not hazard giving to any one a bias to your prejudice. By communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating <hi>a part of that opinion</hi> privately to you, I can do no harm, for you may burn it. I ſhould not give you the pain of reading it, if your demand did not make it neceſſary: I think you then ſo imprudent, ſo litigious and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a man, even with your beſt friends, that peace and good order, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the quiet and regular ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſo neceſſary to ſucceſs, are, where you preſide, impoſſible; theſe are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my obſervation and apprehenſion:— Your military operations I leave to more capable judges. If, therefore, I had twenty ſhips of war in my diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhould not give one of them to Captain Landais: The ſame temper which <hi>excluded</hi> him from the French marine <note n="†" place="bottom">He impoſed himſelf on America as having been Captain of a ſhip of the line, in the navy of France; but the fact ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears to be, that having been placed under the Capitaine du Port, or Maſter Attendant of the Port of Breſt, he was not in the line of promotion of the corps of Officers of the marine, (Capitaine de Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and ſeveral other ſubaltern grades, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no affinity to the reſpective duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thoſe under officers in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are in the ſame predicament) and therefore he never had, and could not have attained the rank of <hi>Lieutenant de Vaiſſeau,</hi> or even Enſign in the Royal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. After he had given ten years trial of his <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>talents,</hi> he had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from the ſervice of France without honors or a penſion; and was adrift for ſeveral years, when, in the year 1777, he prevailed on Mr. Deane, by conſtant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, to take him into the ſervice of America. He told Mr. Deane he had been formerly appointed Captain of a ſhip of the line, and had been <hi>ſacrificed</hi> by jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. But this pretended <hi>line of battle ſhip</hi> was nothing but an old tranſport veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that had been condemned and diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as unfit for war. Mr. Landais was employed to bring a tranſport veſſel from France to America, with a brevet of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the American navy, and an extra gratification of twelve thouſand livres— he arrived in America about the time when the alliance was concluded with France; and Congreſs not only confirmed his brevet, but alſo appointed him Captain of the beſt fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in their ſervice, then juſt launched, and named her the ALLIANCE. This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a compliment to his Moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Majeſty, therefore Congreſs had been groſsly impoſed upon. Since he has been turned out of the American ſervice, it is ſaid, and believed, he has been conſtantly complaining, abuſing the moſt reſpectable characters, and ſaying he has been again <hi>"ſacrificed"</hi> by a general combination; beginning with Dr. Franklin. He has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the juſtice of Congreſs, and of all perſons in authority under the ſovereignty: Yet his pecuniary advantages have not been leſs conſiderable (excluſive of the twelve thouſand livres gratuity) than if he had left the ſervice of his own accord, and with honor.</note> would weigh equally with me; of courſe I ſhall not replace him in the Alliance.</q>
