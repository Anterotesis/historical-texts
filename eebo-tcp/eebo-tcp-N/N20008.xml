            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOW many people have fallen in the city of Philadelphia, by the <hi>peſtilential Infection,</hi> is unknown to the Author—and he believes to the inhabitants of the ſame place; for the accounts are very different, as ſome mention four, others five, ſix, and even more than ſeven thouſand: and the latter has been ſuppoſed to be not too large.—Some have given the <hi>diſorder</hi> one name, and others another, &amp;c. It has been called a <hi>genuine Plague;</hi>—a <hi>putrid malignant Fever;</hi>—a <hi>yellow Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and a <hi>peſtilential Infection.</hi> It ſeems that the <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> began about the beginning of Auguſt, and raged with great violence till the weather grew colder.</p>
            <p>THE Author has compoſed the following lines at his leiſure hours, in which he has given a true deſcription of the terrible effects of this contagion, according to the beſt information he has been able to obtain from recent publications; and as many people have called it a <hi>Plague,</hi> and as he knows not its proper name, he hopes he ſhall be excuſed for calling it ſo in the ſubſequent pages.—From, kind Reader, your's and the public's moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient humble ſervant,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>FROM Philadelphia comes a doleful ſound,</l>
               <l>Of thouſands ſlain, and buried in the ground!</l>
               <l>Who were alive and well three months ago;</l>
               <l>But of their fate at that time did not know.</l>
               <l>The young, the old, thoſe of a middle age,</l>
               <l>With rapid force, have been ſwept from the ſtage!</l>
               <l>By an infection, which ſome people ſay</l>
               <l>From diſtant lands, ſomehow, has found the way:</l>
               <l>But ſome with boldneſs do this thing deny,</l>
               <l>And ſay the <hi>venom</hi> from the earth did fly;</l>
               <l>From <hi>filth</hi> expanded by <hi>Sol'</hi>s burning heat,</l>
               <l>Or <hi>fumes</hi> proceeding from a dirty ſtreet;</l>
               <l>Thus generated, did infect the air</l>
               <l>With putrid exhalations ev'ry where,</l>
               <l>Within the limits of the city's bound;</l>
               <l>But not in places which the ſame ſurround.</l>
               <l>In Water-ſtreet this <hi>mortal Plague</hi> began,</l>
               <l>And with great ſlaughter through the city ran;</l>
               <l>From houſe to houſe the dread contagion flew,</l>
               <l>And on its way a num'rous train hath ſlew!</l>
               <l>In diff'rent ways the exhalations ſtrike,</l>
               <l>And all the patients are not ſeiz'd alike;</l>
               <l>Their conſtitutions diff'ring much likewiſe,</l>
               <l>Make ſymptoms too of diff'rent kinds ariſe.</l>
               <l>Some who were ſeiz'd, had on the firſt attack</l>
               <l>Cold chills, and pains, both in the head and back,</l>
               <l>And in their limbs, and alſo in their bones,</l>
               <l>Exciting horror, gloom, and diſmal groans!</l>
               <l>Within the ſtomach humours did convene,</l>
               <l>And vomiting did often ſupervene;</l>
               <l>The bile was black, and putrid too indeed,</l>
               <l>And haemorrhages ſometimes did ſucceed;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:026206_0004_0FD02C4B78E27830"/>
The pulſe run high, but often very low.</l>
               <l>Sometimes too quick, and then as much too ſlow;</l>
               <l>The eyes grew red, their pupils did dilate;</l>
               <l>The fluids ruſh'd into a putrid ſtate;</l>
               <l>The thirſt was great, the urine colour'd high;</l>
               <l>The tongue turn'd white, the ſkin was hot and dry.</l>
               <l>The dang'rous fever often did remit;</l>
               <l>And was ſucceeded by an ague fit.</l>
               <l>Sometimes eruptions roſe upon the ſkin,</l>
