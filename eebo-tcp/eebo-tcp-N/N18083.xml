            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>NOTHING is more evident, than that men are prejudiced against the goſpel. It is from this ſource, that thoſe who are for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it, meet with ſo much contempt. It is true, they are frail, ſinful duſt and aſhes, in common with other men; yet on account of the important embaſſy with which they are entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is agreeable to the unerring dictates of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake. 1 Theſ. v.13.</p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this ſentiment, was the deſign of the Apoſtle in this verſe: "Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit yourſelves." He was far from inculcating any thing that might seem to confront what the Apoſtle Peter has enjoined, 1 Pet. v.3. Neither as being lords over God's heritage. The word ſignifies to <hi>lead, guide,</hi> or <hi>direct.</hi>

            <p>Our text contains an important motive, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite to attention and reſpect, that is due to the miniſters of Chriſt, on account of their relation to him; and that is the aſpect their work

has to a judgement-day: For they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt quickly give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They are amenable to their great Lord and Maſter for every ſermon they preach, and moſt give an account of the reception they and their work meet with, among their hearers.—Under the influence of ſuch a thought, let us take notice of a few things, ſuppoſed by the work, aſſigned to miniſters in the text.—Say ſomething with reſpect to their character.—Whence it appears that they muſt give account.—When they may be ſaid to be properly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by ſuch conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. There are ſeveral ideas ſuggested by the work aſſigned to goſpel miniſters in the text: which is, to <hi>watch for ſouls.</hi> This ſupposes,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>l is of vaſt importance; elſe why ſo much attention paid to it, as to have a guard to inſpect it? All thoſe injunctions we find interſperſed through the ſacred pages, to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be faithful, are ſo many evidences of the worth of mens ſouls. What renders them ſo valuable, is the important relation they ſtand in to their Maker. The perfections of the Deity are more illuſtrated in the redemption of fallen men, than they would have been the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of apoſtate angels; elſe why were the latter paſſed by, while God choſe the former as the objects of his attention? God hath from eternity appointed a proper number, for the diſplay of his mercy and juſtice; means are neceſſary to fit

them for the Maſter's uſe; ſo that the ſoul in this view, is of infinite importance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Watchmen over the ſouls of men implies that they are prone to neglect them, or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive to their ſouls. When one is ſet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or watch over another, it ſuppoſes ſome kind of incapacity that he is under to take care of himſelf. The ſcripture repreſents mankind by nature as <hi>fools, madmen</hi>; and being in a ſtate of <hi>darkenſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Men in general are very ſagacious with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to temporal affairs, and diſplay much na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wit and ingenuity, in contriving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing evil deſigns; but to do good, they have no knowledge. Jer. iv.22. This is an evidence that their inability to foreſee danger, and provide againſt it, is of the moral kind. Was there a dispoſition in mankind, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to their natural powers, to ſecure the eternal interest of their ſouls in the way God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribbed, watchmen would in a great meaſure be uſeleſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The work and office of gospel miniſters, suggeſtſ the idea of enemies invading; that there is a controverſy ſubſiſting, and danger approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When ſoldiers are called forth, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels stand upon the wall, it denotes war. The ſouls of men are environed with ten thouſand enemies, that are ſeeking their ruin. Earth and hell are combined together to deſtroy. How many already have fell victims to their ferocity!

                   facs="unknown:023437_0005_0FBF702598949A40"

The infernal powers are daily dragging their prey to the priſon of hell. Men have rebelled againſt God, and made him their enemy; yea, all creatures, and all events, are working the eternal miſery of the finally impenitent ſinner.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are taught in the text and elsewhere, that the work of a gospel miniſter is not with the temporal, but the ſpiritual concerns of men: They watch for <hi>ſouls.</hi> Their converſation is not to be about worldly affairs, but things that relate to Christ's kingdom, which involves the everlaſting concerns of mens ſouls. When a miniſter's affections are upon this world, his viſits among his people will be barren; he will inquire about the outward circumſtances of his flock; and perhaps, from pecuniary motives, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at ſuch prosperity: But as though that was of greateſt concern, he will have nothing to ſay— with reſpect to the health, and proſperity of their ſouls: Have no joys or ſorrows, to expreſs, on account of the fruitful or more lifeless state of the inward man.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us ſay ſomething with reſpect to the character of a ſpiritual watchman.</p>
            <p>Natural endownments, embelliſhed with a good education, are qualifications ſo obviouſly requiſite in an evangelical miniſter, that it is needleſs we inſist upon them at this time; and that the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of religion has, and ſtill continues, greatly to ſuffer for the want of them, is equally noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:023437_0006_0FBF702779200600"/>In the early ages of chriſtianity, men were miraculously qualified and called into the work of the goſpel miniſtry; but we are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that this is the preſent mode by which ordinary miniſters are introduced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is neceſſary that thoſe who engage in this work, love the cauſe in which they profeſs to be embarked; that the love of Chriſt be ſhed abroad in the heart: Hence our bleſſed Lord, by thoſe repeated interrogations to Simon whether he loved him, has let before us the importance of this qualification in a ſpiritual Shepherd. The ſad conſequences of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe into the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who are in heart enemies to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, have often taught men to be careful in this particular. The truſt repoſed in a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ſuch, as renders him capable of great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to the community. He that undertakes in this work from ſecular motives, will meet with diſappointment. What a groſs abſurdity is this, for a man to commend religion to others, while he is a ſtranger to it himſelf! "The pious preacher will commend the Saviour, from the perſonal fund of his own experience." Being ſmitten with the love of Chriſt himſelf with what zeal and fervor will he ſpeak of the divine glory! Love to Chriſt will tend to make a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter faithful and ſucceſsful. The importance of this point, urges me to be copious on the ſubject, were it not too obvious to require a long diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wiſdom and prudence are important quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023437_0007_0FBF702DD8542E10"/>
in miniſters; hence that injunction of the great preacher, Mat. x.16. Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſe as ſerpents, and harmleſs as doves. He is a man of ſpiritual underſtanding, whoſe ſoul is irradiated with the beams of the Son of Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs,—has received an auction from the holy one,—is taught by the word and ſpirit, and walks in the light of God's countenance. He has ſeen the deceit of his own heart,—knows the intrigues of the enemy,—ſees the many ſnares to which the ſouls of men are expoſed,—and not being ignorant of the devices of ſatan, he will endeavour to carry on the ſpiritual campaign, with that care and prudence, that he ſhall not get advantage. He knows that he has a ſubtle enemy to oppoſe, and human nature, replete with enmity againſt the goſpel; and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in every effort, to conduct with that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and circumſpection, as ſhall appear moſt likely to prove ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Patience is another qualification very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a ſpiritual watchman. His breaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſpired with love to the cauſe, he will ſtand the ſtorms of temptation; will not be diſhearten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the fatigues, and ſufferings, to which his work expoſes him; but will endure hardneſs as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Courage and fortitude, muſt conſtitute a part of the character of a goſpel miniſter. A ſentinel, who is worthy of that ſtation, will not fear the formidable appearance of the enemy, nor tremble at their menaces. None of theſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023437_0008_0FBF702EEC7495B0"/>
things will move him, neither will he count his life dear unto him, to defend a cauſe ſo very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. He has the ſpirit of the intrepid Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah, "Should ſuch a man as I flee?" He ſtands faſt in the faith; quits himſelf like a man, and is ſtrong.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Nor muſt we forget to mention vigilance, or cloſe attention to the buſineſs aſſigned him, as an eſſential qualification in a miniſter of Chriſt. A man does not anſwer the idea of a watchman, unleſs his mind is engaged in the buſineſs. The word, which we have rendered <hi>watch,</hi> in the text, ſignifies, in the original, to awake, and abſtain from ſleeping.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Legh's Critica Sacra.</hi>
               </note> Indeed all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a watch ſet upon the wall, are fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if he ſleeps on guard; thereby himſelf, and the whole army, are liable to fall an eaſy prey to the cruel depredations of the enemy. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual watchman is not to ſleep, but to watch the firſt motion of the enemy, and give the alarm; leſt ſouls periſh through his drowſineſs and inattention.</p>
            <p>Some further obſervations with reſpect to the work of a goſpel miniſter, will be made in their place. We paſs,—</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew, That miniſters muſt give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God of their conduct, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it reſpects the people of their charge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:023437_0009_0FBF7030694D5D40"/>This ſolemn conſideration is ſuggeſted in the text:—'Tis the deſign of preaching, to make things ready for the day of judgment, 2 Cor. ii.16. To the one we are the ſavour of death unto death; and to the other, the ſavour of life unto life: We are fitting men for the Maſter's use,—preparing affairs for that deciſive court. This ſuppoſes, that things muſt be laid open before the great aſſembly at the day of judgment; or why is it that there are ſo many things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late therefore, and are preparatives therefor.</p>
            <p>The work of a goſpel miniſter has a peculiar relation to futurity: An approaching judgment is that, to which every ſubject is pointing, and which renders every ſentiment to be inculcated, vaſtly ſolemn, and intereſting. Miniſters are accountable creatures in common with other men; and we have the unerring teſtimony of ſcripture, that God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. Eccle. xii.14. If there is none of our conduct too minute to be cognizable, we may well conclude, that ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs, that relate to the work and office of goſpel miniſters, will not paſs unnoticed.</p>
            <p>Arguments may be taken from the names given to the miniſters of Chriſt, that they muſt give account. They are called <hi>ſoldier, ambaſſadors, ſervants, ſtewards, angels,</hi> &amp;c. Which points out the relation they and their work ſtands in to God: That they are ſent of God, and are ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to him that ſent them; as a ſervant or
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023437_0010_0FBF7031D8230038"/>
ſteward, is to give account to his Lord and Maſter, with reſpect to his faithfulneſs, in the truſt repoſed in him. God tells Ezekiel, If watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not faithful, and ſouls periſh through their neglect, that he would require their blood at the hands of ſuch careleſs watchmen. It is evident, that primitive miniſters were influenced to faithfulneſs from a view of the ſolemn account they expected to give at the day of judgment. This gave riſe to thoſe words, Acts iv.19. 'But Peter and John anſwered and ſaid unto them, Whether it be right in the ſight of God to Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.' If God's omniſcience is a motive to faithfulneſs, it muſt be in this view, that he will not let our conduct paſs unnoticed, but call us an account.</p>
            <p>It was approaching judgment that engroſſed the attention of St. Paul, and made him exhort Timothy, to ſtudy to approve himſelf unto God. This made the beloved diſciple ſpeak of having boldneſs in the day of judgment, 1 John, iv.17.</p>
            <p>The divine glory is an object only worthy of attention; and to diſplay his holy character, was the deſign of God in creation; as there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> other beings exiſting antecedent thereto, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the mind of Jehovah; and we are ſure that God is purſuing the ſame thing ſtill, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways will. He is in one mind, and who can turn him? Job xxiii.13. There is no conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object that bears any proportion with the glory of God; and for him ever to aim at any thing elſe, would be incompatible with his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023437_0011_0FBF703A0D3FEC08"/>
The day of judgment is deſigned to be a comment on all other days; at which time God's government of the world, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards him, will be publicly inveſtigated, that the equity of divine adminiſtration may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear conſpicuous before the aſſembled univerſe. It is called a day when the ſon of man is <hi>revealed.</hi> Luk. xvii.30. The honour of God requires that matters be publicly and particularly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; that evidences are ſummoned at this open court: Hence the ſaints are to judge the world. 1 Cor. vi.2.</p>
            <p>It will conduce to the mutual happineſs of faithful miniſters and people, to have matter laid open before the bar of God, as in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our text, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief. The apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome miniſters and people who ſhould have reciprocal joy in the day of the Lord Jeſus;—which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that miniſters, and the people of their charge, are to meet another day as having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpecial with each other. The connexion between miniſters and people is ſuch, as renders them capable of ſaying much for, or againſt, the people of their charge; and of hearers making the ſame obſervations with reſpect to their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and in this way the mercy and juſtice of God will appear illuſtrious.</p>
            <p>Since, therefore, the work of goſpel miniſters has ſuch a near relation to a judgment day;—ſince they are accountable creatures, and their work ſo momentous;—ſince it is a ſentiment that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023437_0012_0FBF703ADDDE4550"/>
has had ſo powerful influence on all true miniſters in all ages of the world: Alſo their connexion is ſuch as to render them capable of laying many things relating to the people of their charge. Above all, ſince the diſplays of divine glory are ſo highly concerned in this matter; we may without heſitation adopt the idea in the text, That miniſters have a ſolemn account to give to their great Lord and Maſter, how they diſcharge the truſt repoſed in them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We are to inquire, what influence ſuch conſiderations will have on the true miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Chriſt; or when they may be ſaid to preach and act as thoſe who muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who properly expect to give account, will be very careful to examine themſelves with reſpect to the motives by which they are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, to undertake in this work. He will view himſelf acting in the preſence of an heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, who requires truth in the inward part, and will ſhortly call him to an account for all the exerciſes of his heart. He will ſearch every corner of his ſoul, whether the divine honour, or ſomething elſe, is the object of his purſuit. He has been taught, by the rectitude of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law, that God will not paſs by tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but will judge the ſecrets of men. The work will appear ſo great, that nature will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil at the thought, like Jeremiah, "Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot ſpeak; for I am a child." Or with the great apoſtle, "Who is ſufficient
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023437_0013_0FBF703C5C4F2970"/>
for theſe things." The true diſciple of Jeſus will not thruſt himſelf forward into the miniſtry, like a heedleſs uſurper; but with the greateſt caution, and ſelf-diffidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A faithful Watchman will manifeſt that he expects to give account, by being very careful to know his duty, and will take all proper ways which are in his power, to become acquainted with it. He will ſtudy, as the apoſtle directs Timothy, to ſhew himſelf approved unto God. He will give attendance to Reading, Meditation and Prayer; will often call in divine aid, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own inſufficiency. As a faithful ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier will be careful to understand his duty; ſo the ſpiritual Watchman, will adhere cloſely to the word of God for his guide and directory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A miniſter that watches for ſouls as one who expects to give account, will have done to pleſe but God. When he ſtudies his Sermons, this will not be the enquiry, "How ſhall I form my diſcourſe ſo as to pleaſe and gratify the humours of men, and get their applauſe?" but "How ſhall I preach ſo as to do honor to God, and meet with the approbation of my Judge?" this will be his daily requeſt at the throne of grace. This will be ten thouſand times better to him than the vain flattery of men. His diſcourſes will not be calculated to gratify the carnal heart, but he will not ſhun to declare the whole counſel of God.</p>
            <p>The ſolemn account that the faithful miniſter expects to give another day, will direct him in the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023437_0014_0FBF7042622BB610"/>
choice of his ſubjects; he will dwell upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> things which have a more direct relation to the eternal world. He will not entertain his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with empty ſpeculations; or vain philoſophy; but with things that concern their everlaſting welfare. Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, will be the great topic and darling theme of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If he means to ſave ſouls, like a ſkilful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, he will endeavor to lead his patients into a view of their maladies, and then point them to a bleeding Saviour as the only way of recovery. The faithful Watchman will give the alarm at the approach of the enemy, will blow the trumpet in the ears of the ſleeping ſinner, and endeavour to awake him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The pious preacher will endeavour to adapt his diſcourſes to the underſtanding of his hearers. "He will not be ambitious of ſaying fine things to win applauſe, but of ſaying uſeful things, to win ſouls." He will conſider that he has the weak as well as ſtrong, children as well as adults to ſpeak to, and that he muſt be accountable for the blood of their ſouls, if they periſh through his neglect. This will influence him to ſtudy <hi>plainneſs</hi> more than politeneſs; alſo he will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to accommodate his ſermons to the different ſtates, or circumſtances of his hearers; he will have comforting and encouraging leſſons to ſee before the children of God; while the terrors of the law are to be proclaimed in the ears of the impenitent. He will ſtrive to preach diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that every hearer may have his portion.—The awful ſcenes of approaching judgment, will
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023437_0015_0FBF7044D15BA638"/>
have an influence on the Chriſtian preacher with reſpect to the <hi>manner</hi> in which he will deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He will guard againſt that low and vulgar ſtile, that tends to degrade religion; but his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage will in ſome meaſure correſpond with thoſe very ſolemn and affecting things that do engage his heart and tongue. He will not ſubſtitute a whining tone in the room of a Sermon; which, to ſpeak no worſe of it, is a ſort of ſatire upon the Goſpel, tending greatly to depreciate its ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and importance, and to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; but the judgment will appear ſo awful, and his attention ſo captivated with it, that his accents will be the reſult of a mind honeſtly, and engagedly taken up with ſubject vaſtly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. "Such a preacher will not come into the pulpit as an actor comes upon the ſtage, to perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate feigned character, and forget his real one; to utter ſentiments, or repreſent paſſions not his own.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Fordyce.</hi>
               </note> It is not to diſplay his talents ; but like one who feels the weight of eternal things, he will not addreſs his hearers as though judgments was a mere empty ſound; but viewing eternity juſt before him, and a congregation on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of it, whoſe eternal ſtate depends upon a few uncertain moments; Oh! with what zeal and fervor will he ſpeak! How will death, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and eternity appear as it were in every feature, and every word! Out of the abundance of his heart, his mouth will ſpeak. His hearers will eaſily perceive, that the preacher is one who expects to give account. He will ſtudy and preach
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023437_0016_0FBF70472C86C9D8"/>
with reference to a judgment to come, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver every Sermon in ſome reſpect, as if it were his laſt, not knowing when his Lord will call him, or his hearers to account.— We are not to ſuppoſe that his zeal will vent itſelf in the frightful bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowings of enthuſiaſm; but he will ſpeak forth the words of truth in ſoberneſs, with modeſty, and chriſtian decency.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They who watch for ſouls as thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to give account, will endeavour to know as much as may be the ſtate of the ſouls committed to their charge, that they may be in a better ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to do them good. They will point out thoſe errors and dangers which they may ſee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching; and when they ſee ſouls taken by the enemy, they will exert themſelves to deliver them from the ſnare of the devil. The outward department of a faithful miniſter will correſpond with his preaching: he will reprove, rebuke, warning his people from houſe to houſe. The weighty affairs of another world will direct his daily walk and converſation, in all places, and on every occaſion.</p>
            <p>A FEW PARTICULAR ADDRESSES.</p>
            <p>Firſt, To him who is about to be ſet apart to the work of the Goſpel Miniſtry in this place.</p>
            <p>DEAR SIR,</p>
            <p>FROM the preceding obſervations, you will eaſily ſee, that the work before you is great and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023437_0017_0FBF7048637456F8"/>
ſolemn; and I hope this is a leſſon you have been taught otherwiſe; the former acquaintance I have had with you, gives me reaſon to hope that this is the caſe. You are about to have theſe ſouls committed to your care; you are to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as a Watchman upon the walls of this part of Zion; I doubt not but that it is with trembling you enter upon this work. The relation that this day's buſineſs has with a judgment to come, renders the ſcene affecting. Your mind I truſt has already anticipated the important moment, when you muſt meet this people before the bar of God. The good profeſſion you are this day to make is before many witneſſes; ſaints and wicked men are beholding; the angels are looking down upon us; above all, the great God with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency or diſapprobation, beholds the tranſactions of this day; he ſees what motives govern you, and will proclaim it before the aſſembled Univerſe. Oh! ſolemn, and affecting thought! The work before you is great, and requires great ſearching of heart, great ſelf-diffidence, and ſelf abaſement. How neceſſary that you feel your dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God; you cannot perform any part of your work without his help; under a ſenſe of your weakneſs, repair to him for help. Would you be a ſucceſsful Miniſter, you muſt be a praying dependant one; do all in the name, and ſtrength of the Lord Jeſus. Would you be faithful in watching for the ſouls of men, you muſt be much in watching your own heart. If you are careleſs with reſpect to your own ſoul, you will be alſo with reſpect to others. Although the work is too
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:023437_0018_0FBF7049E19D50F0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
great for you, yet let ſuch conſiderations as theſe revive your deſponding heart. That the cauſe is good, better than life you may well give up all for it. 'Tis the curſe of God. and that which will prove victorious, in ſpite of all oppoſition from men or devils—that God has promiſed to be with his Miniſters to the end of the world—that the work is delighted; Paul ſomewhere bleſſes God for putting him into the work of the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—that the campaign is ſhort, your warfare will ſoon be accompliſhed—that the reward is great, being found faithful, you will receive a crown of glory, that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have a word to the church and congregation in this place.</p>
            <p>MY BRETHREM AND FRIENDS,</p>
            <p>THE importance of the work of a goſpel Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter, ſuggeſts the weighty concerns of your ſouls;. As Miniſters muſt give account how they preach and behave; ſo hearers alſo are to be examined how they hear and improve. You are to hear with a view to the day of judgment, always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering, that there is no ſermon or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that you have in this life, to prepare for another world, that ſhall go unnouced at that deciſive court. Your preſent exerciſes, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſolemn affairs of this day, will then come up to public view.</p>
            <p>God, we truſt, is this day ſending you one to watch for your ſouls: ſhould not this excite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023437_0019_0FBF704DD05503D8"/>
of gratitude in your breaſts? Shall God take ſo much care of your ſouls, and you neglect them? How unreaſonable will it be for you to deſpiſe the pious inſtruction of your watchmen? You will herein wrong your own ſouls, and it will be an evidence that you love death. You will bear with him in not accommodating his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to your vitiated taſtes, becauſe he <hi>muſt give account.</hi> His work is great, and you muſt pray for him; as in the verſe following the text, the Apoſtle ſays, "Brethren, pray for us." Is it the buſineſs of your miniſter to watch for your ſouls, with ſuch indefatigable aſſiduity, you ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee how neceſſary it is that you do what you can to ſtrengthen him in this work. That you adminiſter to his temporal wants, that he may give himſelf wholly to theſe things. The great backwardneſs among people in general with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to this matter at preſent, has an unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſpect. "Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who ſeedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock." 1 Cor. ix.7.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs this man is ſent here for the riſe and fall of many in this place. We hope he will be uſed as a mean of leading ſome to Chriſt; while on the other hand, we even tremble at the thought, he may fit others for a more aggravated condemnation. Take heed how you hear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:023437_0020_0FBF704FDDDEFCE8"/>
               <hi>A few words to the Aſſembly in general, will cloſe the ſubject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT has been ſaid about the character and work of goſpel miniſters, ſhews us at once that it is a matter in which we are all deeply intereſted. The greater part of the people preſent, I expect to ſee no more, until I meet them at that day, which has been the main ſubject of the foregoing diſcourſe. With reſpect to the characters of the people preſent, we can ſay but little about them; only this we may obſerve, <hi>they are all dying crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> haſtening to the grave, and to judgment: There muſt we meet you,—there an account of this day's work will come up to view,—there each one muſt give account concerning the right diſcharge of the work aſſigned him: The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt give account, and you that hear alſo. Let me ſay to ſuch as are yet in their ſins, and proclaim it from this part of the wall of Zion. That the enemy of your ſouls is at hand,—that deſtruction awaits you. Oh! flee! flee! to Chriſt Jeſus; bow to his ſovereignty; know this, that except you are born again, and become new creatures, in the diſpoſitions of your mind, you cannot be ſaved. Shall miniſters watch and pray for your ſouls night and day, and you pay no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to them? Since they are ſo valuable, having ſuch a relation to God, did men regard divine glory, they would regard their ſouls, as being deſigned to exhibit it. Be inſtructed, then, to delay no longer, but by repentance toward God, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, make
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023437_0021_0FBF70515A99D850"/>
peace with him, before you are ſummoned before his awful bar. Let me bear teſtimony againſt a practice too common on ſuch occaſions as this: Many people think it a time for carnal mirth and diſſipation, than which nothing can be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to God, nor inconſiſtent with that day, and ſtrict account that ſuch an occaſion tends to excise in the mind. May all, both miniſters and people, be exhorted to diligence in their work, that finally we may adopt the language of the bleſſed Apoſtle,—"As alſo ye have acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye alſo are ours in the day of the LORD JESUS.</p>
