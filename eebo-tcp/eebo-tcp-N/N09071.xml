            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A short Narrative of the horrid Massacre in <hi>Boston,</hi> perpetrated in the Evening of the Fifth Day of <hi>March,</hi> 1770, by Soldiers of the XXIX<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment; which with the XIV<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were then quartered there: with some Observations on the State of Things prior to that Catastrophe.</head>
            <p>IT may be a proper introduction to this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, briefly to represent the state of things for some time previous to the said massacre:</p>
            <p>And this seems necessary in order to the forming a just idea of the causes of it.</p>
            <p>At the end of the late war, in which this Province bore so distinguished a part, a happy union subsisted between Great-Britain and the Colonies. This was unfortunately interrupted by the Stamp-Act: but it was in some measure restored by the Repeal of it. It was again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by other acts of parliament for taxing America; and by the appointment of aBoard of Commissioners, in pursuance of an act, which by the face of it was made for the relief and encouragement of commerce, but which in it's operation, it was apprehended, would have, and it has in fact had, a contrary effect. By the said act the said Commissioners were
"to be resident
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011581_0005_0F874623AC748228"/>
in some convenient part of his Majesty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in America"
—This must be understood to be in some part convenient for the whole— But it does not appear, that in fixing the place of their residence, the convenience of the whole was at all consulted, for Boston being very far from the centre of the colonies, could not be the place most convenient for the whole.— Judging by the act, it may seem this town was intended to be favoured, by the Commissioners being appointed to reside here; and that the consequence of that residence would be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and encouragement of commerce: but the reverse has been the constant and uniform effect of it: So that the commerce of the town, from the embarassments in which it has been lately involved, is greatly reduced. For the particulars on this head, see the state of the trade not long since drawn up and transmitted to England by a committee of the merchants of Boston.</p>
            <p>The residence of the Commissioners here, has been detrimental not only to the commerce, but to the political interests of the town and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and not only so, but we can trace from it the causes of the late horrid massacre. Soon after their arrival here in November 1767, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of confining themselves to the proper busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their office, they became partizans of Governor Bernard in his political schemes; and had the weakness and temerity to infringe upon one of the most essential rights of the house of commons of this province— that of giving
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011581_0006_0F8746250F7BB308"/>
their votes with freedom, and not being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table therefor but to their constituents. One of the members of that house Capt. Timothy Folgier, having voted in some affair contrary to the mind of the said Commissioners, was for so doing dismissed from the office he held under them.</p>
            <p>These proceedings of theirs, the difficulty of access to them on office-business, and a superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious behaviour, rendered them disgustful to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, who in consequence thereof treated them with neglect. This probably sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated them to resent it: and to make their resentment felt, they and their coadjutor Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Bernard, made such representations to his Majesty's ministers as they thought best calculated to bring the displeasure of the nation upon the town and province: and in order that those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations might have the more weight, they are said to have contrived, and executed plans for exciting disturbances and tumults, which otherwise would probably never have existed; and when excited, to have transmitted to the ministry the most exaggerated accounts of them.</p>
            <p>These particulars of their conduct his Majesty's Council of this province have fully laid open in their proceeding in council, and in their address to General Gage, in July and October 1768; and in their letter to Lord Hillsborough of the 15th of April 1769.—Unfortunately for us, they have been too successful in their said repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, which in conjunction with Governor Bernard's, have occasioned his Majesty's faithful
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011581_0007_0F874626031B8840"/>
subjects of this town and province to be treated as enemies and rebels, by an invasion of the town by sea and land: to which the approaches were made with all the circumspection, usual where a vigorous opposition is expected. While the town was surrounded by a considerable number of his Majesty's ships of war, two regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments landed and took possession of it; and to support these, two other regiments arrived some time after from Ireland: one of which landed at Castle Island, and the other in the town.</p>
            <p>Thus were we, in aggravation of our other embarrassments, embarrassed with troops, forced upon us contrary to our inclination —contrary to the spirit of Magna Charta,— contrary to the very letter of the Bill of Rights, in which it is declared, that the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom in time of peace, unless it be with the consent of parliament, is against law—and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the desire of the civil magistrates, to aid whom was the pretence for sending the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ops hither: who were quartered in the town in direct violation of an act of parliament for quartering troops in America: and all this in consequence of the representations of the said Commissioners and the said Governor, as appears by their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials and letters lately published.</p>
            <p>As they were the procuring cause of troops being sent hither, they must therefore be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and a blameable cause of all the disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and bloodshed that have taken place in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of that Measure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011581_0008_0F87462622A4F520"/>But we shall leave them to their own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after observing, that as they had some months before the arrival of the troops, under pretence of safety to their persons, retired from town to the Castle, so after the arrival of the troops, and their being quartered in the town, they thought proper to return: having answered, as they doubtless thought, the purpose of their voluntary flight.</p>
            <p>We shall next attend to the conduct of the troops, and to some circumstances relative to them.—Governor Bernard without consulting the Council, having given up the State-house to the troops at their landing, they took possession of the chambers, where the representatives of the province and the courts of law held their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and (except the council-chamber) of all other parts of that house: in which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a considerable time, to the great annoyance of those courts while they sat, and of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and gentlemen of the town, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the lower floor of it their exchange. They had a right so to do, as the property of it was in the town: but they were deprived of that right by meer power.—The said Governor soon after, by every stratagem and by every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but a forcible entry, endeavored to get possession of the manufactory-house, to make a barrack of it for the troops: and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose caused it to be besieged by the troops, and the people in it to be used very cruelly; which extraordinary proceedings created universal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011581_0009_0F874626E3881990"/>
arising from the apprehension; that the troops under the influence of such a man would be employed to effect the most dangerous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses: but failing of that, other houses were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, in which, contrary to act of parliament, he caused the troops to be quartered. After their quarters were settled, the main guard was posted at one of the said houses, directly opposite to, and not twelve yards from, the State-house, (where the General Court, and all the Law Courts for the County were held) with two field pieces pointed to the State-house. This situation of the main guard and field pieces seemed to indicate an attack upon the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a defiance of law; and to be intended to affront the legislative and executive authority of the province.</p>
            <p>The General Court, at the first Session after the arrival of the troops, viewed it in this light, and applied to Governor Bernard to cause such a nusance to be removed; but to no purpose. Disgusted at such an indignity, and at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being under duresse, they refused to do business in such circumstances; and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof were adjourned to Cambridge, to the great inconvenience of the members.</p>
            <p>Besides this, the challenging the inhabitants by centinels posted in all parts of the town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lodgings of officers, which (for about six months, while it lasted) occasioned many quarrels and great uneasiness—</p>

Wilson's, of the 59th, exciting the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes of the town to take away their masters lives and property, and repair to the army for protection, which was fully proved against him. —The attack of a party of soldiers on some of the magistrates of the town—the repeated res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cues of soldiers from peace officers—the firing of a loaded musket in a public street, to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering a great number of peaceable inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants—the frequent wounding of persons by their bayonets and cutlassas, and the numerous instances of bad behaviour in the soldiery made us early sensible, that the troops were not sent here for any benefit to the town or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and that we had no good to expect from such conservators of the peace.<note n="*" place="bottom">The inhabitants, instead of making application to the military officers on these occasions, chose rather to oppose the civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and the laws of the land to such offenders; and had not the soldiery found means to evade legal punishments, it is more than probable their insolence would have received a check and some of the most melancholy effects of it been prevented.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It was not expected however, that such an outrage and massacre, as happened here on the evening of the fifth instant, would have been perpetrated. There were then killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a discharge of musquetry, eleven of his Majesty's subjects, viz.</p>
            <p>Mr. Samuel Gray, killed on the spot by a ball entering his head.</p>
            <p>Crispus Attucks, a molatto, killed on the spot, two balls entering his breast.</p>
            <p>Mr. James Caldwell, killed on the spot, by two balls entering his back.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:011581_0011_0F87462AA5DF9268"/>Mr. Samuel Maverick, a youth of seventeen years of age, mortally wounded: he died the next morning.</p>
            <p>Mr. Patrick Carr mortally wounded: he died the 14th instant.</p>
            <p>Christopher Monk and John Clark, youths about seventeen years of age, dangerously wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is apprehended they will die.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edward Payne, merchant, standing at his door: wounded.</p>
            <p>Messi'rs John Green, Robert Patterson and David Parker: all dangerously wounded.</p>
            <p>The actors in this dreadful tragedy were a party of soldiers commanded by Capt. Preston of the 29th regiment: This party, including the Captain, consisted of eight, who are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to goal.</p>
            <p>There are depositions in this affair which mention, that several guns were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired at the same time from the Custom-House; before which this shocking scene was exhibited. Into this matter inquisition is now making.—In the mean time it may be proper to insert here the substance of some of those depositions.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Frizell, on the evening of the 5th of March, having taken his station near the west corner of the Custom-House in Kingstreet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and at the time of the soldiers firing their guns, declares (among other things) that the first discharge was only of one gun, the next of two guns, upon which he the deponent thinks he saw a man stumble: the third discharge was
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011581_0012_0F87462C0B610660"/>
of three guns, upon which he thinks he saw two men fall, and immediately after were discharged five guns, two of which were by soldiers on his right hand, <hi>the other three, as appeared to the deponent, were discharged from the balcony, or the chamber window of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <hi>the flashes appearing on the left hand, and higher than the right hand flashes appeared to be, and of which the deponent was very sensible,</hi> altho' his eyes were much turned to the soldiers, who were all on his right hand.</p>
            <p>Gillam Bass, being in King-street at the same time, declares that they (the party of soldiers from the main guard) posted themselves between the custom-house door, and the west corner of it; and in a few minutes began to fire upon the people: <hi>Two or three of the flashes so high above the rest, that he the deponent verily believes they must have come from the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE <hi>windows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jeremiah Allen declares, that in the evening of the 5th day of March current, being at about nine o'clock in the front chamber in the house occupied by Col. Ingersoll in King-street, he heard some guns fired, which occasioned his going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the balcony of the said house.—That when he was in the said balcony in company with Mr. William Molineux jun'r. and John Simpson, he heard the discharge of four or five guns, the flashes of which appeared to be to the westward of the centry box, and immediately after, he the deponent <hi>heard two or three more guns and saw
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011581_0013_0F87462D0867F270"/>
the flashes thereof from out of the house, now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <hi>as they evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him,</hi> and which he the said deponent at the same time declared to the aforesaid Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux and Simpson being then near him, <hi>saying to them,</hi> (at the same time pointing his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the custom-house) <hi>there they are out of the custom-house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>George Coster being in King-street at the time above mentioned, declares that in five or six mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after he stopped, he heard the word of command given to the soldiers <hi>fire,</hi> upon which one gun was fired, which did no execution, as the deponent observed, about half a minute after two guns, one of which killed one Samuel Gray a ropemaker, the other a molatto man, between which two men the deponent stood, after this the deponent heard the discharge of four or five guns more, by the soldiers; immediately after which <hi>the deponent heard the discharge of two guns or pistols, from an open window of the middle story of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, near to the place where the centry box is placed, and being but a small distance from the window, he heard the people from within speak and laugh, and soon after saw the casement lowered down; after which the deponent assisted others in carrying off one of the corps.</p>
            <p>Cato, a Negro man, servant to Tuthill Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bart, <abbr>Esq</abbr> declares, that on Monday evening the fifth of March current, on hearing the cry of fire, he ran into Kingstreet, where he saw a number
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011581_0014_0F87462DA082D488"/>
of people assembled before the Custom-House, that he stood near the centry-box and saw the soldiers fire on the people, who stood in the middle of said street; directly after which <hi>he saw two flashes of guns, one quick upon the other, from the chamber window of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE; and that after the firing was all over, while the people were carrying away the dead and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>he saw the Custom-House door opened, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d several soldiers (one of whom had a cutlass) go into the Custom-House</hi> and shut the door after them.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Andrews declares, that being desired by the committee of enquiry to take the ranges of the holes made by musquet balls, in two houses near opposite to the Custom-House, he finds the bullet hole in the entry door post of Mr. Payne's house (and which graz'd the edge of the door, before it enter'd the post, where it lodged, two and a half inches deep) <hi>ranges just under the stool of the westernmost lower chamber window of the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE.</p>
            <p>Samuel Drowne, towards the end of his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition (which contains a pretty full account of the proceedings of the soldiers on the evening of the 5th instant) declares, that <hi>he saw the flashes of two guns fired from the</hi> CUSTOM-HOUSE, <hi>one of which was out of a window of the chamber westward of the balcony, and the other from the balcony; the gun (which he clearly discerned) being pointed through the ballisters, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who held the gun, in a stooping posture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011581_0015_0F87462E67192BA8"/>
himself into the house, having a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or some kind of cloth over his face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These depositions shew clearly that a number of guns were fired from the Custom-House.— As this affair is now enquiring into, all the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice we shall take of it is, that it distinguishes the actors in it into Street-Actors and House-Actors; which is necessary to be observed.</p>
            <p>What gave occasion to the melancholy event of that evening seems to have been this. A difference having happened near Mr. Gray's ropewalk, between a soldier and a man belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, the soldier challenged the ropemakers to a boxing match. The challenge was accepted by one of them, and the soldier worsted. He ran to the barrack in the neighbourhood, and returned with several of his companions. The fray was renewed, and the soldiers were driven off. They soon returned with recruits and were again worsted. This happened several times, till at length a considerable body of soldiers was collected, and they also were driven off, the ropemakers having been joined by their brethren of the contiguous ropewalks. By this time Mr. Gray being alarmed interposed, and with the assistance of some gentlemen prevented any further disturbance. To satisfy the soldiers and punish the man who had been the occasion of the first difference, and as an example to the rest, he turned him out of his service; and waited on Col. Dalrymple, the commanding officer of the troops, and with him concerted measures for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011581_0016_0F87462F4C40D358"/>
preventing further mischief. Though this affair ended thus, it made a strong impression on the minds of the soldiers in general, who thought the honor of the regiment concerned to revenge those repeated repulses. For this purpose they seem to have formed a combination to commit some outrage upon the inhabitants of the town indiscriminately; and this was to be done on the evening of the 5th instant or soon after: as appears by the depositions of the following per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, viz.</p>
            <p>William Newhall declares, that on Thursday night the first of March instant, he met four soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the 29th regiment, and that he heard them say <hi>there were a great many that would eat their dinners on Monday next, that should not eat any on Tuesday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Daniel Calfe declares, that on Saturday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 3d of March a camp-woman, wife to James McDeed a grenadier of the 29th, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his father's shop, and the people talking about the affrays at the rope-walks, and blaming the soldiers for the part they had acted in it, the woman said, the soldiers were in the right; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that before Tuesday or Wednesday night they would wet their swords or bayonets in New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland people's blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mary Brailsford declares, that on Sabbath evening the 4th March instant a Soldier came to the house of Mr. Amos Thayer where she then was. He desiring to speak with Mr. Thayer was told by Mrs. Mary Thayer, that her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011581_0017_0F87462FDB957A48"/>
was engaged, and could not be spoke with. He said, your brother as you call him, is a man I have a great regard for, and I came on purpose to tell him to keep in his house, for <hi>before Tuesday night next at Twelve o'clock, there will be a great deal of bloodshed, and a great many lives lost:</hi> and added, that he came out of a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to her brother to advise him to keep in his house, for then he would be out of harm's way. He said, your brother knows me very well: my name is Charles Malone. He then went away.— Of the same import, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n confirmation of this declaration, are the depositions of Mary Thayer and Asa Copeland, who both live with the said Mr. Thayer, and heard what the soldier said as abovementioned. It is also confirmed by the deposition of Nicholas Ferriter.</p>
            <p>Jane Usher declares, that about 9 o'clock on monday morning the 5th of March current, from a window she saw two persons in the habit of soldiers, one of whom being on horse back appeared to be an officer's servant. The person on the horse first spoke to the other, but what he said, she is not able to say, though the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was open, and she not more than twenty feet distant: the other replied, <hi>He hoped he should see blood enough spilt before morning.</hi>

wife, with one of the fifers of said regiment. When he had got what he went for, and was coming away, the corporal called him back, and desired him with great earnestness to go home to his master's house as soon as business was over, and not to be abroad on any account that night in particular, for <hi>the soldiers were determined to be revenged on the ropewalk people; and that much mischief would be done.</hi> Upon which the fifer (about 18 or 19 years of age) said, <hi>he hoped in God they would burn the town down.</hi> On this he left the house, and the said corporal called after him again, and begged he would mind what he said to him.</p>
            <p>Caleb Swan declares, that on monday night the 5th of March instant, at the time of the bells ringing for fire, he heard a woman's voice whom he knew to be the supposed wife of one Montgomery, a grenadier of the 29th regiment, standing at her door, <hi>and heard her say, it was not fire; the town was too haughty and too proud; and that many of their arses would be laid low before the morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Margaret Swansborough declares, that a free woman named Black Peg, who has kept much with the soldiers, on hearing the disturbance on monday evening the 5th instant said, <hi>the soldiers were not to be trod upon by the inhabitants, but would know before morning, whether they or the inhabitants were to be masters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Joseph Hooton, junr. declares, that coming from the South-end of Boston on monday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011581_0019_0F8746332CF1BCC0"/>
the 5th of March instant, against Dr. Sewall's meeting he heard a great noise and tumult, with the cry of murder often repeated. Proceeding towards the town-house he was passed by several soldiers running that way, with naked cutlasses and bayonets in their hands. He asked one of them what was the matter, and was answered by him, by God you shall all know what is the matter soon. Between 9 and 10 o'clock he went into King-street, and was present at the tragical scene exhibited near the Custom-house; as particularly set forth in his deposition.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mary Russell declares, that John Brails<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a private soldier of the <hi>fourteenth</hi> regiment, who had frequently been employed by her (when he was ordered with his company to the Castle, in consequence of the murders committed by the soldiers on the evening of the 5th of March) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deponent's house declared, that THEIR <hi>regiment were</hi> ORDERED <hi>to hold themselves in readiness, and accordingly was ready</hi> THAT EVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING, <hi>upon the inhabitants firing on the soldiery, to come to the assistance of the soldiery.</hi> On which she asked him, if he would have fired upon any of the inhabitants of this town. To which he replied, yes, if he had orders: but that if he saw Mr. Russell he would have fired wide of him. He also said, <hi>it's well there was no gun fired by the Inhabitants, for had there been,</hi> WE <hi>should have come to the soldiers assistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the foregoing depositions it appears very clearly, there was a general combination among
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011581_0020_0F8746339F49A8A8"/>
the soldiers of the 29th regiment at least, to commit some extraordinary act of violence upon the town; that if the inhabitants attempted to repel it by firing even one gun upon those sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the 14th regiment were ordered to be in readiness to assist them; and that on the late butchery in King-street they actually were ready for that purpose, had a single gun been fired on the perpetrators of it.</p>
            <p>It appears by a variety of depositions, that on the same evening between the hours of six and half after nine (at which time the firing began) many persons, without the least provocation, were in various parts of the town, insulted and abused by parties of armed soldiers patroling the streets: particularly —</p>
            <p>Mr. Robert Pierpont declares, that between the hours of 7 &amp; 8 in the same evening, 3 armed soldiers passing him, one of them who had a bayonet gave him a back-handed stroke with it, on complaint of this treatment he said the deponent should soon hear more of it, and threatned him very hard.</p>
            <p>Mr. Henry Bass declares, that at 9 o'clock a party of soldiers came out of Draper's alley lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and from Murray's barracks, and they being armed with large naked cutlasses, made at every body coming in their way, cutting and slashing, and that he himself very narrowly es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped receiving a cut from the foremost of them, who pursued him.</p>
            <p>Samuel Atwood, declares, that 10 or 12 sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers armed with drawn cutlasses, bolted out of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011581_0021_0F8746345CC6C688"/>
the alley leading from Murray's barracks into dock-square, and met the deponent, who asked them if they intended to murder people? they answered, yes, by God, root and branch; saying here is one of them; with that one of them struck the deponent with a club, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by another: the deponent being unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed turned to go off, and he received a wound on the left shoulder, which reached the bone, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him and gave him much pain. Having gone a few steps the deponent met <hi>two officers,</hi> and asked them, gentlemen, what is the matter? <hi>they answered, you will see by and by;</hi> and as he passed by Col. Jackson's he heard the cry, turn out the guards.</p>
            <p>Capt. James Kirkwood, declares, that about nine of the clock in the evening of the fifth day of March current, he was going by Murray's barracks: hearing a noise he stopt at Mr. Rhoads's Door, opposite the said barracks, where said Rhoads was standing, and stood some time and saw the soldiers coming out of the yard from the barracks, armed with cutlasses and bayonets, and rushing thro' Boylstone's alley into cornhill, two officers, viz. Lieuts. Minchin and Dickson came out of the mess house, and said to the soldiers, my lads come into the barracks and don't hurt the inhabitants, and then retir'd into the mess house. Soon after they came to the door again, and found the soldiers in the yard; and directly upon it, <hi>Ensign Mall</hi> came to the gate of the barrack yard and <hi>said to the soldiers, turn
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011581_0022_0F8746354133CCE0"/>
out and I will stand by you;</hi> this he repeated frequently, adding, <hi>kill them! stick them; knock them down, run your bayonets thro' them,</hi> with a great deal of language of like import. Upon which a great number of soldiers came out of the barracks, with naked cutlasses <hi>headed by said Mall,</hi> and went thro' the aforesaid alley, that some offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers came &amp; got the soldiers into their barracks, and that <hi>Mall with his sword or cutlass drawn in his hand, as often had them out again,</hi> but were at last drove into their barracks by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Minchin and Dickson.</p>
            <p>Mr. Henry Rhoads's declaration agrees with Capt. Kirkwood's.</p>
            <p>Mr. Matthias King of Halifax in Nova Scotia, declares, that in the evening of the fifth day of March instant about nine of the clock, he was at his lodgings at Mrs. Torrey's near the town pump, and heard the bells ring and the cry of fire; upon which he went to the door and saw several sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers come round the south side of the town house, armed with bayonets, and something which he took to be broad swords; that one of those people came up almost to him and Mr. Bartholomew Kneeland; and that they had but just time to shut the door upon him; otherwise he is well assured they must have fell victims to their boundless cruelty. He afterwards went into the upper chamber of the said house, and was looking out of the window <hi>when the drum and the guard went to the barrack,</hi> and he saw one of the guards kneel and present his piece
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011581_0023_0F874635DCAC5500"/>
with a bayonet fixed, and heard him swear he would fire upon a parcel of boys who were then in the street, but he did not: He further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>when the body of troops was drawn up before the guard house (which was presently after the massacre) he heard an officer say to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this was fine work, and just what he wanted;</hi> but in the hurry he could not see him, so as to know him again.</p>
            <p>Robert Polley declares, that on monday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 5th instant, as he was going home, he observed about ten persons standing near Mr. Taylor's door, after standing there a small space of time he went with them towards Boylston's alley opposite to Murray's barracks; we met in the alley about eight or nine arm'd soldiers, they assaulted us, and gave us a great deal of abusive language, we then drove them back to the barracks with sticks only; we looked for stones or bricks, but could find none, the ground being covered with snow; some of the lads dispersed, and he the said Polley with a few others were returning peaceably home, when we met about nine or ten other sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers armed: one of them said,
"Where are the sons of bitches":
They struck at several persons in the street, and went towards the head of the alley. Two officers came and endeavored to get them into their barracks; one of the lads proposed to ring the bell; the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers went thro' the alley, and the boys huzza'd and said they were gone thro' royal exchange lane into Kingstreet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011581_0024_0F87463A9E79DD58"/>Samuel Drowne declares, that about nine of the clock of the evening of the fifth of March current, standing at his own door in Cornhill, he saw about 14 or 15 soldiers of the 29th re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, who came from Murray's barracks arm'd with naked cutlasses, swords, &amp;c. and came upon the inhabitants of the town, then standing or walking in Cornhill, and abused some, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently assaulted others as they met them; most of whom were without so much as a stick in their hand to defend themselves, as he very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could discern, it being moon light, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self being one of the assaulted persons. All or most of the said soldiers he saw go into King-street, (some of them through Royal Exchange lane) and there followed them, and soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them to be quarrelling and fighting with the people whom they saw there, which he thinks were not more than a dozen, when the soldiers came there first, armed as aforesaid. Of those dozen people, the most of them were gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, standing together a little below the Town-House, upon the exchange. At the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of those soldiers so arm'd, the most of the twelve persons went off, some of them being first assaulted.</p>
            <p>The violent proceedings of this party, and their going into King-street,
"quarrelling and fighting with the people whom they saw there"
(mentioned in Mr. Drowne's deposition) was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately introductory to the grand catastrophe.</p>
            <p>These assailants, who issued from Murray's
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011581_0025_0F87463B32DD6878"/>
barracks (so called) after attacking and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers persons in Cornhill, as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, being armed, proceeded (most of them) up the Royal Exchange lane, into King-street; where making a short stop, and after assaulting and driving away the few they met there, they brandished their arms, and cried out, where are the Boogers! where are the Cowards. At this time there were very few persons in the street beside themselves.—This party in proceeding from Exchange lane into King-street must pass the centry posted at the westerly corner of the Custom House, which butts on that lane and fronts on that street. This is needful to be mentioned, as near that spot and in that street the bloody tragedy was acted, and the street-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in it were stationed: Their station being but a few feet from the front side of the said Custom House.—The outrageous behavior and the threats of the said party occasioned the ringing of the meeting house bell near the head of King-street: which bell ringing quick as for fire, it presently brought out a number of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who being soon sensible of the occasion of it, were naturally led to King-street, where the said party had made a stop but a little while before: and where their stopping had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a number of boys, round the centry at the Custom-House. Whether the boys mistook the centry for one of the said party, and thence took occasion to differ with him, or whether he first affronted them, which is affirmed in several depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,—however
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011581_0026_0F87463BDED25D98"/>
that may be, there was much foul language between them: and some of them in consequence of his pushing at them with his bayonet, threw snow balls at him:<note n="*" place="bottom">Since writing this narrative, several depositions have appeared, which make it clear, that the centry was first in fault.—He overheard a barber's boy, saying that a captain of the 14th (who had just passed by) was so mean a fellow as not to pay his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for shaving him; upon this the centry left his post and followed the boy into the middle of the street, where he told him to shew his face; the boy p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtly reply'd, I am not asham'd to shew my face to any man: Upon this the centry gave him a sweeping stroke on the head with his musket, which made him reel and stagger and cry much. A fellow apprentice asked the centry what he meant by this abuse? He reply'd, damn your blood, if you do not get out of the way I will give you something; and then fixed his bayonet and pushed at the lads, who both run out of his way. This dispute collected a few persons about the boy, near the custom-house. Presently after this, the party above-mentioned came into kingstreet, which was a further occasion of drawing people thither, as above related. (See deposition of Benja. Broaders and others.)</note> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned him to knock hastily at the door of the Custom-House. From hence two persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon proceeded immediately to the main guard, which was posted (opposite to the State-house) at a small distance near the head of the said street. The officer on guard was Capt. Preston, who with seven or eight soldiers with fire arms, and charged bayonets, issued from the guard house, and in great haste posted himself and his soldiers in the front of the Custom House near the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aforesaid. In passing to this station the soldiers pushed several persons with their bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets, driving through the people in so rough a manner that it appeared they intended to create a disturbance. This occasioned some
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011581_0027_0F87463C9C89B5B8"/>
snow balls to be thrown at them: which seems to have been the only provocation that was given. Mr. Knox (between whom and Capt. Preston there was some conversation on the spot) declares, that while he was talking with Capt. Preston, the soldiers of his detachment had attacked the people with their bayonets; and that there was not the least provocation given to Capt. Preston, or his party: the backs of the people being towards them when the people were attacked. He also declares, that Captain Preston seemed to be in great haste and much agitated; and that according to his opinion there were not then present in Kingstreet above seventy or eighty persons at the extent.</p>
            <p>The said party was formed into a half circle, and, within a short time after they had been posted at the Custom-House, began to fire upon the people.</p>
            <p>Capt. Preston is said to have ordered them to fire, and to have repeated that order. One gun was fired first: then others in succession, and with deliberation, till ten or a dozen guns were fired; or till that number of discharges were made from the guns that were fired. By which means eleven persons were killed, and wounded, as above represented.</p>
            <p>These facts with divers circumstances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, are supported by the depositions of a considerable number of persons: and among others, of the following viz. Messir's. Henry Bass Samuel Atwood, Samuel Drowne, James Kirk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011581_0028_0F87463D6B5A28E8"/>
Robert Polley, Samuel Condon, Daniel Usher, Josiah Simpson, Henry Knox, Gillam Bass, John Hickling, Richard Palmes, Benjamin Frizzel, and others; whose depositions are in the appendix.</p>
            <p>Soon after the firing, a drum with a party from the main guard went to Murray's and the other barracks, beating an alarm as they went, which with the firing had the effect of a signal for action. Whereupon all the soldiers of the 29th regiment, or the main body of them, appeared in Kingstreet under arms; and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bent on a further massacre of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, which was with great difficulty prevented. They were drawn up between the State House and main guard: their lines extending across the street and facing down Kingstreet, where the town-people were assembled. The first line kneeled; and the whole of the first plattoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented their guns ready to fire, as soon as the word should be given. They continued in that posture a considerable time. But by the good Providence ofGod, they were restained from firing.</p>
            <p>That they then went into Kingstreet with such a disposition will appear probable by the two following depositions.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Mary Gardner, living in Atkinson street, declares, that on Monday evening the 5th of March current, and before the guns fired in Kingstreet, there were a number of soldiers as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled from Green's barracks towards the street, and opposite to her gate; that they stood very
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011581_0029_0F87463E1B184B68"/>
still until the guns were fired in Kingstreet, then they clapped their hands and gave a cheer, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>this is all that we want.</hi> They ran to their barrack, and came out again in a few minutes, all with their arms, and ran towards Kingstreet.</p>
            <p>William Fallass declares, that (after the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Kingstreet) on the evening of the 5th instant, upon his return home he had occasion to stop opposite to the lane leading to Green's barracks, and while he stood there, the soldiers rushed by him with their arms, towards King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street, saying, <hi>this is our time or chance:</hi> and that he never saw men or dogs so greedy for their prey as those soldiers seemed to be, and the sergeants could hardly keep them in their ranks.</p>
            <p>These circumstances with those already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, amount to a clear proof of a combination among them to commit some outrage upon the town on that evening; and that after the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one committed in Kingstreet, they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add to the horrors of that night by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a further slaughter.</p>
            <p>At the time Capt. Preston's party issued from the main guard, there were in Kingstreet about two hundred persons, and those were collected there by the ringing of the bell in consequence of the violences of another party, that had been there a very little while before. When Captain Preston had got to the Custom-house, so great a part of the people dispersed at sight of the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that not more than twenty or thirty then remained in Kingstreet, as Mr. Drowne declares,<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Deposition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and at the time of the firing not seventy, as Mr. Palmes thinks.<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Deposition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But after the firing, and when the slaughter was known, which occasioned the ringing of all the bells of the town, a large body of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants soon assembled in Kingstreet, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there the whole time the 29th regiment was there under arms, and would not retire till that regiment and all the soldiers that appeared, were ordered, and actually went, to their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks: after which, having been assured by the Lieutenant Governor, and a number of the civil magistrates present, that every legal step should be taken to bring the criminals to justice, they gradually dispersed. For some time the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of things was dismal. The soldiers out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous on the one hand, and the inhabitants justly incensed against them on the other: both parties seeming disposed to come to action. In this case the consequences would have been ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. But by the interposition of his Honor, some of his Majesty's council, a number of civil magistrates, and other gentlemen of weight and influence, who all endeavoured to calm and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the people, and by the two principal officers interposing their authority with regard to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> soldiers, there was happily no further bloodshed ensued; and by two o'clock the town was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to a tolerable state of quiet. About that time, Capt. Preston, and a few hours after, the party that had fired, were committed to sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:011581_0031_0F87464173E46898"/>One happy effect has arisen from this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly affair, and it is the general voice of the town and province it may be a lasting one—All the troops are removed from the town.—They are quartered for the present in the barracks at Castle-Island; from whence it is hoped they will have a speedy order to remove intirely out of the province, together with those persons who were the occasion of their coming hither.</p>
            <p>In what manner this was effected, it is not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign from the subject of this narrative to relate.</p>
            <p>The morning after the massacre, a town-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was held; at which attended a very great number of the freeholders and other inhabitants of the town. They were deeply impressed and affected by the tragedy of the preceding night, and were unanimously of opinion, it was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their safety that the troops should remain any longer in the town. In consequence thereof they chose a committee of fifteen gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to wait upon his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to request of him to issue his orders for the immediate removal of the troops.</p>
            <p>The message was in these words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting that the inhabitants and soldiery can no longer live together in safety; that nothing can ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be expected to restore the peace of the town and prevent further blood and carnage, but the immediate removal of the troops; and that we therefore most fervently pray his Honor, that his power and influence may be exerted for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant removal.</hi>

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:011581_0032_0F874641DE85BC68"/>His Honor's reply, which was laid before the town then adjourned to the old south meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, was as follows:

                     <p>I am extremely sorry for the unhappy differences between the inhabitants and troops, and especially for the action of the last evening, and I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted myself upon that occasion, that a due enquiry may be made, and that the law may have its course. I have in council consulted with the commanding officers of the two regiments who are in the town. They have their orders from the General at New York. It is not in my power to countermand those orders. The Council have desired that the two regiments may be removed to the Castle. From the particular concern which the <hi>29</hi>th regiment has had in your differences, Col.

            <p>The foregoing reply having been read and fully considered—the question was put, Whether the report be satisfactory? Passed in the Negative (only one dissentient) out of upwards of 4000 voters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011581_0033_0F874643434C2978"/>A respectable committee was then appointed to wait on his Honor the Lieutenant Governor, and inform him, <hi>that it is the unanimous opinion of this meeting, that the reply made to a vote of the inhabitants presented his Honor in the morning, is by no means satisfactory; and that nothing less will satisfy, than a total and immediate removal of all the troops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The committee having waited upon the Lieut. Governor, agreeable to the foregoing vote, laid before the inhabitants the following vote of Council received from his Honor.</p>
            <p>His Honor the Lieutenant Governor laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Board a vote of the town of Boston, passed this afternoon, and then addressed the Board as follows:

                           <p>I lay before you a vote of the town of Boston, which I have just now received from them, and I now ask your advice what you judge necessary to be done upon it.</p>
                           <p>The Council thereupon expressed themselves to be unanimously of opinion, "that it was absolutely necessary for his Majesty's service, the good order of the town, and the peace of the province, that the troops should be immediately removed out of the town of Boston, and thereupon advised his Honor to communicate this advice of the Council

The committee also informed the town, that Col. Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymple, after having seen the vote of Council, said to the committee,</p>
                           <p>That he now gave his word of honor that he would begin his preparations in the morning, and that there should be no unnecessary delay until the whole of the two regiments were removed to the Castle.</p>

            <p>Upon the above report being read, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants could not avoid expressing the high sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction it afforded them.</p>
            <p>After measures were taken for the security of the town in the night by a strong military watch, the meeting was dissolved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:011581_0035_0F87464429300D58"/>WITH respect to the securing the town by a military watch, which was a very necessary measure, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies, in pursuance of their plan of misrepresentation, have taken pains to misrepresent it, by declaring it to have been contrary to the mind of the Commander in Chief, and against Law.</p>
            <p>This matter will be judged of, by stating the fact, and producing the Law.</p>
            <p>When the Committee, who had waited on the Lieutenant Governor, had reported to the Town, that the Troops would be removed to Castle-Island, (at which time it was near night) it was thought necessary for the safety of the Town, and for preventing a rescue of the persons committed to goal for firing upon, and killing a number of, his Majesty's subjects, that there should be a military watch: and divers Gentlemen were desired to take the needful steps for that purpose. It being then night, it was impossible a regular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification should issue from the officers of the militia: a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number of respectable persons therefore offered themselves voluntiers, and did the duty of a military watch under the direction of the Lieutenant-Colonel, who attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that service with the approbation of the chief Colonel of the Boston regiment. The next day, with two of the Select<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Town, the chief Colonel went to the Lieutenant-Governor, &amp; they informed him it was apprehended absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for the safety of the Town, there should be a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary watch kept; and that the Colonel then waited upon him to receive his orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. The Lieutenant Governor declined giving any orders concerning it, but said the Law was clear, that the Colonel, as chief officer of the regiment, might order a military watch; and that he might do about it as he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it. In consequence of this, and knowing the Law gave him such a power, the Colonel issued his orders for that purpose, &amp; a regular watch was kept the following night. The
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011581_0036_0F87464506BD8E30"/>
next day the Lieutenant Governor sent for the Colonel, and let him know, that he was in doubt about the legality of the appointment of the military watch: and recommended to the Colonel to take good advice, whether he had a right by Law to order such a watch.</p>
            <p>This being quite unexpected, occasioned the Colonel to express himself with some fervor. He also said, he had already taken advice, and had no doubt of his own power; but had the preceeding day waited upon his Honor as Commander in Chief to receive his orders: which as his Honor had declined giving, and left the matter with himself, he had appointed a military watch: and judged it a necessary measure to quiet the fears and apprehensions of the town. The interview ended with the Lieut. Governor's recommending again, that the Colonel would take care to proceed according to law; and without his forbidding a military watch.</p>
            <p>This military watch was continued every night, till Col. Dalrymple had caused the two Regiments under his command to be removed to the barracks at Castle-Island. Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch, the Justices of the Peace in their turns attended every night: and the utmost order and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity took place through the whole of it.</p>
            <p>This is the state of the fact, upon which every one is left to make his own observations.</p>
            <p>Now for the Law: with respect to which nothing more is necessary than just to recite it. It runs thus,
"That there be military watches appointed and kept in every town, at such times, in such places, and in such numbers, and under such regulation, as the chief military officers of each town shall appoint, or as they may receive orders from the chief officer of the regiment."
<note n="*" place="bottom">See a Law of the Province for regulating the Militia, made in the 5th year of William and Mary, Chap. 7. Sect. 10.</note>—This needs no comment. It clearly authorizes the chief officer of the regiment to appoint military watches. The late military watch in Boston being founded on such an appointment was therefore according to Law.</p>

They then retired on board the Romney man of war, and from thence to the castle: for what purpose, their letters and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials lately published have sufficiently informed the world.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hese manoeuvres since the 5th of March indicate? Is it possible to suppose they indicate any thing less than a design to take occasion from the outrages and murders committed on the evening of that day by the soldiers (assisted perhaps fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m the custom-house) to represent the town in a disadvantageous light? And does not their former conduct render this highly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>obable?—Besides, it is a fact, that depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions have been taken in a secret manner, relative to that unhappy affair, to the prejudice of the town; and it is no way improbable, that Mr. Robinson is gone home with memorials and letters from the Commissioners and others, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such depositions.</p>
            <p>By some escapes, as well as by what the circumstances above mentioned make probable, a pretty good judgment may be formed of the substance of those Memorials, Letters and Depositions, viz. that the custom-house was attacked—the revenue chest in danger, but saved by the firing upon the <hi>mob</hi> —the King's troops compelled to leave the town—the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners thence obliged for their safety to quit it also—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent impossibility of their holding boards—the detriment thence arising to the revenue and his Majesty's service—all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at an end, and the Province in a state of rebellion.</p>
            <p>If these be, either in whole or in part, the subjects of the dispatches sent home, it is very proper a few observations should be made upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:011581_0039_0F8746471B5792A0"/>The custom-house attacked—a falsehood. The people drawn into kingstreet, were drawn thither by the cry of fire, and the outrages of the soldiers, which occasioned it. From the first appearance of the people in kingstreet, to the time of the firing upon them, there had not past fifteen minutes. It might with as much truth be affirmed, that they made an attack upon the custom-house in London, as upon the custom-house in Boston: of which latter there was not even a pane of glass broken.</p>
            <p>The revenue chest in danger—a falsehood. It is not probable the chest is kept at the custom-house: but if it be, there was, and is, at least as much danger of it from some of the out-door people employ'd under theCommissioners, as from any body else. It is certain that some of them are of an infamous character.</p>
            <p>The troops compelled to quit the town—a falsehood. They quitted the town by the orders of their commanding officer, in consequence of a <hi>request</hi> from the Lieut. Governor, who was advised by the council to <hi>pray</hi> the said officer to remove the troops. This <hi>request</hi> and this <hi>prayer</hi> was obtained by an application from the town to the Lieut. Governor. Into what times are we fallen, that the government of the province is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the humiliating condition of making <hi>such a prayer!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e troops had been compelled vi et armis to quit the town. It would have been a measure justifiable in the sight of God and man. When the soldiers, sent hither for the declared purpose of assisting the civil magistrate to keep the peace, were themselves in a remarkable manner the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the peace—When instead of assisting, they insulted him; and rescued offenders of their own corps from justice— when they frequently abused the inhabitants in the night— when they had entered into a combination to commit some extraordinary acts of violence upon the town, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, on the evening of the massacre, attacked the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants wherever they met them; afterwards firing upon, and killing and wounding a number of them. When all this had been done, and more threatned, it was high time they should be removed from the town. If there had been no other means of getting rid of them, the inhabitants would have had a right by that law of nature, which superceeds all other laws, when they come in competition with it—the law of self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation—to have compelled them to quit the town. This
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011581_0040_0F874649B6324C50"/>
law is radical in our nature, indelible from it, and uniformly operating, where it can ope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate, to the removal or destruction of every thing incompatible with it; and is abrogable by no other lawgiver than GOD himself, the great author of it. Therefore, although the resisting the King's troops in any thing they have a right by law to do, may be adjudged trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet when they act contrary to law, especially in so out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous a manner as in the present case, and retain a disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repeat it, whereby the lives of the King's subjects are in danger, they then cease to be the King's troops: that is, they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e not the King's troops for any such purpose, but so far become traitors; and on the failure of other means of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance from them, which the time and circumstances may make eligible and are lawful, they may (by the principles of all law, as well as by the great law above-mentioned, into which those principles are resolvable) be resisted and expelled: and not to do it, where it can be done, is a species of treason against the constitution, and consequently treason in an equal degree against the King, and all his subjects.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners obliged for their safety to quit the town.—If one falsehood can be more so than another, this is the greatest yet mentioned, and is as ridiculous as it is false. Their conduct and such a declaration by no means agree. Would they in that case occasionally visit the town? Would they trust themselves in the environs of it? Could they think themselves safe at Cambridge and Brooklyn? Could they think themselves safe any where in the province, or indeed in America? Must they not know, if any evil were really intended them, it might easily overtake them any where and every where on this side of the Atlantic? Some other reason than their safety must therefore be looked for to account for their retiring, and discontinuing their boards. A similar proceeding of theirs in June 1768, and their letters and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, lately published, give occasion at least to conjecture what that reason may be. Is it not probable it was to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the said depositions, and thence induce admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to think it necessary, not only that the troops already here should be continued, but that a further number should be sent to strengthen and support them? If this measure cannot be effected, and should the Commissioners be so unfortunate as to remain here unattacked in the absence of the troops, it might naturally be thought they could have remained here
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011581_0041_0F87464A37165B20"/>
without them in 1768; and therefore that they had put the nation to a very great expence, for no other purpose than fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to alienate the affections of the Americans, and to give them an additional reason to wish themselves independent of it: And hence the Commissioners might have cause to expect a national resentment against them.—However injurious to us the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cts of such policy may be, we cannot but applaud it (on the principles of theMachiavilian system) as it stands related to themselves. If they thought their own existence in danger, considered as Commissioners, how natural was it to use the means to support it? And what fault could be found with the means, if those principles justified them? Why need they trouble their heads about consequences that would not affect themselves? or, if they would, and such existence appeared precarious without those means, was it not necessary they should be used, and the consequences disregarded?—If the means be successful to the end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or which they seem designed, it requires no prophetic spirit to foretell that the consquences may be—bad enough. Whether the present Commissioners, or any Board of Commissioners at all (whose appointments are fully equal to any benefit the nation or colonies are likely to reap from them, and whose usefulness hitherto may be valued by some of the negative quantities in algebra) are <hi>things</hi> of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance enough to hazard those consequences, or any ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence at all, is humbly submitted to the wisdom of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to determine.</p>
            <p>The consequent impossibility of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olding boards— This impossibility was of their own creating. If they had continued in town (from whence they had not the least reason to depart, unless to answer purposes they would choose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal) they might have held their boards as usual.</p>
            <p>The detriment thence arising to the revenue, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's service—If any such detriment has arisen, the fault is their own. <hi>His Majesty's service</hi> is a cant term in the mouths of understrappers in office. Many of them either do not know the meaning of it, or abuse it to answer their own corrupt purposes. It is used to express something distinct from the service of the people. The King and People are placed by it in opposite interests. Whereas, by the happy constitution we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e under, the interest of the King is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the people, and his service is their service: Both are
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011581_0042_0F87464AF9681B20"/>
one, and constitutionally inseperable. They who attempt to seperate them attempt to destroy the constitution. Upon every such parricide may the vengeance both of King and People descend.</p>
            <p>Government at an end—This has been the cry ever since the stamp-act existed. If the people saw they were going to be enslaved; if they saw Governor Bernard (from whom they had a right to expect that he would do nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it) was zealous &amp; active to rivet the chains; and that <hi>his</hi> government, in its principles and conduct, tended to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of a tyranny over them, was it unnatural for them in such a case to reluct? was it unreasonable to refuse an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence in such measures? Did an opposition to them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate a disregard to government? If government, in the true idea of it, has for its object the good of the governed, <hi>such</hi> an administration could not be called government: and an opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it by no means included an opposition to government. From such an opposition has arisen the cry, that government is at an end. The sooner <hi>such</hi> government is at an end the better.</p>
            <p>When a people have lost all confidence in government, it is vain to expect a cordial obedience to it. Hence irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may arise, and have arisen. But they will cease, when the true ends of government are steadily pursued. Then, and not till then, may it be expected, that men of weight and influence will exert themselves to make government respected. Nay, such exertions will then be needless, for mankind cannot help respecting what is in itself respectable, especially when it is at the same time so promotive of their own good as good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is.</p>
            <p>The province in a state of rebellion—Into this state its enemies, on both sides of the atlantic, have been endeavoring to bring it. When they could not make it subservient to their interest and views; and when their measures had raised a spirit of opposition to them, that opposition was made the lucky occasion to represent the province in a state of rebellion, or verging towards it. To justify such a representation the more fully, they endeavored to drive it into that state: whereby in the end they might hope to gratify both their malice and avarice: their malice, by injuring it most essentially; and their avarice, by the subjection of it to their tyranny and pillage. But nothing can be more false than such a representation: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more foreign from this people than a disposition to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011581_0043_0F87464BA8325820"/>
The principles of loyalty were planted in our breasts too deep to be eradicated by <hi>their</hi> efforts, or any efforts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and our interest co-operated with those principles.</p>
            <p>It is humbly hoped his Majesty will not be influenced, by <hi>such</hi> representations, to think unfavorably of <hi>his faithful subjects of this province</hi>: and <hi>that</hi> hope is grounded upon their innocence: of which they have the highest evidence in their own consciousness; and of which they have given their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries no other cause to doubt, than what arises from an opposition to <hi>their</hi> measures. Measures, not only ruinous to the province, but hurtful to Great-Britain, and destructive of the union, and commercial intercourse, which ought always to subsist between her and her colonies.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Observations appeared necessary to vindicate the Town and Province from the aspersions so unjustly cast upon them. The few, that follow, refer to the present and future state of Great Britain and her Colonies.</p>
            <p>HOW happy is Britain with regard to situation, and many internal circumstances; and in her connection with her Colonies.</p>
            <p>Seperated from the rest of the world, and possessed of so large a naval force, she is secure from foreign invasions: her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (well administred) is the best existing; her manufactures are extensive, and her commerce in proportion.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er the Colonies have in a considerable degree contributed. By these means she has risen to her present opulence &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which so much distinguish her among the powers of Europe. But however great and opulent she may be, she is capable of being still more so; and so much more so, that she may be deemed at present in a state of minority, compared with what she will one day probably be, if her own conduct does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. The means of this greatness are held out to her by the Colonies; and it is in her power, by a kind and just treatment of them, to avail herself of those means.</p>
            <p>The Colonists are husbandmen, and till lately have manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured but a small part of their cloathing, and the other articles with which they had been usually supplied from Great-Britain. But they have been taught by experience they can supply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and <hi>that</hi> experience (which has been forced upon them) has demonstrated most clearly, that they have within themselves
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011581_0044_0F87464C9E7B48A0"/>
the means of living conveniently, if not with elegance, even if their communication with the rest of mankind were wholly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This, however, could not be an eligible state: but no one intitled to and deserving the liberties of an Englishman, can he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate a moment to say, that it would be preferable to slavery; to which the Colonists have apprehended themselves doomed, by the measures that have been pursued by administration.</p>
            <p>If the Colonists might be permitted to follow their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with which at the same time their interest co-incides, they would be husbandmen still, and be supplied as usual from Great-Britain.

Let us therefore take only one quarter part of those numbers: and then the value of exports from Britain to the Colonies, in 1866, will be more than thirteen millions sterling for sixteen millions of Colonists. It is highly probable, by <hi>that</hi> time there will be at least that number of Colonists in the British Colonies on this continent. Now, in case there be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the union and harmony that ought to subsist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and her Colonies, and which it is their mutual interest should subsist and be maintained, what good reason can be given why such exports should not bear as great a proportion to the number of the Colonists as they do at this time? If they should, the value of such exports (which will be continually increasing) will be at least thirteen millions per annum. A sum far surpassing the value of all the exports from Great-Britain at this day.</p>
                  <p>In what proportion so vast a trade with the Colonies would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the other branches of her trade; how much it would encrease the number of her people, the rents and value of her lands, her wealth of every species, her internal strength, her naval power, and particularly her revenue (to enhance which in a trifling degree has occasioned the present uneasiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and the Colonies) are matters lest to the calculation and decision of the political arithmeticians of Great-Britain.</p>
               </note> and

might be in future in proportion to the increase of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists. Their increase is rapid: they are daily emigrating from the old towns, and forming new ones; and if they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their numbers every twenty years, as 'tis said they will continue to do, so long as they can form into families by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the means of subsistence at an easy rate, which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will be the case, till America shall be well peopled, there will be in a short time a prodigious addition to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's subjects; who, if not compelled to manufacture for themselves, will occasion a proportionable demand for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of Great-Britain.

She might then view with indifference the interdiction of her trade with other parts of the world; though she would always have it in her power, from the superiority of her naval force, which such a trade and navigation would enable her to support, to do herself jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and command universal respect.</p>
            <p>Connected with her Colonies, she would then be a mighty empire: the greatest, consisting of people of one language, that ever existed.</p>
            <p>If these observations be not wholly visionary, and a mere reverie, they possibly may not be unworthy the consideration of Parliament: whose wisdom will determine, whether any revenue whatever, even the greatest that America could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly produce, either without or with her good will, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensate the loss of such wealth and power; or justify mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that had the least tendency to bring them into hazard: or whether for such a revenue it would be worth while to hazard even the present advantages, resulting to Great Britain from an union and harmony with her Colonies.</p>

I stept out of the window and speedily knock'd up his heels. On falling his coat flew open, and a naked sword appeared, which one John Willson following me out took from him, and bro't into the ropewalks. The soldier then went to Green's bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack, and in about twenty minutes return'd with 8 or 9 more soldiers armed with clubs, and began as I was told with three or four men in Mr. Gray's warehouse, asking them why they had ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I immediately got up and went to the door, and found them returning from the ropewalks to the barracks. Whence they again very speedily re-appeared, now increased to the number of thirty or forty, armed with clubs and other weapons. In this latter company was a tall negro drummer, to whom I called, you black rascal, what have you to do with white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's quarrels? He answered, I suppose I may look on, and went forward. <hi>I went out directly and commanded the peace, telling them I was in commission; but they not regarding me, knock'd down a ropemaker in my presence, and two or three of them beating him with clubs, I endeavoured to relieve him; but on approaching the fellows who were mauling him, one of them with a great club struck at me with such violence, that had I not happily avoided it might have been fatal to me.</hi> The party last mentioned rushed in towards the rope-walks, and attacked the rope-makers nigh the tar-kettle, but were soon beat off, drove out of the passage-way b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I JOHN Gray, of lawful age, testify and say, that on the Saturday preceeding the massacre on the Monday evening of the 5th instant, Middleton the chimney-sweeper being at my house, said to my maid, as she informed me, that he was well acquainted with the soldiers, and they had determined to have their revenge of the rope-walk people; being alarmed with this news, I determined to see Col. Dalrymple on Monday morning. At sabbath noon I was surpriz'd at hearing that Col. Carr, and his officers had enter'd my rope-walk, open'd the windows, doors, &amp;c. giving out that they were searching for a dead serjeant of their regiment; this put me upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately waiting upon Col. Dalrymple, to whom I related
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011581_0052_0F874657F3495D30"/>
what I understood had passed at the rope-walk days before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he reply'd it was much the same as he had heard from his people; but says he,
"your man was the aggressor in affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of my people, by asking him if he wanted to work, and then telling him to clean his little-house."
For this expression I dismissed my journeyman on the Monday morning following; and further said, I would do all in my power to prevent my peoples giving them any affront in future. He then assur'd me, he had, and should do every thing in his power to keep his soldiers in order, and prevent their any more entering my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure. Presently after, Col. Carr came in, and asked Col. Dalrymple what they should do, for they were daily losing their men; that three of his grenadiers passing quietly by the rope-walks were greatly abus'd, and one of them so much beat that he would die. He then said he had been searching for a serjeant who had been murder'd; upon which, I said, Yes Colonel, I hear you have been searching for him in my rope-walks; and asked him, whether that serjeant had been in the affray there on the Friday; he reply'd, no: for he was seen on the Saturday. I then asked him, how he could think of looking for him in my walks; and that had he apply'd to me, I would have waited on him, and opened every apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I had for his satisfaction.</p>

Are you fit to die?</hi> The deponent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being quite unarmed gave no answer. James Bayley, a seafaring young man, coming up, said to the deponent, &amp;c. Why did you not answer? One of the grenadiers, named Dixson, hearing him, came up to Bayley and asked him if he was minded to vindicate the cause? Bayley also unarmed did not answer till James Young came up, who, tho' equally na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, said to the grenadier, Damn it, I know what a soldier is.

That grenadier stood still, and the other who had threatened the deponent came up and struck at him, which Young sended off with his arms, and then turning aimed a blow at the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, which had it reached might probably have been fatal. Patrick —, Mr. Winter Calef's journeyman, seeing the affray, went into the tan-house, and bringing out two batts gave one to a bystander, who together with Patrick soon cleared the walk of them, and further saith not,</p>

               <p>RObert Pierpont of lawful age testifies and says, that going to see a sick neighbour between the hours of seven and eight on Monday evening the fifth current, two soldiers arm'd, one with a broad sword, the other with a club passed him near the hay market, going towards the town-house, seeming in great haste. In a few minutes they returned and hallowed very loud, Colonel. Before the deponent reached Mr. West's house, where he was going, they passed him again, joined by another, with a blue surtout, who had a bayonet with which he gave the deponent a back-handed stroke, apparently more to affront than hurt him. On complaint of this treatment, he said, <hi>the deponent should soon hear more of it, and threatned him very hard,</hi> and further saith not.</p>

The soldier replied, Yes. Green said, then go and clean my s—t-house. The soldier swore by the Holy Ghost that he would have recompence, and tarried a good while swearing at Green, who took no further notice of him, and then went off, and soon after returned to the ropewalk with a party of thirty or forty soldiers, headed by a tall negro drummer, and challenged the ropemakers to come out. All hands then present, being about 13 or 14, turn'd out and beat them off, considerably bruised. And further saith not.</p>

The reply was, there is no officer here. Several of the soldiers came out of the guard house, and the deponent told them if

I returned again to my house, and a few minutes after, at the head of royal exchange lane, in the street, I saw a few, <hi>not exceeding fifteen or twenty persons,</hi> stop, as I supposed talking what had happened. I went to Mr. Payne's door and stood in his entry with him, I believe, about ten or fifteen minutes, and heard some words with the people and the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, such as, Do fire if you dare, but no further than words, not so much as to touch him, as I saw, neither did I see more than <hi>five or six</hi> that had so much as sticks in their hands, <hi>all entirely unarmed, without any weapons.</hi> Mr. Harrison Gray, jun. came into the entry to us, and upon this immediately came an officer with a party of six or seven men with their guns breast-high and clear'd the way, and by their behaviour I did not know but they would fire, I said it was not prudent to tarry there, went directly into my own house and called all my family in. To the best of my judgment, there was not more than <hi>fifty or sixty people</hi> in the street when the party came

I then saw the soldiers loading again, and I ran up the street to get some assistance to carry off the dead and wounded. Doctor Jos. Gardner and David Bradley came down with me to the corps, and as we were stooping to take them up, the soldiers presented at us again; I then saw an officer passing busily behind them.—We carried off the dead without regarding the soldiers. I then saw an officer pass before the soldiers and hove up their arms, and said stop firing, don't fire any more, upon which they shouldered. —I then went close up to them, and addressing myself to the whole, told them I came to see some faces that I might be able to swear to another day—Capt. Preston, who was the officer, turned round and answered (in a melancholy tone) perhaps you may. After taking a view of each man's face I left them. They soon after ran up to the main guard house. I have nothing farther to say.</p>

The captain came before them and put his arm under three or four of their pieces, and puting them into an upright posture, then retired from my sight; and presently they again levelled and the firing began, and proceeded till ten or eleven pieces were discharged. On the people's scattering a little, I saw two men near me lay dead on the street, and observed the soldiers to load again, and moved off. And further I say not.</p>

In this hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and confusion the deponent heard many ask each other whether they thought they would fire? and it was generally concluded they would not. But in about five minutes after the deponent first stood there, he <hi>heard the officer give the word</hi> FIRE, they not then firing, <hi>he again said</hi> FIRE, which they still disobeying, <hi>he said with a much higher voice,</hi> DAMN YOU FIRE BE THE CONSEQUENCE WHAT IT WILL! <hi>Soon after this one of the guns went off—in a few seconds another, and so on, till six or seven were discharged.</hi> Near the deponents left hand dropt a man, which he since learns was Mr. James Caldwell, on which he left the place, and further saith not.</p>

               <p>I Richard Palmes of Boston, of lawful age, testify and say, that between the hours of nine and ten o'clock of the 5th instant, I heard one of the bells ring, which I supposed was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by fire, &amp; enquiring where the fire was, was answered that <hi>the soldiers were abusing the inhabitants</hi>; I asked where, was first answered at Murray's barracks, I went there and spoke to some officers that were standing at the door, I told them I was surprized they suffered the soldiers to go out of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack after eight o'clock; I was answered by one of the officers pray do you mean to teach us our duty; I answered I did not, only to remind them of it; one of them said you see that the soldiers are all in their barracks, and why do not you go to

your homes; Mr. James Lamb and I said, Gentlemen let us go home, &amp; were answered by some, home, home; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I asked Mr. William Hickling if he was going home, he said he was, I walked with him as far as the post-office, upon my stopping to talk with two or three people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Hickling left me; I then saw Mr. Pool Spear going towards the town-house, he asked me if I was going home, I told him I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I asked him where he was going that way, he said he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his brother David's. But when I got to the town-pump, we were told there was a rumpus at the custom-house door; Mr. Spear said to me you had better not go, I told him I would go and try to make peace; I immediately went there and saw <hi>Capt. Preston</hi> at the head of six or eight soldiers in a circular form, with guns breast high and bayonets fixed; the said Captain stood almost to the end of their guns. I went immediately to Capt. Preston (as soon as Mr. Bliss had left him) and asked him if their guns were loaded, his answer was they are loaded with powder and ball; I then said to him I hope you do not intend they shall fire upon the inhabitants; his reply was, by no means. When I was asking him these questions my left hand was on his right shoulder; Mr. John Hickling had that instant taken his hand off my shoulder, and stept to my left, then instantly I saw a piece of snow or ice fall among the soldiers, on which the soldier at the officer's right hand stept back and <hi>discharged his gun,</hi> at the space of some seconds the soldier at his left <hi>fired</hi> next, and the other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I then made a stroke at the officer, my right foot slipt, that brought me on my knee, the blow falling short, he says I hit his arm; when I was recovering myself from the fall I saw the soldier that fired the first gun endeavoring <hi>to push me through with his bayonet,</hi> on which I threw my stick at his head, the soldier starting back<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave me opportunity to jump from him into exchange-lane, or I must been inevitably run thro' my body.

Morton's apprentice up to the prison house, and saw he had a ball shot through his breast; at my return I found that the officer and soldiers were gone to the main guard. <hi>To my best observation there were not seventy people in Kingstreet at the time of their firing, and them very scattering,</hi> but in a few minutes after the firing there were upwards of a thousand; finding the soldiers were gone I went up to the main-guard and saw there the soldiers were formed into three divisions, the front division in the posture of platoon firing, and I expected they would fire. Hearing that his Honor the Lieutenant Governor was going to the Council-chamber, I went there, his Honor looking out of the door desired the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hear him speak; he desired them to go home and he would enquire into the affair in the morning, and that the law should take its course, and said, I will live and die by the law. A gentleman desired his Honor to order the soldiers to their barracks, he answered it was not in his power, and that he had no command over the troops and that it lay with Col. Dalrymple and not with him, but that he would send for him, which after some time he did; upon that a gentleman desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Honor to look out of the window facing the main-guard, to see the position the soldiers were in, <hi>ready to fire on the inhabitants, which he did after a good deal of perswasion,</hi> and called for Col.

south side of it, where I saw an officer of the army lead out of the guard-house there seven or eight soldiers of the army, and lead them down, in seeming haste, to the custom-house on the north side of kingstreet, where I followed them, and when the officer had got there with the men, he bid them face about. I stood just below them on the left wing, and <hi>the said officer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his men to load,</hi> which they did accordingly, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most dispatch, then they remained about six minutes, with their firelocks rested and bayonets fixed, but not standing in exact order. I observed <hi>a considerable number of young lads, and here and there a man amongst them, about the middle of the street,</hi> facing the soldiers, but not within ten or twelve feet distance from them; I observed some of them, viz. the lads, &amp;c. had sticks in their hands, laughing, shouting, huzzaing, and crying fire; but could not observe that any of them threw any thing at the soldiers, or threatened any of them. Then the <hi>said officer</hi> retired from before the soldiers and steping behind them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the right wing, <hi>bid the soldiers fire</hi>; they not firing, he presently again bid 'em fire; they not yet firing, <hi>he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I then went up behind them to the right wing, where one of the people was lying, to see whether he was dead, where there were four or five people about him, one of them saying he was dead; whereupon one of the soldiers said damn his blood he is dead, if he ever sprawl again I will be damned for him.— And I remember as <hi>the said officer</hi> was going down with the soldiers towards the Custom-House, a gentleman spoke to him and said <hi>Capt.

Mr. <hi>Munroe</hi> said they would go to the <hi>Custom-House</hi> and drink a glass of wine. Then I went out, there being <hi>nobody in the house that I knew of but Mr. Hudson and wife</hi>; then I went up to the <hi>Custom-house door</hi> and knocked, when a young man, which I have since heard was named Hammond Green, <hi>let me in</hi> and locked the door, when I saw <hi>my Master and Mr. Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe</hi> come down stairs, and go into a room, when four or five men went up stairs pulling and haleing me after them, and said, <hi>my good boy come</hi>; when <hi>I was carried into the chamber,</hi> there was but <hi>one light in the room,</hi> and that <hi>in the corner of the chamber,</hi> when I saw a tall man <hi>loading a gun</hi> (then <hi>I saw two guns in the room</hi>) my master not being in the chamber, there was <hi>a number of gentlemen in the room</hi>: After the gun was loaded, the tall man gave it to me and told me to <hi>fire,</hi> and said he <hi>would kill me if I did not;</hi> I told him <hi>I would not.</hi> He <hi>drawing a sword out of his cane,</hi> told me, if I did not <hi>fire</hi> it, he <hi>would run it thro' my guts.</hi> The man putting the gun out of the window, it being a little open, <hi>I fired it side way</hi> up the street; the tall man then <hi>loaded the gun again. I heard the balls go down.</hi> The man then laid it on the window again, and told me to <hi>fire</hi> it. I told him <hi>I would not fire</hi> again; he told be again, he <hi>would run me thro' the guts if I did not.</hi> Upon which I <hi>fired the</hi> same way up the street. After I <hi>fired the second gun, I saw my master in the room; he took a gun and pointed it out of the window; I heard the gun go off</hi>: Then a tall man came and clapp'd me on the shoulders above and below stairs, and said that's my good boy, I'll give you some money to-morrow. I said, I don't want any money. There being a light in the lower room, and the door being upon the jarr, I saw it was the tall man that clapp'd me on the shoulder; then the young man <hi>Hammond Green</hi> let me out of the door, there being <hi>two or three people in the entry,</hi> when I got out of the house, I saw a number of people in the streets. And I ran home as fast as I could, and set up all night in my master's kitchen. And further say, that <hi>my master licked me the next night for telling Mrs. Waldron about his firing out of theCustom house. And for fear that I should be licked again,</hi> I did deny all that I said before Justice <hi>Quincy,</hi> which I am very sorry for. And further I say not.</p>

the clock, he heard a bell ringing at the south part of the town, which caused him to leave his shop to make enquiry.— Soon after, he heard that the soldiers had rose upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants; that when he had got as far as Faneuil-Hall, seeing a number of gentlemen standing together, the deponent made up to them, and asked them what the disturbance was; they answered him that two young men had been abused by the soldiers—but that the soldiers had now returned to their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks—he then proceeded with a number of others up royal exchange lane: at the head of the lane some of the persons with him cry'd out here is a soldier and huzza'd; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the soldier who was centry near to the box before the custom house, repaired to the <hi>custom house door</hi>; at which, with the knocker the soldier gave three very hard strokes; upon which <hi>some person within side opened the door and spoke to him remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably short, and then shut it again.</hi>—The soldier then directly loaded his gun, knocking the breech twice hard upon the stone steps: at the same time seven soldiers (as the deponent judges) with a commanding officer came and cry'd clear the way as he came along: then forming them into a half circle, ordered them to load: the deponent then made up as he could to the officer, and said for God's sake don't fire upon the people, he made him no answer: then turning to the inhabitants he the deponent expressed himself in the following manner; for God's sake don't trouble these men for they are upon duty and will fire: turning about to the soldiers he saw them making up to the inhabitants with their bayonets fixed (about ten feet off) directing them to stand off, attempting to drive them away with their bayonets: then he withdrew himself to the other side of the way, where seeing a man attempt to throw a club, he beg'd that he would not; adding that if he did the soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would fire, and he did not: the deponent then standing by Warden and Vernon's shop on the south side of King-street with his back to the soldiers; immediately after heard the word <hi>present</hi>; at which word he stooped down.—A little space of time ensued, and then he heard the words, <hi>damn you, fire;</hi> the sound of which words seemed to proceed from the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I John Wilson of lawful age testify, that on monday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 5th current, I was at Mr. Burdett's at the head of long-lane, and heard the bells ring and fire cried, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon went in company with others to king-street, and saw no disturbance there, hearing the bells still ringing, I asked what was the matter? The people said the soldiers had insulted the inhabitants, on which I went to Cornhill, where the bustle had been, and found no soldiers there. Then I came down King-street opposite the custom-house, and saw a man with a light colour'd surtout coming from the main guard go up to the centry, and lay his hand on his shoulder and speak some words to the centry, and then <hi>enter the custom-house door.</hi> On this the centry grounded the breech of his gun, took out a cartridge, primed and loaded, and shoulder'd his firelock. After this I drew back opposite Mr. Stone's, &amp; in a few minutes saw a party of soldiers headed by <hi>an officer</hi> coming down from the main guard, crying to the inhabitants, <hi>Damn you, make way you boogers!</hi> I not moving from my place was struck by one of them on the hip with the butt of his musquet, which bruised me so much that it was next day very sore, and much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured. <hi>The officer</hi> seeing the soldier strike me <hi>said to the soldier in an angry manner why don't you prick the boogers?</hi> The party drew up before the custom-house door, and ranged to the west corner in a half circle, and charged their pieces breast high. Some small boys coming up made a noise to the soldiers, on which <hi>the officer said to them why don't you fire? Damn you fire!</hi> They hereupon fired and two men fell dead

in my sight. I then left the place, and went over the street and assisted Patterson the wounded man in getting home. The deponent further saith, that when he got into kingstreet he saw nobody but the centry walking backwards and forwards by the custom-house, and then went to Cornhill as above; and at the time of firing he verily believes there were <hi>not above fifty persons in the street near the custom-house, the snow being at that time near a foot deep,</hi> and further I say not.</p>

Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after, I heard some people cry out for assistance. I then went down into Kingstreet, and in going down, overtook an officer (as I tho't) with 8 or 9 soldiers with bayonets
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011581_0104_0F8746949EF83130"/>
charged breast-high, the <hi>officer holding a naked cutlass in his hand, swinging and calling, stand out of the way, and the soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers cursing and damning, and pushing their bayonets</hi> to clear the way. They went down to the <hi>Custom-house,</hi> and placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves just above the <hi>centinel box,</hi> the officer then ordered the soldiers to place themselves, which they did in a half circle; with that the boys came up near to the soldiers (standing as before). The officer then said, Boys go off, lest their be some murder done; with that the boys removed back a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance throwing snow-balls, the soldiers <hi>pushing them with their bayonets, saying, damn you, stand off</hi>; with that the boys went forward again, and a man with a naked cutlass in his hand, who appear'd to be the commanding officer (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) gave the word <hi>Fire,</hi> immediately a gun going off upon the left of me, I saw a man like a sailor go up to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and strike him upon the left arm: Immediately he the said <hi>officer said,</hi> think I'll be used in this manner, <hi>Damn you, Fire, which they did,</hi> one after another. After they had all fired, <hi>he ordered them to prime and load again</hi>; after that he ordered his men in the middle of the street, <hi>and told them to clear their way with their bayonets breast high</hi>; with that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, I saw four men lay dead on the snow, <hi>the snow being at that time near a foot deep.</hi> Then I went and help'd the molatto man who was shot, into Mr. Stone's house. After we got him in there, I saw him give one gasp. I then open'd his breast, and saw two holes, one in each breast, where the Balls had enter'd. After that went to the door, and look'd, and saw the soldiers standing in the middle of the street, and saw two gentlemen talking with the officers and soldiers. Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after went to see the molatto again; and return'd back into the street, <hi>saw all the soldiers at the main guard house out, with their bayonets charged breast high</hi>; with that going home thro' quaker-lane into long-lane, about the middle of the lane, saw two soldiers, <hi>who told me to stand out of the way or else they would stabb me.</hi> I immediately got out of the way, and made the best of my way home.

Not more than ten seconds after this, I saw something white resembling a piece of snow or ice fall among the soldiers, which knock'd the end of a firelock to the ground. <hi>At that instant the word fire was given,</hi> but by whom I know not; but concluded it did not come from the officer aforesaid, as I was within a yard of him and must have heard him had he spoke it, <hi>but am satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied said Preston did not forbid them to fire,</hi> I instantly leap'd within the soldier's bayonet as I heard him cock his gun, which that moment went off between Mr. Palmes and myself.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011581_0106_0F874699B82D64B8"/>
I thinking there was nothing but powder fired stood still, till upon the other side of Mr. Palmes and close to him, <hi>I saw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gun fired,</hi> and the man since called Attucks fall. I then withdrew about two or three yards, &amp; turning saw Mr. Palmes upon his knee, and the soldiers pushing at him with their bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onets. During this the rest of the guns were fired, one after another when I saw two more fall, I ran to one and seeing the blood gush out of his head tho' just expiring, I felt for the wound and found a hole as big as my hand. This I have since learned was Mr. Gray. I then went to Attucks and found him gasping, pulled his head out of the gutter and left him; I returning to the soldiers and asked them what they thought of themselves and whether they did not deserve to be cut to pieces, to lay men wallowingin their blood in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>they answered God damn them, they should have stood out of our way.</hi> The soldiers were then loading their muskets and told me upon my peril not to come any nearer to them. <hi>I further declare that I heard no other affront given them than the huzzaing and whistling of boys in the street.</hi>

He immediately opened the window, and told me they were soldiers. Upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I immediately put on my hat and went out.

He told me there were six men killed in kingstreet by the military: I immediately hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in my way to kingstreet, and met another person by Concert-hall, of whom I likewise enquired as aforesaid; his answer to me corresponded with the other. When I got into kingstreet, I found a great number of people there assembled, and intended going into the custom-house, to find out the particulars of the affair. Upon my knocking at the custom-house door with the knocker, Mr. Hammond Green (who was then looking out of the window) ask'd me Who was there? I called him by name, and told him I wanted to come into the custom-house. <hi>He told me he would not let me, nor even his father</hi> (and I think he said) <hi>nor one of the commissioners, into the house, for he had orders for so doing,</hi> or to that effect. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately quitted the door and stay'd some time at the bottom, and then at the head of the town-house, where I met Capt. John Riordan. While we were conversing, a party of the 29th regiment came down Queenstreet and joined the regiment then at the town-house. Soon after that, I asked Capt. Rior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan if he would spend an hour at the coffee-house, he compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and we immediately went after spending some time there, I went home, and in going home, I found the inhabitants were gone off and the soldiers gone from the town-house. It was some time before I came into kingstreet, that the guns were

fired, and when I knock'd at the custom-house door, all the persons I saw at the window over the centry box at the custom house (which window was then open'd) was Mr. Hammond Green and some women.</p>

               <p>I Edward Crafts, of lawful age, testify and say, that on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening the fifth instant, between 11 and 12 o'clock, Mr. Joseph Ayers met me at my gate, and I asked him where he was going. He answered to call Mr. Thomas Theodore Bliss to attend at the council-chamber, to give evidence of the captain's giving the soldiers orders to fire on the inhabitants. On leaving Mr. Bliss's door, there passed by us two corporals with about twenty soldiers with musquets and fixed bayonets, and on their observing our moving towards the town-house, the soldiers halted, and surrounded us, saying we <hi>were a pack of damn'd rascals, and for three coppers they would blow our brains out. One of the corporals (viz. Eustice) gave orders for one half the soldiers to cock, and the rest to make ready.</hi> On which we told them we had nothing to say to them, but were on other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. <hi>The corporal, Eustice, struck Mr. Haldan, then in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and turning to me aimed a blow at my head with his firelock, which I took upon my arm, and then with all his might he made a pass at me with his fixed bayonet, with full intent to take my life, as I thought. This I also parried with my naked hand. Then a sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier step'd out from among the rest and presented his musquet to my breast, and six or seven more at about</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>feet distance also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</hi> Upon this I called corporal McCan, who came to me with a drawn sword or cutlass in his hand and pushed the gun from my breast, saying, this is Mr. Crafts, and if any of you offers to touch him again I will blow your brains out. Corporal Eustice answered and said, he is as damn'd a rascal as any of
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011581_0113_0F8746A2B22908B0"/>
them. The next evening about dusk coming by Rowe's bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack I saw corporal McCan who saved my life. He asked me if my arm was broke? I answered no. He said <hi>the gun with which Eustice struck me was broke to pieces. And continued, you would have been in heaven or hell in an instant if you had not called me by name: One man in particular would have shot you, seven more presented at you!</hi> He also said, <hi>his orders were, when the party came from the guard-house by the fortification, if any person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons assaulted them, to fire upon them, every man being loaded with a brace of balls. And further I say not.</hi>

This wound I apprehended was the immediate cause of his death. The other ball entered the fourth of the false Ribs, about five inches from the Linea Alba, and descending obliquely passed through the second false Rib, at the distance of about eight inches from the Linea Alba; from the oblique direction of the wounds, I apprehend the gun must have been discharged from some ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and further the deponent saith not.</p>

               <p>And that the hole made by another musquet ball through the window shutter of the lower story of the same house, and lodged in the back wall of the shop, ranges about breast-high from the ground and between the second and third window from the west corner of the Custom-house.</p>
               <p>And that the holes made in the shop of Warden and Vernon thro' the outer shutter and back partition of the shop, ranged breast-high from the ground and with the westernmost side of the first window west of the great door of the Custom-house.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is in consequence of the appointment of the Town of Boston, that we have the honor of writing to your Grace, and of communicating the enclosed Narrative, relating to the Massacre in this Town on the 5th Instant.</p>
            <p>After that execrable deed, perpetrated by soldiers of the 29th regiment, the town thought it highly expedient that a full and just representation of it should be made to persons of character, in order to frustrate the designs of certain men, who, as they have heretofore been plotting the ruin of our constitution and liberties, by their letters, memorials and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, are now said to have procured depositions in a private manner, relative to the said Massacre, to bring an odium upon the town, as the aggressors in that affair: But we humbly apprehend, your Grace, after examining the said Narrative, and the depositions annexed to it, will be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the falshood of such a suggestion; and we take upon ourselves to declare upon our honor and consciences, that having examined critically into the matter, there does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the least ground for it.</p>
            <p>The depositions referred to (if any such there be) were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without notifying the Select Men of the Town or any other persons whatever, to be present at the caption, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Town: of which conduct, as it has been justly complained of heretofore in other cases, so the Town now renew their complaint in the present case; and humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011581_0132_0F8746B9477BE0D8"/>
such depositions will have no weight, till the Town has been served with copies of them, and an opportunity gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Town to be heard in their defence, in this matter; and in any other, wherein their character is drawn into ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a view of passing a censure upon it.</p>
            <p>A different conduct was observed on the part of the Town: The Justices with a committee to assist them, made their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations publicly; most of them at Faneuil-Hall, and the rest, where any persons might attend. Notifications were sent to the Custom-house, where the Commissioners of the Customs sit, that they or any persons in their behalf, might be present at the captions: Accordingly Mr. Sheaffe the deputy-collector, and Mr. Green, Tenant of the Custom-house under the Commissioners, and employed by them, were present at many of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Declaration of the Justices, in Page 78.</note>
            </p>
            <p>One of the said Commissioners, Mr. Robinson, in a secret manner has embarked on board Capt. Robson, and sailed for London the 16th instant; which, with three of the other Commissioners retiring from the Town, and not having held a board for some time since the 5th instant,<note n="†" place="bottom">No Board has been held from the 9th of March, to the Time of printing this Letter, viz. May 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h, and it is uncertain when there will be one.</note> gives reason to apprehend, they have planned, and are executing a scheme of misrepresentation, to induce administration to think, that their persons are not in safety in this Town, in the absence of the Troops. But my Lord, their safety is in no wise depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on Troops: for your Grace must be sensible, that if any evil had ever been intended them, Troops could not have prevented it.</p>
            <p>It was so apparently incompatible with the safety of the Town, for the Troops to continue any longer in it, that his Majesty's Council were unanimous in their advice to the Lieutenant-Governor, that they should be removed to the barracks at Castle-Island. And it is the humble and fervent Prayer of the Town, and the Province in general, that his Majesty will graciously be pleased, in his great wisdom and goodness, to order the said Troops, out of the Province; and that his dutiful and loyal subjects of this Town and Province—dutiful and loyal, notwithstanding any representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011581_0133_0F8746B9E8E21850"/>
to the contrary—may not again be distressed and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Troops; for preventing which, we beg leave in behalf of the Town, to request most earnestly the favour of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition and Influence.</p>
            <p>The candor and justice of your Grace so conspicuous in the last Session of Parliament, when your Grace was pleased to move in the House of Lords, that the Resolves then under Consideration, and afterwards passed by that right honorable House for censuring this Town and Province, should be suspended, till we could have an Opportunity of being heard on the subject of them, — the candor and justice so conspicuous in that Motion will always endear to us the Personage that made it: And they give us the strongest Reason to hope for your Patronage, in every thing not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with those virtues. We have the Honor to be with the most perfect Regard,</p>
