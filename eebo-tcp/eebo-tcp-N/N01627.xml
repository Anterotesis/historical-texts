            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN ſhe was in health, ſhe was not more backward, than ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and deſirous to ſpeak now ſhe was ſick; delivering her ſelf with a great deal of freedom, and omitting nothing of what ſhe knew to be edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

            </p>
            <p>AFTER this, ſhe had about an hour's ſleep, out of which being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, ſhe ſaid, <hi>What is our Life</hi>? Truly, <hi>it is even a vapour that appears for a little time, and then vaniſhes away,</hi> Jam. 4.14. Therefore, <hi>O Lord, teach
us ſo to number our days, as that we may apply our hearts to Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 90.12. <hi>What is Man, that thou art mindful of him; and the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him,</hi> Pſal. 8.4. <hi>When his breath goes forth, he returns to his Earth,</hi> Pſal. 146.4.

               <hi>LORD, how ſweet are thy words to my taſte, yea ſweeter than honey to my mouth!</hi> Pſal. 119.103.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Chaplain was come in, ſhe ſaid to him, <q>Come, Sir, <hi>Let us go boldly unto the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he anſwering, <q>Why don't you ſay, [Let us go and implore for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy] rather than ſay, (as with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence you do) <hi>Let us go, that we may obtain mercy</hi>;</q> She replv'd, <q>Sir, it is becauſe I find a Redeemer there, who has <hi>bought me with a price</hi>

               <q>Aye, Madam (anſwered the Chaplain) this Promiſe he has made to your Contrition, Repentance, and Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>DURING this whole day (which was Wedneſday) ſhe ſpake many other admirable things, that could not, all of them, be remember'd. One would have thought by ſeeing her, that her Soul was ſet looſe from the Body. She had quite forgot the Earth, and all Ties and Relations here; her only thoughts being now to unite her ſelf with her God by Meditation, till ſhe might be more perfectly united to him, in Heaven.</p>
            <p>ABOUT Evening ſhc felt a great drought in her Throat, and was very thirſty; yet they durſt not give her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, by reaſon her Stomach could not bear ſo much as one drop of fair Water, without bringing of it up, and that with a vehement Cough, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with a ſtoppage and ſhortneſs of breath; they therefore only call'd for an Epitheme, to allay her great pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of heart. But ſhe little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001933_0042_0FBA1FF584799970"/>
the Relief they were willing to her Body, cry'd out on a ſudden, <q>LORD JESUS! thou my Heavenly Phyſician, apply the Merits of thy precious Blood to me; for that alone can infallibly heal my Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IMMEDIATELY after this, ſhe fell into moſt cruel Agonies, which made her take very little reſt all that night: but yet ſhe continu'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her ſelf in God; ſeeking no where elſe, but in his Word, for a Remedy to all her griefs. And in these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhe often cry'd, <hi>Speak, O Lord, for thy ſervant hears,</hi> 1 SAM. 3. 10. <q>Speak thou, O my God, to the Soul of thy poor Hand-maid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH having ſaid, ſhe asked a Gentleman that was opening the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows on her Chamber, what time of the day it was; he anſwer'd, It was almoſt day-light; adding, <q>Madam, why do you ask me this Queſtion? Have you a mind to do as <hi>David</hi> did, and riſe by break of day to praiſe God? No, Sir, (reply'd ſhe) I can't
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001933_0043_0FBA1FF8B9788640"/>
do that; but i will continually bleſs and magnifie him upon this my <hi>Bed of Languiſhing.</hi>

               <hi>O</hi> GOD of all Fleſh and Father of our Spirits, I know that any Death of thy Beloved Ones, is precious in thy ſight, and that whatſoever mine may be, thou wilt take care of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I weighing every thing in the Balance of the Sanctuary, do find it very little imports me, whether my Life be taken away by a Diſeaſe, or forc'd from me by Violence, provided my Soul enter into thy Glory &amp; be made Partaker of thoſe unutterable Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are with thee.

O Lord, thou knoweſt all thy works from Everlaſting. Thou, with one glance, diſcovereſt the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Abyſs, and ſeeſt to the very bottom of Eternity. As thou haſt preciſely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Hour of Death, ſo haſt thou been pleas'd alſo to determine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. O Great &amp; Living God! it is my duty wholly to acquieſce in thy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable Providence, &amp; abſolutely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelf to thy wiſe Decrees.

Boſom, I do, with all the powers of my I Soul, humbly beſeech thee to grant me this favour, that / may know my End, and not be (like Job's Children) ſurpriz'd by a ſudden Death: But, O Lord, be thou pleas'd to give me notice of my diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as thou didſt to thy Servant <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah.</hi> I do not ſue for years, but ſome few days; or at leaſt, a few hours warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
