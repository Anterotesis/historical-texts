            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS <hi>Pſalm</hi> is a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> or rather a <hi>Penitential Confeſſion</hi> of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and Provocations of the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael,</hi> from the day of their Departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> thro' all their Travels and long Sojourning in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi> In the <hi>Text</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the Name of the People of his <hi>own Generation,</hi> confeſſes their Intereſt and ſhare in theſe Sins of <hi>their Fathers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have</hi> Sinned <hi>with our Fathers:</hi> The <hi>Critics</hi> render it by <hi>Sicut</hi> and <hi>aeque;</hi> as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Similitude</hi> of one unto the other, or
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001801_0003_0FB82C62E3C47E80"/>the <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the one from the other: We have done <hi>as</hi> our Fathers did before us, with <hi>equal</hi> Perverſneſs and Rebellion. We have, <hi>added</hi> to the Stock of <hi>Hereditary Guilt,</hi> and fill'd up the Meaſure of their Iniquity. Not only have ſinned in their <hi>loins,</hi> being the Children and Poſterity of wicked Anceſtors; but we have been our ſelves a diſobedient, Impenitent, and ſometimes <hi>Idolatrous</hi> People, after the <hi>Similitude</hi> of their Tranſgreſſions. We have ſinned <hi>like</hi> them, by whoſe <hi>Example,</hi> Sins and Sufferings we ſhould have <hi>taken War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſeems to be the Meaning of the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> and ſo they <hi>Aggravate</hi> on their own Iniquities in deep Humiliation, by <hi>calling to Remembrance</hi> the Sins of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</p>
            <p>NOR barely is it the Sins of their <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Progenitors</hi> which they here confeſs, but they look back unto the <hi>firſt Times</hi> of their being a free and Diſtinct People, as you may ſee at large thro' the <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, I would obſerve the <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> of the Confeſſion; which is <hi>doubled</hi> and <hi>trebled,</hi> to expreſs the <hi>mighty Senſe</hi> they had of the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their own Guilt: <hi>We have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with our Fathers, we have committed Iniquity, we have done wickedly.</hi> The <hi>ſame thing</hi> is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001801_0004_0FB82C6464F906E0"/>
               <hi>over and over</hi> in other words: Yet here is no <hi>Tautologie</hi> or <hi>vain Repetition:</hi> But out of the <hi>Abundance</hi> of the heart the Mouth <hi>pours out</hi> its Confeſſions: the more to expreſs the <hi>Reality</hi> and Certainty of the thing, and the Shame and Sorrow <hi>felt</hi> on that account: the more to <hi>affect</hi> themſelves with the thing, and to <hi>aggravate</hi> it upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Doctrine</hi> I would offer is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT it becomes the Profeſſing People of GOD in their Humiliations and Confeſſions of their own Sins, and the Sins of their own Time and Generation, to remember mention and bewail alſo the Sins of their FATHERS and AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CESTORS, even in Times long ſince paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT we ſhould mourn for our <hi>own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Guilts</hi> in the firſt place, you will eaſily Acknowledge: <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould ever lye <hi>neareſt</hi> to and <hi>heavieſt</hi> upon our Hearts. Jer. 8.6. <hi>I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and heard, but they ſpake not aright, no man repented him of HIS Wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we muſt mourn for the Sins of <hi>Others</hi> together with our own. Sin ought to grieve us wherever we ſee it: Pſal. 119.158. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Tranſgreſſors and was grieved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001801_0005_0FB82C66576BD598"/>
IN particular, We ſhould be <hi>Affected</hi> with and <hi>afflicted</hi> for the Sins of the <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> wherein our Lot is caſt: Ezek. 9.4. <hi>Go thro' the midſt of the City, and ſet a Mark on the foreheads of the men that ſigh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it may be the <hi>Inſtance in the Text</hi> has been <hi>leſs tho't of,</hi> than <hi>Theſe</hi> which I have nam'd: <hi>ſcil.</hi> That we ſhould bring into our Humiliations and Confeſſions, as the Sins of our People that <hi>now live,</hi> ſo the Sins of the Generations <hi>before us;</hi> even their Sins who are <hi>long ſince dead,</hi> and were ſo <hi>before we were born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will lay before you, 1. The <hi>Demand</hi> of GOD from us to this purpoſe, and then 2. Conſider a little the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>IT is the Will of GOD that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and mourn for the Sins of thoſe that are gone before us, and who may have been long ſince dead, in our penitential and ſolemn Confeſſions.</hi> GOD preſcribes <hi>This</hi> unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the <hi>After-Confeſſions of Future Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations,</hi> and in particular in the <hi>Captivities</hi> which their Sins would bring upon them: Levit. 26.39, 40. <hi>You ſhall pine away in your Iniquities in the Land of your Enemies, and in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001801_0006_0FB82C68E2371FF0"/>Iniquity of your Fathers ſhall ye pine away: If then they ſhall confeſs their Iniquity and the Iniquities of their Fathers,—then will I remember my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Now in Obedience to this <hi>Direction</hi> and Command of GOD, the Faithful and <hi>Penitent</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> did <hi>thus</hi> on every Solemn Occaſion: whereof the <hi>Pſalm</hi> before us is a copious <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</hi> More eſpecially, toward and after the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity</hi> (to which ſome refer the <hi>Pſalm</hi>) this was the <hi>Burthen</hi> in the Church's Confeſſions. So <hi>Jeremiah, Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> made their Confeſſion in their Day. Jer. 3.25. <hi>We lie down in our Shame, and our Confuſion covers us, for we have ſinned againſt the LORD our GOD, we and our FATHERS from our Youth.</hi> Lam. 5.7. <hi>Our Fathers have ſinned and are not, and we have born their Iniquities.</hi> Ezra 9.7. <hi>Since the days of our Fathers have we been in great Treſpaſs unto this day.</hi> Nehem. 1.6, 7. <hi>Both I and my Fathers houſe have ſinned: We have dealt very corruptly before thee.</hi> More eſpecially in the <hi>Ninth Chapter</hi> we have a large Account of a <hi>Day of Prayer</hi> ſolemnized by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the <hi>Remnant of Judah,</hi> the very Deſign of which <hi>Solemn Day</hi> is thus declared, <hi>v. 2. The ſeed of Iſrael—ſtood and confeſſed their Sins, and the Iniquities of their FATHERS.</hi> They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed then <hi>ſmarting</hi> for borh together, and could not well <hi>ſeparate</hi> them <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>But they</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001801_0007_0FB82C6D06ED0688"/>even <hi>our Fathers dealt proudly, and hardned their Necks, and hearkened not to thy Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Neither have our Kings, our Princes, our Prieſts, nor our Fathers kept thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Practice</hi> is Eſtabliſh'd in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> by Precept and by Example. We find the holy Men of GOD, under the <hi>Inſpiration</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, and the ſpecial <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of his Grace, bringing the Sins of their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> and of the <hi>Generations</hi> before them, into their <hi>Confeſſions</hi> before GOD; as well in their <hi>private</hi> as in their more <hi>public</hi> Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And now,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I will Enquire into the Reaſons of this Duty.</hi> It may ſeem liable to <hi>two Objections,</hi> which I wou'd <hi>premiſe</hi> two Words to <hi>Obviate.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT implies no want of Reverence to our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors:</hi> Nor is it to be charged with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>graceleſs Ham,</hi> who was condemned for <hi>not covering his Fathers Nakedneſs.</hi> We <hi>cannot uncover</hi> the Shame of our Fathers before GOD, to whoſe Eye all things are <hi>naked and open.</hi> Or if we remember <hi>them</hi> with <hi>Abaſement</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, as well as proſtrate our ſelves in the Duſt, it is before <hi>our FATHER in Heaven,</hi> that His Name and Holineſs may be <hi>glorified:</hi>

HAVING <hi>premis'd theſe two things</hi> for the guarding and ſtating the <hi>Truth</hi> before us, I ſhall now offer two or three more <hi>direct Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> Why we ſhould confeſs the Iniquity of our FATHERS together with our <hi>Own</hi> in our Solemn Humiliations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>TO repair the more if it were poſſible the Diſhonour done unto the Name of GOD and His holy Law.</hi> For all the <hi>Reparation</hi> which we can make being only in the <hi>Explicit Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of our Souls on that Account, we do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>greater Glory</hi> to the Name of GOD while in our Confeſſions we do look back to the Sins of our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> as well as Recollect our <hi>Own.</hi> I am ſure among <hi>Men</hi> it wou'd be Accounted a very <hi>worthy Action,</hi> if our Parents had done any Injury to a Nei'bour, if We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death ſhould do what we can, and what appears juſt to us to do them right: And doubtleſs the <hi>Great GOD</hi> will accept ſuch an Act of Piety and Duty from us toward Himſelf.</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be <hi>our Grief</hi> that our Fathers ſinned againſt GOD, and ſhould we not <hi>ſay ſo</hi> before Him? What better <hi>Reverence</hi> can we ſhow unto our Father in Heaven? while we <hi>go backward like the bluſhing Sons of Noah, drawing a Covering over our earthly Parents Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</hi> Which tho' we wont <hi>look upon,</hi> yet
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001801_0010_0FB82C7686072AC8"/>we know with Concern that it <hi>lies Expoſed.</hi> To <hi>whom</hi> do we publiſh it? to GOD! and <hi>why?</hi> but that HE may be Glorified! Where then is the Treſpaſs on <hi>Filial Piety</hi> by this Act of Devotion and Worſhip? or did it bear har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the <hi>Names of the Deceas'd,</hi> yet what were <hi>theſe</hi> to the Honour of the ETERNAL GOD?</p>
            <p>IN confeſſing the Sins of our Fathers we <hi>Adore the GOD of our Fathers;</hi> and in Effect we do but <hi>give Him the Glory of that Relation:</hi> Our Fathers GOD and <hi>we will Exalt thee:</hi> ſon we do as truly <hi>Exalt</hi> GOD in our Penitent Confeſſions, as in our Thankful Praiſes. Ezra 10.10, 11. <hi>Ye have tranſgreſſed—Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make Confeſſion unto the LORD GOD of your Fathers.</hi> Can we remember Him as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers GOD in our Confeſſions, and never bring our Fathers Sins into our Confeſſions? Where then is his <hi>Honour,</hi> and where is his <hi>Fear, as</hi> the Lord GOD of our Fathers?</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT becomes us to Confeſs the Sins of our Fathers with our Own, <hi>to ſhow our Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in the hatred of Sin:</hi> that we grieve and mourn for it <hi>becauſe it is Sin,</hi> Contrary to GOD and abhorred by Him, <hi>without any Reſpect of Perſons.</hi> For <hi>Sin</hi> is the ſame in it ſelf, and the ſame in the Sight of GOD, whoever be the <hi>Sinner;</hi> and therefore it is equally to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001801_0011_0FB82C77E1C0C710"/>by us, as againſt GOD. Pſal. 139. <hi>ult. Am I not grieved with them that riſe up againſt thee?</hi> This is a ſincere and upright <hi>Deteſtation</hi> of Sin, as ſuch.</p>
            <p>SOME can freely eno' <hi>fault</hi> Sin in thoſe that are <hi>not related</hi> to them; but O how they <hi>cover</hi> and palliate it when it falls out in their <hi>own Houſe?</hi> This brings the moſt declared Zeal againſt Sin under a juſt <hi>Suſpicion</hi> in any One; while it turns to another for a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of their Impartial Regard to the Honour of GOD, when they are not brib'd by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto any to juſtify them in Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is but juſt for <hi>a wicked Poſterity</hi> to joyn the Sins of their <hi>Anceſtors</hi> with their own in their Confeſſions, <hi>becauſe they are actually Partakers with them in their Iniquity.</hi> Indeed <hi>this</hi> is too much the <hi>Courſe</hi> of this World in the ſeveral Generations of it, <hi>Poſterity learn and retain the Vices of their Anceſtors.</hi> As <hi>one Generation</hi> corrupt themſelves it is a pretty ſure way to make the <hi>Next</hi> worſe. A People are hardly bro't to <hi>reform</hi> the Errors of their <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> which they are <hi>Educated</hi> in, and ſuck in with their <hi>Mothers Milk.</hi> So <hi>Iſraels Apoſtacy grew</hi> on the ſucceeding Generations after the Death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and again after the Reigns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Judg. 2.10, 19. <hi>There aroſe another Generation which knew not the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001801_0012_0FB82C7B5CFA3680"/>LORD;</hi> but the next after them <hi>returned and corrupted themſelves more than their-Fathers.</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> ſuppoſes it to be ſometimes the happy Caſe of particular Perſons, <hi>that the Son ſeeth all his Fathers Sins which he hath done, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth and doeth not the like.</hi> Ezek. 18.14. And GOD forbid that <hi>this</hi> ſhould not be often <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified;</hi> and to GOD be the <hi>Praiſe</hi> whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is ſo. But the Contrary is uſually the Caſe of a Degenerate People. Poſterity <hi>inherit</hi> their Fathers Manners, and are <hi>fix'd</hi> in evil Cuſtoms by the Practice and Example of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and ſometimes may <hi>receive their Errors with Reverence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW if the People of <hi>our Age</hi> retain the Evils of the <hi>laſt,</hi> and carry Impiety to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Length than it was before our time, have we not made our Fathers Sins <hi>our own</hi> with a witneſs? <hi>Truly,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews</hi> in His Time. Luk. 11.48. <hi>Ye bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ye allow the Deeds of your Fathers.</hi> That is, <hi>They</hi> did by the <hi>Prophets</hi> then, as their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> had done long before; They were <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> and <hi>Obſtinate</hi> in Sin as their Fathers had been under the Miniſtry of former Prophets; they were of the ſame <hi>perſecuting Spirit</hi> that their Fathers had been of: So <hi>their Fathers Sin was Theirs</hi> and both to be confeſſed in the ſame Breath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001801_0013_0FB82C7C66E369F0"/>
IT was the <hi>folly</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and their <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> that they cou'd confeſs their Fathers perſecution of the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>not diſcern their own.</hi> It may be the Error may ſeem <hi>leſs</hi> if we confeſs our own faults, and not our Anceſtors. But that our Confeſſions may be perfect we muſt <hi>Omit neither.</hi> As the <hi>Martyr Stephen</hi> made Confeſſion for the <hi>Jewiſh Rulers,</hi> ſince they wou'd not do it for themſelves: Act. 7.51. <hi>You ſtiff-necked and Uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſiſt the HOLY GHOST; As your Fathers did ſo do ye: Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted? and they have ſlain them which ſhewed before of the Coming of that JUST ONE, of whom ye have been now the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers and Murderers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. TO Confeſs the Sins of our <hi>Fathers</hi> with our own <hi>may be of ſpecial Influence to keep us from them, or to Convince us of them, and put us the more zealouſly upon the Reforming and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that the Wrath of GOD may be turned away from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>TO keep us from them:</hi> that if we are not fallen into their Sins we may not: for what more Effectual way is there for the <hi>Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Sin than a ſincere penitential Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of it; which binds the Soul not to do it 2. Chron. 30. <hi>And be not ye like your Fathers and like your Brethren, which treſpaſſed againſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001801_0014_0FB82C7DEAD5D9D0"/>the LORD GOD of your Fathers,—Now be not ye ſtiff-necked as your Fathers were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>OR ſurely it muſt the more Convince us of and humble us for our own Sins,</hi> if we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the <hi>Similitude</hi> of the Sins of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which we confeſs. It muſt leave us <hi>Self-judged</hi> and condemned. Our own <hi>Lips</hi> do then fall upon us, and our own <hi>Tongue</hi> riſes in Judgment. The Guilt of a People is greatly Aggravated, and the Offence to GOD riſes exceedingly, when the Sins of Anceſtors are retained. A People may not be ready to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this; but GOD will have them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of it. Jer. 16.10, 11. <hi>What is our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? or what is our Sin that we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the LORD our GOD? Then ſhalt thou ſay unto them, Becauſe your Fathers have forſaken me, ſaith the LORD,—and ye have done worſe than your Fathers.</hi> If this will not convince a People what can! Mal. 3.7. <hi>Even from the days of your Fathers ye have gone away from mine Ordinances—. Antiquity, Uſage</hi> and <hi>long Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom</hi> is ſo far from Extenuating the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> that it aggravates it. Mat. 23.32. <hi>Fill ye up the Meaſure of your Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. IF we are Convinced of and Humbled for the Sins of our Fathers found among our ſelves, <hi>we ſhall reform and forſake them as well as confeſs 'em.</hi> So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> gathered the <hi>Prieſts
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001801_0015_0FB82C80F0F2AF78"/>and Levites</hi> together, and ſaid unto them; <hi>Our Fathers have treſpaſſed, and done that which was Evil in the Sight of the LORD,— Now it is in my heart to make a Covenant with the LORD GOD of Iſrael, that his fierce wrath may turn from us.</hi> 2 Chron. 29.6, 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly. <hi>GOD will turn away his Wrath from and mercifully pardon ſuch a People, as peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently confeſs and reform their own and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the one hand it is moſt Certain, that a Peoples perſiſting impenitently in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sins does heap up Guilt, and treaſure up Wrath, from Generation to Generation, and at laſt brings down fearful Deſtructions on them. Iſa. 65.7. <hi>Your Iniquities and the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of your Fathers together,— which have blaſphemed me—: therefore will I meaſure their former Work into their Boſom.</hi> Very pathetical are the <hi>Expoſtulations</hi> to this purpoſe: Jer. 44.7, 9. <hi>Wherefore commit ye this great Evil againſt your own Souls, to cut off from you man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, child and ſuckling out of Judah, to leave you none to remain—? Have ye forgotten the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of your Fathers—? they are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law.</hi> And again, Ezek. 20.30, 36. <hi>Are ye polluted after the manner of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Surely—with fury poured out—will I plead with you—.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:001801_0016_0FB82C8339FE67B0"/>
BUT now the <hi>Entail of Wrath</hi> is as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>cut off,</hi> if a people repent of and reform the Sins of their Fathers, and do not <hi>relapſe</hi> into them, nor have any like Provocations of their own. <hi>Joſiah</hi> wou'd have ſaved <hi>Judah</hi> from Ruine, after all their Apoſtacies and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, if his People would have done and been like Him: He <hi>rent his Clothes</hi> when he heard the Words of the Book of the Law,—<hi>for great is the Wrath of the LORD that is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled againſt us,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>becauſe our Fathers have not hearkned to the Words of this Book:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent and gathered unto him all the Elders of <hi>Judah</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and went up with them in a Solemn Aſſembly <hi>into the Houſe of the LORD,</hi> and there cauſed to be read in their hearing all the Words of the <hi>Book of the Covenant:</hi> And the <hi>King</hi> there and then publicly <hi>Covenanted</hi> before the LORD, <hi>to walk after the LORD, and to keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Teſtimonies, and his Statutes, with all their heart and all their Soul,— and all the People ſtood to the Covenant. i.e.</hi> Declar'd their Conſent to it and bound themſelves to keep it; which had they <hi>indeed ſtood to, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem's</hi> Deſtruction wou'd not have come on ſo ſoon after. See 2 King. 22. &amp; 23. <hi>Chapters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THESE</hi> are ſome of the <hi>Great Reaſons</hi> why a People in confeſſing their own Iniquity,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001801_0017_0FB82C8550BD6298"/>ſhould confeſs alſo the Sins of their FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS. I will Conclude with a few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Inferences</hi> from the <hi>Premiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE 1. Hence I infer, <hi>That in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Actions we ſhould always conſider that we act for POSTERITY.</hi> The Influence of our Principles and Practices reaches to <hi>them.</hi> Therefore we ſhould by no means limit our Tho'ts meerly to our ſelves and our own Times, when we are regulating our own Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. If we of <hi>this Age</hi> are wicked, we hurt not only the preſent, but <hi>Ages to come.</hi> Not only thoſe who are now Alive and ſee our ill Example, but thoſe too who are not yet born may be much prejudiced by our ill Conduct. And on the other hand, If we are Vertuous and Religious, we ſerve not only our own Generation, but thoſe that come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, it may be to many Generations. For this Reaſon and on this View let us deſire ſo to live that <hi>Poſterity</hi> may not be the worſe for us, but the better. That they may not be Miſerable thro' our fault and come to curſe us, but that our Memory may be dear and precious, Venerable and bleſſed to them. That our <hi>Childrens Children</hi> may not be Aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of us, and remember us only in their Confeſſions and <hi>Abaſements;</hi> but alſo ſome times in their <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> to the Glory of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001801_0018_0FB82C8719AD9BC0"/>GOD with Reverence and Eſteem. Pſal. 22.4, 5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in Thee, they truſted and Thou didſt deliver them; they cried unto thee and were delivered, they truſted in thee and were not Confounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we ought to confeſs the Sins of our Fathers, then <hi>pious Fathers ſhould bewail the Sins and degeneracy of their Children, and be afflicted and abaſed before GOD in the proſpect and fear thereof.</hi> This is a very natural Grief to Holy Hearts, and alas too commonly is there Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given for it. The fear of this gives a very <hi>painful Concern</hi> to Them that bear us, and if they live to ſee <hi>it</hi> it brings down their <hi>grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.</hi> Like <hi>old Eli</hi> they ſit <hi>trembling</hi> for the <hi>Ark</hi> of GOD in the hands of their <hi>Ungodly Off-ſpring.</hi> Tremble they do for their <hi>Sons,</hi> to think what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them; but much more for the <hi>Name</hi> and Honour of GOD that ſuffers by them, and which is more to them than the <hi>Lives</hi> of their Children. So faithful <hi>Moſes</hi> took a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful <hi>Leave</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> on the knowledge of their paſt Sins, and foreſight of thoſe to come: He even confeſs'd and bewail'd 'em before thoſe were born that did commit 'em: Deut. 31.27, 28, 29. <hi>For I know thy Rebellion and thy ſtiff neck: Behold while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been Rebellious againſt the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001801_0019_0FB82C8B5E43ECC0"/>LORD; and how much more after my Death? Gather unto me all the Elders of your Tribes, and your Officers, that I may ſpeak theſe Words in your Ears, and call Heaven and Earth to Record againſt them. For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt your ſelves, and turn aſide from the Way which I have commanded you; and Evil will befal you in the latter days, becouſe ye will do Evil in the ſight of the LORD, to provoke him to Anger—.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. IF we ſhou'd confeſs their Sins who are gone before us, <hi>then whatever has been Amiſs in our Fathers we ſhould reform.</hi> I have <hi>no Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> to bring againſt the FATHERS of my <hi>Country,</hi> whoſe Memory is Bleſſed with us; and with <hi>Whom</hi> we may not compare our Selves, being <hi>riſen up a ſinful Generation</hi> in their place; A more <hi>mixt People,</hi> and acting more on <hi>worldly Views, Maxims and Cuſtoms.</hi> Yet <hi>They</hi> were far from pretending to <hi>Perfection,</hi> They were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

            <p>IF in the Begining of the <hi>Country,</hi> in any Places they founded their <hi>Churches</hi> on <hi>too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> a Bottom, and in too much <hi>Independency</hi>

            <p>IF there be any <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> in our Churches derived from our <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> whereby thoſe <hi>Terms are Impoſed</hi> in order to the <hi>Admiſſion</hi> of Perſons to the LORD's <hi>Table,</hi> which CHRIST hath not impoſed in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> ſuch <hi>Impoſitions</hi> ought to be laid aſide. For they are juſtly to be Condemned, eſpecially in <hi>US,</hi> becauſe <hi>we do complain</hi> of Impoſitions in other <hi>Communions,</hi> and our <hi>Fathers ſled</hi> from the ſame.</p>
            <p>IF there ever was a <hi>Cuſtom</hi> among us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Communion in our Churches</hi> was made a TEST for the Enjoyment of <hi>Civil Priveledges in the State;</hi> the <hi>Natural</hi> Rights of Men and the <hi>Legal</hi> Rights of <hi>Engliſh Men,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to one Church State and Communion or another, conſiſtent with the public Peace and Safety of the <hi>GOVERNMENT;</hi> we have done well long ſince to <hi>Aboliſh</hi> any ſuch <hi>corrupt and perſecuting Maxims:</hi> Which it is a <hi>Miſchief</hi> to any free People and a <hi>Scandal</hi> to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to retain.</p>

IF there were of old among our Fathers any <hi>Laws Enacted,</hi> or at any time any <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> given and <hi>Executions</hi> done according to thoſe Laws, which have carried too much the <hi>Spirit and Face of Cruelty and Perſecution;</hi> we ought to be <hi>Humbled greatly</hi> for any ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our Fathers, and confeſs it to have been ſinful in them.

            <p>IF there ever was among our Fathers any Grounds for that <hi>groſs Accuſation</hi> which has been made by ſome againſt them; but I am ready to believe was a <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Calumny</hi> unjuſtly caſt upon their Memory, becauſe I have heard the ſame <hi>Accuſation</hi> made moſt unjuſtly in ſome particular <hi>Caſes</hi> againſt our <hi>Judges</hi> now alive; If (I ſay) there has been <hi>open Partiality</hi> in doing Juſtice and Judgment, out of reſpect of Perſons, becauſe of our own Communion or <hi>way of Worſhip;</hi> GOD forbid that the leaſt of <hi>this Leven or Tincture</hi> ſhould be found among us.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001801_0023_0FB82C93C8C1D240"/>and it is one Inſtance of our Obedience to the <hi>firſt Commandment with Promiſe, Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> If there be any <hi>Vertue,</hi> if there be any <hi>Praiſe,</hi> think of <hi>theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Fathers</hi> had their <hi>Infirmities</hi> no doubt, but they had their <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Integrity.</hi> They were a Company of <hi>brave and honeſt Men.</hi> Not many <hi>Wiſe men after the fleſh,</hi> not any of the <hi>Mighty and Noble</hi> were among them; but neither were they any of the <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>vile</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> for outward <hi>Eſtate</hi> or <hi>Character.</hi> They were for the Body of them Serious and <hi>Godly Chriſtians;</hi> Men <hi>rich in Faith</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of a better World. For that <hi>better Country</hi> they left their pleaſant <hi>Native Land,</hi> and in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> moſtly for Religion's ſake, they declar'd plainly that they <hi>fought</hi> it.</p>
            <p>THEY came over on a moſt <hi>worthy</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, on the <hi>Nobleſt</hi> Motives, and with the <hi>beſt</hi> Intentions. <hi>Pare and Undefiled RELIGION</hi> was their propoſed <hi>End,</hi> and their <hi>Support</hi> in their Undertaking. Their firſt Care was to <hi>plant Churches</hi> rather than <hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>Schools and Colledges</hi> as ſoon as they ſaw Towns In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, to leave a <hi>learned MINISTRY</hi> and Religion in the <hi>Power of it</hi> to their Poſterity. <hi>Government</hi> and good Order was as much their Care as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> not uſing Liberty
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001801_0024_0FB82C951ECDAE60"/>for an <hi>Occaſion to the fleſh,</hi> but ſtanding faſt in that <hi>wherewith CHRIST hath made us free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY have jeſt us their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> for the <hi>purity of GOD's Worſhip</hi> according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Scripture,</hi> without the Additions of men; and againſt Will worſhip and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition Formality and Hypocriſy. They have Inſtituted us in the ſtrict Obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which has been the Honour of theſe <hi>Churches,</hi> and as it decays is our <hi>real Apoſtacy</hi> from vital Religion. They have commended to us ſtrict <hi>Family Government,</hi> and the <hi>good Education</hi> of our Children, which was our <hi>own Happineſs</hi> under their wiſe and faithful Care. They taught us by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> what the. <hi>Grace of GOd, which brings us Salvation teacheth; to deny Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly in this preſent Evil World: to honour all Men, to love the Brotherhood, to fear GOD, and to honour the King.</hi> They have left us the noble Example of a <hi>Public Spirit,</hi> to love our Country, to act for Poſterity, and ſeek the Good of After-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>SUCH a ſort of Men were the <hi>Founders and Fathers</hi> of our Country: Men <hi>of whom the World was not worthy,</hi> tho' they were <hi>plain men,</hi> but not wanting in <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Learning, Prudence, Integrity</hi> and true <hi>Devotion,</hi> I ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001801_0025_0FB82C9A8F5D45F8"/>have ſaid too what a <hi>Stock of Prayers</hi> they laid in for us, which have bro't down many Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſings on us already, and we hope will many more on the Generations yet to come.</p>
            <p>[NOR may I omit to mention, with how much <hi>Humanity</hi> and a truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Zeal they had at heart and labour'd for the <hi>Civilizing,</hi> the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Natives.</hi> The Names of <hi>Eliot</hi> and <hi>Mahew</hi> are made Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal with us on this Account, and their <hi>Reſt is Glorious.</hi> They did the part of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> with a truly primitive Spirit. The <hi>Government</hi> treated the <hi>barbarous people</hi> with many Courteſies and Obligations. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Labours were uſed and pains taken with them to Acquaint them with the Ways of GOD. The <hi>Bible</hi> with vaſt pains and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was <hi>Tranſlated</hi> into the <hi>Indian Tongue</hi> and printed for their Uſe, and diſtributed among them. They were preach'd to, they were argued with and Entreated. An <hi>Indian Colledge</hi> was built, ſome of their <hi>Children</hi> with much difficulty put to <hi>School,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> have been bro't up at the <hi>Colledge,</hi> but <hi>died</hi> there.</p>
            <p>WHAT tho' the <hi>Succeſs</hi> has not anſwered the pious hope Intention and Prayers of our Fathers? their Piety is never the leſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and their <hi>Reward is with GOD</hi> tho
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001801_0026_0FB82C9D214424D0"/>the <hi>Salvages be not gather'd.</hi> What tho' they might have taken <hi>wiſer Methods,</hi> ſome may think; They did what appear'd to them beſt, and what coſt 'em more Expence and fatigue it may be, than the other propoſed Methods would have done. And what tho' there were <hi>Neglects</hi> too of <hi>ſome Parts,</hi> and even ſome of our own <hi>Plantations</hi> were ſetled in too <hi>heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a manner:</hi> Never the leſs if much of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Preſence</hi> of GOD had not been with our <hi>Fathers,</hi> they had never done half the Great and Good things they did.]</p>
            <p>THIS is but a ſmall piece of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to their Memory, and to excite our <hi>Emulation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, IF we ſhould conſider the faults of our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> to confeſs them, <hi>then how much more ought we to bewail our own Sins, and the Sins of our own Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>OUR own Perſonal Tranſgreſſions and Guilts.</hi> Without <hi>theſe</hi> the Sins of others gone before us would not hurt us much. <hi>The Soul that Sins ſhall die: The Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of his Father,</hi> if he conſidereth and doeth not the like. Ezek. 18.14.</p>
            <p>LAY thy hand then upon thy heart, and ſmite there for thy own Abominations. For theſe GOD will judge thee in the laſt Day. And this it is that He looks for to day from thee, that thou feel the <hi>plague of thy own heart,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001801_0027_0FB82C9ED78141F8"/>and ſo ſpread forth thy hands toward his houſe. For what haſt thou to do to confeſs the Sins of others, who art not Affected with thy own? <hi>Thou Hypocrite, pull firſt the Beam out of thine own Eye.</hi> Repent thee of thy own Wickedneſs, and ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> When I ſpeak of Sinners, am I not <hi>the Chief?</hi> But what is my own <hi>Repentance</hi> this day before the LORD? Am I <hi>humbled</hi> for and bewailing my own Sins? have I <hi>reformed</hi> theſe yet? do I <hi>keep my ſelf from mine own Iniquity?</hi> Pſal. 51.2, 3. <hi>Waſh ME thro'ly from MINE Iniquity, and cleanſe ME from My Sin; for I acknowledge My Tranſgreſſions, and My Sin is ever before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>LET us lay to heart the Sins of our Day and Time.</hi> Whether thoſe of our <hi>Land,</hi> or of our <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Sins of our Land.</hi> We are ſadly on the decay as to ſerious Piety and vital Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

            </p>
            <p>OUR Work <hi>to day</hi> is to bewail the <hi>preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy</hi> and corruption of our People. Iſa. 58.1. <hi>Shew my People THEIR Tranſgreſſion, and the Houſe of Jacob their Sins.</hi> Let us therefore bring <hi>our Peace-Offerings,</hi> as repenting <hi>Judah</hi> did, and <hi>make Confeſſion to the LORD GOD of our Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>LET us lay to heart the Sins of our Nation, the place of our FATHERS Sepulchers.</hi> And here a <hi>diſmal Scene</hi> opens of ſuch Iniquity, as I hope is <hi>not yet known</hi> among us; how ſoon ſoever it may <hi>threaten us</hi> if not reformed there.

            <p>THE <hi>Venerable Name</hi> of Religion and of the CHURCH is made a <hi>Sham-pretence</hi> for the worſt of <hi>Villanies:</hi> for all <hi>Uncharitableneſs</hi> and unnatural <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> of the pious and peaceable, for <hi>ſlanders lies and falſhoods,</hi> for <hi>Diviſions hatred and Animoſities,</hi> for <hi>Bribery and Perjury,</hi> for <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty</hi> and <hi>Perfidy,</hi> for <hi>Tumults, Mutinies and Rebellions,</hi> for all <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to GOD &amp; <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt the KING and our Country.</p>

THE <hi>perilous Times</hi> are come, wherein Men are <hi>Lovers only of their own Selves,</hi> ſacrificing the <hi>Public</hi> to their own private <hi>Gains and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, without natural Affection, Truce-breakers, falſe Accuſers, Incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are Good; Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures more than lovers of GOD, having a form of Godlineſs,</hi> and multitudes not <hi>that</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>From ſuch turn away,</hi> ſays the Holy <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> And I pray GOD to <hi>purge</hi> the <hi>Court, Nobility and Magiſtracy</hi> of this plague and <hi>leproſy;</hi> and not the <hi>Court</hi> only, but alſo the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the <hi>Univerſities</hi> and <hi>Accademies,</hi> as well as the <hi>Camp</hi> and <hi>Fleet;</hi> that the Spirit of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Factions</hi> may not increaſe unto more <hi>Ungodlineſs,</hi> and to all <hi>Barbarities.</hi>

However I am very glad that I can do our <hi>United Brethren in Great Britain,</hi> and this <hi>Country</hi> too the Honour and the Juſtice as to ſay, That in this time of public <hi>Treacheries, Perjuries, Rebellion</hi> &amp; <hi>Treaſon,</hi> not a <hi>dog</hi> can wag his tongue to charge us with <hi>Diſloyalty,</hi> Undutifulneſs or Diſreſpect to <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or want of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> to the PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANT SUCCESSION, the peaceful <hi>Reign</hi> of the KING, &amp; the true Intereſts of the Nation as to their <hi>Civil and Religious Rights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it is an <hi>Amazing</hi> thing, and one wou'd think Incredible, that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſhould be in the <hi>late Rebellions</hi> againſt his <hi>preſent MAJESTY,</hi> to ſet up a <hi>popiſh Pretender</hi> whom they have ſo often and juſtly <hi>Abjured.</hi> It is as the <hi>right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend the Biſhops</hi> ſay Excellently in their late <hi>pious and loyal Declaration,</hi> 
               <q>ſo vile and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable a thing as may juſtly make 'em Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to GOD and man. And at the ſame time to pretend a zeal for the Church of <hi>England</hi> is ſuch an Impoſition on the common Senſe of Mankind, that nothing even in Popery it ſelf can be more Abſurd: And nothing but an Infatuation from GOD, juſtly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for our Sins can ſuffer it to paſs upon the Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Wherefore, in the Name of GOD, thoſe <hi>moſt Reverend Perſons</hi> do call upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001801_0031_0FB82CA98B3ED090"/>in the firſt place to humble themſelves before GOD for the Great and crying Sins of the Nation; for that Spirit of Infidelity and Libertiniſm; of Unthankfulneſs for the Mercies of the Goſpel; of Formality and Hypocriſy, of Strife and Envy, of Hatred and Animoſity, which are ſo rife in it, and generally the Forerunners of the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be GOD for this <hi>Seaſonable and True Teſtimony</hi> of theſe FATHERS in the Church. They have here ſaid what the Body of the <hi>Diſſenting Miniſters</hi> have long tho't and <hi>ſaid often Weeping,</hi> but <hi>in vain.</hi> The Atheiſtical and Immoral part of the Nation are the Source of its Miſeries and Dangers.

            </p>
            <p>I pray GOD that the Day may come when We may no longer <hi>hate to be reformed,</hi> and that the KING may live to be the <hi>Glorious Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in the Hand of GOD of our <hi>Reformation</hi> in every Reſpect.
