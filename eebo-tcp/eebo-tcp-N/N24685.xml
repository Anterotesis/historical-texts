            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This will appear in the hiſtory of Socivizca, and is the only thing that can be urged in extenuation of his crimes, or as an excuſe for the conduct of the preſent Emperor of Germany, who, ſince the year 1776, has retained him in his ſervice, as <hi>Arambaſſa,</hi> an officer in his regiment of Pandours. The

Morlachians are amazingly ſtrong; travellers affirm that four of them will carry a man on horſeback twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty paces over the moſt dangerous paſſes of the mountains. Their habits are of divers colours, quite different from thoſe of the Venetians, and they commonly go armed with an ax.</p>
               <p>This ſingular man will not excite in us that horror and averſion which we generally feel in reading the lives of common thieves and murderers, nor does he deſerve to be conſidered wholly in that light, ſince he did not lie in wait for travellers indiſcriminately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſtrip and murder them, but confined his depredations and barbarity to the Turks, againſt whom he had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive animoſity, rouſed and augmented by perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to the incidents of his life, it may be proper to ſhow, that the Morlachians of our time differ very little in their manners and cuſtoms from the ancient inhabitants of their country, deſcribed thus by Ovid, in his "<hi>Epiſtolae ex Pento.</hi> The men that I ſee here (ſays this author) are ſcarce worthy to be called men, for they have the natural ferocity of wolves.

They live on pillage, but they fight-bravely and openly for their prey; all other means of procuring the neceſſaries of life appear to them to be baſe and ignominious,. Without any fear or apprehenſion of them, the ſight of them is alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to create averſion. Their voice is ſavage; their

               <p>STANISLAO SOCIVIZCA was born in the year 1715, at Simiovo, in a farm houſe, about ſixteen miles from Trebigne, a city dependant on the Ottoman empire. His father, who was in extreme indigence, labored, with three other ſons, in cultivating the lands of a very rich Turkiſh family, called the <hi>Umitalcichi,</hi> and theſe poor people were cruelly oppreſſed by their maſters, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they not only loaded them with inſults, but beat them ſeverely. Neither Socivizca, whoſe tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was naturally ſavage and cruel, nor his brothers, could any longer endure their repeated acts of tyranny, but their father conſtantly exhorted them to forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and bound them by the ties of filial obedience to ſubmit, for ſeveral years, with reſignation to their hard fate.</p>
               <p>At length however chance threw in their way the three Turkiſh brothers who were the chief perſecutor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>8000 ſequins ariſing from exactions called <hi>the Arai,</hi> that is to ſay, the forced contributions of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of ſeveral villages, their vaſſals, they came to paſs a few days on the farm where Socivizca and his family cultivated the lands. This favourable opportunity awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened their reſentment, and deaf to all the remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their mild and peaceable father, they reſolved to avenge themſelves of the whole houſe of the <hi>Umitalcichi</hi> in the perſons of theſe three young men: accordingly they maſſacred them, and buried the bodies in a deep
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032707_0005_0FF432405F269C00"/>
ditch which they dug round the farm. The young men being miſſed, the Turkiſh Baſhaw of <hi>Trebigne,</hi> and the captain of the guards arreſted upwards of fifty chriſtians of the diſtrict; ſome of whom were put to death, and others made ſlaves for not confeſſing tho innocent, that they were criminals; but not the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion fell upon the family of <hi>Socivizca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a cuſtom among the Turks, that when a ſum of money has been ſtolen from any perſon, and cannot be recovered, all the inhabitants of the village or town wherein the robbery is committed are aſſembled togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and a tax is levied upon each family in proportion to their property to make up the amount; this was put in practice in the preſent caſe, and the neatneſs of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civizca</hi>'s dreſs, the pride he had aſſumed, and which he had not ſhown before, together with his temerity and audacity of which he had given frequent proofs ſince this event, left no doubt in the minds of the Turks that he was the murderer: but a full year had elapſed before they were confirmed in this opinion.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt rumour of his family being ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Socivizca had adviſed his brothers to retire to a diſtant province with the remains of the money. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they all ſled together with their father, who being very old and infirm died upon the road; and they reached <hi>Imoſchi</hi> a ſmall town upon the <hi>Venetian</hi> territories. This happened in the year 1745; there they purchaſed lands, built a houſe, and ſtocked a warehouſe with the moſt valuable merchandiſe.</p>
               <p>As for Socivizca as he did not think the ſlow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032707_0006_0FF42A206C604678"/>
of trade, or annual rents worth his notice he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to return to <hi>Monte Vero,</hi> where with a ſmall band of choſen relations and friends, he commenced public robber and murderer of the Turks; in one ſummer they attacked, aſſaſſinated and robbed forty. One of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades having loſt his carabine, Socivizca reſolved to take one by force from the firſt perſon he met armed, but in this attempt, when he leaſt ſuſpected it, he found himſelf in the midſt of a Turkiſh caravan. The guard who firſt perceived him, took him for what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e really was, an <hi>Aiduco,</hi> a name formerly given to a party of Morlachians, who devoted their whole lives to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Turks, at preſent they call every high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way robber an <hi>Aiduco</hi>; he denied it with terrible oaths, but in vain, ſix other Turks ſurrounded him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further trial were preparing to bind him. Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vizca ſeeing himſelf in this ſituation, fired a piſtol as an alarm to his companions and told the Turks they conſiſted of a large band at a little diſtance; at the ſame time he ſhouted as loud as poſſible. The Turks took the alarm, and imagining they already ſaw a hardy troop of veteran aſſaſſins advancing, fell back a few paces to obſerve from what quarter they would come, this gave him an opportunity to eſcape by flight; but the Turks perceiving the ſtratagem, purſued him with their carabines loaded. Socivizca, who knew that it was the cuſtom of the Turks to fire all together, and not to reſerve a ſingle carabine for an emergency, juſt as they were on the point of diſcharging their pieces, laid himſelf down flat on the ground, and the enemy having fired, inſtantly approached him think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032707_0007_0FF43244A6790B78"/>
they had mortally wounded him, either in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his body or in the head, when riſing ſuddenly he ſhot one Turk, and knocked down another, with the butt end of his piſtol, then recollecting that he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other piſtol loaded he diſpatched him.</p>
               <p>In the interval his comrades joined him, and the five remaining Turks took to their heels. The caravan now came up, and tho Socivizca and his companions had no inclination to let ſo rich a body eſcape them, they found it ſo numerous that they durſt not venture to attack it.</p>
               <p>After this expedition he returned to <hi>Imoſchi</hi> where he lived retired for nine years, and followed the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick his family had eſtabliſhed, but when he wanted recreation he made a ſport of hunting the Turks, and aſſaſſinating one or two from time to time.</p>
               <p>One of the brothers of Socivizca following his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, became the terror of the country; he aſſociated himſelf with a banditti, at the head of whom was one <hi>Pezeireb</hi> who took pleaſure in empaling alive all the Turks who had the misfortune to fall into his hands. This monſter of cruelty at laſt was taken by the Turks, who ran a ſtake thro his body, and then faſtened him with cords to another, leaving him in this condition to expire at the ſide of a high road. Paſſengers, and the peaſants inhabiting the neighbourhood, affirmed, that he lived in this horrid ſituation three days, preſerving his ferocity to the laſt, and ſmoaking repeated pipes given him by them as long as he had breath, notwih<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the agonies he endured.</p>

This man was a <hi>Probatim,</hi> a name aſſumed by a fraternity in Morlachia, who by ſolemn rites and ceremonies, at the foot of the alter, ſwear an unalterable friendſhip to each other, and a mutual alliance offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. The uſual vows had been exchanged between this Greek and Socivizca's brother, and in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their friendſhip, he invited him to paſs a few days at his houſe on the confines of Imoſchi: the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e having ſhown him every mark of hoſpitality and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he had made him quite drunk, he adviſed him to retire to reſt, and while he ſlept, ſent for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Turks to whom, for a bribe, he delivered up his unſuſpecting gueſt. The Turks carried him to the Baſhaw of <hi>Trawnick,</hi> who knowing him to be the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a man who had ſworn deſtruction to the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race held a council which laſted eight hours, to deviſe the moſt cruel mode of torturing him to death. The news of this dreadful cataſtrophe ſoon reached the ears of Socivizca, but as he remained ignorant of the circumſtances of his falling into their hands, he went directly to the houſe of the <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> for intelligence. The father of the prefidious friend, received him with the greateſt compoſure, and being a venerable old man, Socivizca readily believed the artful tale he told him, of their being unexpectedly ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Turks, who had received ſome ſecret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, no doubt, from an unknown hand. The Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032707_0009_0FF42A3E684E7370"/>
likewiſe received him with ſuch an appearance of real kindneſs, that he did not entertain the ſmalleſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>picions of treachery: for he invited him to ſtay the night, and told him he would fetch a fine lamb from the fold to make him an excellent ſupper. With this pretence he left him, in affect, to run as faſt as he could to give notice to a party of the Turkiſh cavalry ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about twelve miles from his houſe, that he had got their great enemy under his roof.</p>
               <p>The hour of midnight was paſſed, when Socivizca finding the Probatim was not returned with the lamb, went to bed, as well as the reſt of the family, who ſoon fell into a profound ſleep, but as for Socivizca, his ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions were awake, and he could not cloſe his eyes. "And ſuch were my forebodings, ſaid he, (his own words to the Emperor) as if I was at the brink of ſome eminent danger, that I jumped from my bed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to light a lamp by the aſhes of a fire that had been in the room, but the old man was in the plot with his ſon, and knowing what they expected to happen in the courſe of the night, had taken care to extinguiſh ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpark." He was then convinced that ſome horrid conſpiracy was formed againſt his life, and rage took poſſeſſion of his ſoul; he ſought in vain for his arms, they were concealed: he then called aloud to know if any of the family could tell him where to find them, but no one replied, except an old woman, who bid the brute lie ſtill and not make a noiſe to diſturb the children. Fortunately he had a flint and a knife in his pocket, with which he ſtruck a light, and applied it to the lamp.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032707_0010_0FF432995E1C0DB8"/>
He then repaired to the old man's bed, and aſked in a ſevere tone of voice where they had put his arms, but the traitor to gain time, feigned to be aſleep, but being compelled to anſwer, he pretended not to underſtand him, which coſt him his life, for Socivizca took up a hatchet that lay by the chimney, and diſpatched him. This ſo terrified the woman, that ſhe inſtantly produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his arms, and he had no ſooner got them, then he made his eſcape from the houſe, and concealed himſelf in ſome thick buſhes at a ſmall diſtance to wait the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. He had not been long in this ſituation before he heard the trampling of a great number of horſes, and by the light of their torches he diſcovered them to be a detachment of Turkiſh cavalry, who diſmounted, went into the houſe, and in a few minutes returned, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly much diſappointed. Socivizca obſerved their motions when they remounted and returned by the ſame road; at length, having narrowly watched that not one of them remained to lay wait for him, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured from his hiding place and made the beſt of his way to Imoſchi.</p>
               <p>This double perſidy of the <hi>Probatim</hi> made ſuch an impreſſion upon his mind that it was never out of his thoughts, nor was he eaſy till he had taken a moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and cruel revenge. As ſoon as he could get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeven companions on whom he could rely for their reſolution, inſenſibility, and attachment, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them his horrid expedition, which was to ſet fire to the houſe in the dead of night. This they effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſecretly and ſuddenly, that the cottage which was
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032707_0011_0FF432484E4BA330"/>
built with wood and thatch was in flames before any of the family perceived it, except one woman, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make her eſcape by the door, was ſhot thro the head. Seventeen perſons fell a victim to his ſavage vengeance; and the Turks repreſented this barbarous tranſaction in ſuch ſtrong terms, in a memorial againſt him, addreſſed to the Governor General of Dalmatia, that he iſſued a decree ordering the houſe of Socivizca to be razed level with the ground, and ſetting a price upon his head, by offering <hi>twenty ſequins</hi> to any perſon who ſhould kill him, and <hi>forty</hi> to thoſe who ſhould take him alive. Before this decree appeared, he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from Imoſchi, and ſecreted himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different diſguiſes, in various places, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying one hour of tranquility, from the conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind, to find means of avoiding a ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>Being at the fair of Sign, in Auguſt 1754, the year in which he had burnt the family of the Probatim, he narrowly eſcaped the purſuit of a party of Croats, who were out in ſearch of him, and therefore finding he was no longer ſafe in any part of the Venetian territories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he wrote privately to one of his confidential friends to ſend his wife and family, with his effects, after him to <hi>Carlowitz,</hi> near the river <hi>Zermanga,</hi> as ſoon as they could ſecurely quit the retreat in which they lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. Thither he travelled on foot, with all poſſible expedition, and not long after his family arrived with all his effects, which were conſiderable. His houſehold conſiſted of himſelf, his two remaining brothers, his wife, a ſon and two daughters. This place being ſo ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated

that he had no opportunity to purſue his ſavage vengeance againſt the Mahometans; his manners were inſenſibly ſoftened, he lived a peaceable life for three years, and might have been totally reformed if a certain perſon in authority in that country had not been tempted from motives of avarice to deliver him and his brothers into the hands of the Turks. It is ſaid, he afterwards paid dear for his perfidy; but be this as it may, poor So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civizca and his two brothers were ſent to a fort beyond the <hi>Udbina,</hi> on the frontiers of the territories of Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, Venice, and Turkey, from whence they were eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted by a detachment of one hundred Turkiſh horſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to the Baſhaw of <hi>Traunick,</hi> the ſame who had put the fourth brother to death a few years before. After they had lain in priſon ſome time, ſinking under the weight of double irons, and ſtrictly guarded night and day: the alternative was propoſed to them, either to turn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, or to be impaled. It may well be imagined they prefered the milder operation of circumciſion; and at the ſame time it ſhows the force of Turkiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, which beats down the fence of juſtice: for Socivizca was publickly known to be the mortal foe of their race; and had maſſacred many of their brethren. Socivizca upon this occaſion took the name of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> but he did not thereby regain his liberty: his two broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers indeed were releaſed, and one of them had the poſt of Aga beſtowed upon him; but this did not prevent them from taking the firſt fair opportunity to fly from the Turkiſh dominions. The Baſhaw enraged at this ſtep ordered the new Ibrahim to be more cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; that the indulgence lately granted to him ſhould
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032707_0013_0FF4324C863A21A8"/>
be withdrawn, and notwithſtanding his pretended zeal for the Mahometan faith, that the guards ſhould never loſe ſight of him.</p>
               <p>Perceiving at length, that all his religious adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his affected docility, and exemplary patience did not advance his deliverance; his fruitful imagination furniſhed him another ſtratagem. His only relief from the horror of his fate was to converſe with his guards, whom he one day addreſſed in the following terms. "My condemnation to perpetual captivity I could bear with fortitude; I have been guilty of crimes which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this puniſhment; but I regret the quantity of money I have been obliged to bury under ground, while the hand of juſtice purſued me from place to place: conſiderable ſums are likewiſe owing to me from my former neighbors and friends. The Baſhaw cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the one, nor find the other, but if he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to demand my dues in perſon, or to find the money I have concealed, it ſhould be his; and I ſhould be happy to regain his favor by theſe preſents, and to be reſtored to the privileges' I enjoyed before my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers incurred his diſpleaſure by their eſcape."</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of this ſpeech was carried to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw; avarice, the ruling paſſion of the Turks, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over every other conſideration, and an order ſoon came to the goaler, to perm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, &amp; to give them directions to conduct him to every ſpot where he ſhould indicate that he had concealed any treaſure.</p>
               <p>Reſtored by this artful device to the liberty of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032707_0014_0FF432A14BD897C0"/>
breathing the free air, his ſubtlety furniſhed him with various pretences to amuſe the guards for upwards of a month; ſometimes he directed them to purſue one route to arrive at a cavern in which he had concealed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum, at others, he declared he had miſtaken the place, and finally, at SIGN, being confronted by ſeveral perſons whom he called his debtors to a large amount, but who ſolemnly and juridically proteſted they did not owe him a ſingle ſequin, the guards to puniſh him loaded him with heavy irons and confined him in an obſcure apartment, placing two ſentinels at the door night and day, till they had repoſed themſelves ſufficiently after the fatigue of travelling, and had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured depoſitions in form of the falſity of his pretenſions to give to the Baſhaw. By way of revenge, they found means to ſend for his wife and his two children, a boy and a girl, from the county of Zara, pretending that he was at full liberty, and had ordered them to repair to him, but as ſoon as they arrived, they took them into cuſtody.</p>
               <p>This was an unexpected aggravation of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, but it did not conquer his fortitude, nor check the fertility of his genius, ever meditating the means of eſcape. On the 26th of November, 1758, Socivizca and his family were carried before the Effendi by his guards, in order to receive inſtructions for reconducting him to Traunick; his wife was ordered to kiſs the hand of the officer as a token of obedience; he ſuffered her and his daughter to ſubmit to this ceremony, but when they ordered his ſon to do the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he called to him in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032707_0015_0FF432502B3708B8"/>
a furious tone—"Stand off! and do not offer to kiſs the hand of that dog." The Turks were ſtruck dumb with ſurpriſe, and the Effendi admiring his greatneſs of ſoul made an apology to him, expreſſing regret that his people had urged the compliance with this ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, only as a matter of cuſtom. One of the ſpectators ſhowing a forwardneſs to ſeize him, in order to tie him on the horſe he was to ride, he ſhook his chains in a terrible manner, and bid him keep his diſtance, adding theſe words, in the ſame furious tone: "Soul of a dog, think'ſt thou, that I am a woman to be held by the hand!" and then notwithſtanding the weight of his chains, he mounted his ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The inhabitants of Sign, affected at this melancholy cavalcade, in compaſſion for his wife and children, made a collection for him, and theſe charitable contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions he turned to more advantage than a rich booty ſo dexterous was he in reſources. The liberality of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vizca ſoon became the theme of praiſe with his guards, for moſt of the money given to him for his ſupport he ſpent in regaling them with brandy, till they got drunk by drinking bumpers to his health. As ſoon as they had paſſed the frontiers of the Venetian territories, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vizca complained of the extreme cold, upon which they covered him with a long Turkiſh cloak called a <hi>habanizca,</hi> and his wife having ſecretly conveyed to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032707_0016_0FF432A6453F3360"/>
him a knife ſometime before; he took an opportunity under this concealment, to cut the rope with which he was tied upon the horſe, firſt in two, and afterwards by degrees into ſmall bits which he dropped from time to time unperceived upon the road. About ſun ſet they arrived at the tower of Prologh, not far from Bilibrigh, where is a ſtation of Turkiſh cavalry. Here a diſpute aroſe, if they ſhould proceed farther, or ſtop; and it was decided by the majority to go on. At the diſtance of about two hundred yards beyond the tower of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logh the road on one ſide, paſſes along the edge of a very ſteep deſcent; at this part of it Socivizca ſlid from the horſe, and took the chance of rolling down the declivity, till he caught hold of the branch of a tree, which ſtopped him, and behind this tree he ſheltered himſelf. The ſnow lay upon the ground, which at oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er times is a fine valley lined with fruit trees. As ſoon as the guard neareſt the horſe miſſed his priſoner, he imparted it to his companions, who were ſtupified with aſtoniſhment, and not ſuſpecting that he had ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they ſeperated and galloped on in purſuit of him. Night now came on, and a heavy fall of ſnow, and when Socivizca thought it was ſo dark that objects could not be any longer diſtinguiſhed, he traverſed the mountains and woods, continuing his journey all night to regain the Venetian frontiers. He was frequently obliged to climb up into trees to avoid the fury of wild beaſts, but the weight of his chains generally brought him to the ground, and probably nothing but the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of them preſerved him from being devoured. At
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032707_0017_0FF4325481FC1A38"/>
length however he reached Morlachia in ſafety; his countrymen releaſed him from his chains, made great rejoicings upon the occaſion, and compoſed ſongs in their language to be ſung in honor of their hero.</p>
               <p>He told the emperor, that at this period of his life he had reſolved to ſupport himſelf and family by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of his hands in a private retreat, and not to commit any more depredations on the Turks; if he could have prevailed on the Baſhaw of Traunick to reſtore to him his wife and ſon; as for his daughter ſhe had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to embrace the Mahometan religion, and was well maried to a rich Turk, who ſaid it was a pity ſuch fine blood ſhould be contaminated by a Morlachian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. But the Baſhaw deaf to all his intreaties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by diſappointment, would not anſwer the letters he wrote him, in which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>emonſtrated, that he had only followed the common law of nature in uſing every ſtratagem to recover that firſt of bleſſings, liberty. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſtoring his wife and ſon, he ſent an embaſſy to the Margrave Contarini, Govenor General of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Dalmatia, requiring him by the law of nations to find him out, to ſeize him, and to ſend him to him. The Margrave who underſtood politicks better than the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, replied, that having once got him into their hands, within their own dominions, they ſhould have taken care to prevent his eſcape; and that an attempt to make him compenſate for their negligence was a manifeſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front: in ſhort, he diſmiſſed the envoys with contempt.</p>
               <p>As for Socivizca, finding all his endeavors to recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his wife and ſon by fair means were fruitleſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032707_0018_0FF42A2EB502FBE0"/>
to reſume his former occupation and to avenge himſelf on the Baſhaw's ſubjects. For this purpoſe he put himſelf at the head of twenty five ſelect compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, all of them intrepid, and in the vigor of youth: with this choſen band he took the road for Serraglio, the firſt Turkiſh town beyond the Venetian frontiers; for he had the prudence not to commit any act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence within the juriſdiction of the Venetian ſtate, that he might not make that government reſponſible for his depredations.</p>
               <p>In a few days he met with a Turkiſh caravan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one hundred horſes laden with merchandiſe, and eſcorted by ſeventy men. The Turks ſeeing him accompanied by ſo ſtrong a band, though they were ſo much ſuperior, dreaded him to ſuch a degree, that they fled with the utmoſt precipitation, and only one Jew merchant loſt his life, in defence of his valuable effects. This audacious robbery alarmed the whole Ottoman empire. Parties were ſent out againſt him from all quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he was ſought for in the mountains and in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, every field and almoſt every buſh was beat, as if they had been in chaſe of a wild boar; but this was all mockery to diſguiſe their cowardice, for while all theſe parties were making ſuch ſtrict reſearches, he and his companions appeared at noon day in their villages, and ſupplied themſelves with proviſions in the markets of their towns. He generally lodged his booty at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of <hi>Caloyers,</hi> an order of friars of the Greek church, who make a vow of rigid abſtinence, but whoſe relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion does not prevent them from harboring the <hi>Aiduzee</hi> (highwaymen) of the country, and ſharing their plunder.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032707_0019_0FF4325837D50B88"/>
The guardian of one of theſe convents ſituated at Drago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vich, ſeven miles beyond the ſprings of Cettina, was his particular friend, and here he often retired, ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf from his companions for many months, ſo that the Turks often thought he was dead; while he was only waiting for an opportunity to fall upon them, and to exterminate as many of their race as poſſible. At length, his robberies and maſſacres became inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Ottomans, and occaſioned great inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iences to the Venetian ſtate; for they were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſource of quarrels between the inhabitants of the frontiers of the two powers, ſo that it became the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the latter to ſeize him; therefore upon every new complaint of the Turks, the government of Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia increaſed the reward offered to take him, dead or alive.</p>
               <p>Socivizca was not inſenſible of the great danger he was in of being ſeized by open force, or betrayed by ſome falſe friend for the ſake of the price ſet on his head, yet ſuch is the force of habit, that nothing could deter him from continuing his depredations on the Turks, In the courſe of the year 1760, a certain Turk whoſe name was <hi>Acia Smaich,</hi> a very formidable man in the opinion of his countrymen, and in his own ideas a great hero, boaſted in all companies that Socivizca durſt not encounter him in ſingle combat. It happened however that this man and one of his brothers eſcorted, in company with eight others, a rich caravan which paſſed through a village near <hi>Glamoz</hi> in the Ottoman territories, where Socivizca and ſix of his comrades lay

By their ſpies they eaſily got intelligence who was at the head of the eſcort, and Socivizca who was not of a temper to put up with the inſolence of Smaich, went out to meet the caravan; and as ſoon as he approached it, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly called upon the Turk to defend himſelf. Smaich advancing, inſtantly fired from his carabine at Sociviz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and aimed ſo well that the ball ſtruck the upper part of his forehead, fortunately for him he had turned his head, to ſee that the enemy did not ſurround him while he was engaged with his adverſary, and in this poſition, the ball paſſed obliquely and only gave him a ſlight wound; but it rendered him deſperate, and with amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rapidity he fired one ball which entered the barrel of Smaich's carabine, and a ſecond which ſhot him thro the head, and killed him on the ſpot. His companions inſtantly fled, but five of them were overtaken in the purſuit and put to death by Socivizca's comrades.</p>
               <p>After they had plundered the caravan and divided the ſpoils, they diſguiſed themſelves and took different roads, the better to avoid the reſearches of the Turks, who generally go in ſearch of troops of robbers, and pay little or no attention to ſingle perſons on the road. For ſome time after this event, Socivizca lived ſo retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and quiet, that it was generally believed he was dead; but when it was leaſt expected, he ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the head of a formidable banditti, conſiſting of twenty five ſtout young men, with whom he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack a very conſiderable caravan that was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

At the firſt onſet, they killed ſeventeen of the Turks and took three priſoners; which ſo terrified the reſt of the guards, that they fled with the utmoſt precipitation and left him in quiet poſſeſſion of the treaſure. Socivizca was no ſooner arrived at a neighboring wood, than he ordered two of his priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be impaled alive, and aſſigned to the third, the dreadful office of turning the ſtake which was paſſed thro their bodies before a ſlow fire; his companions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to put the third to death, but inſtead of this when the two victims were half roaſted, he ordered their heads to be cut off, which he delivered to the ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoner with this commiſſion: "Carry theſe to the Baſhaw of <hi>Traunick,</hi> and tell him from me, that if he does not releaſe my wife and children without delay, I will ſerve every Turk who falls into my hands in the ſame manner; and, that God only knows what exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pleaſure it would give me to roaſt the Baſhaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>

Several ſtrong parties of foot and horſe took different routes to traverſe the mountains, woods, and vallies in ſearch of this deſperate enemy. Upon this occaſion they were ſo exaſperated, that they reſolved to quit every other employment, and to think
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032707_0022_0FF432AFD82FB238"/>
of nothing elſe but the extirmination of Socivizca and his band; and they were very near ſucceeding, for not expecting ſo much celerity on the part of the Turks, they were ſurpriſed in a wood, and obliged to maintain a flying ſkirmiſh, in which five of his comrades were wounded and and one killed, whoſe brother cut off his head, that the Turks might not have it to expoſe upon a gibbet: The Turks purſued them almoſt to <hi>Mitco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the mean time the Baſhaw of Traunick was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called to Conſtantinople, to anſwer to accuſations of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in his government, and a deſign to pillage the province af <hi>Moſtar:</hi> Socivizca had always foretold this event, and that whenever it happened, the feſtivity and diſorder which is occaſioned by the arrival of a new Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, would afford a favorable opportunity for his wife and children to eſcape. After a great many fruitleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to accompliſh this grand point, he fell upon a ſtratagem which ſucceeded.

Having collected four more of his troop, he ſent this man to Traunick, and with the others he arrived by another road within four miles of that city, and there waited the iſſue of the enterpriſe. We know not how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, but his four companions had one day left him alone, when three of the Turkiſh cavalry accoſted him, who ſtrongly ſuſpected he was an <hi>Aiduco,</hi> but little imagined he was Socivizca. Finding no excuſe to evade this, he thought the only way of removing their ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion was to offer to go with them to the city of <hi>Pruſack,</hi> which was at no great diſtance; many people in that place knew him perſonally, and he would not have made this offer, if he had not imagined that their doubts concerning him would have ceaſed, and that they would have left him, for it was hardly poſſible to conceive that any notorious robber would make ſuch an offer.</p>

Overjoyed to find her huſband was ſo near, ſhe determined to join him if poſſible, and ſhe would have brought off her daughter, but ſhe enjoyed ſo much pleaſure in the arms of her huſband, that ſhe would only conſent to facilitate the eſcape of her mother and brother. In the duſk of the evening they followed the pedlar, as if they were bargaining for ſome of his goods, and walking gently out of the gates, as if intending to return, they ſtole out without notice, and got clear off. The joy of Socivizca at their meeting, could only be reſtrained by the ſenſe of their immediate danger, and therefore as ſoon as the firſt embraces were over, he and his companions eſcorted his wife and his ſon to <hi>Draco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vick,</hi> the uſual place of refuge for them, and he deſired the Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When it was known in Traunick that the wife and ſon of Socivizca were not to be found, after the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſearch, the inhabitants were in as much conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as if their city had been beſieged: fear was on ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery

countenance, for the name of Socivizca was become ſo formidable to the Turks, that inſtead of terrifying their children with the appearance of ghoſts; they had only to name Socivizca to make them ſhudder, and as the ſum of all puniſhment; not doubting that he himſelf had conducted this bold enterpriſe; they intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the new Baſhaw to make the ſtrongeſt remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances to the governor of Dalmatia, declaring that they could not ſleep in tranquillity, unleſs his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency would cauſe him to be ſeized and put to death. The Turkiſh envoys poſitively maintained that he reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Dalmatia, and the Venetian governor as obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted that he durſt not remain a ſingle day within any part of his juridiction, which was the fact, and therefore the diſputes about him occaſioned jealouſies between the two powers without producing any effect.</p>
               <p>About the latter end of the year 1764, Socivizca found himſelf deprived of moſt of his comrades, ſome being carried off by the plague which raged with great violence in the territory of <hi>Sign,</hi> and others, amongſt whom were the moſt deſperate, being taken and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for robberies in the Venetian dominions. Thus circumſtanced, he could not undertake any coſiderable enterpriſe, for which reaſon he retired to the Auſtrian frontiers near the river <hi>Zermagna,</hi> and his name was not heard of again for ſome years, inſomuch that the Turks had entirely forgot him, imagining he was either dead, or had taken refuge in ſome very remote part of the world. However, he was not quite idle all this time, for under the name and diſguiſe of a chief

of another banditti who died, he aſſiſted in ſome attacks on ſmall caravans, and collected a little booty, juſt ſufficient for the ſupport of his own family. But in the year 1769, he appeared publicly again; having picked up eight aſſociates of determined valour, they attacked and pillaged larger caravans with ſucceſs, and once more ſpread an alarm throughout the Turkiſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. Innumerable and almoſt incredible ſtories are related of his intrepidity and dexterity about this time, in his encounters with large bodies of the Turkiſh horſe ſent out to ſcower the country in ſearch of him. At one time, perceiving a party of twenty five, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he ordered his comrades to conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves behind ſome trees, and to place their caps in ſuch a manner in others near, that they ſhould appear to be upon the heads of men; by this ſtratagem he doubled the number of his little corps, and confounded the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for having fired at the caps which all fell down, and yet ſtill receiving a warm diſcharge of ſhot from another quarter, they thought there was ſome magic in it, and were ſtruck with ſuch a panic that they fled with the utmoſt precipitation. Another party conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of forty, coming upon him by ſurpriſe in a wood near the banks of a river, his companions had juſt time to eſcape by flight, and while the Turks were pointing their muſquetry at them, he darted into the river and lay concealed under the water, in the hollow of a bank. The aſtoniſhed Turks thought it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he could eſcape them, and at laſt fatigued with fruitleſs ſearch, they gave him to the devil with whom

they were certain he was in league, otherwiſe he could not have rendered himſelf almoſt inſtantaneouſly inviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible.</p>
               <p>At length he began to grow tired of the wretched kind of life he led, and reſolved to employ the money he had ſaved in purchaſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ome little poſt for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his days; but his deſign was fruſtrated by a cruel misfortune. The Caloyer, his confeſſor, with whom he had depoſited five hundred ſequins and ſome valuable jewels, the principal fruit of his robberies, ran away with them and was never heard of more; and to complete his miſery, while he was gone as far as the Danube in purſuit of him on falſe intelligence, one of his couſins from Imoſchi came to pay him a viſit, and availing himſelf of his abſence, ſtripped the houſe of his clothes and linen. Theſe events happened in the beginning of the year 1775, and the bitter complaints he made of the perfidy of theſe two thieves, ſhowed that he was abandoning himſelf to diſpair, when by one of thoſe unaccountable viciſſitudes for which the lives of ſome men are remarkable, chance brought the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent emperor of Germany to the village where he reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it lay in the route of his memorable travels under<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the title of Count Falkerſtein; and the fame, ſuch as it was, of this bold man having reached Vienna many years before, his majeſty ſent for him, that he might be entertained with his adventures from his own mouth. The emperor perceived that the man was born with tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents for military enterpriſes, and the command of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; that in all probability if he had been civilized by

               <head>THE REFINED LOVERS. A SPANISH TALE.</head>
               <p>WHEN a lady happens to feel tender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions, in favor of a man very much inferior to her in point of rank and fortune, ſhe may be allowed to make the firſt overtures to him, eſpecially if ſhe had reaſon to believe, from his behavior, that he feels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions of the ſame kind with her own, and that he is only prevented by a delicate conſciouſneſs of his inferiority, from making an avowal of his paſſion for her. In this ſituation, however, tho appearances may be very promiſing, a woman cannot be ſure of diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtedneſs on the ſide of him who has made an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on her heart; ſhe cannot be certain that his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032707_0029_0FF4326B2D9747A8"/>
is pure and unmixed with any mercenary conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations, without making ſome trial of it; without bringing it to the teſt. An artful woman is not, in general, an amiable character; but, in theſe ſuppoſed circumſtances, no woman can be fairly blamed for the exertion of her addreſs.</p>
               <p>Olivetta, a rich heireſs in one of the moſt fertile parts of Spain, lived upon the lands ſhe inherited in a ſtyle which at once proved the grandeur of her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the delicacy of her taſte; the ſtrength of her underſtanding, and the goodneſs of her heart. In the various arrangements of her houſehold, ſhe diſcovered a conſiderable deal of judgment, happily ſteering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two extremes of parſimony and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: and, while ſhe exhibited a ſplendid appearance to the world, had not recourſe to any domeſtic mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for the ſupport of it. Her liberality was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; but it was ever under the guidance of diſcretion: the objects of her beneficence were numerous; but they were objects deſerving of her compaſſion, before they taſted of her generoſity.</p>
               <p>It may be eaſily imagined that ſuch a woman, unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, had a train of admirers. Olivetta's admirers were innumerable, and many of them were in a ſituation to juſtify their pretentions to an alliance with her; but, as ſhe had diſcernment enough to ſee that the majority of them only wanted to increaſe their conſequence by the addition of her fortune, ſhe very prudently declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed coming to any ſerious converſation with them.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe who wiſhed to be united to Olivetta,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032707_0030_0FF432BE217692F8"/>
there was one, however, whom ſhe particularly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt, and whom ſhe felt emotions, of which ſhe had not, before he came in her way, been ſenſible. With nothing to recommend himſelf to her firſt notice but an agreeable perſon, and a genteel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, he drew her attention: by his modeſt and reſpectful behavior afterwards he became of ſo much importance in her eyes, that ſhe could not help ſecretly wiſhing he was in a ſituation to throw himſelf into the line of her opulent lovers; a line which he avoided with a decency which heightened the favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion ſhe had entertained of him.</p>
               <p>Julio, the timid, ſilent, ſincere lover of Olivetta, was by birth a gentleman, but the ſport of fortune. His parents, having met with a ſeries of bitter diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments ſunk at laſt under the oppreſſive load of them, and left him to ſtruggle with an income juſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for a decent ſubſiſtance: an income by no means equal to what he had reaſon to expect in his early days, to the education which his father beſtowed upon him when he was in a flouriſhing ſtate, and had no preſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the change he was deſtined to feel in his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. With that income, however, he made himſelf, by dint of oeconomy, fit to mix with the beſt company. His figure, his converſation, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, were extremely engaging, and he was as much praiſed as pitied by all who new him. Every body ſaid, that he deſerved to be placed in a very different ſphere, but nobody offered to promote his advancement to it. A man cramped in his affairs by the mere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price

of fortune, without having done any thing to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit his adverſity, may derive ſome pleaſure, indeed, from the good wiſhes of his friends; but if thoſe who declare themſelves to be his friends are not active in his ſervice, if they take no ſteps to remove the diſtreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> which excite their compaſſion, he is under very ſlight obligations to them. Julio could not but be pained by the inactivity of his friends, yet he was cheerful; and moved in his ſmall circle uncomplaining, unrepining with a dignity which threw a luſtre upon his character, and ſhamed many illuſtrious perſonages who looked down upon him with the cold eye of commiſeration.</p>
               <p>This was the man whom Olivetta beheld in the moſt favorable light, and whom ſhe thought worthy of that affluence which ſhe herſelf enjoyed. At firſt ſhe viewed him with a kind of reverence, ſo much was ſhe ſtruck with the philoſophic part of his character: Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſoon followed by eſteem, &amp; eſteem in a ſhort time ripened into love. Such was the ſucceſſion of feelings in Olivetta's boſom, and the laſt gave no ſmall diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to her gentle breaſt. Many were the tender lines which ſhe remembered from the ſoft pages of the moſt elegant Spaniſh poets, lines of which ſhe had not till then felt the full—the more than poetic force. She bluſhed whenever ſhe thought of her loving a man in a ſtation ſo much beneath her. Not becauſe ſhe deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Julio undeſerving of her ſincereſt affection, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe clearly perceived that he would not venture to offer himſelf to her for a huſband, and that ſhe could not of courſe hope to be united to him in the manner
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032707_0032_0FF432C1C2F5FEE0"/>
ſhe wiſhed, without deviating from the decorum which ſhe could not bring herſelf to violate.</p>
               <p>While ſhe was ſitting one day in this painful, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing ſituation, in a penſive attitude, over one of her favorite poets, a young lady, for whom ſhe had a great regard, who lived with her as a companion, endeavored to divert her melancholy, by ſome ſprightly reflections on the havock made between the two ſexes by the belle paſſion: but poor Olivetta was too much under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of that paſſion to be amuſed with her compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion's vivacity. She only, ſighing, replied, that thoſe were, in her opinion, the unhappieſt of human beings, who were denied the ſatisfaction of a marriage agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their inclinations.</p>
               <p>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Franciſca, who knew as well what paſſed in Olivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's heart at that moment as ſhe did herſelf, told her, that, "if ſhe was in her place, ſhe would marry the man ſhe liked, however inferior he might be to her, if he was not unworthy of her, if ſhe could be aſſured of his loving her, without any lucrative views in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn."</p>
               <p>"Would you have me condeſcend to make the firſt advances to a man?"</p>
               <p>"The firſt advances from a woman to a man, replied Franciſca, are not, I confeſs, in general, to be defended; but, circumſtanced as you are, a few female delicacies may, I think, be diſpenſed with. You love Julio—nay, you need not be aſhamed of loving him—I am ſure he is neceſſary to your happineſs. He is very much your inferior, I grant, with reſpect to rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032707_0033_0FF43270FA22E388"/>
but he is a gentleman by birth and education, and intrinſically ſuperior to all his richer competitors. From the modeſty of his behavior, in conſequence, no doubt, of his elevated ſentiments, I will preſume to ſay, that he will never ſpeak firſt upon the ſubject."</p>
               <p>"Then I am doomed to be miſerable," exclaimed Olivetta, haſtily interrupting her, riſing, and walking acroſs her chamber inexpreſſibly agitated.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not, anſwered Franciſca, your amiable lover, thro his extreme diffidence, a diffidence which enhances his merit, prevents him from diſcloſing the ſenſations which wound his peace on your account, may be drawn into the very declaration you wiſh to extract from him, I do not pretend to put myſelf upon a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you in any ſhape; yet I fancy, I can point out a way to you, by which you may arrive at the ſummit of your deſires, without being reduced to any indelicate meaſures."</p>
               <p>Olivetta, after having liſtened very attentively to her concluding words, earneſtly entreated her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the greateſt freedom and unreſervedneſs.</p>
               <p>Franciſca obeyed, proceeded, and gave Olivetta ſo much pleaſure by her communications, that ſhe reſolved to avail herſelf of her adviſe without delay.</p>
               <p>While Olivetta and Franciſca were engaged in this manner, Julio, unable to remain in a place where he was perpetually beholding the woman whom he loved to diſtraction, but with whom he dared not to expect an alliance, determined to remove himſelf to a diſtant part of the country, and endeavor, by abſence, to cure the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032707_0034_0FF42A48D58D1700"/>
wounds which love had inflicted on his heart. It was not, however, till after the ſevereſt conflict which he had ever endured, that he reſolved to take a ſtep ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle likely to produce the intended effect.</p>
               <p>When he had packed up the few moveables in his poſſeſſion, he repaired to Olivetta's magnificent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in order to pay his grateful acknowledgements for all the civilities he had received from her, and to bid his eyes "take their laſt farewell."</p>
               <p>The reception which he met with from the "god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs of his idolatay," would have probably encouraged any other man to tell his "fond tale;" but he, from the extreme refinement of his ideas, was ſilent upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in which he was moſt intereſted, and only announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his departure, after having poured out his moſt grateful effuſions. During the delivery of thoſe effuſions, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vetta's cheeks were alternately pale and red, and the concluding words affected her in ſuch a manner, that ſhe was almoſt on the point of fainting away. Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf, however, in a few moments, ſhe took a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ring, of conſiderable value, from her finger, and preſented it to him, with the following ſpeech.</p>
               <p>"Having longer entertained a high opinion of your merit, ſir, I have long wiſhed to reward it; and if I ſhould happily have it in my power to be of ſervice to you, I ſhall certainly prove myſelf your friend. In the mean time, I beg you to accept this trifle (preſenting the ring to him) as a ſmall token of my regard; and let me be acquainted with your route, if you are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely determined to leave this place, that I may know
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032707_0035_0FF432754F156B70"/>
whither to diſpatch a meſſenger, ſhould I hear of any thing to your advantage."</p>
               <p>If Julio had obſerved Olivetta's looks, while ſhe delivered the above ſpeech, with the penetrating eyes of a truly touched inamorato, he would have derived the higheſt ſatisfaction from them, as they forcibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him, as forcible as a thouſand words could have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe earneſtly wiſhed to reward him perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the merit which had won her heart, and that ſhe wiſhed, with the utmoſt impatience, for his making the firſt overtures, to ſave her from the indelicacy of having recourſe to a ſtill plainer mode of utterance for the conſumation of her deſires: her chaſte deſires: for ſhe loved Julio with an affection of the pureſt kind; loved him more for his internal worth than for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal accompliſhments.</p>
               <p>Julio, overwhelmed at once with gratitude, love, and delicacy, was unable to return an anſwer to the moſt friendly expreſſions with which the brilliant dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was accompanied.</p>
               <p>It is an old ſaying, and a pretty true one, that a man ſincerely in love is very apt to look like a fool in the preſence of his miſtreſs. It is not quite clear that Julio's appearance would have been ſilly before a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to whom he might have had, as he thought, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without being guilty of impertinence or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; but Olivetta's ſuperiority operated upon him in ſuch a manner, that all the encouragement ſhe gave him to diſcloſe his tender ſenſations, was inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to remove the obſtructions which delicacy threw
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032707_0036_0FF42BB442B2E718"/>
in his way. After much heſitation, and many ſtrong marks of irreſolution in his whole behavior, he murmured out ſomething very grateful, but very aukwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and retired.</p>
               <p>It is not eaſy to deſcribe what Olivetta ſuffered, when her timid lover had taken his leave. Ordering her attendant to withdraw, ſhe thus unboſomed herſelf to her faithful companion,</p>
               <p>"The behavior of this amiable man, my dear Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſca, is not to be endured. I have gone as far as I can with propriety, to make him ſee that his addreſſes to me would be favorably received; but to no purpoſe. You are continually aſſuring me, that he loves me as much as I love him. Would he not then, encouraged as he has been, make a declaration? Beſides, how can you reconcile his intended departure from this place for ever—theſe were his words, Franciſca, with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of his attachment to me?"</p>
               <p>"The violence of his attachment, replied Franciſca ſmiling, is the cauſe of his departure. If he was quite indifferent about you, he would not, I imagine, have thought of it. His diffidence, his delicacy—call it what you will, prevents him from revealing the ſecret he longs to diſcover, (you cannot yourſelf long more to have the diſcloſure of it;)—and he is therefore reſolved to fly from a ſpot which is become ſo diſtreſſing to him."</p>
               <p>"You are right, I believe, my dear; but what can I do? how can I act? I cannot ſay directly to him, "I love!" and he will not, you perceive, give me a decent opportunity to tell him ſo."</p>

               <p>"The unfortunate Julio, unable to expreſs his grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the terms he wiſhed, when he received the generous Olivetta's valuable preſent accompanied with aſſurances of a very flattering kind, cannot help embracing this opportunity, before his departure, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her, that her noble behavior has ſtrengthened his reſolution never to return. The recollection of her promiſed friendſhip will afford him, wherever he goes, as much conſolation as he can poſſibly enjoy, while he feels himſelf in a ſituation which forbids him to expect an alliance with the only woman in the world whom he can ever love.

               <p>The peruſal of this letter occaſioned a variety of mixed emotions in the fluttered boſom of Olivetta, but the pleaſing ones were predominant.

               <p>Having ſent it away by a truſty and active meſſenger, ſhe waited for his coming back with a reſtleſſneſs much more eaſily to be conceived than communicated.</p>
               <p>The meſſenger, hearing that Julio had ſet out from his appartment ſome hours before his arrival, made all the enquiries in his power concerning the road he had taken; but, not being able to gain the leaſt intelligence about it, returned with his diſpatches.</p>
               <p>Olivetta, on the return of her domeſtic, was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly diſappointed, diſcontented, and diſtreſſed; and while ſhe regretted the loſs of the only man who had kindled the flame of love, in her breaſt, reproached her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeverely for that refinement which, by driving him into exile, had deprived her of the exquiſite pleaſure ſhe had promiſed herſelf from the contents of her anſwer to his deſponding epiſtle.</p>

moment he ſaw her, he advanced with an uncommon agility towards her; perceiving on a nearer approach, that ſhe looked like the picture of death, he ſtarted, and could hardly believe his eyes.</p>
               <p>Olivetta, while her lover was advancing to her, had fainted away in the arms of her attendants. As ſoon as ſhe recovered, he inquired with the greateſt anxiety into the cauſe of the melancholy alteration in her looks. On her acquainting him with her ſufferings on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and with her conventual intentions, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of them, he rapturouſly told her that it was in his power, by the deceaſe of an opulent relation, to reinſtate her in her former ſtile of life; and that, if ſhe would conſent to ſhare his unexpected acquiſition with him, he ſhould deem himſelf the happieſt being in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>Olivetta was charmed with a behavior which left her no room to queſtion the ſincerity of her Julio's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to her; but threw out a few difficulties, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

youth, ever ſuſceptible of the fineſt emotions of love. Among the reſt of her admirers, Strato and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes were ſo happy as to obtain peculiar marks of diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Strato had all the recommendations which wealth and power can beſtow, &amp; to do him juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtitute of perſonal merit. The only objection, which could with the appearance of reaſon be made to him, was, that he was conſiderably advanced beyond that period which is called the flower of youth; an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which commonly has great weight in a female heart.</p>
               <p>Calliſthenes yielded to Strato in fortune, intereſt, and family: but his perſon was more engaging, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more polite, and his acquirements more agreeable. There was a peculiar modeſty in his addreſs, which probably might be encreaſed by a conſciouſneſs of the ſmallneſs of his fortune: but this circumſtance tended to promote his intereſt; for however it depreſſed his ſpirit, it taught him that ſubmiſſive ſoftneſs, which makes him appear amiable in the eyes of Ariſtoclea.</p>
               <p>Strato, it muſt be confeſſed, was the more ardent lover, and his paſſion had been enflamed by an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſight of his fair charmer while ſhe was bathing, one ſummer morning, in a little rivulet that glided thro her father's garden.</p>
               <p>Calliſthenes, perhaps in reality, felt as ſtrong a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as his rival, yet was he leſs aſſiduous in his addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, from deſpair of ſucceeding againſt a competitor ſo much his ſuperior in rank and fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:032707_0041_0FF42A13EE852248"/>Theophanes, the father of Ariſtoclea, was much embarraſſed by the importunities of the two lovers, but would gladly have given his conſent to him whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions were the largeſt, had he not been cautious of interfering in the choice of his daughter. After many delays, it was at laſt agreed, on all ſides, to refer the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to a neighbor of great wiſdom and experience, by whoſe deciſion it was reſolved to abide.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Strato was informed by a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Ariſtoclea, whom he had bribed with liberal preſents, that he poſſeſſed the firſt place in the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his miſtreſs. Animated with this intelligence, he determined to break off the agreement of referring the affair to a ſtranger, and to leave it to be decided by the moſt proper judge, Ariſtoclea herſelf. Calliſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes readily acceded to the propoſal, from a conviction, that if he ſtood any chance; it could be only from the deciſion of the fair object of his love. The father, who had previouſly been aſſured by Strato, that his daughter had ſhown him a preference, entered without heſitation into the agreement, and appointed an early day for the final determination.</p>
               <p>During this uneaſy interval, various were the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the two lovers. Strato already anticipated his happineſs, and wantoned in imagination on all the charms of his miſtreſs. Calliſthenes, on the contrary felt all the pain and anguiſh of ſuſpended hope.</p>
               <p>At length, the important hour arrived. Strato ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to hear his doom with a ſmile of confidence; Calliſthenes in all the dejection of deſpair. How ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032707_0042_0FF432CE07C06000"/>
were their ſeveral emotions exchanged, when the lovely fair one declared in favor of the deſponding Calliſthenes! Strato, however, after many efforts, got the better of his amazement and chagrin, aſſumed an air of chearfulneſs, and beſought the happy pair to grant him one requeſt, which was to permit him to be preſent at the nuptial ceremony. A requeſt ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, none could deny; and amidſt the congratulations of the whole company, the next day was fixed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting the union.</p>

               <p>AS Omar of Baſra was one day wandering along the ſtreets of Bagdat, muſing on the varieties of merchandiſe which the ſhops offered to his view, and obſerving the different occupations which buſied the multitudes on every ſide, he was awakened from the tranquility of meditation, by a croud that obſtructed the paſſage. He raiſed his eyes and ſaw the chief Viſier, who had returned from the Divan, and was entering his palace.</p>
               <p>Omar mingled with the attendants, and being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſome petition for the Viſier, was permitted to enter. He ſurveyed the ſpaciouſneſs of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, admired the walls hung with golden tapeſtry, and the floors covered with ſilken carpets, and deſpiſed the ſimple neatneſs of his own little habitation. Surely, ſaid he to himſelf, this palace is the ſeat of happineſs, where pleaſure ſucceeds to pleaſure, and diſcontent and ſorrow can have no admiſſion.

What can mortal wiſh or imagine which the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this palace has not obtained? The diſhes of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury cover his table, the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and ſleeps upon the downs of the cygnets of the Gange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>How different, Omar, is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torments of unſatisfied deſire, and who has no amuſement in thy power that can withold thee from thy own conviction. They tell thee that thou art wiſe, but what does wiſdom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wiſe have very little power of flattering themſelves. That man, is ſurely the moſt wretched of the ſons of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by praiſe and veneration.

               <p>Full of his new reſolution, he ſhuts himſelf in his chamber for ſix months, to deliberate how he ſhould grow rich; he ſometimes propoſes to offer himſelf as a counſellor to one of the kings of India, and ſometimes reſolves to dig for diamonds in the mines of Colconda. One day, after ſome hours paſſed in violent fluctuation of opinion, ſleep inſenſibly ſeized him in his chair.

the noiſe of thunder, and ſcattering its foam on the impending woods. Now, ſaid his father, look upon the valley that lies between the hills.

Tell me now, ſaid his father, doſt thou wiſh for ſudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent, or for a ſlow and gradual increaſe, reſembling the rill gliding from the well?

But, following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the ſupply, ſlow and conſtant, kept always full. He waked, and determined to grow rich by ſilent profits and perſevering induſtry.</p>
               <p>Having ſold his patrimony, he engaged in merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and in twenty years purchaſed lands on which he raiſed a houſe, equal in ſumptuouſneſs to that of the Viſier's, to which he invited all the miniſters of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity he had imagined riches able to afford. Leiſure ſoon made him weary of himſelf, and he longed to be perſuaded that he was great and happy. He was courteous and liberal, he gave all that approached him hopes of pleaſing him, &amp; all who ſhould pleaſe him hopes of being rewarded. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery act of praiſe was tried, and every ſource of adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fiction was exhauſted. Omar heard his flatteries without delight, becauſe he found himſelf unable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. His own heart told him his frailties. His own underſtanding reproached him with his faults.

               <p>ADELA was the only daughter of a powerful baron of Aquitaine. Her father ſprung from an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious family, and added to hereditary honors, the glory of heroic atchievements. In his youth, he accompan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied the flower of the European chivalry, who fought under the banner of Godfrey, and recovered the holy ſepulchre from the hands of the infidel. He returned to his country, crowned with victory, and fair renown; and inherited the rich domains of his anceſtors. Adela was in the prime of beauty, and poſſeſſed a ſuſceptible heart. In her air and aſpect, dignity was mingled with ſweetneſs: for in the diſpoſition of her mind, conſcious elevation of ſentiment was ſoftened by amiable and mild affections.</p>
               <p>Edwin, a gallant youth, animated with the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love of arms, ſmit with the renown of Albert's proweſs, and ambitious of profiting by the narrative of his exploits, repaired with other warriors to his hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caſtle. His eye; keen and piercing, indicated a fiery, vigorous, and active ſpirit. His form was well fitted to kindle deſire in the boſom of tender maids: and the heart of Adela was not inſenſible to his merit.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032707_0047_0FF4328BBA09A698"/>
Their paſſion was mutual. He gazed on her unaffected charms with aſtoniſhment; for, till then, he had never felt the tender anxiety, the reſtleſs longing and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of love. Ambition had been the governing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſoul: but the fierceneſs of ambition now yielded to a ſofter, tho no leſs ardent deſire. He no longer diſcourſed in keen rapture of marſhalled hoſts, of liſted fields, and feats of venturous men; but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed on the ineffable attractions of a roſeate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and tender melting eye. The vehement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of the warrior was loſt in the complacency and penſiven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"And who art thou, ſaid the haughty baron, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeſt to the love of Adela? What feats of heroic proweſs haſt thou atchieved? Or is thy anceſtry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed among the chieftains of the ſouth?

Degenerated as thou art, the meanneſs of thy ſentiments ſhall not fully the ſplendor of thine anceſtry, nor load my reſpectful age with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor. Receive the addreſſes of Edgar with ſuitable regard, and the deference due to my commands. Mean time preparations ſhall be made for the bridal ſolemnity in a manner becoming the dignity of this alliance."</p>
               <p>Adela, after remonſtrating in vain againſt the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his commands, intreated, with an humble and dejected air, that the marriage ceremony might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed. "Can Edgar, ſaid ſhe, prize the cold and eon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained embraces of a heart that throbs for another? Will the ſighing and anguiſh of a broken ſpirit accord with the fond careſſes of a bridegroom? To Edwin my faith was plighted, and on him my imagination hath dwelt. Give me time, therefore, to divert the current of an affection too violent to be ſuddenly oppoſed; to diſcourage the reveries of fancy, animated by a legal and habituated paſſion; and to reconcile myſelf to the

addreſſes of Edgar." As her reaſoning was plauſible, the nuptial ſolemnity was deferred. But, as ſoon as ſhe had retired from her father's preſence, ſhe ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a page in whom ſhe confided, and ſpoke to him in the following manner: "Prepare thee for a long journ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey: ſaddle the ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The menial bowed with humble obeiſance, and, with profeſſions of diligence and fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, departed.</p>
               <p>Mean time Edgar preſſed his ſuit with courteous phraſe and dalliance. Daily tournaments were exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited at the caſtle of Albert. The knights and barons of the neighboring domains attended: but Edgar ſurpaſſed them in the ſplendor of his armor, and the pomp of his retinue. The hall reſounded with revelry and rejoicing; and minſtrels, clad in gaudy apparel, celebrated the praiſes of warlike chiefs, or ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Peace! peace! interrupted Adela, with a faultering utterance and looks of aſtoniſhment mixed with anger, reſtrain thy blaſphemous ſpeech, nor with baſe calumny aſperſe the fame of a true and gallant warrior."

"Rehearſe them unreſervedly, cried Adela, with a tone of anxious impatience."</p>

               <p>The heart of Adela throbbed with anguiſh during the recital. "Valorous, heroic warrior! ſhe exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are theſe thy deeds of hardy proweſs, to betray the innocent credulity of an eaſy maid?

               <p>Edgar now advanced his ſuit with redoubled ardor.

The caſtle reſounded with minſtrelſy, and the dance; when a ſtranger, in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple garb of a pilgrim, entered the hall.

He was received with hoſpitable welcome, and the reverence due to his holy ſemblance. He ſpake in meek and modeſt guiſe; his eyes were often fixed on Adela; they were ſometimes dimmed with a gliſtening tear; and ever and anon his boſom heaved with involuntary ſighs. He took the harp of a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrel; he touched the ſtrings with maſterly cunning and accompanied the notes with a melodious voice. Tuneful, but melancholy was the ſtrain: for he ſung the ſorrows of thoſe that are forſaken; the anguiſh of a deſponding ſpirit; and the wounds inflicted on a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, by inconſtancy and proud diſdain. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, with marks of grief and inward contention. "Holy pilgrim, ſaid Albert, the ſenſe of calamnity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thy ſpirit.

of a gentle dame, the only daughter of a noble baron. My ſincere, tho preſumptuous ſuit, ſeemed not diſpleaſing to that peerleſs beauty; and with the raſh, intemperate boldneſs of a lover, I aſked her in marriage of her ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, not without a tender interchange of vows and tokens of affection with the beloved idol of my heart. I haſtened to the plains of Catalonia, where the Saracen was waging fierce battles againſt the banner of the holy croſs. I proffered my ſervice to the chief of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and that my ſword was not idle, and that I was not, backward in the ſtrife of arms, my honorable wounds can teſtify. Neither were my ſervices, nor my thirſt after martial fame unrewarded.

Rejoicing in my ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I haſtened my return. But what power of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can expreſs the agony of my ſoul, when I learned that the faithleſs and inconſtant fair had yielded to the vows of another? I who was ſo true and loyal to my love and plighted truth, to be ſo ſoon forgotten, ſo ſoon forſaken!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough, cried Adela, O ill requited lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! pierce not my ſoul with deeper wounds. O Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win! Edwin! never was I inconſtant. Bear witneſs, ye holy angels! but traiterous guile hath been practiſed: thy integrity hath been impeached, and my vexed heart betrayed into error."</p>
               <p>The eyes of all were now turned on the ſtranger:
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032707_0055_0FF432E7EF2BF550"/>
he threw off his diſguiſe, and, inſtead of a pilgrim's ſtaff, he graſped a keen and trenchant weapon. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment glowed in his cheeks, and flaſhed from his fiery eyes. "And who, ſaid he, hath impeached mine integrity? Stand forth, thou proud, but daſtard ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, whoſe gloſſing tales have betrayed the unwary heart of a maiden: it is Edwin demands reparation." Conſcious fear was manifeſt in the diſordered features, the pale cheek, and diſconcerted air of Edgar. He nevertheleſs accepted the challenge: and the warriors, arraying themſelves in complete armor, deſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the court of the caſtle. In the firſt onſet, the well tempered ſteel of Edwin cleft the creſted helm of his adverſary; he threw him to the ground, and diſarmed him. "Confeſs thy guilt, ſaid the conqueror, and by what infamous arts thou haſt accompliſhed the deſign."—By gifts and glittering gold he replied, I cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the page of Adela, who with counterfeited ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of fidelity and regret, accuſed thee of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and impoſed falſehood on the ear of his miſtreſs. I embraced the ſeaſon of her excited reſentment, and forwarded my ſuit with ſucceſs. She is mine by the indiſſoluble ties of wedlock: and know, proud boy that, if thy hands be ſtained with my blood, it is the blood of Adela's huſband; and if ſhe receives thee to her boſom, ſhe receives the ſlayer of her ſpouſe."</p>
               <p>Edwin ſtarted with apparent horror. He pauſed; but recollecting himſelf, "ariſe he cried, and by anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er trial, prove thyſelf worthy of that envied title." So

ſaying, he raiſed him from the ground, and both war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors addreſſed themſelves a ſecond time to the fight. Edgar, burning with exaſperated rancor, aimed his ſpear at his rival's breaſt. Edwin neither averted nor avoided the deadly blow. The keen weapon cleft his breaſt, and was tinged in the purple ſprings of his heart. He fell to the ground. "Farewell, he cried, Adela! lady peerleſs! and dearly beloved. I have proved myſelf worthy of thy eſteem: I die a ſacrifice to thy repoſe. With my hands red with thy huſband's blood, could I ever aſpire to thy love? Could I ſurvive and behold thee wedded bride of another?" He heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſigh, and died. "Inhuman deed! cried Adela, tearing her lovely treſſes, and beating her ſnow white breaſt: ſhe ran, ſhe threw herſelf on the lifeleſs body. O ſtay! ſhe exclaimed, O leave me not in my woe! Return, fleeting ſpirit! reanimate theſe pallid features. He heeds me not.—I heard a voice! a dreary voice! it was Edwin! he ſummons me away!—I come! I come! Let the nuptial bed be prepared! The clay cold bed?"—So ſaying, ſhe claſped the corps, and expired.</p>
               <p>Inſtantly the page, who had been corrupted by Edger, ſeizing a daggar, ruſhed behind that teacherous baron, and pierced him to the heart. "Periſh! he cried, author of my ruin, and of the ruin of the Houſe of Albert." He grew immediately frantic: he ran forth furious and ſcreaming: the memory of his crimes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him, and his reaſon was never reſtored.</p>
               <p>The obſequies of the deceaſed were celebrated with due ſolemnity: holy requiems; and pious prieſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

oriſons for their eternal repoſe. Albert, unable to ſuſtain the weight of his misfortune, forſook the habitation of his anceſtors; and expoſing his old age to the fatigues of a pilgrimage, he ſought the holy land, and there paſſed the remnant of his days in a monaſtry.</p>

The perfections of her mind and perſon being improved to his wiſh, ſhe was no ſooner arrived at a proper age, than he ſet out with her towards Conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inople. In their journey meeting with a company of <hi>Polanders,</hi> he was in great danger of loſing his prize, and the innocence of the beautiful <hi>Selima</hi> had certainly been the prey of the ſavage hand, had not <hi>Mirzim,</hi> a great favorite of the Sultan, happened to come that way with a numerous retinue, and put the raviſhers to flight.</p>
               <p>The deliverer and the delivered were in the ſame inſtant inſpired with a mutual paſſion for each other;

but Mirzim, underſtanding Oſman's deſign, made no public ſhow of his affection; and Selima as carefully concealed her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus they continued giving and receiving all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The cruel ſeperation muſt be now endured, not all his love could render Mirzim neglectful of the duty be owed to his imperial maſter, his country, and his honor; and Selima had too true ſenſe of the latter to delay his haſtening where glory called. He took his leave, and ſhe was now obliged to acknowledge herſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, leſt a real phyſician ſhould diſcover ſhe had but counterfeited indiſpoſition. Oſman proſecuted his journey, and in a ſhort time reached Conſtantinople; where, he agreed with the <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

weeps: ſhe intreats Oſman to change his reſolution, and at laſt reveals the ſecret of her love for Mirzim; but all is now too late, the compact is made and ſhe muſt by force ſubmit.</p>
               <p>Mirzim returned from his expedition the ſame day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in a condition far different from what he had hoped at his embarking in it: he had flattered himſelf with being able to do things which might enable him to beg the charming Selima of the Sultan as a reward of his ſervices; but inſtead of laurels, he was covered with confuſion; all his deſigns had proved unſucceſsful; <hi>Buda</hi> was taken before his face, and he was obliged to acertificate from the ſubaltern officers to clear his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the Sultan. If any ſhadow of comfort appeared to him, it was in the friendſhip of the <hi>Kiſler Aga,</hi> who promiſed him to conceal the beauty of Selima as much as poſſible from the Sultan's knowledge; but tho this eunuch kept his word inviolably a new and undreamed of misfortune befel their loves. Zara, a creature of Prince Muſtapha, the brother of the Sultan, no ſooner beheld this lovely maid, than ſhe began to caſt about in her mind how to procure her for him, and ſoon after intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to her apartment: he was immediately e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amored of her beauty, but her behavior gave him equal deſpair. Mirzim being informed of this viſit, and the effects of it, writes a letter to a friend complaining of the ſeverity of his face in raiſing him a new rival. The <hi>Kiſler Aga</hi> had the charge of delivering it but being called away on ſome important buſineſs, entruſts it to a ſlave, who gives it into Zara's hand, ſhe communicates
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032707_0060_0FF42AA917B152A8"/>
it to Prince Muſtapha, who, ignorant of the character, and no name being ſubſcribed, is fired with extreme impatience to diſcover this happy favorite. At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Achmet and Ibrahim, two diſcontented courtiers, enter his apartment; to them he relates the ſtory of his love and jealouſy, and is by them informed, the letter which gave him ſo much pain, was the Viſir's hand; and they take this opportunity of perſuading him to appear at the head of a party already formed for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throning the Sultan; this they aſſure him is the only means by which he can attain the enjoyment of his miſtreſs, or the deſtruction of his rival.</p>
               <p>How great ſoever the weight of theſe reaſons were to him as a lover, thoſe of nature and of duty had not leſs efficacy; he could not preſently be brought to take up arms againſt his ſovreign and brother, nor yet could he think of ſeeing his adored Selima torn from him; he therefore deſires time for conſideration &amp; in this tempeſt of his ſoul, the <hi>Kiſler Aga</hi> having found the miſcarriage of the letter, and judging into whoſe hands it was fallen, makes him an offer of his ſervice, and ſo artfully gains the belief and confidence of this unſuſpecting prince, that he prevails with him to give him the letter on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of confronting Mirzim, and obliging him by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces to deſiſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Achmet and Ibrahim, having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the only way to bring Muſtapha into their plot, is the immediate danger of loſing Selima, ſecretly inform the Sultan how beautiful a creature is in the <hi>Kiſler Aga's</hi> poſſeſſion; on which the impatient monarch

commands ſhe ſhall be brought inſtantly to his preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſoon as ſhe appeared, her charms had their ordinary effect, the Sultan's heart yielded to a paſſion not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that ſhe had inſpired in his brother or the Viſir; and finding her wit and virtue as matchleſs as her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he reſolves to make her Empreſs, and defer the gratification of his love till the celebration of thoſe rites, which ſhould yield her to him without a bluſh.</p>
               <p>All the ſcruples which had hitherto ſubdued the dictates of ambition in Muſtapha, were now ſilenced by the calls of a more powerful paſſion: he enters into the meaſures Achmet and Ibrahim had propoſed, and perceives they had already carried things to ſuch a height, that there wanted little more than his conſent to pluck his brother from the throne; the Viſir's well known loyalty was the only impediment he had to ſtruggle with; it was therefore neceſſary to begin with his deſtruction, and chance ſoon furniſhed means.</p>
               <p>That deſpairing lover had prevailed with the <hi>Kiſler Aga</hi> to admit him in a diſguiſe to take a laſt farewell of his dear Selima, and the contrivance by which he was to be introduced being overheard by Achmet, he that moment diſpatches Ibrahim to the Sultan to acquaint him with it; who going in perſon to the apartment of Selima finds Mirzim with her. All denials of their mutual paſſion would be now in vain; they boldly own it, and the Viſir is ordered to immediate death.

               <head>THE <hi>WEASLES</hi> AND THE <hi>FERRETS.</hi> AN OCCASIONAL FABLE.</head>
               <p>IN ancient days, before man extended his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the extremeſt limits of the earth, there was an iſland in the Northern Seas, inhabited only by the different ſpecies of the quadruped kingdom; who, for a time, having no general ruler or maſter, lived in perfect caſe and happineſs. Tranquil ſtates, however, never are of long duration; the want of one general lord made them ſoon begin to lord it ever one another, and the Ferrets, a knaviſh and cunning, as well as extremely ambitious, tho weak people, look it into their heads to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an univerſal monarchy, of which their king ſhould always be at head.</p>
               <p>Slavery is a contagious evil; the king of the Ferrets had found means to make himſelf an abſolute and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic tyrant over them, and the ſubjects ſeemed intent on nothing ſo much as reducing the whole iſland, which was to them a world, into the ſame abject ſtate with themſelves. Their tyran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> had taught them to think his grandeur their greateſt glory. This ſeemed a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd doctrine in the firſt age, when it was advanced; but as all opinions mellow by uſe, and the moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things become familiar by habit, the favorite opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the court had been handed down from father to ſon, till in a few reigns it became as abſurd to diſpute, as it had at firſt been to believe it. In this ſtate were
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032707_0064_0FF4331A487279C0"/>
things in our iſland, when the king of the Ferrets, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning his people about him, addreſſed them in theſe words: You ſee, my ſubjects, we live among a great number of different ſtates, each of which has its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar king, but there is yet no monarch of the whole. Is it not your intereſt and glory, that I ſhould become that king, and you the ſubjects of that monarch, who will then be maſter of the world. If this appears plain to you, the means are eaſy; force can command the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The ſtronger muſt be attacked by treachery, and the moſt powerful and obſtinate of all will be overcome with gold. Be you unanimous, I will make you great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Before this is ſuſpected abroad, let all our ſchemes be ſettled; let ſome Ferrets of diſtinguiſhed addreſs and abilities immediately depart for the courts of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nations; of theſe, let ſome be ſupported in figure and equipage, to converſe with the great in public, and others enter as menial ſervants, to pry into their ſecrets at home; let theſe all foment whatever broils or inteſtine diviſions they find, for they who quarrel with one another half conquer themſelves, and ſave an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the greateſt part of his expence and trouble; let thoſe who reſide at the <hi>Weaſel</hi> court be rich, to bribe at all things; and thoſe at the <hi>Polecats</hi> be cunning, to ſwear or forſwear all things; theſe laſt, we may uſe as friends a while, and, when by their means we have conquered the reſt, they fall of courſe, and thus in a few years the world is ours. But in the whole attempt be this the great leſſon, the greater the ſupplies the ſooner the great work is finiſhed; therefore, come every Ferret

Thus, continued the monarch, I have reaſoned with you like friends; now, as your king, you know my will, and I command you all to execute it.</p>
               <p>As the fire eyed tyrant ended his ſpeech, he ſtalked away in a majeſtic manner, attended by his courtiers: great murmurs were raiſed among the people; many ſcrupled to give in their money, more to expoſe their lives, and ſome to murder innocent people, who had done them no injury, only at his command; but they had made a tyrant, and they found they muſt obey him. The Ferrets of broken fortunes entered readily to mend them, and thoſe in better circumſtances, becauſe they could not help it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, all entered. The whole country inhabited by theſe animals was ſtripped of its inhabitants, and the tyrant ſaw himſelf at the head of a very numerous and powerful army. With his bribes and emiſſaries at the ſtronger courts, and this army at his heels, he marched againſt the weaker provinces; he flattered himſelf every thing was in his power, all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but that of conqueſt was neglected, and all thoughts but that of victory at once deſerted the ſouls of prince and people. The inhabitants of this iſland were all of the ſmaller kind of animals, ſo that they had no deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032707_0066_0FF42AB23744DD60"/>
of their own kind to fear; the lion, the leopard, and the wolf were not known there: only a creature of another kind ſwept them off with a very fatal havoc; this was a monſtrous ſerpent known among them by a name which in their language ſignified death. He was cunning enough to way lay them in a thouſand dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners, and their only defence againſt him was by means of water, for he hated ſwimming, ſo that, while he was kept off from them by trenches filled with water, he only now and then came over and ſnapped them up one by one, as his natural hunger required; but, if this defence was away at any time, he devoured them by millions. Every province therefore allotted a great number of its inhabitants to work high up in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, at the ſources of rivers and brooks, to turn their currents in, and give annually a freſh ſupply of this their liquid wall; this was a neceſſary ſervice, and on the labor of theſe the lives of all depended. The Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret king however, inflamed with the luſt of univerſal tyranny, ſpared not even his ſubjects, who were thus employed, but commanded all into his army; in vain was it repreſented to him, that, when the firſt or ſecond year was out, he would have no water, and that by that time his neighbors would be all too much his enemies to ſupply him; he arrogantly anſwered fear not that, they ſhall by that time be all my ſlaves and then we cannot want what they are poſſeſſed of.</p>
               <p>Full of this tyrannic ſpirit, he now conſidered where firſt to bend his murdering courſe. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Mice,</hi> whoſe provinces lay very diſtant from

His army was too numerous to be reſiſted in the field, and his gold too heavy not to weigh down all arguments in the cabinet; in ſhort, he was conquering ſome provinces and buying others, while the adjoining kingdoms, yet unhurt, ſaw wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>One of the neighbor kingdoms was that of the <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;</hi> theſe were a race of animals happy in a robuſt habit of body; and penetrating turn of mind, and formed at once for the field and council. The great were bred up in all the pomp of knowledge, the lower claſs in honeſt induſtry; and all the generous principles of courage nurſed by freedom. This happy nation had a king like the reſt, but that king was bound to rule them juſtly, and acted only according to laws themſelves had made; ſo that they had all the benefits of a regal government without the oppreſſion, and their ſovereign all the joys of power without its crimes. Great ſouls are formed by generous examples, and every king of this communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had all the virtues of the ſubject, while every ſubject had all the honor of a king. The Weaſels, alarmed at
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032707_0068_0FF4331F2DD44108"/>
the progreſs of the Ferrets arts and arms, addreſſed their king, who rejoiced to be reminded of his duty to the world by his ſubjects; and anſwered their remonſtrance in the following words:</p>
               <p>"My faithful people, we are a nation born to the inheritance of virtuous liberty, and as we know the worth of that invaluable bleſſing, it is our duty not only to preſerve it for ever among ourſelves, but to propogate it as far as the world's utmoſt limits among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Ours is a land of freedom, and him, whom his own wiſhes arm not in ſuch a cauſe, we know no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to force; let him enjoy his infamy, and we our hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. The deſigns of our ambitious neighbor yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affect not us, but we live not ſolely for ourſelves: the gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous virtue of the free ſoul knows the whole world for its home, and every creature for its brother. Let us with this view arm to check the devaſtations of his forces; and, could we be too cold to ſtir in ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cauſe, even our own intereſt will engage us to the war, ſince what he now beſtows on others will hereafter be our own fate; he aims at univerſal power, and has entered into an union with our ſworn enemies, the <hi>Polecats,</hi> hoping by their means to conquer us; and laſtly, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves. Theſe are his views, and it is both our duty and our intereſt to diſappoint them. To this purpoſe let us march an army againſt him in the field, but let us not, like him, depopulate our kingdom to do it: no let us leave enough here to manage the great buſineſs of the floods againſt our general deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that thoſe who remain at home may be ſecured from

periſhing; but, as our numbers thus may be too ſmall, let us by ſolomn embaſſy invite our neighbor powers to join with us, and, in the place of theſe we leave at home, hire with our money ſtrangers from provinces too much peopled; who may thence be ſpared, and do their country as much ſervice by their abſence as ours do by their reſiding in it." The whole nation of the Weaſels applauded to the clouds, the wiſdom of their ſovereign; and an army was ſoon formed on this pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Theſe met the great power of the Ferret tyrant, while others were engaged in different places with his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. He ſtirred up private diſſentions where he could not come or ſend his troops in perſon; and even ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his beſt friends of all their poſſeſſions, under the ſpecious pretence of keeping them for them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them from falling into the hands of his, and, as he choſe to expreſs it, their enemies. Thus the whole iſland, before ſo peaceable and happy, was by the ambitious views of one prince turned into a ſcene of blood and murther.</p>
               <p>Battles were fought with various ſucceſs in different places, but the reſiſtleſs numbers of the main body of the Ferret army made it every where too ſucceſsful, and victories and conquered provinces crowned all its attempts. The iſland was alarmed with the impending danger, when the illconſtructed fabrick began to ſink by its own weight. The armies of the Weaſels and their friends though they could not prevent, had greatly ſtopped the rapid progreſs of the Ferrets, and as theſe could be ſupported without injuring their country, being raiſed on judicous plans,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032707_0070_0FF43322324D6160"/>
ſo the Ferret army, gathered in haſte, and managed without true prudence, now found itſelf periſhing with its country, and ſoon fell into deſpair amidſt its glorious conqueſts.</p>
               <p>The ſupplies of water failed, the trenches became dry, and the grand deſtroyer, the Serpent, marched in horrid pomp with all his retinue over them, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands fell before him every day. The tyrant now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his army periſhing, before his work was yet half done: he knew there was no way to ſave them, but by the relief and aſſiſtance of thoſe he was now at war with, and he therefore humbly ſued for peace.</p>
               <p>The Weaſels, who had armed only for the ſake of peace, which they wiſhed to give to the whole earth, readily conſented, and to encourage the new humbled tyrant to better behaviour for the future, gave it on eaſy terms. His ſubtle heart, however, was not to be won by good; he had a deeply deſtructive plan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, while all was open and free on the Weaſels ſide. Both agreed to ſend off their armies to different quarters, and, as ſoon as articles of peace were agreed on, the generous Weaſels ſtopped the rage of death among their late enemies, by throwing water from their own rivers into their trenches. The Serpent was now driven off again, and no hoſtilities were thought of againſt the Ferrets, when a thouſand ſcenes of rapine and murther were at once let looſe upon the Weaſels, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious enemy; when this was complained of, the double dealing tyrant delared his ſubjects had not done this,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032707_0071_0FF42A84A9F72618"/>
but that it was the <hi>Polecat</hi> nation who had been guilty of it, and with whom the Weaſels had no diſpute.</p>
               <p>The Weaſel monarch received the lying anſwer as he ought; Aſk your perfidious king, ſaid he, to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, whether he thinks Weaſels have not eyes to diſtinguiſh black from white, and tell him withal, his actions and thoſe of his ſubjects ſtink to the whole world, though their carcaſes do not; and they ſhall be revenged. Let him beware: he has begun his treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery too early, &amp; will find by the event, that the ſtings of his perfidy will return with tenfold violence on the head of him who is guilty of it. He diſmiſſed him with theſe words, when an old and ſage Weaſel, well known to his country by his ſervices, aroſe and addreſſed his ſovreign in theſe words:</p>
               <p>"What I have to offer ſeems but the tenour, of your majeſty's own thoughts; let us now puniſh this breaker of treaties as we ought; he ſoon muſt bend to us again, and let us then make him feel the weight of his laſt crime. The ſupply we have given him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him and his people from the common death, that elſe muſt have devoured them by this time, was but ſmall in compariſon of the occaſion, and will be ſoon exhauſted; though we ſent, him rivers of water, the earth by its trenches, long parched with drought, will ſuck it all up in a few days; he then muſt apply and ſue to us again: but, O my ſovereign! let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat that he may then ſue in vain; let him feel the ſharpneſs of the Serpent's ſting ſome days, and let us then impoſe new conditions of the peace on him, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032707_0072_0FF43324615A3158"/>
make him agree to ſuch as will diſable him from diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world again."</p>
               <p>This juſt advice was followed; a few years brought the haughty victor again to be a ſupplicant; death raged among his ſubjects with an uncontrolled ſway, and ſwept them daily in ſuch numbers from his ſide, that he was forced to yield to ſuch conditions as made the whole iſland afterwards happy for many ages.</p>

ſtile themſelves, "<hi>the better ſort.</hi>" An example of this kind it pourtrayed in the following fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florimore</hi> and <hi>Leontine</hi> were the only ſons of two gentlemen, whoſe eſtates were contiguous, and who reſided in a town ſituate in the weſtern part of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts. In the innocent amuſement of childhood, they were conſtant partners; through the playful ſcenes of youth, they walk'd hand in hand. They were inſtructed by the ſame preceptor; taſted the ſweets of ſcience from the ſame cup, and the ſame college wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the progreſſive improvment of two minds, which bid fair, in their expanſion, to enlighten and bleſs ſociety.</p>
               <p>Having completed their collegiate education, they retired to ſpend a few months in their native town, and to enjoy the company of thoſe whoſe paternal fondneſs had enabled them to tread the paths of knowledge with honor; and whoſe attention to the improvement of their underſtandings, in the days of youth, had aſſiſted them to gain the applauſe of the learned world.</p>
               <p>The time at length arrives when they muſt part.— It was the wiſh of <hi>Florimore's</hi> father that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote his talents to the miniſtry of the goſpel of peace— with that wiſh the willing ſon coincided.—<hi>Leontine's</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition led him to the ſtudy of phyſic.—They part, in purſuit of their different callings.—No vows were neceſſary to cement and perpetuate the friendſhip— an intimacy for years had formed an union, which noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but death could diſſolve.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florimore,</hi> had completed his ſtudies, and was inducted into the paſtoral office, to take charge of a flock, who
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032707_0074_0FF43328AE687E40"/>
delighted in his miniſtry, and who were enraptured with the propriety and amiableneſs of his conduct in the private walks of life—indeed, his heart was the receptacle of every finer feeling; the ſigh of ſympathy ever eſcaped him, at the tale of another's woe, and the tear of pity ſtreamed from his eye, at the ſight of human miſery. But the ſigh of ſympathy, and the tear of pity, were not the only conſolations which <hi>Florimore</hi> afforded to the ſons and daughters of diſtreſs. His hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable board bid welcome to the hungry and the thirſty, and his wardrobe often furniſhed a cloak for the naked, ſhivering mendicant.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Leontine</hi> was uſhered into the notice of the world, as a Phyſician. He was ſoon celebrated for an uncommon ſhare of ſkill in his profeſſion, and for his attention and humamity to his patients. His practice became extenſive, and his proſpects were flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing. Though the love of wealth is predominant in moſt minds, <hi>Leontine</hi> ever made it ſubſervient to the calls of humanity. His attention and ſkill were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed equally with thoſe who moved in the obſcure, humble paths of life, and thoſe whoſe opulence enable them to revel in every luxury the world afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of three years attention to the duties of his calling, <hi>Florimore,</hi> was ſeized with a diſorder, which his phyſicians apprehended would prove mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. <hi>Leontine</hi> flew, on the wings of friendſhip, to the aſſiſtance of the beloved of his ſoul. His ſkilful aid, and the ſmiles of an overruling Providence, ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled

that anxiety, under which his pariſh and friends labored, leſt a bloſſom ſo uſeful ſhould be nipt in its opening. But though the reſpectable Clergyman got the better of his diſorder, it left him in a very weak and debilitated ſtate; and it was the decided opinion of the faculty, that he muſt bid adieu to the walks of a clerical life. This intelligence impreſſed the minds of the people of his charge, with the deepeſt ſorrow;— nor was <hi>Florimore</hi> unaffected on the occaſion, though he was ſenſible of the neceſſity of a compliance with the opinion of his phyſicians. He, however, collected ſufficient ſtrength and fortitude, once more to aſcend the ſacred deſk, and take an affectionate farewell of his beloved flock. Tears often choaked the paſſage of his words; while melancholy, and heartfelt grief were depicted in the countenance of his audience. After this, he quitted the place of his late reſidence, and the prayers and bleſſings of hundreds followed him to the manſion of his affectionate parent.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032707_0076_0FF4332C6116CF58"/>
To ſatisfy the demand the whole property of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate gentleman was ſold at public auction, nor did even the venerable manſion or houſehold furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remain the property of its former owner.—This event made ſo deep an impreſſion upon the aged gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's mind, that it brought on a diſeaſe, which ſoon cloſed his eyes upon all temporary objects; and he was entombed beſide the remains of a once fond partner, who had not lived to behold this melancholy reverſe of fortune.</p>
               <p>For ſoms time <hi>Florimore</hi> remained inconſolable— nor could every aſſiſtance which the genuine friendſhip of <hi>Leontine</hi> beſtowed, diſpel the gloom from his mind, or revive his depreſſed ſpirits. At length, however, calm reflection reſumed her place in his ſoul; and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſubmit with reſignation to the divine will, triumphed in his mind. "<hi>The Lord hath given</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Lord hath taken away; and bleſſed be his name.</hi>"</p>
               <p>At the preſſing ſolicitations of his friend, <hi>Florimore</hi> repaired to the hoſpitable dome of <hi>Leontine</hi>; and every hour which could be ſpared from the calls of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>Leontine</hi> devoted to ſolace the cares, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the hours of him whom his ſoul loved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Florimore's</hi> ſtate of mind, and his bodily infirmities, prevented him from taking a part in the active purſuits of life—and his friend had aſſured him that no other ſeparation than that which diſſolves all human ties, ſhould ever take place between them.—In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one of the moſt important objects of <hi>Florimore</hi> was the cultivation of the infant mind of the young ſon of

                  <hi>Leontine.</hi> And "well were all his cares repaid," by the progreſs which his pupil made in knowledge and information.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who, from their wealth and rank in life, move in what is termed a more exalted ſphere, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten neceſſitated to aſſociate, in ſome degree, with that claſs who have nothing but wealth to recommend them. It was <hi>Leontine's</hi> misfortune to be thus ſituated. At an entertainment given to the neighboring gentlemen, <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> made one of the company. He abounded in wealth but was an entire ſtranger to every finer feeling of the ſoul. The tale of diſtreſs made little or no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his mind; and the poor, tho encircled with merit and virtue, be ever treated with rudeneſs and diſdain. His rough and uncouth manners led him to expreſs his contempt of humble worth on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—He was no ſtranger to <hi>Florimore</hi>'s ſituation and circumſtances; and notwithſtanding his preſence, took occaſion to fling out the moſt bitter reflections and pointed ſarcaſms, upon dependent objects.—<hi>Leontine</hi> perceiving the drift of his obſervations, and was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to whom they pointed. His noble ſoul took fire at the affront, and he openly accuſed <hi>Veſpers</hi> not only of ill manners, but brutality. His reſentment led him further; he bid him depart from his preſence, nor ever darken again his doors with an object, that could beaſt of nothing but an human form; the world, continued he, can furniſh me if I want, with hundreds like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the world cannot give me another <hi>Florimore.</hi>

He yielded up his breath to him who gave it—and left the beſt of friends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore an irreparable loſs—When <hi>Leontine's</hi> grief had in ſome meaſure abated, he erected a monument over the remains of his friend, upon which he inſcribed the following ſhort epitaph.</p>

               <p>THERE is a particular injuſtice amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind which, tho glaring, has hitherto been unnoticed, and which ſo far from being cenſured is never thought culpable in the practices—this injuſtice is the cuſtom which people have of poſſeſſing property without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which their anceſtors have acquired by diſhoneſty; a man will readily acknowledge that his father's wealth reſulted from the oppreſſion of the unfortunate, but he will not refund a ſingle ſhilling to the lawful owners when it deſcends into his own hands;—on the contrary, tho he is convinced it is in equity the actual right of

another, he thinks he may retain it without the leaſt ſhadow of reproach, and the world is ſo extremely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite that while it perhaps excerates the memory of the firſt ſpoilor, it compliments the latter with the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unqueſtionable probity—to elucidate this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion clearly, &amp; to let my readers ſee in what manner peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould act, when they are made the heirs of ill gotten fortunes ſhall be the buſineſs of the following little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative.</p>
               <p>Sir John Wentworth was a younger brother of a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, who by the death of an uncle in Oxfordſhire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poſſeſſed of a title, but of nothing elſe; the baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, whom he ſucceeded in honor, had it in his power to bequeath every foot of his eſtate, as he thought proper, and as he never entertained any cordial affection for Sir John, he left it to a more diſtant relation. This was rather an unfortunate circumſtance for Sir John, whoſe finances were not in a very flouriſhing ſituation —however as his perſon was handſome, his addreſs el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egant, and his education finiſhed, he did not quite deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of obtaining a fortune ſomewhat ſuitable to his rank —nor was our baronet's expectations altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon—to the qualities we have already deſcribed Sir John, added a deep diſſimulation, and a faſcinating plauſibility—he knew mankind well, and was inclined upon every occaſion to profit by the weakneſs or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity of his acquaintance, nor was an opportunity long wanting to gratify his avarice—a young widow who had been left in the poſſeſſion of a large eſtate by the laſt will of a doating huſband, ſaw Sir John by accident at
<pb facs="unknown:032707_0080_0FF433322D4B46A0"/>
Bath, liked, and married him; as love is ſeldom accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by prudence, ſhe would by no means lock up her fortune from the man ſhe had honored with her perſon.—It is true ſhe had a daughter by her former huſband but what of that? She was in love with her preſent,—and we generally believe thoſe people are really worthy of our regard, whom we eagerly wiſh to deſerve it:—Beſides this, Miſs Milmour her daughter had ten thouſand pounds ſettled on her by her fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's will, which Lady Wentworth thought a very handſome proviſion; and it was ſo in reality, if her mother had not been her guardian, and this guardian's fate entirely at the diſpoſal of Sir John. It is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to dwell minutely upon particulars;—our baronet had married totally from intereſtive motives, and as we have already obſerved, he was not the moſt conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of mankind,—he was not therefore united two years to his lady till he got poſſeſſion of Miſs Milmour's fortune, and in leſs than two years after, both the moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the daughter were negligently loft at a miſerable old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

young lady home, and having in vain applied to Sir John for her fortune, endeavoured to recover it by law; but unhappily juſtice is not always ſucceſsful; the glorious uncertainty of the courts fatigued them for many years, and in the end totally deceived their expectations. This greatly cooled the affections of the young lady's friends, whoſe regard had for ſome time been gradually declining, from the unpromiſing appearance of affairs, and ſhe was at laſt induced from motives of prudence as well as tenderneſs, to throw herſelf into the arms of a worthy young fellow who had a company in a march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regiment, and to whom ſhe was rendered addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally dear, by the melancholy turn in her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
               <p>All this time it muſt be confeſſed the world made very free with Sir John Wentworth's character; they exclaimed at his inhumanity in the very moment they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his politeneſs, and tho the law had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in his favour, the deciſion by no means removed the reflections which were eternally thrown upon his character.—But though his name was frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with abhorrence, his company was never avoided; &amp; thoſe who acknowledged the cruelty of his diſpoſition, were the firſt to give him invitations, and though they could ſay nothing in favour of his principles, they were always ready to declare that he was infinitely agreeable: Death, however, did not treat him ſo polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the world did; it took him away in the midſt of all his ill-gotten wealth, without a moment of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious intimation, and an apoplexy ſnatched away at a

from their neceſſities; and as his allowance from rather a ſevere &amp; parſimonious father was pitifully ſlender he could only ſecretly grieve at the lamentable ſtate of their circumſtances.—</p>
               <p>Beſides this, a circumſtance happened while he was in Italy, which principally engroſſed his heart.—In Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna he had the misfortune of wounding a gentleman dangerouſly who groſly inſulted him, and thought it nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary to fly to a neighboring ſtate as faſt as poſſible, and to avoid the reſentment of the gentleman's numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous relatians who loudly threatened to revenge their friend, he changed his name, and lived for ſome time very privately.—Notwithſtanding this cautiouſneſs of conduct, an Engliſh family, then reſident at the place of his retreat, quickly diſcovered that they had a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman in town, and gave him an invitation ſo good naturedly importunate, that he embraced it with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of ſatisfaction, becauſe it rendered his ſafety more ſecure, and furniſhed him with an opportunity of ſpending many an hour very agreeably, which at this time hung uncommonly heavy upon his hands.—</p>

and extremely amiable in her perſon, was affable and condeſcending—ſhe did not imagine that opulence gave her any claim to extraordinary reſpect, nor did ſhe believe that a fine face could furniſh her with a juſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be arrogant—on the contrary, ſhe conſidered ſweetneſs of temper to be one of the moſt eſſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in the compoſition of the female character, and ſtrove rather to merit the good opinion of her friends, than to obtain their admiration—the charms of her perſon however, and the gentleneſs of her manner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. Harrington found great entertainment in the company of this amiable young lady, but the juſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which he felt for her merit could by no means render him unmindful to the attractions of Miſs D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Miſs Mortimer, for inſtance, was the very ſoul of cheerfulneſs, whereas a continual air of dejection ſat on the features of Miſs Daſhwood—the firſt loved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and converſation, the latter was remarkably ſilent and fond of retirement—Miſs Daſhwood however, was no way ſurpaſſed either in depth of ſenſe, or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſentiment by Miſs Mortimer—and if her fair couſin's vivacity rendered her univerſally beloved, ſhe

               <p>Juſt as Colonel Mortimer had given this reply, Miſs Daſhwood entered the room, and begging Mr. Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton would favor her with a ſhort audience, ſhe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the following manner—"I have juſt this moment been informed by Miſs Mortimer.

               <p>Theſe reflections naturally ariſe to me, from the office I have juſt been performing: paying the laſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of friendſhip to two young men, whoſe untimely death has been occaſioned by a fatal propenſity to the worſt of all vices, gaming, a vice which they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed againſt the advice of friends, the knowledge of experience, and even the conviction of their own minds.</p>
               <p>Theſe unhappy youths were the twin ſons of a gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tlemen in the weſt, whoſe name (for the ſake of the narrative) is Hargrave.

                  </gap> the virtuous, whoſe ſociety they courted, and by whom they were beloved. Their father's fortune was ſcanty, yet ſufficient to furniſh them with the means of polite education, and it was his conſtant ſtudy to inſtruct them in virtuous principles, and to teach them to ſet a value on piety as their beſt poſſeſſion, and on time, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But vain and deluſory are the hope of parents. The morning of their children's exiſtence aroſe with bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and bade fair for a day of ſerenity. Their youth
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032707_0094_0FF433475A544BA0"/>
paſſed on, and every day was remembered with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Their diſpoſitions were amiable as their perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; their ſenſibility forbade all fears of declenſion, and it was with confidence that their parents ſent them from under their inſpection, to purſue their ſtudies at a diſtant univerſity.</p>
               <p>Youth, livelineſs of temper, and ingenuouſneſs of mind, pointed them out as the proper objects of a game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's attention. One Leeſon was at this time the main ſupport of the profeſſion of gaming, and ever watchful to ſeduce the unwary. For this purpoſe (if it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to ſpeak it) he ſeemed even formed by nature. His perſon, wit, and acompliſhments, reccommended him to general notice. His language was copious, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and perſuaſive: and his memory and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were of the higheſt degree of ſtrength. He had ſtudied human nature for no intention but to prey on its weakneſſes, and he well knew when to take an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to inſinuate his pernicious principles. Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was his buſineſs, and to ſeduction of females he was no ſtranger. His perſonal courage was eſtabliſhed in the faſhionable world, but upon no better foundation than his having killed in a duel the huſband of a woman whom he had ruined, plundered and expoſed to ſhame. With the undiſcerning part of the world, he was a man of honour and of abilities.—In fact, he was totally deſtitute of every virtue that can dignify man, and he practiſed thoſe vices which brutes are incapable of, but which the imperfect ſtate of our legiſlature leaves "unwhipt of juſtice."</p>

               <p>Had the loſs of fortune been the only conſequence, frugality and abſtinence from the company into which they had been introduced might have retrieved, or at leaſt leſſened their miſfortune. But they had loſt that which can ſeldom be recalled; they loſt the ſpotleſs purity of their minds; they ſcarcely ever recollected the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their early education. The ſenſibilities of love and friendſhip were no longer felt. Avarice, envy, and rancour were now the leading paſſions, as they are the natural conſequence of gaming. The diſtreſſes into which they were from time to time plunged, they did not ſeek to alleviate by ſobriety and attention to duty. As their expences multiplied, they found it neceſſary to have recourſe to other means than formerly: their father might weep over their infatuation, but he could no longer ſupply their wants. The friends (as they were wont to call them) who had profited by their folly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to contribute any aſſiſtance. The gaming table was their only place of refuge; but ignorant of the tricks of ſharpers, they found that their ſucceſs here
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032707_0096_0FF4334B017D2A20"/>
was but temporary, and only ſerved to chain them down to a torture of which they began to have the moſt alarming apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>An offer was made by an opulent relation to purchaſe a commiſſion in a regiment deſtined for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign ſervice. This was repreſented to them by their parent, and the eldeſt accepted the offer, while the other agreed to apply to the ſtudy of commerce in the houſe of an eminent merchant in London, to which they now removed, and their parents rejoiced at their departure from a place in which their fondeſt hopes had been ſo ſadly diſappointed.</p>
               <p>Happy had it been, if their follies had now ended; if they had profited by their experience, dear bought as it was, and been reclaimed from vicious indulgencies. But the company they fell into in London, a place to which they were before ſtrangers, added to their imprudence. In a ſhort time, by the common tranſitions of the life of a gameſter they were reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs. To complete all, when they found themſelves beyond all hopes of retrieving circumſtances, they took the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate reſolution of going on the highway, determined to plunder or die in the attempt. They carried their purpoſe into execution; weary of life, they alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that if there ſhould be danger of detection to rid themſelves of life by piſtol or poiſon. If they ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were to leave of the pernicious practice off gaming, and amend that life which in its preſent ſtate was a burthen. Such is the ſophiſtry with which a gameſter grown deſperate amuſes his mind.</p>

But it was too late. The eldeſt of them had fired at the poſtilion, and the ball miſſing him, mortally wounded the gentleman in the carriage, who was no other than their own father!—The other who had not heard the voice, rode up to the door of the chaiſe, and was about to diſcharge his piſtol, when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But gaming, when it is made the buſineſs of life, is pernicious in every reſpect. Ruin and reproach are the portion of that unhappy female who is prone to a vice ſo inconſiſtent with the delicacy of the ſex.

But being touched by the wrongs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and ſenſible, of my obligations to the unhappy ſufferers, I can no longer juſtify a concealment of their caſe from the public eye: Reſting, therefore, upon the candor of the age, I ſhall give a free and unbiaſſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a circumſtance, that lately befel me in a country town.</p>
               <p>I called one day at Mr.—'s a gentleman of my acquaintance, where I had promiſed myſelf an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble afternoon; but finding my friend was gone out, I reſolved to entertain myſelf as well as I could. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, being invited by the lovely ſongſters, and prompted by a natural curioſity, I took a walk into the fields; and, intent upon great nature's works, careleſsly ſauntered about, till I was quite loſt among the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable mazes of mountains, lawns, and meadows. The ſun had ſet, and the ſables of night were covering the earth; when I found myſelf alone in a ſequeſtered vale. From whence I had come, or whither to go, I knew not. In this bewildered condition, I came to an high mountain, and ſat down under a large tree; that the boughs might ſhelter me from the damps of night. The winds ceaſed, and a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing her plaintive ditty: but the repeated ſighs, joined with almoſt articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſounds, ſoon convinced me of my miſtake. The aſcent of the mountain, that the ſound came from, was exceeding ſteep, and appeared to be inſuperable; yet nature, at the voice of human diſtreſs, irriſiſtably urged me to offer relief. With much difficulty, and at the expence of much time, I climbed up the precipice; and guided by the mournful ſound, I came to a cave where the object of pity was. The morning light by this time favoring me, I had a clear view: A young woman of ſurpaſſing beauty, was ſitting on the ground within the mouth of the cave: her diſhevelled hair hung neglected down her neck, and her languiſhing head reclined on her ſhoulder; while ſhe was pouring forth her moans to the empty winds. For a few minutes I ſtood ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at the piteous ſight; then, moved with an humane paſſion and kind ſympathy, I ſtepped to the cave, and took her by the hand to raiſe her up, till then ſhe took no notice; but feeling my hand, ſhe looked up and thus ſpoke: "Ah! depart, and leave me, the moſt wretched of my ſex." If your misfortunes, ſaid I, are great, as this your condition, is miſerable, and you have no ſympathiſing friend to bear the burden with you, thou art wretched indeed "Friend!" ſhe replied, "ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſing friend! O Artamenes! had not I injured thee, I ſhould now poſſeſs a warm and generous friend." Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ſhe was oppreſſed with a load of ſorrow, I begged to be informed of the cauſe; and made every proffer of aſſiſtance. "Kind ſtranger," ſhe replied,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032707_0101_0FF42B0EBB892A48"/>
"your curioſity is laudable, and your offers generous; the former, if it will afford you any ſatisfaction, I am willing to gratify; but the latter, thro a conſciouſneſs of my own unworthineſs, I am reſolved never to accept. All the pleaſure I enjoy, is the indulgence of my grief; and all the aſſiſtance I deſire is a pitying tear."</p>

The next day he returned, according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and renewed the attack with the greateſt civility and warmeſt perſuaſion. But like the monſter guilt my tongue ſaid no, when my heart and coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to his purpoſe, and often renewed his requeſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I admired his perſon, and was charmed with his ſenſibility; yet had the folly, incident to my ſex, whilſt I was in his preſence to banter his paſſion and ridicule the ſincereſt profeſſions of his love: but no ſooner could he leave me, than I pined with the ſame vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of paſſion, and wiſhed for an opportunity to diſcloſe it. At length being wearied with ungenerous treatment, and deſpair of ſucceſs, he made this laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve: (ah, too fatal reſolution!) "Tho thou art dearer than life; tho death ſhould ſooner ſeparate me from the world, than aught from thy arms; yet, ſince my miſery is ſo nearly blended with thine, I cannot deſire to be ſo wretchedly happy, as thereby to make you miſerable; as you intimate, if ever a union betwixt us ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue: therefore, I fly thy preſence, having this comfort only, that I may feed on thy ſweet remembrance, which is ſo deeply fixed in my breaſt, that not life, nor death can eraſe it."</p>
               <p>"This he ſpoke with ſo much tenderneſs, and yet reſolution that I was at a loſs what to do: and whilſt I was conſidering whether falſe named modeſty, or open ſincerity ſhould guide my way, he took his laſt farewell.

Still I had the vanity to think that he would break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But I was ſoon informed that he took leave of his friends, and told them that he ſhould never return. It is impoſſible for you to conceive of my diſtreſs and anxiety: a thouſand ideas, and a thouſand ſtratagems continually paſſed thro my mind. My ſpirits ſunk, and I pined away in grief and ſorrow. And altho the ſlighteſt occurrence would raiſe my expectation, yet they were all ideal and momentary. My parents no ſooner ſaw me diſordered, than with the kindeſt concern they uſed all means for recovering my health. Phyſicians far and near were conſulted, but to no purpoſe; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of the cauſe, the cure was beyond their reach. I continued in this ſtate for a conſiderable time, avoiding all company as much as poſſible. But as I was ſitting alone one evening in my chamber, having ſecur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſtreets were liued on one ſide with a ſtern ſoldiery, and on the other filled with a diſtracted crowd. I ſpoke to a perſon, who was ſtanding by, and aſked the cauſe of the tumult. He replied, that life, or liberty, muſt now be reſigned. Juſt as he ſpoke, I eſpied thro the crowd the long wiſhed for Artamenes. The roſe bluſhed on his cheek and the ſerenity of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſat upon his countenance; length of time had added new elegance to his form, and melting love, mingled with cheerful innocence ſparkled in his eye. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

beyond expreſſion, I was juſt leaping to embrace the object of my love—but ere I could reach his lovely arms; (Oh horrid to relate! let flowing tears buy off the mournful tale) ere I could taſte the ſweetneſs of his lips; the cruel ſoldiers diſcharged the winged fate. Artamenes was the firſt! pale, and ghaſtly he fell to the ground! the blood, than worlds more precious, ſtreamed from his body! beſmeared with gore, he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on the cold ground! and his head, without any friendly hand to ſupport it, was bruiſed upon the rough pavement! he groan'd! he gaſp'd! he died!"</p>
               <p>Here ſhe was ſo affected, that her power of ſpeech was ſuſpended for a conſiderable time; but at length ſhe thus continued.</p>
               <p>"I ſtartled in wild amaze from my ſleep, raved with ſtaring horror; and, then ſwooned with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming grief. When I had recovered again my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled ſtrength, I thus ſpoke with myſelf; O Artame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes! if my dream be true, how changed! a pale, lifeleſs corpſe! trampled with the common earth under foot! ſacrifice to ſavage luſt! and the ſecond victim at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſhrine! O cruel, curſed—but be ye huſhed, revengeful paſſions; they were only the agents, I the cauſe. Oh! I could weep my ſpirit from mine eyes! perhaps in the pangs of death he remembered Cleora, and called her cruel! wretched me! what have I done! I will ſeek ſome lonely cavern where I may forever mourn his unhappy fate. The next day at evening I had the ſorrowful news of his murder from a perſon who was preſent at the maſſacre. I retired to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſpent the night in grief and impatience, being
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032707_0105_0FF42AB916F457C0"/>
haunted with the dying groans and injured ſhade of my butchered lover. At length the morning light juſt glimmering upon the mountains, I left my kind, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parents to bewail my loſs, and ſled in all the pangs of deſpair to this mountain. Unknowing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, I wandered about; till I chanced to light upon this cave. I viewed it wiſhfully on every ſide; the ground I ſaw, was covered with a moſſy gray; the dark walls ſeemed to weep for my hard fate; and every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was tinged with a ſullen gloom; it appeared every way adapted for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here I entered, and have been kindly ſheltered from the inclemencies of the weather, being ſupported, by the ſpontaneous product of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Here, in this gloomy cavern, will I ſpend my remaining ſands in mourning and ſorrow, the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of folly."</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for any perſon to imagine, or me to expreſs, the grief and ſympathy that agitated my breaſt, whilſt ſhe was relating her ſtory. When ſhe had finiſhed, I endeavored with all the rhetoric I was maſter of to perſuade her from her cave: but all to no effect. And when I ſaw ſhe was obſtinately fixed, I left her ſitting upon the cold ground ſighing and mourning to the deaf, but the weeping walls of her cavern.</p>
               <p>I came down from the mountain, and with ſome difficulty found the way back to my friend's houſe. After the uſual compliments, and a tranſient converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were paſſed; being very much fatigued with what had happened, I retired to an apartment, and ſlept till

He expreſſed a great deal of ſurprize at what I told him, and replied: "She was the ſweeteſt, and moſt lovely creature upon eerth: no body was ever better reſpected or more beloved: but ſhe has been loſt ever ſince the unhappy period mentioned in her dream. We imagined, that being drowned in grief, for her lover, ſhe had put an end to her life. But if ſhe be yet alive, let us haſten to her relief, and force her from her cave; for her parents are now expiring with grief, end every countenance through the village is veiled with ſorrow." Upon this I went back with him to the mountain; and juſt before we entered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>We had now preſented ourſelves to her view, and when ſhe ſpoke to us, made anſwer, that we come to bring relief.</p>
               <p>"Impoſſible, ſhe returned, for I have none upon earth: but ſtay—now it is well; death mocks your kindneſs, O Artamenes! I loved—I die."</p>

At length we took the corpſe, and with tears and ſilence brought it to the village. But who can imagine, or what pen deſcribe, the grief and ſorrow, that filled the place? "Cleora is dead!

               <head>THE HAPPY DELIVERANCE.</head>
               <p>IN one of thoſe ages when deſpotiſm was the engine of reſentment, of paſſion, of civil fury, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical rage, Alphonſo, the ſon of Ferdinand, king of Arragon, lived. This young prince was diſtinguiſhed not more by the robuſt valor of the times, than by the gentle and generous qualities of the heart, which are thought to belong more properly to modern manners. The ſon of a cruel and ruthleſs tyrant, he was mild, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and forbearing; the flattery of courtiers was heard by him with indifference, and to the fawning of ſycophants he was ever averſe. He led a retired life even in the buſtle of a court, and devoted his hours to love and the Muſes. The object of his paſſion was the daughter of his father's treaſurer Orlando—her name Iſabella—a virgin univerſally admired for her extreme beauty, and the lovely qualities of her mind. She was not inſenſible to the paſſion of Alphonſo, but whether from dread of Ferdinand, who ſhe was convinced had too much pride to allow his ſon to marry the daughter of one whom he had raiſed from obſcurity—or whether Orlando had forbid her interviews with the young prince, ſhe avoided meeting with the prince, who could not but venerate her prudence while he lamented the unhappy cauſe.</p>
               <p>Ferdinand about this time ſent for his ſon, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of a march he had prepared for him, and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032707_0109_0FF42ABF2B2428B0"/>
which he had ordered him inſtantly to accept, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on pain of his diſpleaſure to offer any argument againſt it. Alphonſo was not more alarmed at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation than aſtoniſhed at the injunctions which accompanied it. "Surely," though he, "my father ſuſpects my paſſion for Iſabella, elſe why imagine that I was about to refuſe his offer." Ferdinand, however, moſt abſolute in all his commands, immediately gave orders to prepare the ſolemnities uſual on the marriage of the king's ſon. Alphonſo had no alternative—He flew to Iſabella—and by ſtealth got into her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, notwithſtanding every precaution her father had uſed to prevent their meeting.—Fatal was that interview; he was diſcovered entering Iſabella's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and betrayed to his father by a domeſtic. Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, enraged beyond deſcription, ſent for Orlando, and reproaching him for encouraging an illicit connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between his ſon and Iſabella, ordered him inſtantly to be beheaded; the cruel ſentence was no ſooner exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted than the king ſent ſome truſty ſervant to ſeize Iſabella and remove her to a ſecret place of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the borders of his dominions, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be treated with every poſſible ſeverity, and that every precaution ſhould be taken to prevent her eſcape. The minions of tyrants are frequently ſacrifices to their own treachery; when thoſe ſervants returned to inform him that his orders were obeyed, he put every one of them to death, leſt they might betray the ſecret of Iſabella's impriſonment.</p>

The news of his death ſoon ſpread over the kingdom; and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, who had hid himſelf at no great diſtance from the city, returned and was proclaimed king; the firſt act of his power was to diſmiſs thoſe men who had been the agents of his father's tyranny, and redreſs the grievances of thoſe ſubjects who had ſuffered by their oppreſſion. His virtues had long been the theme of popular applauſe, and the whole kingdom reechoed "Long live Alphonſo!"</p>
               <p>To Alphonſo, however, theſe proofs of loyalty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded little relief. The remembrance of Iſabella's wrongs, nothing could efface. His imagination repreſented her as in miſery and diſtreſs, and his dreams were filled with horrible apparitions of her ſorrows. Every means he had hitherto uſed to find out the place of her confinement were in vain. Such precautions were taken by Ferdinand that this might for ever have remained a ſecret had not accident diſcovered it.</p>

In this dilemma, he came up to an old tower, the greater part of which was in ruins; the only habitable part was a priſon, but apparently in decay.

               <p>HAMET the ſon of Morat was deſcended from the ancient princes of Perſia: led by the fame of Cha Abbas, he reſorted to his court and was treated with all thoſe marks of diſtinction which he could expect from ſo generous a monarch.</p>
               <p>He had a fine houſe and gardens allotted him in the city of Iſpahan with a numerous retinue, and an ample revenue to maintain them. His table was loaded with all the luxuries of the eaſt, his ſeraglio was filled with the moſt beautiful women in the world, He was high in favour with the Perſian Monarch, and ſeemed to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs every thing that could contribute to enſure human felicity.</p>
               <p>Yet there was a ſtrange void in his heart, a ſort of

chaſm which to him was the ſource of perpetual unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.—The riſing day beheld him a prey to cares, and the ſhades of night brought him no repoſe.</p>
               <p>One day as he was wandering abroad alone, full of anxious thoughts, he came to a little ſpot of ground where he found a ſhepherd who was reclining on a green bank warbling out a pleaſant air, while his flock was feeding beſide him; every now and then he caſt a look towards a ſmall cottage at a little diſtance, then ceaſing his melody would caſt up a grateful look to heaven as full of thankfulneſs for its benefits.</p>
               <p>Hamet had approached as yet unſeen, and as there was ſomething in the peaſant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering him "ſhepherd, ſaid he, thou appeareſt delighted with thy occupation, and by thy countenance thy heart ſeems to be unacquainted with trouble." It is ſo indeed, illuſtrious ſtranger, returned the ſhepherd, my occupation anſwers all my wants and is well ſuited to my inclination; but I have beſides yet other ſources of happineſs.—Then thou art happy? exclaimed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, but what are theſe ſources of felicity, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doſt thou regard that cottage with ſuch ſatisfaction, and lift up thy eyes to heaven as in prayer or rather in thankſgiving." —"My ſources of happineſs my lord, anſwered the ſhepherd, are in a woman whom I tenderly love, and a faithful friend who regards me as himſelf.—That cottage ſuffices to contain us all, and I am for ever pouring out my thanks to heaven that has preſerved them to me, and thus has made me hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py."</p>

                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:032707_0114_0FF42AEC15FC1128"/>This ſpeech touched the very ſource of Hamet's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety: "Alas he cried, I have an hundred ſlaves and concubines, and friends without number, and yet I am unhappy!"</p>
               <p>So ſaying he left the ſhepherd, and advanced on his walk buried in meditation till the hour of noon, when the weather which he had before little attended to, grew ſuddenly very boiſterous.—A cloudy curtain veiled the ſkies, the fighting winds ruſhed forth, loud thunders roared and lightning flaſhed around him, —A deluge of rain poured down while the very ground ſeemed to ſhake beneath him.</p>
               <p>Driven by their tempeſts, he haſted to ſeek ſhelter in a wood, whoſe thickeſt branches however were not ſufficient to repel its force. But in the midſt of this diſtreſs, by the glare of the lightning he diſcerned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a little miſtic building in the wood; encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by the hopes that it was inhabited, he eagerly preſſed forward to it. When he arrived, a venerable man opened the door to him, whoſe hair and beard were ſilvered over by age, it was the hermit Haſſan, who kindly invited him to take refuge from the ſtorm while it laſted. Perceiving the anxiety that dwelt on the bow of his gueſt, he inquired the cauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs—Hamet concealed nothing of it from him, as far as he knew himſelf;—When he came to ſpeak of the ſhepherd's happineſs and compare it with his own ſituation, "what ſaid Haſſan, doſt thou ſay, thou haſt an hundred ſlaves, concubines and friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number—ah! deluded wretch, thou haſt no love, no friend, thy luxury indeed has provided thee with a

Lay by thy rich attire, and conceal thy grandeur, ſo ſhall thou better judge of human kind, when diveſting thyſelf of the prince thou findeſt thoſe who regard plain Hamet."</p>
               <p>The ſon of Morat withdrew, when the tempeſt was over, fully determined to follow the advice of the hermit, he went home and changed his attire for plain cloathing and diſguiſed his face as much as poſſible; then having concealed a quantity of rich jewels in his garment, he ſat out on a journey to Cachemire. Paſſing thus along through tha public ſtreets of Iſaphan as a traveller he received no marks of reſpect from any one and was obliged often to give the way to his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics and dependants.</p>
               <p>As he was travelling one evening late on the confines of Cachemire, he found himſelf ſuddenly attacked by a number of armed robbers, againſt whom he defended himſelf with great bravery, but muſt have fallen in the conteſt, had not a young man timely came up, who with three ſervants were travelling on the ſame road—Theſe fell upon the robbers flew ſome and put the reſt to flight, and afterwards the youth took Hamet home with him, and having provided him with a ſurgeon inſiſted on his ſtaying at his houſe till the wounds he had received ſhould be cured.

                  </gap>enviable indeed, is the lot of him, who falls within the limits of this deſcription; his fate is ſevere, and his future proſpects of felicity but very ſmall. Happy he who, in theſe moments finds a friend, to whom he may impart his grief, and receive conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from a ſymphathizing heart. Happy the man who poſſeſſes fortitude firm enough to baniſh from his mind the tormenting idea, and drive from his imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the object of his woe, but tranſcendantly more happy, the man, who is fortunate enough to fix his choice on a perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ungrateful to the ſentiments her worth inſpires. Warmed with congenial tranſport, the friendly ſpark is gently fanned, until blazing into a flame of mutual affection, Hymen crowns them happy, and their terreſtial felicity terminates alone in death. It is, however, a melancholy truth, that the connubial ſtate is unfortunately too often attended with undeſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I wont ſay unavoidable, hapleſs moments of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and animoſities, which ought never to enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Deception on either hand may take place before the gordian knot is tied; and above every thing diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the temper, diſpoſition and real merits,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032707_0119_0FF4333720AFEB80"/>
is ever to be deplored and lamented; they form a ſource of continual rancour, and are the bane of harmonious agreement and conjugal love. A man cannot conceal his real temper from the world; he cannot diſſemble altogether his true character; a female can in a great meaſure; ſeen by few perſons ſhe may appear charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while ſhe is in fact quite the reverſe, and by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual chain of duplicity and artful affability, captivate an unhappy victim, to partake in the inherent miſery, nature had intended for her alone. But theſe inſtances are rare in happy America. Her daughters are virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as fair. The luſtre of whoſe charms ſhine reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the face of day, and the lucid brightneſs of their characters, form the devoted objects of heaven's care.</p>
               <p>I would never make intereſt a prevailing motive for a change of condition, nor would I adviſe any one to aſpire at the attainment of a perſon, above the ſphere of life, in which he is placed by the opinion of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding world; diſappointment is too often the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and ſometimes miſery reſults from the unhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for denial. The man who marries from intereſt alone, find out pretty generally the error of his choice, and meets ſooner or later with juſt cauſe of repentance, eſpecially ſhould misfortune happen, which none are altogether exempt from. It is abſolutely neceſſary that there ſhould be a competency, without which the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations are very confined. A pretty girl, or a pretty fellow, form no ſufficient food for ſuſtenance, by no manner of means. I ſeldom knew love to be durable where the means of ſubſiſtence were wanting; at moſt,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032707_0120_0FF42AEF1F7F2028"/>
it is a very rare caſe. An union of this kind adds miſery to want, and makes penury the wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of at leaſt two perſons, when one alone might have been the ſubject. I would not be underſtood as having a poſitive averſion to matrimony; the feelings of my heart evince the reverſe.

               <p>In this country we are born to inherit an equal proportion of our parents' fortune at their deceaſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided our conduct does not render us unworthy their care: by this means a large eſtate is ſubject to being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into many hands; thence the baſis of equality and the incitement to induſtry and caution: and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of frugality may operate with the ſame if not ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or force, in preſerving the reſpectability of families in this country, as the pernicious cuſtom of inheritance, which the laws have eſtabliſhed in ſome parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, are capable of doing. But even the mildeſt laws, and cuſtoms the moſt generous and well founded, will not alone inſure and maintain reſpectability. Virtue and good morality are neceſſary. Theſe are the moſt munificent guardians, theſe the conſolations of a dying parent. Precepts may be futile and examples vague, when the mind is not prone to virtue. It therefore is a parents duty to early infuſe into the minds of his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring a juſt idea of their expectations and their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in life, and prepare them by an education calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the part they are to act, upon the grand theatre of the world. A liberal extenſive education is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended with ſucceſs, even in the ſuperior walks of life; and I think they muſt be often ſtill leſs ſo, in the more humble. A young man with no rich protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032707_0122_0FF4335F25FDAD70"/>
when he comes from college, is very often deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; he is obliged to become ſchoolmaſter in ſome ſmall village, the fees of which will not always produce ſufficient for his ſupport: This is diſcouraging to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that might have been better employed in tilling the ground, and making improvements in agriculture, which he is now by the brilliancy of his education and perhaps falſe ideas of his talents, led to regard as below the ſphere of life which nature had deſigned him for. Long accuſtomed to a life of eaſe, he deſpiſes laborious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, and the wrong notions his education has induced him to imbibe, become the ſource of his wretchedneſs, and deprives his country of otherwiſe a valuable ſubject and the reſpect of a flouriſhing poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus population is cramped.</p>
               <p>Agriculture and manufactures are the ſubſtantial riches of a ſtate; they ought to go hand in hand in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. Theſe are the ſources of commerce, and when the former are encouraged and protected, the lattter will conſequently flouriſh and improve.</p>

They furniſhed him with learning ſufficient for a counting houſe, and at a proper age good fortune directed the kind hand of Mercator, to take Philander, into the boſom of his fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. Honoria was then at an age when thoſe ſentiments which have ſince expanded and allayed unmeaſureable ſorrows, began to take root in her heart. She ſaw Philander with no indifference; innocence was painted on his brow, ſimplicity, artleſs affability, and obliging manners, evinced the ſincerity of a mind which his outward deportment announced. Qualities like theſe could not eſcape the already penetrating eye of Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032707_0124_0FF42AF45751ECC8"/>
ſhe determined to be the friend of Philander; a mutual confidence ſoon took place, and from friendſhip, which grew up with them, reſulted the pureſt love. When Philander had attained his twenty firſt year, he retired from the houſe of his friend to enter into buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a town ſome ways diſtant from that of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; but not before giving him the moſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurances of his obligations and the indeliable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions his generous and kind partiality had made on his heart. When he comes to take leave of the lovely Honoria, the recollection of paſt pleaſures and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential friendſhip that had ſo early enkindled and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their affections, ſerved to augment the natural regret of his departure, and cauſe the moment of their ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be equally painful and unhappy.</p>
               <p>Mercator was not unknowing to their friendſhip, and ſuſpected their mutual attachment; but far from being diſpoſed to ſuppreſs, he watched the ſpontaneous flame, and promoted the object of his generoſity by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him forward in buſineſs and making him ſtill his care. An explanation had long before taken place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lovers, and they ſwore to each other at the ſhrine of Philander's departed father, that their hearts ſhould never ſwerve, and when mountains and lakes ſhould intercept them, the pen ſhould become ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to oral intercourſe. Philander, by his induſtry and ſtrict economy, ſoon acquired a handſome property, and his buſineſs daily increaſed. During his abſence Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator died, and left his daughter chief heireſs to his large fortune; but by ſome fatality, at this important
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:032707_0125_0FF43340E05C2630"/>
and afflicting period, the letters of Honoria were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and their enemies, to effect certain purpoſes, gave riſe to reports equally painful to both lovers. The buſineſs of Philander at this time happened to call him near to the capital, the former reſidence of his departed friend, and he was there informed of his death. Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarmed at the melancholy news, he flew to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and with hers mixed the tear of ſympathy and ſorrow. He was ſoon made acquainted with the vile purpoſes of his enemies, and controverted all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous intrigues, and at a proper time the angelic Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria granted her hand, and preſented her fortune, to the grateful object of ſo rich a prize.</p>

Frank was no ſtranger at Bath, Briſtol, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and Brighthelmſtone; and he began to ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf that he had gained ſo much wiſdom by experience, that it would be almoſt impoſſible for him to be deceived, even by the moſt artful.</p>
               <p>His prudence was ſoon put to the trial. Paſſing in a ſtage-coach from London to York, he was ſtruck with the ſight of a young lady, whom he conſidered as the moſt beautiful of her ſex. She appeared modeſt even to a fault, and gave the moſt prudent anſwer to the queſtions ſhe was aſked by any of the paſſengers. As ſhe became more familiar with the company, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more entertaining, and it was ſoon evident that the charms of her converſation were not inferior to thoſe of her face and form. 'This, ſaid Frank to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is certainly the moſt beautiful, and the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed woman in the world. I thought beauty had no power to make me her ſlave: But I was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The charms of Delia have been victor in the conteſt, and I ſhall willingly reſign my liberty at her feet. There can be no deception here.

One evening, as Frank was walking with the object of his wiſhes, he accidentally met a gentleman, who had been a very particular acquaintance of his father. Surpriſed to ſee him in that part of the world, without having received the favour of a viſit, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in a friendly manner of ſuch unmerited neglect, and begged the favour of his company the next day to dinner. Frank, promiſed to attend him, and after mutual compliments they parted. Delia ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the preſence of this gentleman, whom we ſhall call Horatio; and, during the conference, kept her eyes fixed upon the ground. Her lover imputed her behaviour entirely to modeſty, and the incident ſeemed rather to increaſe, than leſſen the eſteem he had conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her. But Delia's confuſion aroſe from a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent motive: She was no ſtranger to the face of Horatio, and uſed every artifice in her power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Frank from performing the promiſe he had made to his friend. She propoſed a tour into the country, where ſhe promiſed to ſhew him ſome remarkable pieces of antiquity, Frank expreſſed his deſire of attending her but wiſhed the tour might be poſtponed for a day or two, as he ſhould then have paid the viſit he had promiſed; and Delia, fearing that any farther importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity might attend to alarm him, conſented to poſtpone the tour, declaring at the ſame time that his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had ſlipped her memory.</p>

After dinner, when the company were retired, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio aſked his friend how long he had been acquainted with the lady whom he ſaw yeſterday in his company. Frank ingenuouſly told him the whole of his adventure, that he had ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'I wiſh, for the ſake of our common friendſhip, and that harmony which has always ſubſiſted between our families,' replied Horatio, with ſome vivacity, 'that I could approve your choice. I would willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate your on the proſpect of your approaching happineſs with all the ardour of a friend. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, Frank, you have placed your affections on an undeſerving object. She has put on the cloak of innocence to deceive you; and will, if you perſiſt in completing the connection you wiſh; ſoon triumph in your ruin.'</p>
               <p>'It is impoſſible,' anſwered Frank, with great emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'that I can ſuſpect your uttering a premeditated falſhood; but are you not deceived in the object? You may have ſeen a perſon that nearly reſembles her; and it is poſſible you may load her with crimes which are the property of another.' 'I am too cautious Frank,' replied Heratio, 'to be eaſily deceived; and I have too much reaſon to remember her: The injuries I have
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032707_0129_0FF42ADB36A95110"/>
received are too great and too recent to be forgotten. To her hypocritical innocence I owe the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of my life. My eldeſt ſon, your old ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow and companion, was ſeduced by her arts, and, had not I ſnatched him from her company, his ruin had been completed. She then practiſed her arts in the capital, and is now I ſuppoſe endeavouring to extend her pernicious influence in the country. Believe me, Frank, though very young, ſhe has already been the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of ſeveral, and poſſibly you yourſelf might have been the next victim at her altar. You ſeem aſtoniſhed, but I will convince you that I have uttered nothing but the truth: I will to morrow attend you to her lodgings, and force her to confeſs that I have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her character.'</p>
               <p>Frank readily conſented, and it was agreed that the viſit ſhould be paid in the morning. Frank was perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his friend was miſtaken, and that this inteview with Delia would only tend to give an additional luſtre to her innocence and virtue. He believed he had ſeen too much of the world to be deceived; and that tho vice might for a time aſſume the maſk of virtue, yet the unnatural character would ſoon be conſpicuous, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only of deceiving the ignorant and the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the morning appeared, Frank viſited his friend, and could hardly be perſuaded to ſtay till break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt was over before they repaired to the ſcene of action. But what was his aſtoniſhment to find that Delia, the innocent Delia, was fled, and had taken Frank's pocket

               <head>THE <hi>PARADISE</hi> OF <hi>SCHEDAD:</hi> AN EASTERN TALE.</head>
               <p>A LONG time before the prophet of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers had enlightened the world, and the holy Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran had deſcended from the ſeventh heaven, Schedad reigned in Yemen, with abſolute power, which he uſed without moderation. He was a voluptuous, an extrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agant, and an impious tyrant: He was a monſter rather than a man, and he had the ambition of being a god. If he had wiſhed to be ſo only in his court, they ſay the courtiers of theſe times would have adored without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, himſelf, his monkey, and his paroquet: But Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad was deſirous that all his ſubjects ſhould recognize his pretended divinity, and that they ſeriouſly and in good faith ſhould believe in it.</p>
               <p>To ſucceed in this project, he conceived a ſcheme, which to him appeared infallible. He made a circular
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032707_0131_0FF43348DC9638D8"/>
wall, of prodigious height and extent, built in the moſt beautiful ſpot of Yemen. This wall was bordered on the inſide with a foreſt of pine trees, which ſerved as a belt or crown to the greateſt and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt magnificent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den one can poſſibly imagine. There were meadows adorned with all the flowers of the ſpring, and orchards which promiſed all the riches of autumn. There were rivulets which glided in ſilence over golden ſands; or which ruſhing rapidly over a bed of pearls, mixed their murmurs with the warbling of the birds On one ſide, a perſon might admire himſelf in a ſma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng: On the other, one might deſcend into a delicious valley, whoſe freſhneſs is preſerved by a ſheet of water which tumbles from a rock.</p>
               <p>A little further on, one might walk among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed arbours always green, where the ſpikenard, the balm, and the aloes, grow at the foot of palm trees and cedarr. Nature every where ſhows herſelf with all her charms; and the timid art which has unveiled her, hardly allows herſelf to be perceived.</p>
               <p>In the center of this enchanted ſolitude, a round hill ariſes with a gentle ſlope; then growing flat at once, forms on the ſummit a vaſt eſplanade. There Schedad conſtructed a ſuperb palace, which he furn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with equal elegance and magnificence.</p>
               <p>Here the pomp of luxury was found joined with the acquirements of affeminacy, and the immenſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus of little conveniencies. And one might there find the artiſts of pleaſure, cooks, muſicians, dancers,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032707_0132_0FF4336AEBF12158"/>
buffoons, and even poets. Schedad thought little of theſe laſt; but what he prized above all the reſt was a numerous ſwarm of young girls, whom he took care to ſcatter over the palace and the gardens.—They were beautiful as the heavenly <hi>houris</hi> ſomewhat leſs pure, but much more lively and ſprightly.</p>
               <p>When every thing was ready for the execution of his deſign, Schedad was in haſte to publiſh this ſtrange edict, which was affixed on all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>"Schedad, the god of Yemen, to our faithful adorers, ſends health and happineſs. As we intend to ſurpaſs in liberality all other gods, who only promiſe happineſs after death, we make it known unto you, that we have created in the plain of Iram a paradiſe where you ſhall enjoy all the pleaſures of this life. We ſhall admit into that place, at a convenient ſeaſon, all thoſe among you, who, neglecting every ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous virtue, ſhall believe ſincerely in us, and ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves without reſerve to our divine will. We ſhall admit there at preſent, and without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, our bleſſed ſervants, whoſe names are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the liſt annexed to this preſent edict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— O people of Yemen! encourage yourſelves to follow the example they leave you, and merit the crown which they have obtained."</p>
               <p>Should you wiſh to know who were theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſervants of Schedad? Some of the moſt impudent flatterers; ſome miniſters of his oppreſſion and of his debaucheries; ſome deſpicable women who had yielded to his deſires; ſome others more artful who
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032707_0133_0FF4334C861D1040"/>
only promiſed to repair there, and theſe were beſt treated in this promotion. Scarcely was this edict publiſhed, when Schedad kept his word with the new ſaints. He conducted them with great ſolemnity to the palace of <hi>Iram,</hi> where he left them, deſiring them to enjoy in peace the happineſs he had prepared for them, which his frequent viſits ſhould render more perfect.—He himſelf in going out ſhut the gate of the ſacred incloſure, with an order to the ſoldiers who guarded it without, to kill without mercy all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane who ſhould dare to approach it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the bleſſed gave themſelves up without reſerve to the raptures into which the view alone of their new habitation had thrown them. For the firſt time in their life they admired, nay almoſt loved, the tyrant of Yemen. They even believed, as if he had been preſent, that the author of ſo many delights could be only a god. But their faith was of no longer duration than their happineſs, which was indeed extremely ſhort. Pleaſures varied in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but which at bottom were eternally the ſame; pleaſures eaſy to be procured, conſtant, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; ſoon became inſipid employments or hateful drudgery. By being obliged to enjoy them, they had no longer reliſh for hem; they perceived, on the other hand, that diſguſt and diſquiet paid little reſpect to the paradiſe of Schedad, and that diſeaſes without intermiſſion paid ſtill leſs. This was not all. The bleſſed had been a little acquainted in the world, and did not like each other; but on ſeeing one another nearer, they became better acquainted, and mutually
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:032707_0134_0FF4336D7A2CBEF8"/>
deteſted each other. From that time, no more ſociety, no more converſation. Shut up in their apartment, or diſperſed over the terraces of the palace, they looked with ſorrow on the delicious gardens which ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them; They only ſaw there the verdure of their priſon. Their eyes were more willingly fixed on the red ſea, and on a chain of mountains they perceived at a diſtance. What would they not have given to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at liberty through theſe frightful rocks, or to ſail on that ſea, diſcredited by ſo many ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecks.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation were the bleſſed when the god of Yemen honored them with his firſt viſit. He came to add the ſupreme good of his preſence to the pleaſures with which he believed them enchanted. But who can figure his ſurpriſe and indignation when he ſaw ſorrow painted on every countenance: And when in place of hymns and ſongs, he heard only complaints and murmurs! he diſſembled, however, and contained himſelf as much as poſſible! He joined careſſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; and by threatening and cajolling his ſaints, he made them promiſe that they would endeavour to accuſtom themſelves to paradiſe, and to enjoy their good fortune with patience. But this extorted prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe hardly removed his fears. He truſted more to an order he left with the guards of the outer wall; which was to put to death no longer the profane, but the ſaints themſelves, if they attempted to ſcale the wall.</p>
               <p>In ſpite of all theſe precautions, Schedad returned to his capital with the moſt lively inquietude, which
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032707_0135_0FF42ADFC7B557C8"/>
was but too well founded. He no longer flattered himſelf; he ſaw that his paradiſe and his divinity would tumble together into ſuch diſcredit as never more to raiſe themſelves. To parry this fatal ſtroke, he had recourſe to the only expedient which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He proclaimed, by a ſecond edict, that ſeeing the ingratitude of his people, and their little eagerneſs to deſerve paradiſe, he was about to create a hell, where unbelievers and impious perſons ſhould no longer mock him. As it is more eaſy to torment men than to make them happy, the new project would probably have ſucceeded better than the other: But they did not leave Schedad time to execute it. That cruel extravagance alarmed people of all ranks, and exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their patience. The tyrant was dethroned; and they deliberated a long time on the puniſhment they ſhould inflict. At laſt, they could think of none more proper than to ſhut him up in the garden of Iram with the vile wretches with whom he had peopled it, and to ſhut the gate of that infernal paradiſe. There, torn with remorſe, and overwhelmed with affronts, the god of Yemen ought to be convinced, that there is a ſupreme God, who confounds the projects of impiety; and who has only promiſed happineſs to virtue.</p>

                  <p>THE pleaſure I always take in writing to you wherever I am, and whatever doing, in ſome meaſure diſpels my preſent uneaſineſs; and uneaſineſs cauſed at once by the diſagreeable aſpect of every thing round me, and the more diſagreeable circumſtances of the Count Alberti, with whom you were once acquainted. You remember one of the gayeſt, moſt agreeable perſons at the court of Vienna; at once the example of the men, and the favorite of the fair ſex. I often heard you repeat his name with eſteem, as one of the few that did honor to the preſent age, as poſſeſſed of generoſity and pity in the higheſt degree; as one who made no other uſe of fortune but to alleviate the diſtreſſes of mankind. That gentleman, Sir, I wiſh I could ſay, is now no more; yet, too unhappily for him, he exiſts, but in a ſituation more terrible than the moſt gloomy imagination can conceive.</p>
                  <p>After paſſing thro ſeveral parts of the Alps, and having viſited Germany, I tho't I could not well return home without viſiting the quickſilver mines at Idra, and ſeeing thoſe dreadful ſubterranean caverns, where thouſands are condemned to reſide, ſhut out from all hopes of ever ſeeing the chearful light of the ſun, and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032707_0137_0FF42B211331B240"/>
obliged to toil out a miſerable life under the whips of imperious taſk maſters. Imagine to yourſelf an hole in the ſide of a mountain, of about five yards over; down this you are let, in a kind of bucket, more than an hundred fathom, the proſpect growing ſtill more gloomy, yet ſtill widening as you deſcend.</p>
                  <p>At length after ſwinging in terrible ſuſpenſe, for ſome time, in this precarious ſtation, you reach the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and tread on the ground, which, by its hollow ſound under your feet, and the reverberations of the echo, ſeems thundering at every ſtep you take. In this gloomy and frightful ſolitude, you are enlightened by the feeble gleam of lamps, here and there diſpoſed, ſo as that the wretched inhabitants of theſe manſions can go from one part to another without a guide. And yet, let me aſſure you, that tho they, by cuſtom, could ſee objects very diſtinctly by theſe lights, I could ſcarce diſcern, for ſome time, any thing not even the perſon who came with me to ſhow me theſe ſcenes of horror.</p>
                  <p>From this deſcription, I ſuppoſe, you have but a diſagreeable idea of the place: yet let me aſſure you, that it is a palace, if we compare the habitation with the inhabitants. Such wretches my eyes never yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. The blackneſs of their viſages only ſerves to cover an horrid paleneſs cauſed by the noxious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mineral they are employed in procuring. As they, in general, conſiſt of malefactors condemned for life to this taſk, they are fed at the public expence; but they ſeldom conſume much proviſion, as they loſe their appetites in a ſhort time; and commonly in about

two years expire, from a total contraction of all the joints of the body.</p>
                  <p>In this horrid manſion I walked after my guide for ſome time, pondering on the ſtrange tyranny and avarice of mankind, when I was accoſted by a voice behind me, calling me by name and enquiring after my health with the moſt cordial affection. I turned and ſaw a creature all black and hideous, who approached me and with a moſt piteous accent demanding, "Ah! Mr. Everard do not you know me!" Good God, what was my ſurpriſe, when, thro the veil of his wretchedneſs, I diſcovered the features of my old and dear friend Alberti.

                  <p>MY laſt to you was expreſſive and perhaps too much ſo, of the gloomy ſituation of my mind. I own the deplorable ſituation of the worthy man deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in it, was enough to add double ſeverity to the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous manſion. At preſent, however, I have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of informing you, that I was a ſpectator of the moſt affecting ſcene I ever yet beheld. Nine days after I had written my laſt, a perſon came poſt from Vienna to the little village near the mouth of the greater ſhaft. He was ſoon after followed by a ſecond, and he by a third. Their firſt inquiry was after the unfortunate count, and I happening to overhear the demand, gave them the beſt information. Two of theſe were the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032707_0140_0FF433851B5F5EB8"/>
brother and couſin of the lady, the third was an intimate friend and fellow ſoldier to the count: they came with his pardon which had been procured by the general, with whom the duel had been fought, and who had perfectly recovered from his wounds. I led them with all the expedition of joy down to his dreary abode, and preſented to him his friends, and informed him of the happy change in his circumſtances. It would be impoſſible to deſcribe the joy that brightened upon his grief—worn countenance; nor was the young lady's emotion leſs vivid at ſeeing her friends and hearing of her huſbands freedom. Some hours were employed in mending the appearance of this faithful couple, nor could I without a tear behold him taking leave of the formers wretched companions of his toil. To one he left his mattock, to another his working cloths, to a third his little houſhold utenſils, ſuch as were neceſſary for him in that ſituation. We ſoon emerged from the mine, where he once again reviſited the light of the ſun, that he had totally deſpaired of every ſeeing. A poſt chaiſe and four were ready the next morning to take them to Vienna, where I am ſince informed by a letter from himſelf, they are returned. The empreſs has again taken him into favour; his fortune and rank are reſtored; and he and his fair partner now have the pleaſing ſatisfaction of feeling happineſs with double reliſh, as they once knew what it was to be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <div type="letter">
                  <p>YOUR letter, kind Lindor, I peruſed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſatisfaction. I feel much gratified, and you have the pureſt acklowledgments of my heart for your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting ſtory. To merit your confidence, I ſhall ever rank among my moſt valuable acquiſitions; and be perſuaded of the warm emotions of my boſom, when you inform me, that any words my lips can pronounce, are capable of abating the ſorrows which corrode your mind. If my advice has been ſerviceable, if it has been the means of calming the turbulence of your fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs burning flames, I am richly compenſated by its event; my intention is thereby ſanctioned, and by following it in this inſtance, I may without oſtentation ſay, you add a ſprig of laurel to your own brow. It is not common, for two ſexes to correſpond with each other, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you have choſen. It is rather the province of ours alone. But what is uncommon, is not always vicious; if therefore, our correſpondence ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the maidens of ſixteen, my age of ſix and thirty will juſtify me; add to this, our connection and early acquaintance, and I may flatter myſelf of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from cenſure. I often think on your father's anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for you, and the pleaſure he fondly anticipated in the enjoyment of your ſociety, after the completion of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032707_0142_0FF42B229763F210"/>
your education, which he had determined to watch over with a parental care.</p>
                  <p>I well remember his grey diſhevelled locks, falling upon the ſhoulders, on which, he has often borne you with peculiar delight, while you remained unconſcious of his devoted affection towards you. He was ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this ſcene of woes, this theatre of ſhort lived pleaſures, to mount the realms of eternal bliſs, while yet you needed his parental precepts. His examples however have afforded you the pureſt model of recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and his virtues offer you a complete and worthy rule of human perfection. Follow them, my friend; and if the ſympathy of Caroline can at any time allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate your grief, recur to her, and receive thoſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which reſult from her little experience, with the ſame pleaſure ſhe takes in offering them; and be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the joy ſhe ever feels in ſuppreſſing the ſorrows of thy wounded heart, and the animation it affords her, to draw upon thy blooming cheek, a gentle ſmile.</p>
                  <p>While I was writing you, <hi>Charles</hi> came running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the parlor, to inform me of the arrival of my brother <hi>Sylvander;</hi> (who you know we heard was dead) the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance he gave me of the fact, left me no room to doubt the truth of it. He told me he had enquired for my father, and ran immediately into his chamber; luck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily he found him ſleeping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would not, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his anxiety, diſturb him: I had been up as uſual ever ſince five.</p>
                  <p>You may well judge of my joy and ſurpriſe to ſee an only brother, who all of us had concluded to

                  <p>Indeed I was almoſt diſtracted, fearing it a dream; at the moment of my deepeſt indeciſion, he came into the parlor; I made a fruitleſs effort to run to meet him; with difficulty I preſerved myſelf from fainting; my ſtrength failed me, and I fell back upon the ſofa almoſt lifeleſs; he flew and caught me in his arms, and by the help of ſome ſalvolatile from my ſmelling bottle, which had dropt from my hand, I was very ſoon recovered.

                  <p>I felt extremely glad that <hi>Sylvander</hi> did not diſturb my father, for the ſhock might have overcome him. We have now taken the precaution, to adviſe him of the pleaſing news of my brother's arrival, when he ſhall awake. This will prepare his mind, for the interview, and at the ſame time prevent a too ſudden effuſion of joy, which might prove fatal to one in his declining years. After the mutual inquiries conſequent on the meeting of friends, ſeparated from each other for ſo long a term of years, my brother informed me that laſt evening he met with his "ever adored <hi>Lavina,</hi>" as he called her, which prevented his arrival in town ſooner; indeed he told me, he had almoſt determined to tarry to day wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE evening was beautifully ſerene; the moon, bluſhing with crimſon hue, had juſt emerged from the horizon; and I was directing my ſteps towards an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from whence, I promiſed myſelf with reaſon, the moſt delightful perſpective view of the fine country around.—Arrived at this ſummit, I was contemplating the ſweet proſpect, and dwelling with rapture upon the variety of the ſcene. On the one ſide were verdant plains and flowery meads; on the other ſide, an orchard of trees in bloſſom, exhaling in profuſive plenty the ſweeteſt fragrance, wafted by the gentle zephyr with fanciful delight; the ruffling of the leaves and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring ſound from the little brook cloſe by me, arreſted attention with peculiar pleaſure; the wide extended ocean glittering in tranquil calmneſs, attracted thought, and the little interſperſed iſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032707_0146_0FF42B1659C0BE30"/>
the ſilver moon advanced to replace the diurnal ſtar, and prevent the dark canopy of night from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furled. I wandered from hill to hill, contemplating in tranſport the brilliancy of the proſpect, till I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally loſt myſelf; and entering an adjacent grove, I heard the voice of a female, uttering her complaints in ſoft accents, to the meandring brook, by the ſide of which ſhe had ſeated herſelf on a rock. I crept ſoftly when I perceived her, and came near to her, while ſhe was yet melodiouſly continuing her tender tale, unconſcious of an interruption. Pardon my intruſion, ſaid I, unknown fair, whoever thou art, and if the almighty ruler of events, ſhall have thus directed my ſteps to afford you relief, command the exertions of one, who will take a pleaſure in preſenting the balm of comfort, to the fair diſtreſſed. Her ebony hair was diſplayed in ringlets over her well formed neck, and divided in front, fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing careleſsly in gentle curls upon her temples. A gloom was viſible on her countenance, and ſhe appeared to behold me with very little ſurpriſe. I told her the bright evening had induced me to wander till I had quite loſt my way, and begged her to inform me in what direction I might walk to regain the road. She replied, with a ſyren's voice, "yonder houſe borders on it." And pray is that your dwelling? She anſwered in the affirmative. The tear was not dried from her lively eye, ſparkling, tho in diſtreſs, and animating to a charm. Her cheeks ſeemed to have been once emblems of the blooming roſe, but now become almoſt pale; her features were regular, and her countenance diſplayed a degree of virtuous dignity, at once commanding and agreeable;

                  <p>"I was induced to walk" replied this charming fair, "from the ſame motive which ſeems to have prompted you, and coming to this winding brook, I felt a ſymphathy which touched my heart, iſſue from the ſound of its curling ſtreams, gliding ſtill ſoftly, roaring over the bed of rooks, which ſeemed to attempt in vain, to ſtop its determined courſe.

One who pretended to be my friend, intimated to my father that the amiable <hi>Sylvander</hi> viſited him for the ſake of his daughter, and was actually paying his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes; this was ſufficient to induce my father to refuſe <hi>Sylvander</hi> any future admiſſion to his houſe, and order me to forbid his coming. My duty obliged me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the painful taſk; this did not, however, by any means diſſolve my paſſion; on the contrary it ſeemed rather to augment it, and I endeavored to alleviate the poignancy of his grief, by giving him every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity I was able, to be in my company; but the plot was ſoon diſcovered, and for my own peace and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination I ever had to follow the dictates of my beloved parent, I was obliged to beg my lover never to ſee me more. To forget him was impoſſible. His views were repreſented in ſo unfair a light, that my father, on al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all occaſions, ſeemed to take pains to make his name odious to me.

The precious moments he fondly dedicated to my diverſions ſerved to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, in ſome meaſure, the pains of an aching heart, and reconcile my mind to the hard laws of fate. Our attachment and our affection were mutual. At his death—I felt all the force of his obſervations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my unfortunate <hi>Sylvander,</hi> and in the agony of my grief proteſted never to encourage his addreſſes. I have to my ſorrow kept my word. When I told him my determination, and the impreſſion the ſentiments of my father had made on my mind, a pale coldneſs ſeemed to overſpread his face, and a tear ſtartling from his eye, melted my very heart in his favor. Had he urged with energy his propoſals, my innate fortitude was incapable of withſtanding the force of his arguments, or making any powerful reſiſtance to the well applied obſervations he might have made—but he was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident!—However tenderly I might have loved the dear author (after God) of my exiſtence, I muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſuggeſt that the attempt of a parent to control the propenſities of a child in this point, is exceedingly wrong; it is too frequently the means of their miſery, and never of benefit; a child will always harken to a parent's advice when reaſonably offered, but ſeverity oftentimes injuries the point they mean to enforce.—I was now expoſed to the the world, without a friend, as it were, to recur to, for the leaſt advice.

my acquaintance, and endeavored to obtain with my perſon, that part of my father's hard earnings which fell to my lot. I refuſed many offers; at length I concluded on one who in many reſpects reſembled my <hi>Sylvander</hi>; there ſeemed a great ſimilarity in their manners, and I affected to have a neceſſary fondneſs for the one I had ſingled out, for the partner of my life. I was married in leſs than twelve months after the death of my father, and ſhall I add, in ſpite of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to a perſon I never could love with any degree of ſincerity. I have however this ſatisfactory reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I never cauſed him a moment's diſquietude on account of his extravagant diſſipation, which aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented my averſion to him. I carefully concealed my hatred, and notwithſtanding the regret with which I parted with him, I found that had not heaven have been pleaſed to call him hence, my ſituation would have been reduced to the moſt abject ſtate of beggary. When my affairs came to be liquidated, I found that the greater part of my fortune was ſpent, and that the ſmall houſe and farm adjacent were the only remnants of my riches.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after my marriage <hi>Sylvander</hi> embarked for <hi>England,</hi> much out of health, his ſpirits broken, and dejected to a degree exciting pity. I learned ſome time after, that he had jumped or fallen overboard on the paſſage.

In a year after my nuptials I was preſented with a ſon who lived only three months;—to add to my grief, death prematurely

I perſuaded the dear girl of the conſtant ſincerity of my heart, and the purity of my ſentiments, which no circumſtance had been powerful enough to deſtroy; for real affection and genuine love are durable as life, and no change in human affairs can extinguiſh the pure diſintereſted flame.

I have not yet ſeen my friends, continued I; late this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I arrived in this place, and to morrow morning I muſt go to the capital, and in the evening will return and be every thing you wiſh. "I feel too anxious, replied the charming <hi>Lavina,</hi> to diſpenſe ſo long with what ſo materially intereſts my feelings." I then told her, in a few words, that after leaving <hi>America,</hi> my fixed melancholy was noticed during my paſſage to <hi>London</hi> by the Captain and crew. I happened to be the only paſſenger on board, and I frequently begged the Captain and likewiſe the ſailors at ſeveral times, to throw me into the ſea, but none would ſo far befriend me. I wiſhed to be relieved from my wretched diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude of mind, but ſhuddered at the idea of ſelf deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction. I told the Captain the cauſe of my grief, &amp; the affliction of my heart; his benevolence and philanthropy, virtues which ſhone conſpicuouſly in the character of this execellent man, induced him from that moment, to become my ſincere friend. He informed me I might embark very advantageouſly in an Eaſtindiaman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to his friend in <hi>London,</hi> and place to advantage the funds I had with me in the enterpriſe, and that he would undertake to conduct the affair.

Altho he laughed at the idea, yet it appears that ſome of them have executed with ſucceſs this piece of buſineſs.

               <p>IN the north weſt parts of Scotland, in the reign of Malcolm, and cotemporary with the uſurper Macbeth, whoſe hiſtory our immortal Shakeſpear has made the ſubject of one of his tragedies, there lived two young noblemen, at the head of two parties, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> mortal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of one another. Scarce a week paſſed, at thoſe times when the families were near one another, without accounts of rapes, of duels, and of private murthers; for the hatred was ſo univerſally ſtrong thro the whole multitude, that from the lord to the meaneſt ſervant, all thought it a merit and an honor to injure, even in the moſt diſhoneſt manner, any body that belonged in any degree to the enemy's party.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:032707_0158_0FF42B8658F19EC0"/>The names of the two young noblemen, at this time at the head of theſe parties, were <hi>Seaton</hi> and <hi>Kintair</hi>; the former, a youth of a moſt promiſing genius and great abilities, joined to great integrity, and an earneſt love of virtue; his hereditary hatred to the Kintairs was, in ſhort, the only thing that could ſully his character; and that he governed in ſuch a manner, that had it not been for the temper of his enemy, the world ſaw the family quarrel might have been made up between them, and a deal of miſery and bloodſhed prevented to the country; but ſuch was the implacable hatred and native cruelty of the young Kintair, that all offers of this kind in his life muſt have been vain, and could only have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the goodneſs of the offerer to the imputations of weakneſs, cowardice, and fear. The violent Kintair was in his temper bloody, revengeful, pityleſs, and ſavagely cruel, to a degree ſcarce to be conceived; ye all theſe violent paſſions and all his hatred to the Seaton family, could not prevent his falling in love, at firſt ſight, with one of that houſe, indeed the ſiſter, though he at firſt knew it not, of the very lord he hated ſo implacably.</p>
               <p>This lady, whoſe name was Margaret, had nor only a very charming perſon; but the innate virtues of her ſoul diſplayed themſelves outwardly in her face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whole deportment, and gave her an air and manner not to be reſiſted; ſhe had a twin ſiſter, ſo like her in every feature and lineament of face, that they were not eaſily to be known aſunder, theſe were the only relations of the young Seaton; and, with him, made all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that noble and antient family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="unknown:032707_0159_0FF433A344431468"/>Opportunities of meeting, it is eaſy to imagine, were not very frequent between theſe two families, eſpecially between the heads of them: in ſhort, it happened that the rough Kintair had never ſeen this lady, till one evening as ſhe was returning on horſe back from a viſit to a friend at ſome miles diſtance, he met her, as he was going acroſs the country, attended by half a dozen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to a party of diverſion. The moment he beheld her, he ſtopped his horſe, ordered as polite a meſſage a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he could dictate to be delivered to her, and begged h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> might have leave to ſpeak to her: the lady alighted from her horſe, and readily admitted him: when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her, he threw himſelf upon his knees, intreated her to tell him her condition; and, if the laws of honor would permit it, he would make her wife to the firſt nobleman of the country; for that he was the lord Kintair. The lady, who had till that word heard him with a downcaſt look, and a face covered with a bluſh of modeſty, now immediatly leaped on her horſe again, and told him; young lord, one word will anſwer you; my name is Maraget Seaton. And, thus ſaying, ſhe purſued her journey.</p>
               <p>Words are too faint to deſcribe the conflict of raging paſſions in the breaſt of the wild Kintair, on this occaſion; love, anger, pride, revenge, the loſt hopes of enjoyment of the lady, and the diſdain of a refuſal, all combating together in his breaſt, left him no room at firſt for words, or for any reſolution: he thew himſelf on the ground, and tore up the very earth in agony: at length, ariſing in a fury, he bade his ſervants follow, and bring her and her attendants back to him:
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032707_0160_0FF433D930AD45F0"/>
they were not got far, however, before he changed his opinion; and, thinking of the uncertainty of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as the lady's attendants were equal to them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and determining to truſt his revenge to nobody but himſelf, he mounted his horſe and followed them.</p>
               <p>Love and revenge gave him wings; he ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took his own ſervants, and, quickly after, the lady Margaret and hers: he rode up to her, and addreſſed himſelf to her a ſecond time in theſe words: Inſolent ideot, did you imagine you could eſcape me thus, and that I would let you go home to make your brother ſport with my entreaties, and your proud refuſal? no! think not that I would marry the ſiſter of a man I hate; or be the ſcandalous means, by a boyiſh paſſion, of making up an enmity, which has ſo juſt a cauſe as that between our families; and which I hope, will be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. There is a ſhorter way for me to ſatiate my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; one that gives me too a double pleaſure; as it ſeeds at once my hatred and my love, and gives me the nobleſt revenge on all your houſe, that my hate can even wiſh: with theſe words, he gave the ſignal of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his attendants, who deſtroyed all the unhappy lady's ſervants, after a ſhort conflict; during which, the inhuman lord raviſhed their miſerable miſtreſs. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a moment after this, tho too late, alas! to prevent it, a party of near an hundred of the Seatons appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a neighboring hill; they, however, ſaw nothing of this; but the ſavage raviſher, fearing to be overpowered by numbers, mounted his horſe, and with his attendants rode off in haſte thro the woods. The Seatons paſſed
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032707_0161_0FF433A787DA2D78"/>
another way; and the wretched lady was in a moment left alone, encompaſſed with the horrors of her own fate, the carcaſes of her murthered ſervants, and the bloody weapons of the murtherers, which their haſte to get away, on ſight of the other party, had made them leave. Her firſt reſolution was, to end her life and miſery together, by plunging one of the daggers into her own boſom; but religion forbidding, and her own ſhame preventing her returning home, ſhe came to a final reſolution, of hiding herſelf from the world for ever; and picking up the weapons to lay before her, as an eternal remembrance of the horrid ſcene: ſhe made her way to a diſtant cottage, where ſhe told her ſtory; and, giving to the poor honeſt hands her money, jewels, and whatever elſe of value ſhe had about her, ſwore them to an eternal ſecrecy, and conjured them to let her ſpend the remainder of a miſerable life with them.</p>
               <p>The bloody Kintair, as ſoon as he had got to a place of ſafety, ſat down with his attendants, exulted with them in the ſucceſs of his monſtrous villainy, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſwore he never taſted the pleaſures of revenge before; he praiſed their courage, gave them a number of preſents, promiſed them a thouſand more; and, finally, bound himſelf in an aſſociation with them, to make them his companions and his friends forever; and give them all eſtates, provided they joined heartily with him in proſecuting a ſcene of vengeance, which he told them he had now concerted; and of which this was but the auſpicious beginning. All were proud of the honor their lord did them; and all, with the ſevereſt impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032707_0162_0FF42B8E859FCDD8"/>
entered into the aſſociation he propoſed, of nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſting till the family of the Seatons, conſiſting now of three perſons only, ſhould be extinct.</p>
               <p>Friends and brothers in revenge, ſaid Kintair on this, hear me now, and know the firſt ſtep to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is this: the lady whom I have enjoyed muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; this muſt be the firſt act; and you ſhall then ſee, and be ſurpriſed at my concerted vengeance. I had not ſpared her, but for the party that we ſaw above us; but now the deſperate attempt muſt be to ſeize her again ere ſhe gets home, and kill her on the ſpot where I enjoyed her; this completes my yet unfiniſhed ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on her, and leads you beſides to a ſcene of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated miſchief, with which my brain is full, but which you can yet have no idea of.</p>
               <p>The words were no ſooner uttered, but all were up and ready for the enterpriſe; and made that haſte, that they ſoon got forwarder than ſhe could poſſibly have been by that time, had ſhe continued her journey home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; here they pitched on a thick wood, thro which the road to the caſtle of the Seatons lay, and waited for the unfortunate lady. She, poor creature, was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed than they imagined; but her ſiſter the lady Jane, unfortunately for her, had the ſame day been abroad to ſome little diſtance, and returning home in the duſk of the evening alone, the villains immediately ſeized on her, and, according to the orders of their lord carried her to the fatal place where the rape and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been before commmitted. It was late in the night before they arrived there; and the moon ſhining bright, the diſtracted lady Margaret had left her cottage
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032707_0163_0FF433A90A9770E8"/>
and wandered to weep her ſorrows at the fatal place where the horrid act had been committed; ſhe was here toſſing herſelf on the ground, and making the rocks and woods reſound with her diſtracted cries, when the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers approached with their unhappy prey; the trampling of horſes, the oaths and blaſphemies of the company, and the known voice of the hated Kintair ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the unfortunate lady Margaret ſo, that ſhe crept among buſhes and thorns which wounded her tender ſkin as ſhe paſſed on at every ſtep, till ſhe came to a thicket, behind which ſhe reſted to liſten to the noiſe of theſe abandoned ruffians. They were now come to the place, and the ſervants throwing down the unfortunate and miſtaken victim of their fury, whoſe mouth they had before ſtopped, and tyed over with handkerchiefs, to prevent her outcries, no voice was heard but of the ſavage Kintair, who, walking up to her, cried in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting tone, We were prevented, lady, this morning, but here is now a favor that you ſhall own ſtrikes you to the heart: with theſe words he plunged his ſword into her boſom, and put an end to her life, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering his miſtake. As ſoon as the unfortunate lady fell, the inhuman murtherer ſeating himſelf on her body, yet ſtruggling in the agonies of death, ſaid to his attendants, Now, friends, hear the utmoſt of my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; alarm you the neighboring villages with cries of murther; theſe other bodies are yet warm, and they ſhall be made to believe all fell together; I will join in the croud that firſt comes, and do you, Farquarſon (ſpeaking to one of his ſervants) mount the ſwifteſt horſe, and, as you ſee us approach, ride with your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:032707_0164_0FF433DF0D1307D8"/>
ſpeed towards Seaton caſtle, then round the heath and join us, and you ſhall be rejoiced at what my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge ſhall make of this. Immediately all ſeparated to the work; and the afflicted lady Margaret took that opportunity to get back to her cottage; ſhe was ſcarce there when the whole country was raiſed; the bloody Kintair joined the mob; and Farquarſon, when they came in ſight, fled, as he was ordered, before them; Kintair purſued him, with a number of the clowns; and when he was got from them, that monſter of villainy returned, aſſured, and perſuaded his followers, that it was lord Seaton who ſled before them. The clowns, willing to ſhow their diſcernment, agreed to a man, that they knew him all the way he went, and knew the horſe he rode on; and on now viewing the bodies of the murthered perſons, the abandoned Kintair perſuaded every body, that this Seaton had debauched his ſiſter, and brought her hither, where with the aſſiſtance of his other ſervants, he had murthered her, and all who were there preſent. His own people, it is eaſy to imagine, joined readily in this, and the reſt were ſoon brought over to follow their opinion: as ſoon as Kintair found this, he made them a long declamation on the horror of the crime, and perſuaded them all to follow him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the next large town, and relate before the magiſtracy what they had ſeen. His perſuaſions, and the rewards he promiſed to all that would go with him, made every one preſent follow; and immediately they ſet forward, tho in the night, and never ſtopped or ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till they arrived at the end of their journey. All the way, as they went on, the villainous Kintair's attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032707_0165_0FF433ACC61816D0"/>
extolled the generoſity, the goodneſs, and love of juſtice their maſter ſhowed in this; and partly by theſe praiſes, and partly by promiſed reward to all that ſhould be able to give material evidence againſt the murtherers, the clowns were led into forming a thouſand circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, all poſitive, againſt the pretended murtherer. When they arrived at the town, it happened that the magiſtracy was at that time ſitting: they were all rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this, and went in a body to the hall; and, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding (on account of the horrid enormity of the crime they came to give evidence in) an immediate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinence, were admitted. The arch-devil Kintair en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering at their head, recounted to the magiſtracy the ſtory he had before concerted, and ſwore to the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the perſon he accuſed; his ſervants all follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his example, and, unwilling to ſay ſomething from their own knowledge, each ſingled out ſome one by name of the innocent Seaton's ſervants, whom they accuſed of the murther of the attendants; and the clowns joining their poſitive oaths to the ſame facts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other forged circumſtances, the abſent Seaton and ſix of his attendants were accuſed of a moſt horrid murther, on the poſitive oaths of more than thirty perſons, who all declared themſelves to have been eye witneſſes of the facts they alledged againſt them.</p>
               <p>The innocent lord Seaton knew nothing of any part of this fatal tragedy, but was returning to his caſtle with ſome of his ſervants, from a ſhort journey he had taken to meet his ſiſters, when he was ſeized by the officers of juſtice ſent to apprehend him: all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are conſtrued into meaning by people poſſeſſed
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032707_0166_0FF433E2AEDC98E8"/>
of an opinion; and accordingly, this unhappy lord being now found returning with a number of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from that part of the country where the murther had been committed, was looked on as a proof of his having been committing it; and the agonies of grief, aſtoniſhment, and horror with which he received the news of the death of his beloved ſiſter, and his ſervants, were conſtrued into confeſſions of his guilt.</p>
               <p>The miſtake of the two-ſiſters was not found out; and the poſitives oaths of all the accuſers, that it was lady Margaret that was murthered, made it not at all doubted. The unfortunate lady was glad of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, wiſhing, ſince the rape, for nothing but to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the whole world; and looking on this as the moſt ſecure of all the means of being ſo, would never, had ſhe not afterwards felt the then neceſſity that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled her to it, have declared herſelf to the world.</p>
               <p>A ſhort journey brought the accuſed lord before the magiſtracy; he entered the room before they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him, and immediately on his appearance all the accuſers renewed their oaths, that he and his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants who were now with him, were the very perſons who had committed the murthers; and the vile Kintair made a long harrangue to the court, aggravating in the ſtrongeſt manner the horror of the crime, and adding a thouſand reproaches. When he had done, the accuſed lord advanced toward his judges with a ſettled coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and looking with diſdain on his accuſer, and on his judges with that modeſt, but intrepid confidence, which conſcious innocence ever gives, ſpoke in the following manner:

               <p>Here the accuſed ended his defence, which was ſoon overpowered by the number and repeated oaths of the evidences and particularly of his enemy Kintair, who aſſerted that he ſaw him plunge his dagger in the breaſt of the lady Margaret, and ſaw the others butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering her attendants. The ſupreme judge was now riſing from his ſeat, to pronounce ſentence on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed lord and his attendants, when a voice was heard crying with the utmoſt earneſtneſs, Forbear! forbear, oh judge guard well the doors that none eſcape; and at the ſame inſtant, a woman threw herſelf at the feet of the judges, crying out, I am that Margaret, whom this innocent this beſt of brothers is accuſed of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering;

The court all roſe in a moment, aſtoniſhed at her appearance; the brother threw himſelf on her neck in a tranſport of joy, and the court examining the daggers, and finding on each the name of its owner, demanded of the lady the true hiſtory of the fact. She on this related the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe in the moſt pathetic terms. And when ſhe had heard the ſentence, intended for her brother and his ſervants, paſſed on his accuſers, ſhe retired into a nunnery, and left the innocent, but unhappy Seaton in the poſſeſſion of his own, and the forfeited eſtate and titles of his accuſer; which his deſcendants, the Seatons of that country, enjoy to this day.</p>

The pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diſtreſs, and the throbbings of the heart at the critical moment of impending miſery; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous tribute in return for the pureſt philanthropic intentions, ſhall be my theme. Ingratitude, has, from the earlieſt ages, been treated with juſt contempt, and
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032707_0169_0FF433B119891818"/>
inceſſant pains have been taken to publiſh the deed, and lay open to mankind the hated miſcreant, guilty of ſo vile a ſtain; a crime of the greateſt magnitude in the ſight of heaven, and generally regarded as heinous and contemptible by the inhabitants of this lower world.</p>
               <p>I was led to theſe reflections, from a circumſtance which took place not long after the peace. It will be recollected, that at the cloſe of the late war, between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> the latter was as memorable for failures among its merchants, as during the conteſt, the ſucceſs of their trade had been remarkable. At this period the unfortunate <hi>Douxville</hi> (as I ſhall here call him) from his extenſive trade, experienced repeated ſhocks by bankruptcies and the death of inſolvent debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; theſe, added to ill ſucceſs in navigation, reduced a handſome fortune to the confines of a very ſmall capital, all of which he could not call his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Douxville,</hi> was a foreigner, of a compaſſionate turn of mind, and a diſpoſition truly amiable. It always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted him to calm the afflictions of his fellow coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, who were indigent through misfortunes. Theſe he ſeemed to entertain with an extreme plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, even from the ſlighteſt recommendation. It was in the days of his proſperity when mirth was the product of every moment; when affluence had ceaſed to afford in real enjoyment, and the exquiſite refinements of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure had loſt their verdant ſmiles, ariſing from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſion of them, that chance preſented to his hoſpitalitie board his former friend <hi>Raymond,</hi> to whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> fortune had been illiberal in the diſtribution
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032707_0170_0FF433E91B1F3CC0"/>
of her favours. He had contracted an intimacy with <hi>Raymond</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and found his family to be rather in opulent that middling circumſtances. They offered him a handſome capital on his enterance into buſineſs; with which he purchaſed goods and came to <hi>America</hi> a little before the peace; but through misfortunes on the one hand, and entering into ſpeculations he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unacquainted with, on the other, he reduced himſelf to mere penury. <hi>Raymond</hi> was a young man who united to a getneel perſon and polite addreſs, the advantages of an extenſive education; but deſtitute, without a hope, when introduced to <hi>Douxville,</hi> whoſe generoſity, from diſintereſted friendſhip alone, taught him to recognize the friendleſs object. <hi>Douxville,</hi> whoſe hoſpitality was conſpicious on every occaſion, and whoſe liberality the ſhadow of meanneſs never eclipſed, invited him to his houſe, and made him his companion and boſom friend. The impreſſions ſuch diſtinguiſhed kindneſs wrought upon feelings of the diſtreſſed <hi>Raymond,</hi> can be eaſily conceived of. He accepted the invitation with all the aſſurances, that a mind penetrated with the extent of the obligation is capable of teſtifying: But it appears by the event, that this ſentiment of gratitude was only momentary; and theſe outward demonſtrations were, by no means the genuine effuſions of a good heart. The time however was now arrived, when the beneficent acts of real friendſhip could be in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid; fidelity inviolable, and attachment ſincere, were all that became neceſſary. It was at this time <hi>Douxville,</hi> taking into ſerious conſideration his extreme reverſe of fortune, reflected with ſome ſecret ſatisfaction, that
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032707_0171_0FF42B4AEDB4BEA0"/>
a friend was left him, to whom he could diſcloſe without any kind of reſerve, the exact eſtate of his affairs. From the ſtagnation of buſineſs in <hi>America,</hi> he found he ſhould be totally ruined to continue, and therefore, ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the plan of collecting together the feeble remains of his ſhattered fortune, and ſailing for the Weſtindies, in a veſſel which he had, to endeavour to repair his loſſes by a few ſucceſsful voyages in thoſe parts. From a miſtaken conception of merit, and a falſe idea of friendſhip in the object he had ſelected for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, he thought to place the moſt implicit confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the wretch he had prevented from famiſhing; one whom gratitude ought to have very ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced to ſtrict fidelity. But behold! a fatal reverſe. The ſmall capital that remained in <hi>Douxville's</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would not admit of diminution without injury to his trade; and owing ſeveral ſums in the Weſtindies, though not very conſiderable, he thought it moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſecure his property, in ſuch a manner as not to have it arreſted from him by ſeizure in the ports where his buſineſs might lead him. To this effect, he propoſed to convey the veſſel and cargo by a bill of ſale to <hi>Raymond</hi>; the latter promoted the idea with all the warmth of apparent friendſhip, and the plan was duly carried into execution. They purſued their voyage, and arriving in the Weſtindies, found every thing to exceed their moſt ſanguine expectations. Fortune to appearance began once more to diſplay her lucid beams over the head of the unhappy <hi>Douxville.</hi> The cargo was diſpoſed of in the name of <hi>Raymond,</hi> and the profits afforded <hi>Douxville</hi> the pleaſing hopes of
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:032707_0172_0FF433ED6D9A54E8"/>
a ſpeedy termination with his creditors in a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iſland. Theſe did not long remain ignorant of his being there, and improved the firſt opportunity to ſend and arreſt him. From the confidence he placed in the efforts, of his pretended friend, he ſuffered himſelf to be conducted to priſon, in perference to making any attempts to eſcape; and the gates were ſhut againſt him, never to be opened for his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The falſe <hi>Raymond</hi> continued the maſk no longer than an opportunity offered for caſting off the diſſembling veil; and the property which he was firſt led to regard as imaginary, he now claimed as his lawful right. He was ſent for, from the darkſome cell, and called on by the voice of his benefactor from the black receſs of a priſon. But the hardened wretch was deaf to the calls of him who had been his trueſt friend, whoſe abſence ſerved to ſuppreſs all kind of fear and reſtraint. His anſwers, when he condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make any, were vile as the mouth that uttered them, the imports of which were, that he had been his friend already too long, and that the period was now arrived that muſt terminate all further intercourſe between them. He pretended ignorance of having any obligations to him, and affected to deſpiſe him as an impoſtor; one for whom repeated favours had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irkſome, by their conſtant ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>Confined within the walls of a loathſome goal, the unhappy <hi>Douxville</hi> was unable to juſtify himſelf to the world, or to obtain the leaſt juſtice from a wretch loſt to all the feelings of humanity. In vain did the now miſerable <hi>Douxville,</hi> by pathetic remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,

endeavour to raiſe a grateful ſentiment in his breaſt.—Equally vain were his attempts to prove the property his and offer it in preference to his cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itors in payment of his juſt debts. It was in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a wretch undaunted by threats and demands, and whoſe heart was thoroughly ſteeled againſt the ſoft language of milder intreaties. Every effort to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain juſtice became futile, and the hardened villian ſailed in a few days from the ſhore, leaving his trueſt friend in the deepeſt affliction and loweſt miſery, to worry out the remainder of his exiſtence in a priſon; where he was ſoon overcome by the weight of his grief, ſurviving only a few days the departure of the wretch who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted his ruin and terminated his exiſtence. How fatal the effects of miſplaced confidence! The perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of this horrid deed did not however eſcape with impunity.

He was precipitated from the quarter deck into the ſea, and toſſed by the vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting flood upon rocks which mangled his limbs and body in a ſhocking manner.

Inſenſible man open the eyes of thy ſoul, and make a choice worthy of thy judgment. The beauty that ſo inchants thee is but the morning flower, which in the evening fading thou wilt caſt it away.

               <p>This ſong ſoon found its way to Gemil. He was ſtruck with the beauty of it, and the truths it conveyed.

               <head>THE HISTORY OF <hi>LEONORA,</hi> OR THE UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORTUNATE JILT.</head>
               <p>LEONORA was the daughter of a gentleman of fortune; ſhe was tall and well-ſhaped, with a ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in her countenance, which often attracts beyond more regular features joined with an inſipid air; nor is this kind of beauty leſs apt to deceive than allure the good humor which it indicates, being often miſtaken for good nature, and the vivacity for true underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Leonora, who was now at the age of eighteen, lived with an aunt of her's in a town in the north of England. She was an extreme lover of gaiety; and very rarely miſſed a ball, or any other public aſſembly; where ſhe had frequently opportunities of ſatisfying a greedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of vanity with the preference which was given her by the men to almoſt every other woman preſent.</p>
               <p>Among many young fellows who were particular in their gallantries towards her, Horatio ſoon diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf in her eyes beyond all his competitors; ſhe danced with more than ordinary gaiety when he happened to be her partner; neither the fairneſs of the evening nor the muſic of the nightingale, could length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her walk like his company. She affected no longer to underſtand the civilities of others: whilſt ſhe inclined ſo attentive an air to every compliment of Horatio, that ſhe often ſmiled even when it was too delicate for her comprehenſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:032707_0178_0FF433F115892F00"/>Horatio, was a young gentleman of a good family <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>red to the law, and had been ſome few years called to the degree of a barriſter. His face and perſon were ſuch as the generality allowed handſome: but he had a dignity in his air very rarely to be ſeen. His temper was of the ſaturnine complexion, and without the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aint of moroſeneſs. He had wit and humor, with an inclination to ſatire, which he indulged rather too much.</p>
               <p>This gentleman, who had contracted the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion for Leonora, was the laſt perſon who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the probability of its ſucceſs. The whole town had made the match for him, before he himſelf had drawn a confidence from her actions ſufficient to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his paſſion to her; for it was his opinion, (and perhaps he was there in the right) that it is highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic to talk ſeriouſly of love to a woman before you have made ſuch a progreſs in her affections, that ſhe herſelf expects and deſires to hear it.</p>
               <p>But whatever diffidence the fears of a lover may create, which are apt to magnify every favor conferred on a rival, and to ſee the little advances towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves thro the other end of the perſpective; it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Horatio's paſſion ſhould ſo blind his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as to prevent his conceiving hopes from the behavior of Leonora, whoſe fondneſs for him was now as viſible to an indifferent perſon in their company, as his for her.</p>
               <p>It was in the midſt of a gay converſation in the walks one evening, when Horatio whiſpered Leonora, that he was deſirous to take a turn or two with her in

               </p>
               <p>Leonora, who very much ſuſpected what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would have deferred it till another time: but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, who had more than half conquered the difficulty of ſpeaking, by the firſt motion, was ſo very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that ſhe at laſt yielded, and leaving the reſt of the company, they turned aſide into an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented walk.</p>
               <p>They had retired far out of the ſight of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, both maintaining a ſtrict ſilence. At laſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio made a full ſtop, and taking Leonora, who ſtood pail and trembling, gently by the hand, he fetched a deep ſigh, and then looking on her eyes with all the tenderneſs imaginable, he cried out in a faltering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; 'O Leonora! it is neceſſary for me to declare to you on what the future happineſs of my life muſt be founded! Muſt I ſay, there is ſomething belonging to you which is a bar to my happineſs, and which unleſs you will part with, I muſt be miſerable?' 'What can that be,' replied Leonora?— 'No wonder,' ſaid he, 'you are ſurprized that I ſhould make an objection to any thing which is yours, yet ſure you may gueſs, ſince it is the only one which the riches of the world, if they were mine, ſhould purchaſe of me—Oh it is that which you muſt part with, to beſtow all the reſt! Can Leonora, or rather will ſhe, doubt longer?—Let me then whiſper it in her ears,—It is your name,

               <p>Leonora, covered with bluſhes, and with as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry a look as ſhe could poſſibly put on, told him, that had ſhe ſuſpected what his declaration would have been, he ſhould not have decoyed her from her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; that he had ſo ſurprized and frightened her, that ſhe begged him to convey her back as quick as poſſible; which he, trembling very near as much as herſelf, did.</p>
               <p>Many weeks had not paſs'd after this interview, before Horatio and Leonora were what they call on a good footing together. All ceremonies except the laſt were now over; the writings were now drawn, and every thing was in the utmoſt forwardneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to the putting Horatio in poſſeſſion of all his wiſhes. I will, if you pleaſe, repeat you a letter from each of them which I have got by heart, and which will give you no ſmall idea of their paſſion on both ſides.</p>

                  <p>Matters were in ſo great forwardneſs between this fond couple, that the day was fixed for their marriage and was now within a fortnight, when the ſeſſions chanced to be held for that county in a town about twenty miles diſtance from that which is the ſcene of our ſtory.

                  <p>The ſame afternoon in which he left the town, as Leonora ſtood at her window, a coach and ſix paſſed by, which ſhe declared to be the compleateſt, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeleſt, prettieſt equipage ſhe ever ſaw; adding theſe remarkable words, 'O I am in love with that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He had on a cut velvet coat of a cinnamon colour, lined with a pink ſattin, embroidered all over with gold: his waiſtcoat, which was cloth of ſilver, was embroidered with gold likewiſe.

However, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it ſo far, before he had power to correct himſelf, that every perſon in the room eaſily diſcovered where his admiration was ſettled. The other ladies began to ſingle out their former partners, all perceived who would be Bellarmine's choice; which they however endeavoured, by all poſſible means, to prevent: Many of them ſaying to Leonora, 'O, Madam, I ſuppoſe we ſhan't have the pleaſure of ſeeing you dance to night;' and then crying out, in Bellarmine's hearing, 'O Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora will not dance, I aſſure you; her partner is not here.' One maliciouſly attempted to prevent her, by ſending a diſagreeable fellow to aſk her, that ſo ſhe might be obliged either to dance with him, or ſit down: but this ſcheme proved abortive.</p>

In a word, her carriage was abſurd as her deſires, which were, to affect an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of the ſtranger's admiration, and at that ſame time a triumph, from that admiration, over every wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the room.</p>
                  <p>In this temper of mind, Bellarmine, having enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who ſhe was, advanced to her, and with a low bow begged the honor of dancing with her, which ſhe with a low court'ſy immediately granted. She danced with him all night, and enjoyed perhaps the higheſt pleaſure that ſhe was capable of feeling.</p>
                  <p>Leonora retired about ſix in the morning, but not to reſt. She tumbled and toſſed in her bed, with very ſhort intervals of ſleep, and thoſe entirely filled with dreams of the equipage, and fine clothes ſhe had ſeen, and the balls, operas, and ridottos, which had been the ſubject of their converſation.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon, Bellarmine, in the dear coach and ſix, came to wait on her. He was indeed charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her perſon, and was, on enquiry, ſo well pleaſed with the circumſtances of her father (for he himſelf, notwithſtanding all his finery, was not quite ſo rich as Croeius or an Attalus.) He was ſo pleaſed I ſay, that he reſolved to make his addreſſes to her directly.

                  <p>From the opening of the aſſembly till the end of Bellarmine's viſit, Leonora had ſcarce once thought of Horatio; but he now began, tho an unwelcome gueſt, to enter into her mind. She wiſhed ſhe had ſeen the charming Bellarmine and his charming equipage, before matters had gone ſo far.

                  <p>The next morning Bellarmine breakfaſted with her in preſence of her aunt, whom he ſufficiently informed of his paſſion of Leonora: he was no ſooner withdrawn, than the old lady began to adviſe her nice on this occaſion—'You ſee, child, (ſays ſhe) what fortune hath thrown in your way; and I hope you will not withſtand your own preferment.' Leonora ſighing, 'begged her not to mention any ſuch thing, when ſhe knew her engagements to Horatio.' 'Engagements to a fig,' cryed the aunt; 'you ſhould thank heaven on your knees, that you have it yet in your power to break them. Will any woman heſitate a moment, whether ſhe ſhall ride in a coach, or walk on foot all the days of her life?—But Bellarmine drives ſix, and Horatio not even a pair.' 'Yes,' 'but, Madam, what will the world ſay?' anſwered Leonora; 'will they not condemn me?' 'The world is always on the ſide of

'O leave that to me,' ſays the aunt. 'You know your father hath not been acquainted with the affair.

'All French,' ſays he, 'I aſſure you, except the great coats; I never truſt any thing more than a great coat to an Engliſhman; you know one muſt encourage our own people what one can, eſpecially as, before I had a place, I was in the country intereſt, he, he, he! but for myſelf, I would ſee the dirty iſland at the bottom of the ſea, rather than wear a ſingle rag of Engliſh work about me; and I am ſure after you have made one tour to Paris, you will be of the ſame opinion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your own clothes.

                  <p>With ſuch ſort of polite diſcourſe did the gay Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine entertain his beloved Leonora, when the door opened on a ſudden, and Horatio entered the room. Here 'tis impoſſible to expeſs the ſurprize of Leonora.</p>

''Tis indifferent to me,' ſays ſhe, how you underſtand me; but I think ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a viſit is difficult to be underſtood at all, at leaſt when people find one engaged; though one's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do not deny one, one may expect a well-bred perſon ſhould ſoon take the hint.'

'Does any man dare affront this lady before me, d—n me?' 'Hearkee, Sir,' ſays Horatio, 'I would adviſe you to lay aſide that fierce air; for I am mightily deceived, if this lady has not a violent deſire to get your worſhip a good drubbing.'

She convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him that he was never more awake in his life, and that nothing more extraordinary had happened in his three days abſence, than a ſmall alteration in the affections of Leonora; who now burſt into tears, and wondered what reaſon ſhe had given him to uſe her in
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032707_0193_0FF4340377EBB838"/>
ſo barbarous a manner. Horatio deſired Bellarmine to withdraw with him: but the ladies prevented it, by laying violent hands on the latter; upon which, the former took his leave without any great ceremony, and departed, leaving the lady with his rival to conſult for his ſafety, which Leonora feared her indiſcretion might have endangered: but the aunt comforted her with aſſurances, that Horatio, would not venture his perſon againſt ſo accompliſhed a cavalier as Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; and that, being a lawyer, he would ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in his own way, and the moſt they had to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from him was an action.</p>
                  <p>They at length therefore agreed to permit Bellarmine to retire to his lodgings, having firſt ſettled all matters relating to the journey which he was to undertake in the morning, and their preparations for the nuptials at his return.</p>
                  <p>But alas! as wiſe men have obſerved, the ſeat of val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or is not the countenance; and many a grave and plain man, will, on a juſt provocation, betake himſelf to that miſchievous metal, cold iron; while men of fiercer brow, and ſometimes with that emblem of courage, a cockade, will more prudently decline it.</p>
                  <p>Leonora was waked in the morning, from a viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry coach and fix, with the diſmal account, that Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine was run thro the body by Horatio: that he lay languiſhing at an inn, and the ſurgeons had declared the wound mortal. She immediately leaped out of the bed danced about the room in a frantic manner, tore her hair, and beat her breaſt in all the agonies of deſpair; in which ſad condition her aunt, who likewiſe aroſe at
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032707_0194_0FF433FFC7CDAE40"/>
the news, found her. The good old lady applied her almoſt art to comfort her niece. She told her, 'while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>here was life there was hope; but that if he ſhould die, her affliction ſhould be of no ſervice to Bellarmine, and would only expoſe herſelf, which might probably keep her ſome time without any future offer; that as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had happened, her wiſeſt way would be to think no more of Bellarmine, but to endeavor to regain the affections of Horatio.' 'Speak not to me,' cryed the diſconſolate Leonora; 'is it not owing to me, that poor Bellarmine has loſt his life? have not theſe curſed charms' (at which words ſhe looked ſtedfaſtly in the glaſs) 'been the ruin of the moſt charming man of his age? Can I ever bear to contemplate my own face again? (with her eyes ſtill fixed on the glaſs.) 'Am I not the murdreſs of the fineſt gentleman? no other woman in the town could have made any impreſſion on him.' 'Never think of things paſt,' cries the aunt, 'think of regaining the affections of Horatic.' 'What reaſon,' ſaid the niece, 'have I to hope he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me? No, I have loſt him as well as the other, and it was your wicked advice which was the occaſion of all; you ſeduced me, contrary to my inclinations, to abandon poor Horatio,' at which words ſhe burſt into tears; you prevailed upon me, whether I would or not, give up my affections for him; had it not been for you, Bellarmine never would have entered into my thoughts; had not his addreſſes been backed by your perſuaſions, they never would have made any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on me; I ſhould have defied all fortune and equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the world; but it was you, it was you, who got

Thoſe who adviſe young women for their intereſt, muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways expect ſuch a return: I am convinced my brother will thank me for breaking off your match with Horatio at any rate.' 'That may not be in your power yet,' anſwered Leonora; 'tho it is very ungrateful in you to deſire or attempt it, after the preſents you have received from him.' (For indeed true it is, that many preſents, and ſome pretty valuable ones, had paſſed from Horatio to the old lady: but as true it is, that Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, when he breakfaſted with her and her niece, had complimented her with a brilliant from his finger, of much greater value than all ſhe had touched of the ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Leonora's paſſion returned now for Bellarmine, with greater force after its ſmall relaxation than ever.

                  <p>The ladies of the town began to take her conduct under conſideration; it was the chief topic of diſcourſe at their tea tables, and was very ſeverely cenſured by the moſt part; eſpecially by Lindamira, a lady whoſe diſcreet and ſtarch carriage, together with a conſtant attendance at church three times a day, had utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated malicious attacks on her own reputation: for ſuch was the envy that Lindamira's virtue had attracted, that, notwithſtanding her own ſtrict behavior and ſtrict inquiry into the lives of others ſhe had not been able to eſcape being the mark of ſome arrows herſelf, which however did her no injury; a bleſſing perhaps owned by her to the clergy, who were her chief male compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and with two or three of whom ſhe had been bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly and unjuſtly calumniated.</p>

The many launces, and pieces of armour, that hung round the old hall, did not render it more reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, that did the unbounded benevolence of its preſent poſſeſſor. The poor ſat at his gate, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his liberal hand; and never a pilgrim repoſed in his porch, without remembering, in his oriſons, its hoſpitable owner.</p>
               <p>Saint Clair had allied himſelf in marriage with the Lady Margaret de Boys, a woman of high birth and rare endowments; whoſe accompliſhments might have embelliſhed the greateſt ſcenes, had not a love of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life and a religious caſt of mind, induced her to prefer retirement. All her leiſure hours, which her family did not call for, were ſpent in duties, which, in that age, ladies of the nobleſt rank exerciſed, without thinking they demeaned their ſtations;—ſhe relieved the indigent,—adviſed with the unfortunate,—viſited the ſick,—and brought up her <hi>Twin Daughters,</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Iſabella, in the ſame ſentiments;—accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them very early, to attend upon her in all thoſe acts of primitive piety. As theſe young ladies were the ſole iſſue of Saint Clair and Lady Margaret, they
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032707_0204_0FF42B3704900B88"/>
devoted their whole attention to their education; and and the comfort to find in their minds, ſo rich a ſoil, that every thing proſpered which was planted in them: —no uſeful knowledge was omitted,—no external ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment neglected.</p>
               <p>Frances and Iſabella were now arrived at the age of twenty five. The amiableneſs of their characters, their enlarged underſtanding, and the gracefulneſs of their perſons, won the admiration and eſteem of all who approached them. They had, from ſimilitude of manners, and ſentiment, contracted ſuch a rare affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for each other, that it ſeemed as if Nature, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them together in the womb, had prepared them for that extraordinary union, which was to diſtinguiſh their lives,—and for thoſe effuſions of elevated friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which the loſs of their exemplary mother was one day to call forth. Nor was this event very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote; Lady Margaret was ſeized by a ſudden illneſs which, in a few days, carried her off, and deſolated one of the happieſt families in the world.</p>
               <p>It would be difficult to deſcribe the ſounds of woe, which on this occaſion, echoed through all the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or the ſighs of the diſconſolate poor, under the windows.—The grief of Saint Clair, after the many years of uninterrupted happineſs that he had enjoyed with lady Margaret, in its firſt attack, almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered his reaſon;—whilſt Frances and Iſabella had the weight of a father's ſorrow added to their own; which compelled them to ſmother their feelings, great as they were, and to aſſume a fortitude their hearts diſavowed.</p>

               <p>The Saint Clair called in aid all his philoſophy, to ſupport himſelf under the loſs of his beloved Lady Margaret, yet he was worn, by a ſilent ſorrow, which had ſo viſible an effect on his health, as to menace his life; and which, in about a year, put an end to it.</p>
               <p>In this mournful interval, the greateſt comfort his dejected daughters received, was from the frequent viſits of their uncle, John de Saint Clair—who was at that time Abbot of the monaſtery of Saint Auguſtin, in Canterbury; of which place there are, at this day, ſuch noble remains exiſting. He was the younger brother of Geoffry, though there was but the difference of a year between them; and was reputed to be a man of ſo much learning and virtue, that Saint Clair, by his will, recommended his children to his care and protection; bequeathing to each of them a very large inheritance.</p>
               <p>—The manner in which Frances had been brought up, added to her natural turn of mind, and the example of a mother ſhe ſo much revered, determined her to a life

He deſired her to baniſh from her thought, ſuch a reſolution;—and failed not to intimate to her, that Frances, having devoted herſelf to the cloyſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe remained the only ſupport of the family of Saint Clair; that her virtues ſhould rather embelliſh ſociety, than be loſt within the walls of a monaſtery;—and wiſhed ſhe would, by accepting ſome alliance of ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rank and fortune, rather permit thoſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be ſeen by the world, which ſhe ſought to hide in oblivion.</p>
               <p>Frances, on her part, however ſhe was charmed with this teſtimony of her ſiſter's affection, joined in ſentiment with her uncle,—expreſſing to her, how much happier ſhe ſhould be, to ſee her ſettle herſelf by marriage, and imitate the good life and example of their excellent mother.—</p>

He was of good birth, though much inferior to Iſabella in fortune; his father's eſtate having greatly ſuffered in the confuſion of thoſe turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent times.</p>
               <p>Belville was now in his twentyninth year;—his figure was graceful and manly,—and, to a diſpoſition as

               <p>Belville, on his firſt return to England, a few years previous to the preſent period, had been honored by the patronage of Richard Duke of Glouceſter; near whoſe perſon he held an employment, which could not long diſpence with his abſence;—for that prince, being now mounted on the throne of England, the whole nation was thrown into an hoſtile ſtate.</p>
               <p>It will not be wondered at, if after Belville and Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella had been a few days together, their mutual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, and their mutual deſire to pleaſe, ſhould have made them much charmed with one another. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville felt himſelf enamoured of his fair companion,— and had the ſatisfaction to perceive, that his attention to her was not thrown away. Tho he took leave, after a ſhort time, to go to London, yet he found an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for returning very ſoon;—and having reaſon to think he had made a favorable impreſſion on Iſabella, did not long heſitate to propoſe himſelf to her, as one who would be happy to paſs his life in the ſociety of ſo engaging a woman. His offer was not leſs pleaſing to Iſabella, than it was to her uncle, and Frances;—the latter of whom agreed to give up to her ſiſter, her right

But the ſucceſsful progreſs that the arms of Henry of Richmond, now made in the kingdom, had obliged Richard to oppoſe them with his utmoſt force, and to ſummon all his ſervants to attend his camp; amongſt whom, as I before mentioned, was the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bridegroom; who at this time would moſt willingly have waved the ſervice, had not his own nice ſenſe of honor, and his zeal for his royal maſter, overcome ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery private motive.</p>

               <p>Thoſe who contemplated Belville a few weeks before, in the full vigour of youth, flattering himſelf with every expectation of happineſs, that virtue, fortune, and an union with one of the lovelieſt of woman, could preſent to his imagination; and now picture him, ſtretched on a poor pallet, ſurrounded by a parcel of mendicant friars,—his countenance ſhrunk and wan, —and his eyes fixed with humility, and reſignation, on a crucifix which they held before him,—cannot ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the contraſt, avoid dropping a ſigh, at the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of human hopes!—</p>

               <p>The arrival of Belville's Page, could not be long a ſecret to Iſabella, who was then at her uncle's; and whoſe mind inſtantly foreboded ſome extraordinary event;—tho the news of the battle had not yet reached that city.</p>

               <p>Iſabella, after giving way to the firſt tranſports of paſſion, aſſumed a fortitude, and reſignation, which her piety alone could inſpire. She deſired that Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram might be detained, two, or three days, at the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The two Siſters enjoyed all that heart felt pleaſure, which ariſes from rooted friendſhip;—and, as the effects of benevolent diſpoſitions operate on all around, theirs ſerved to commmunicate happineſs to all the Siſterhood.</p>
               <p>The Louvain <hi>Manuſcript</hi> informs us, that after theſe ladies had paſſed near fourteen years in this peaceful retirement, the Abbeſs was ſeized with an alarming fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the effects of which hung ſo long upon her, that they greatly endangered her life. It is not difficult to conceive, how ſevere Iſabella's ſufferings were, in this dreadful interval of ſuſpenſe and apprehenſion, or the anxieties of her mind, till her Siſter was reſtored to health.</p>
               <p>FRANCES during her illneſs, had made a private vow to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary, that if ſhe recovered, ſhe would ſend ſome coſtly offering to a chapel, which was conſecrated to her, at a little Port, called Bradſtow or Broadſtairs, in the iſle of Thanet (part of which chapel is at this day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="215" facs="unknown:032707_0214_0FF42B53B81ADE88"/>
it was held in ſuch veneration, that all ſhips paſſing within fight of it; are reported to have conſtantly lowered their top ſails, to ſalute it. And the feaſt of the Invention of the Holy Croſs, which was the third day of May, being to be celebrated there, with great ſolemnity,—her gratitude for her recovery, and for the ſuppoſed interceſſion of the Virgin, determined her to go herſelf at that time and fulfil her vow.</p>
               <p>Iſabella obtained permiſſion to accompany her ſiſter in this devout purpoſe;—and the roads being little frequented in that age, and a horſe almoſt the only conveyance—they reſolved to put themſelves, with two attendants, aboard a paſſage-ſloop, that uſually went at ſtated times, from Feverſham to Broad-ſtairs, and other parts along the coaſt, between that place and the Downs.</p>
               <p>—They ſet ſail in the evening, but had not been at ſea above two hours, before a violent ſtorm aroſe.

               <p>—It was four hours after the arrival of the boat, before any one durſt venture out; when, the ſtorm abating with the departure of the tide, and the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near dawning, a large boat put off to the wreck. When thoſe who went to aſſiſt, got to it, they found all the people on board, retired to different places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the deck,—great part of which was broken away. Iſabella had remained in the cabin; one ſide of which was alſo waſhed off, and the room half filled with water;—ſhe was almoſt exhauſted, by the terrors ſhe had ſuſtained,—the bruiſes ſhe had received,—and the extreme cold in which ſhe had ſo long ſuffered. They led her with the utmoſt gentleneſs from this wretched place,—while ſhe, all pale and trembling, ſcarcely comprehended at firſt what they were doing;— yet life ſeemed to fluſh anew in her countenance, on hearing that her Siſter was preſerved.—</p>
               <p>—As ſoon as they had brought her on ſhore, ſhe was ſupported by ſeveral women, who were waiting to receive her; and conducted to the houſe where the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Abbeſs was.

               <p>Iſabella was immediately put into bed, and received every aſſiſtance that could be procured;—but her ſtrength and ſpirits were ſo far exhauſted, by the terror and fatigue, which her mind and body had undergone, and by remaining ſo many hours in water, that ſhe lived but till the evening of the following day.</p>
               <p>Frances, tho ſtill ſinking from the ſhock and agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preceeding night, forgot, in her attention to her Siſter, her own ſufferings. She never ſtirred from her bedſide,—and often accuſed herſelf, as being the fatal cauſe of all that had befallen her, by ſuffering her attendance in this expedition. Iſabella chid her for thinking ſo,—declaring it was the will of heaven, to, which ſhe patiently ſubmitted. "Tho we came into the world together," ſays ſhe, "yet as we were not deſtined to periſh together,—a time muſt inevitably have come, when death would have diſſolved our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. I rejoice that I am not the ſurvivor. I die, where I have ever wiſhed to live, in the arms of the moſt beloved of ſiſters. Pray for the repoſe of my ſoul; —and lay me in the tomb which you have allotted to be your own—that one grave may in death hold our remains, who in life had but one heart."</p>
               <p>The loſs of Iſabella plunged the lady Abbeſs into that deep diſtreſs, which minds, formed like her's with

               <p>When time and reflection had ſomewhat calmed her affliction, Frances failed not to tranſmit, by the hands of her Confeſſor, (her uncle, the Abbot, having been ſometime dead) her intended offering to the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of</hi> Broad-Stairs,—accompanied by a donation of twelve maſſes, to be ſaid for the repoſe of Iſabella's ſoul. And ſoon after, to perpetuate the memory of her Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,—as well as to direct mariners in their courſe,— that they might eſcape the ſad calamnity herſelf had ſo fatally experienced,—ſhe cauſed a very ancient church, that ſtood on a riſing ground juſt above the village of Reculver, and which was greatly fallen into decay, to be reſtored, and much enlarged,—and at one end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of erected <hi>two Towers</hi> with <hi>lofty Spires</hi> upon them,— the which ſhe directed ſhould be called THE SISTERS! —and to this day it retains the name, and is a ſea mark of great utility.</p>

               <p>IN the time of <hi>Heptarchy</hi> lived in the kingdom of Kent, a certain gentleman, whoſe property was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe; he had one child only, an heireſs, whoſe name was Roſilla, whoſe beauty was inſurpaſſable, and whoſe qualities of mind were in no degree inferior to her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal accompliſhments; in ſhort, ſhe was eſteemed as the moſt finiſhed piece of perfection which nature could boaſt of being the author of; ſhe was celebrated not only through the kingdom of Kent, but furniſhed a topic of converſation for all the people, and a ſubject for the employment of the genius of all the bardo through the whole ſeven kingdoms; and every perſon of quality was ſtriving to recommend themſelves to her favourable notice. Then, thus ſituated, her father, who was of a diſpoſition ambitious in the extreme, had nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in his boſom a hope of raiſing her to the bed of the king of Kent, who was a prince exceſſively fond of beauty, and no effort was left unaſſayed to recommend her to him; the king himſelf had a deep impreſſion made on his mimd by the many concurrent reports he had heard of her external and mental accompliſhments, and was determined to make a viſit to her father in a tour through that part of his kingdom where he lived, and if ſhe anſwered the idea he had formed of her by reports, to raiſe her to his bed and throne, of which he informed her father in a letter ſent by expreſs.</p>

               <p>It is foreign from my preſent deſign, to give a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular detail of what the poor Roſilla paſſed thro on board of the veſſel under the name of Evander, and of what hardſhips ſhe experienced in a long and fruitleſs ſearch after her beloved Alcander; ſuffice it to ſay, that ſhe acquitted herſelf ſo honorably that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſecond commander in the veſſel on the death of her prececeſſor, in which ſtation ſhe poſſeſſed the higheſt degree of confidence of all who were on board the veſſel; but what amazement &amp; horror ſeized not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Roſilla, but the Captain &amp; the whole crew, one fair and pleaſant morning, when they eſpyed a veſſel but a ſmall diſtance from them, having a piratical flag hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their maſt heaſt; to attempt an eſcape was in vain, as they had been long at ſea, and very ſoul, and but a dull ſailor at beſt, and no hopes could rationally be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of ſucceſs in a combat.</p>
               <p>In this confuſed ſituation they held a conſultation, the reſult of which was, to make as good a defence as

               <p>By the time this was agreed on, the pirate was along ſide of them, when a furious attack was begun by the pirate and an obſtinate defence by the other. Perhaps never was more valor diſcovered than by this little band of heroes; 'till at length being overpowered, their Captain ſlain, and above half their men killed and wounded, they were boarded by the aſſailants, on which a compleat victory ſoon enſued.</p>
               <p>The priſoners were indiſcriminately hurryed on board of the pirate, and huddled in below the deck, while the captors were buſily employed in plundering their new acquired booty. This buſineſs being ended, ſaid the Lieutenant to the Captain, 'tis time a council ſhould ſet to determine the fate of thoſe ſturdy priſoners who have put us to ſo much coſt of time, pains, and blood to conquer them, not leſs than one third of their crew being either killed or wounded, thoſe miſcreants ought to be ſacrificed to appeaſe the <hi>manes,</hi> of our fallen breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and to alleviate the pains of thoſe who are ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under their wounds; what ſay you Captain?

His father finding him averſe to buſineſs, and diſpoſed for a military life, gave him at an early period his ſmall patrimony, with which he purchaſed a pair of colours in the guards.

               <p>In this ſituation he ſaw no other hope than having recourſe to play, in which he was for ſometime pretty ſucceſsful, &amp; was, by his good fortune at the hazard ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, enabled to make a more ſplendid figure than ever, &amp; even his miſtreſſes more valuable preſents.

a ſtrong recommendation to the ladies, who now viewed him with more partial eyes than ever; and finding his influence, he reſolved to turn it to ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, &amp; to realize his nominal eſtate, in that of a wiſe. He had ſcarce come to this reſolution, before a lady pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented herſelf with about fifteen thouſand pounds in her poſſeſſion, being of age, and out of the clutches of her guardian. Miſs Ellis was about twenty-three, tall and genteel, rather ſhowy than handſome; but, upon the whole, very well calculated to make an agreeable wiſe, and a domeſtic life completly comfortable.</p>
               <p>Frank let no opportunity eſcape of advancing his ſuit: and the lady had ſo far conſented, and the day of their nuptials was appointed. In the interim, a moſt unfortunate affair happened to Frank. He one night engaged in a party at picquet with a celebrated Black legs, well known upon the turf, to whom he loſt two hundred pounds. An apology was ſufficient for the evening; but on the morrow, a farther apology was fruitleſs, Paddy ſaid, this is 'tother ſide of enough—a man with two thouſand a year, to make two apologies for ſuch a trifle as two hundred—no, no—my dear, it won't do—I had a miſerable ill run myſelf laſt week at Newmarket—and ſo do you ſee, I ſhall meet you here to morrow at twelve, and we muſt ſettle it one way or other." Saying this he took a French leave, and left poor Frank to his own melancholy reflections. What was to be done?—If he aſked Miſs Ellis to lend him money, it would ruin his match, that was to take place in about a week—To morrow he muſt either pay or fight, which was a very diſagreeable alternative. In a
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:032707_0237_0FF4339D87EB5800"/>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> great diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for Frank, Miſs Ellis had a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the ſame regiment, and as occurrences of this kind ſoon get abroad, and become the ſubject of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion among officers of the ſame corps, it became, in a day or two, the ſubject of converſation at miſs Ellis's teatable. She was greatly alarmed at the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but ſuppreſſed her aſtoniſhment at the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and endeavoured to account for the tranſaction, by ſaying, "She heard Mr Gaylove was on the point of being married, and doubtleſs that was the cauſe of his ſelling out of the army." But her kindſman aſſured her that ſhe was miſtaken in this reſpect, as he was informed Mr. Gaylove had ſold his commiſſion to pay a gaming debt.—"Pay a gaming debt (ſaid 'miſs Ellis) Heavens does he game? you aſtoniſh me, I have always heard him declare the greateſt abhorrence for play." Ha! ha! ha! reſumed the captain, you are very much deceived; there is not a man who plays deeper in all the purlieus of St. James's. Miſs Ellis now became very ſerious; and of courſe very bad company, when her relation retired.</p>
               <p>He had not long gone before Frank made his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when he found Miſs Ellis in a very melancholy ſituation—Her anſwer to all his queſtions were very cool and conciſe. He urged her very ſtrenuouſly to ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plain the cauſe of her very uncommon behaviour, when eclariciſſement enſued: ſhe then ſaid, that a ſoldier was the idol of her heart, and that ſhe had reſolved never to
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032707_0238_0FF42BB2B868D390"/>
marry any other; and if he had that eſteem for her which he pretended, he would buy it again the firſt opportunity, for that ſhe would not give him her hand till he bore a commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Frank took his leave in a promiſe to obey her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates—but, alas! it was impoſſible in his preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He had but one chance, which was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing—but one glimmering of hope; which was very forlorn. He was in poſſeſſion of about a hundred and fifty pounds, the reſidue of the ſale of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and with this he was reſolved to make a puſh at the gaming-table, in the flattering expectation that the blind goddeſs would, for once, ſmile propitiouſly on him.</p>
               <p>He accordingly had recourſe that very evening, to the box and dice; and the bones, to ſpeak in the gambling phraſeology, were pretty favourable to him: but twenty pounds were no objects to him in his preſent ſituation. In fine, he purſued his plan for about three weeks; at the end of which time, he was neither a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable loſer or gainer—but his expences had eat up near a moiety of the relics of his fortune. He, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, continued paying his viſits to Miſs Ellis, but did not meet with that cordial reception he had hitherto done, and not a ſylable of the nuptial day ever now tranſpired; tho he aſſured her he was then in treaty for a cornet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Three weeks were expired, and affairs ſtill remained in ſtatu quo, till one morning at breakfaſt, at the coffee houſe, he read with aſtoniſhment—"Yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was married at St. James' church captain D—

of the guards, to Miſs Ellis, a beautiful young lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a handſome fortune." He ſlung down the paper in rage, broke all the tea equipage, damned the whole ſex and ſlew out of the room; to the great aſtoniſhment of every one preſent, who for the moſt part judged he was mad.</p>
               <p>Thus ſituated—the came up with Miſs Eills—He had another game to play, and he was reſolved to pay more attention to his cards, and never make ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other matrimonial revoke. He was by this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to his laſt ten pieces, when being at a city ball, he danced with a lady whom he found to be a widow, and in poſſeſſion of a handſome jointure. Having gained this intelligence, he reſolved to cultivate the acquaintance, and waited upon her the next day, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her health, and hoped ſhe had taken no cold.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harriſon, the lady in queſtion, received him very politely, as ſhe had entertained ſome prejudices in his favor the night before, from the elegance of his perſon, and the graceful manner of his dancing. His converſation ſhe now found to be as lively and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as his figure had been pre-engaging; and an involuntary ſigh ſoon convinced her; that he had made no ſmall impreſſion on her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harriſon, her former huſband, was a plodding cit old enough to have been her father; it was a match of intereſt, and very diſagreeable to her: ſhe therefore reſolved to pleaſe herſelf in a ſecond mate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harriſon's partiality for Frank was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by her relations, who ſtrenuouſly diſſuaded

But theſe remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances had little or no effect; ſhe was reſolved to have him, her vanity prompting her to believe her charms and attractions were ſufficient to reclaim a rake, let him be ever ſo abandoned. In this preſumption ſhe liſtened to his addreſſes, and, in a ſhort time gave him her hand; but not before ſhe had prudently ſettled his whole fortune upon herſelf.</p>
               <p>The honey moon had ſcarce clapſed, before ſhe was ſenſible of his coolneſs. He was frequently abſent from home all night; and, when he returned, ſeemed to have forgot that Mrs. Gaylove was his wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stung to the quick at this behaviour, ſhe reſolved to trace his haunts, and diſcover what happy female had ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her in his affections. It was not long before one of his emiſſaries purſued him from the chocolate houſe to the apartments of a celebrated Thais, in the new build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This intelligence was immediately communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Mrs. Gaylove, who inſtantly took a coach, and repaired to the ſcene of infidelity, where having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Miſs Shep—d, ſhe gained admittance, and ruſhed up ſtairs, threw open the dining room door, when ſhe detected her perfidious huſband, in amorous dalliance with his miſtreſs. His ſword was hung up, and every circumſtance tended to teſtify that he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed taking up his quarters there that night.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gaylove's remonſtrances to Miſs Shep—d, were doubtleſs pretty ſevere upon the occaſion; but

               <p>No ſooner had Mrs. Gaylove returned home, than ſhe packed up all her clothes, with what belonged to her, and repaired to a relation, with whom ſhe remained till ſuch time as ſhe could obtain proper apartments for herſelf, leaving upon the table the following mortifying billet.</p>
               <p>"Ungrateful wretch! adieu for ever! From this moment I take a final farewell, and leave you to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon Frank's return, finding the ſituation of affairs, he was almoſt frantic—he inquired of the ſervants whither their miſtreſs had flown. The only anſwer he could obtain was, that ſhe had paid them their wages, and diſmiſſed them.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation he diſpoſed of the houſhold furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the produce of which ſupported him for ſome time.

                  </gap> aſſertions in the following ſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hortenſia Melmoth,</hi> the heroine of this hiſtory, was the daughter of Sir Cecil Melmoth, a man whoſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ambition was to be reckoned the leader of the <hi>beau monde</hi> in all the faſhionable purſuits of pleaſure, ſo that it was almoſt proverbial when any thing particularly elegant appeared, to ſay, "this is quite in Sir Cecil's ſtile:" his fortune was large, and he had a heart ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the moſt delicate feelings; generous, and good natured to a fault: bleſſed with a wife in whom every virtue, every grace was concentered, to render the ſtate of matrimony as perfectly happy as that of our primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive parents before their fall; yet had ſhe none of that rigid ſternneſs, which ſo many hypocrites affect, and call it virtue. No, ſhe was all that was lively, gay, and debonair, would enter freely into moſt of the modiſh amuſements, dreſs elegantly according to the taſte of the times, and often, to pleaſe her huſband, would even lead them.</p>
               <p>One would imagine that nothing could now exceed Sir Cecil's felicity; happy in a woman's love with whom (after being ſatiated with a continual round of diſſipation) he could paſs his hours in ſocial converſe, with ſuch heartfelt ſatisfaction, that, were it to be made known to the world even in idea, it would be the means of domeſticating half the popinjays of the age. Flattered in his favorite foible of having the polite cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles implicitly following him thro all the mazes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and poſſeſſed of a fortune ample enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him in his darling paſſion without the leaſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:032707_0244_0FF433E12CDC2950"/>
had not that bane of ſociety, that diſturber of connu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial tranquility GAMING, gained an aſcendency over him, amidſt the other follies of the day, and without which, it would be impoſſible for him to preſerve that high rank, as a man of the <hi>ton,</hi> which he had taken ſuch pains to acquire, he muſt have been as happy as this mundane ſtate would admit. The conſequence was, he fell a dupe to the deſigns of knighted pick pockets, and ennobled ſharpers, who, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, ſhould have a cord inſtead of a ribbon. Sure there never was a truer ſaying in regard to gaming than that of the French poet, "On commence par etre dupe, et on fi nit par etre fripon." His repeated and heavy loſſes brought a gloom upon his temper to which he was heretofore a ſtranger; and his breaſt, which uſed to be the manſion of pleaſantry, was now the ſeat of anguiſh. This his lady, who was than preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, obſerving, preſſed him, with all the eagerneſs of virtuous love, to make her acquainted with the cauſe, and unreſervedly pour his ſorrows in her hoſom, that, by participation, they might be leſſened. For a time he evaded her ſociliations, fearing the dangerous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it might occaſion, but at length he yielded to her repeated entreaties, he confeſſed he had loſt what ready money he was poſſeſſed of, and had mortgaged his eſtate for more than he ever had any hopes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving.</p>
               <p>Here inſtead of reproaching him, ſhe, with all the engaging ſoftneſs of a fond female, who ſees the object of her affection oppreſſed by misfortune, endeavored to ſooth his ſorrows, and calm his melancholy. This ſhe in

This was too ſevere a ſhock for the delicate frame of lady Melmoth to ſuſtain—ſhe ſunk under it—it threw her into a decline; and ſhe ſurvived but a few months. For a time Sir Cecil was quite bereft of his reaſon; at firſt he was a mere bedlamite, to think of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all he held dear in the world, and from an affluent fortune to be reduced to the ſcanty pittance of a ſmall annuity purchaſed with the overplus of the ſale of his eſtate. At length his frenzy ſubſided, and he was ſeized with a ſettled melancholy that ſeemed likely to laſt his life. In this ſtate he continued about ſeven years; when, unexpectedly, by the death of a diſtant relation, a fortune much larger than his former devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him—his firſt care was to place his children in a more eligible ſituation than they were at preſent, as they had been till now under the care of the nurſe who had reared them from their tender infancy. His mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy decreaſed imperceptibly, and he once more returned to gaiety and pleaſure; yet he took care to avoin gaming of every ſpecies. He bought a large houſe in Portland-place, and engaged a tutor for his ſon; his daughter he placed at an eminent boarding ſchool near Londnn; where inſtead of that ſtrict regard being paid to the morals, and proper care taken to implant
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:032707_0246_0FF42B96298BCDA0"/>
the love of virtue and goodneſs in the breaſts of the fair pupils, which, thro the courſe of their lives, would protect their innocence and honor from the wily arts of wicked and deſigning men, ever watchful to ſeize upon the hearts and perſons of unguarded females, and then leave them a prey to reflection and deſpair; I ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a proper attention to theſe things; the grand and only object is to make them accompliſhed in thoſe external qualifications which ſerve to catch the eye, but ſeldom to win the affections. At the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miſs Melmoth was by far the beſt dancer in the ſchool, played tolerably upon the harpſichord and guit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; ſpoke French fluently, and underſtood a little Italian. Already did ſhe begin to diſtinguiſh that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant taſte for dreſs which had ſo characteriſed her father; for whatever Miſs Hortenſia wore, that faſhion was ſure to prevail thro'out the ſchool.</p>
               <p>This Sir Cecil obſerved with a joyful eye, and far from checking this vanity, put it in her power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge her fancy to its utmoſt latitude—Here ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till ſhe was ſixteen, daily making improvements in thoſe ideal accompliſhments which had been her early ſtudy, when her father took her home, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her into the <hi>great world.</hi> The fame of her great beauty, fortune, and accompliſhments, made his houſe a rendezvous for all the young men of faſhion of the age. She kept her heart ſecure from the moſt vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attacks for a long time, coquetting with ſome, and laughing at others, till chance happening to bring the young lord Derwood (a young nobleman of a moſt bewitching perſon, and large fortune) to her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

Here then our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine loſt her heart; and a man ſo deeply ſkilled in all the myſteries of intrigue as lord Derwood, ſoon found means that her chaſtity ſhould follow. Having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed his deſigns, far from obſerving any ſecrecy, he boaſted publicly of his triumph, and aſſured his riotous companions, that Miſs Melmoth was (to uſe a faſhionable phraſe) <hi>come at-able.</hi> This ſoon reached Sir Cecil's ears; and he would immediately have wreaked his revenge on the deſpoiler of his child's honor; when then the reflection of himſelf having, as it were, been acceſſary to her ruin, both by his own example, and encouraging that levity, and love of diſſipation, which had thrown her off her guard, and made her fall an eaſy victim to premeditate villiany, had ſuch an effect upon him that threw him into a violent fever, accompanied by a high delirium. On the ſixth day after he was taken ill, his reaſon ſeemed to return, he begged for a few minutes to be left alone; his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, not apprehending the conſequence, eaſily compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his requeſt; when, taking advantage of their obſence, he threw himſelf out of the window, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired on the ſpot. Three days had ſcarcely elapſed, after the interment of Sir Cecil, when Charles Melmoth, who had been making the tour of Europe with his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, arrived in Portland-place. Struck with horror, by the news of his ſiſter's ruin and father's death, and fired with indignation again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
