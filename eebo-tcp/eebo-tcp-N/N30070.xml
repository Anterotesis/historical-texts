            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE double Tye of Nature and Grace, beſides the many endearing Paſſages that for ſo many Year have linked &amp; glewed our Affections ſo intimately, cannot but beget a tender Sympathy in me with you under all your Troubles; and make me ſay of every Affliction which befalls you, <hi>half mine.</hi> I find it is with our Affections, as with the Strings of Muſical Inſtruments exactly ſet at the ſame heighth, if one be <hi>touched,</hi> the other <hi>trembles,</hi> though it be at ſome Diſtance.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Affections</hi> are one, and ſo in a great meaſure have been our <hi>Afflictions</hi> alſo. You cannot forget that in the Years lately paſt, the Almighty viſited my Tabernacle with the Rod,
<pb facs="unknown:039945_0003_10149606AD70D000"/>and in one Year cut off from it the Root and Branch, the tender Mother, and the only Son. What the Effects of theſe <hi>Strokes,</hi> or rather of my own unmortified <hi>Paſſions</hi> were, I have <hi>felt,</hi> and you and others have heard. Surely, <hi>I was a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoak;</hi> Yea, I may ſay with them, <hi>Lam. 3.19, 20. Remembring mine Affliction and my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, the Wormwood and the Gall, my Soul hath them ſtill in Remembrance, and is humbled in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I dare not ſay that ever I felt my Heart diſcontentedly riſing and ſwelling againſt God: no, I could ſtill juſtifie him, when I moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſmarted by his Hand: If he had plunged me into a Sea of Sorrow, yet I could ſay in all that Sea of Sorrow, there is not a drop of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice:</hi> But it was the over-beating, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-acting of my fond and unmortified Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Paſſions that made ſo ſad Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon my Body; and caſt me under thoſe Diſtempers which ſoon imbittered all my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Comforts to me.</p>
            <p>It was my earneſt Deſire ſo ſoon as I had Strength and Opportunity for ſo great a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to viſit you; that ſo (if the Lord had pleas'd) I might both refreſh, and be refreſhed by you, after all my ſad and diſconſolate Days. And you cannot imagine what Content and Pleaſure I projected in that Viſit; but it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, as all other Comforts of the ſame
<pb facs="unknown:039945_0003_10149606AD70D000"/>kind ordinarily do, more in <hi>Expectation,</hi> than in <hi>Fruition:</hi> For how ſoon after our joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meeting and Embraces, did the Lord over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt and darken our Day, by ſending Death into your Tabernacle, <hi>to take away the Deſire of your Eyes with a Stroke!</hi> to crop off that ſweet and only Bud from which we promiſed our ſelves ſo much Comfort. But no more of that, I fear I am gone too far already. It is not my Deſign to exaſperate your Troubles, but to heal them; and for that Purpoſe have I ſent you theſe Papers, which I hope may be of Uſe both to you and many others in your Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince they are the After Fruits of my own Troubles; Things that I have commended not to you from another Hand, but which I have (in ſome meaſure) proved and taſted in my own Trials.</p>
            <p>But I will not hold you longer here. I have only a few Things to deſire for and from you, and I have done.</p>
            <p>The Things I deſire, are</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That you will not be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> haſty to get off the Yoak which God hath put upon your Neck. Remember when your Child was in the Womb, neither of your deſired it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thence, till God's appointed. Time was fully come, and now that you travail again with Sorrow for its Death, Oh, deſire not to be delivered from your Sorrows one Moment before God's Time for your Deliverance be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="unknown:039945_0004_101496086C922BE8"/>come alſo. Let Patience have its perfect Work; that Comfort which comes in God's Way and Seaſon, will ſtick by you, and do you good indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I deſire, That though you and your <hi>Afflictions</hi> had a ſad <hi>Meeting,</hi> yet you and they may have a comfortable <hi>Parting.</hi> If they effect that upon your Hearts which God ſent them for, I doubt not but you will give them a fair Teſtimony when they go off.</p>
            <p>If they obtain God's Bleſſing upon them in their <hi>Operation,</hi> ſurely they will have your Bleſſing too at their <hi>Valediction:</hi> And what you entertained with <hi>Fear,</hi> you will diſmiſs with <hi>Praiſe.</hi> How ſweet is it to hear the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Soul ſay, when God is loſing his Hands, <hi>It's good for me that I have been Afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I heartily wiſh that theſe ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Afflictions may make the moſt ſatisfying Diſcoveries, that you may now ſee more of the Evil of Sin, the Vanity of the Creature, and the Fulneſs of Chriſt, than ever you yet ſaw. Afflictions are Searchers, and put the Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſearching and trying its way, <hi>Lam. 3.14.</hi> When our Sin finds us out by Affliction, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are we, if by the Light of Affliction we find out Sin. Bleſſed is the Man whom God chaſteneth, and teacheth out of his Law, <hi>Pſ. 94.12.</hi> There are unſeen Cauſes many Times of our Troubles; you have an Advantage now to fiſt out the Seeds and Principles from which they ſpring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:039945_0004_101496086C922BE8"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I wiſh that all the Love and Delight you beſtowed upon your little One, may now be placed to your greater Advantage upon Jeſus Chriſt; and that the Stream of your <hi>Affection</hi> to him, may be ſo much the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as there are now fewer Channels for it to be divided into. If God will not have any part of your Happineſs to lie in Children, then let it wholly lye in himſelf. If the Jealouſie of the Lord hath removed that which drew away too much of your Heart from him, and hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by his Rod, ſaying, <hi>Stand aſide, Child, thou art in my way, and filleſt more Room in thy Parents Hearts than belongs to thee.</hi> O then deliver up all to him, and ſay, Lord, take the whole Heart entirely and undivided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thy ſelf. Henceforth let there be no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, ſharing, or dividing of the Affection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> betwixt God and the Creature, let all the Streams meet and center in him only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That you may be ſtrongthened with all might in the Inner-man to all Patience, that the Peace of God may keep your Hearts, and Minds. Labour to bring your Hearts to a meek Submiſſion to the Rod of your Father. <hi>We had Fathers of the Fleſh who correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and we gave them Reverence, ſhall we not much more be in Subjection to the Father of Spirits and live?</hi> Is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="unknown:039945_0005_1014960B602DABC0"/>the Yoak from ſtruggling under it! O that your Hearts might be in a like frame with his that ſaid, Lord, thou ſhalt <hi>beat</hi> and I will <hi>bear.</hi> It was a good Obſervation that one made, <hi>Anima ſedendo &amp; quieſcendo fit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piens.</hi> The Soul grows wiſe by ſitting ſtill <hi>&amp;</hi> quiet under the Rod. And the Apoſtle calls thoſe excellent Fruits which the Saints ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their ſanctified Afflictions, <hi>The peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. <hi>12.11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> My Hearts Deſire and Prayer to God for you, is that you may die daily to all viſible Enjoyments, and by theſe frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with Death in your Family, you may be prepared for your own Change and Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it ſhall come.</p>
            <p>Oh Friends! How many Graves have you and I ſeen opened for our dear Relations? How oft hath Death come up into your Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and ſummoned the Delight of your Eyes! It is but a little while and we ſhall go to them; we and they are diſtinguiſhed but by ſhort Intervals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tranſivere patres, ſimul hinc tranſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our dear Parents are gone, our lovely and deſirable Children are gone, our Boſom Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were as our own Souls are gone:
<pb facs="unknown:039945_0005_1014960B602DABC0"/>And do not all theſe Warning-Knocks at our Doors acquaint us, that we muſt prepare to follow ſhortly after them.</p>
            <p>O that by theſe things, our own Death might be both <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>familiar</hi> to us! the oftner it viſits us, the better we ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it; and the more of our belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Relations it removes before us, the leſs of either Snare or Intanglement remain for us when our Turn comes.</p>
            <p>My dear Friends, my Fleſh and my Blood, I beſeech you for Religion Sake, for your own ſake, and for my ſake, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is in great part, bound up in your Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Welfare, that you read frequently, ponder ſeriouſly, and apply believingly theſe Scripture-Conſolations and Directions, which in ſome haſte, I have gathered for your Uſe; And the God of all Conſolation be with you.</p>

            <p>How apt we are to tranſgreſs the Bounds both of Reaſon and Religion under a ſharp Affliction, appears, as in moſt Mens Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ſo in this Woman's Example, to whoſe exceſſive Sorrow, Chriſt puts a Stop in the Text: <hi>He ſaw her, and had Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on her, and ſaid to her, Weep not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lamentations and Wailings of this diſtreſſed Mother, moved the tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions of the Lord in beholding them, and ſtirred up more Pity in his Heart for her, than could be in her Heart for her dear and only Son.</p>
            <p>In the Words we are to conſider, both the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Woman, and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> of Chriſt, with reſpect unto it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>How ſad an Hour it was with her when Chriſt met her, appears by what is ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly remarked by the Evangeliſt, in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. where it is ſaid, <hi>Now when they came nigh to the Gate of the City, behold there was a dead Man carried out, the only Son of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe was a Widow, and much Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the City was with her.</hi>

In this one Verſe, divers Heart-piercing Circumſtances of this Affliction are noted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was the <hi>Death of a Son.</hi> To bury a Child, any Child muſt needs rend the Heart of a tender Parent; for what are Children but the Parent multiplied? A Child is a part of the Parent made up in another Skin. But to lay a Son in the Grave, a Son which continues the Name, and ſupports the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; this was ever accounted a very great Affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Son was not carried from the <hi>Cradle</hi> to the <hi>Coffin,</hi> nor ſtript out of its <hi>Swathing,</hi> to be wrapt in it's <hi>Winding-Cloth:</hi> Had he died in Infancy, before he had engaged <hi>Affection,</hi> or raiſed <hi>Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the Affliction had not been ſo punge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Occaſion of it, and that was his ſeeing of her. This Meeting at the Gate of the City, how accidental and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional ſoever it doth ſeem, yet without doubt it was providentially ſuited to the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039945_0009_10149617142A9CE8"/>Work intended to be wrought: The Eye of his Omniſcience foreſaw her, and this Meeting was by him deſigned, as an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that famous Miracle which he wrought upon the young Man. Chriſt hath a quick Eye to diſcern poor mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; diſconſolate Creatures: And though he be now in Heaven, and ſtands out of our Sight, ſo that we ſee him not; yet he ſees us, and his Eye (which is upon all our Troubles) ſtill affects his Heart, and moves his Bowels for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Motive</hi> ſtirring him up to give this relieving and comfortable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to her, was his own <hi>Compaſſion.</hi> She neither expected nor deſired it from him; but ſo full of tender Pity was the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, that he prevents her with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Conſolation: Her Heart was nothing ſo full of Compaſſion for her Son, as Chriſt was for her: He bore our Infirmities, even <hi>Natural</hi> as well as <hi>Moral</hi> ones, in the Days of his Fleſh; and though he be now exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the higheſt Glory, yet ſtill he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues as merciful as ever, and as apt to be touched with the Senſe of our Miſeries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>Counſel it ſelf, Weep not;</hi> herein fulfilling the Office of a Comforter to them that Mourn, whereunto he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. Yet the Words
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039945_0010_10149618CF9CCF98"/>are not an abſolute Prohibition of Tears and Sorrows, he doth not condemn all Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſinful, or all Expreſſions of Grief for dead Relations as uncomely: No, Chriſt would not have his People ſtupid and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate; he only prohibits the Exceſſes &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of our Sorrows for the Dead, that it ſhould not be ſuch a Mourning for the Dead as is found among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who Sorrow without <hi>Meaſure,</hi> becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Hope,</hi> being ignorant of that Grand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by the Reſurrection which the Goſpel reveals.</p>
            <p>The Reſurrection of her Son from the Dead, is the Ground upon which Chriſt builds her Conſolation &amp; Relief. Well might he ſay, <hi>Weep not,</hi> when he intended quickly to remove the Cauſe of her Tears by reſtoring him again to Life.</p>
            <p>Now though there be ſomewhat in this Caſe extraordinary and peculiar: For few or none that carry their Dead Children to the Grave, may expect to receive them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the Dead immediately by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Reſurrection, as ſhe did: I ſay this is not to be expected by any that now loſe their Relations; the Occaſions and Reaſons of ſuch miraculous ſpecial Reſurrections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, by a ſufficient and full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Confirmation of Chriſt's Divine Power and God-head: Yet thoſe that now
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039945_0010_10149618CF9CCF98"/>bury their Relations, if they be ſuch as die in Chriſt, have as good and ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to moderate their Paſſions, as this Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had, and do as truly come within the reach and compaſs of this Chriſt's comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſupporting Counſel, <hi>Weep not,</hi> as ſhe did; For do but conſider what of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or Comfort, can a particular and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Reſurrection from the Dead give us more than it is, and as it is a <hi>Specimen,</hi> Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or Pledge of the general Reſurrection? It is not the returning of the Soul to its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to live an animal Life again in this World of Sin and Sorrow, and ſhortly after to undergo the Agonies and Pains of Death again, that is in it ſelf any ſuch Privilege as may afford much Comfort to the Perſon raiſed, or his Relations: It is no Privilege to the Perſon raiſed; for it returns him from Reſt to Trouble, from the Harbour back again into the Ocean. It is a Matter of Trouble to many dying Saints, to hear of the Likelihood of their Returning again, when they are got ſo nigh unto Heaven.</p>
            <p>It was once the Caſe of a godly Miniſter of this Nation, who was much troubled at his Return, &amp; ſaid, I am like a Sheep dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Storm almoſt to the Fold, and then driven back into the Storm again: Or a weary Traveller that is come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Home, &amp; then muſt go back to fetch
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039945_0011_1014961B9A0ADEC0"/>ſomewhat he had forgotten; or an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, whoſe Time is almoſt expired, &amp; then muſt begin a New Term.</p>
            <p>But to die, and then return again from the Dead, hath leſs of Privilege, than to return only from the Brink of the Grave; for the Sick hath not yet felt the Agonies and laſt Struggles or Pangs of Death, but ſuch have felt them once, and muſt feel them again; they muſt die <hi>twice,</hi> before they can be happy <hi>once;</hi> and beſides, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the little Time they ſpend on Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the firſt and ſecond Diſſolution, there is a perfect <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi> and <hi>inſenſibleneſs</hi> of all that which they ſaw or enjoyed in their Eſtate of Separation: It being neceſſary, both for them and others, that it ſhould be; for, for themſelves it is neceſſary, that they may be content to live, and endure the Time of Separation from that bleſſed and ineffable State,<note place="margin">Victuroſque dii celant, ut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere durent.</note> quietly &amp; patiently; and for others, that they may live by Faith, and not by Senſe, and build upon Divine, and not Humane Authority and Report.</p>
            <p>So that here you ſee, their Agonies and Pangs are doubled, and yet their Life not ſweetned by any ſenſe of their Happineſs, which returns and remains with them, and therefore it can be no ſuch Priviledge to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:039945_0011_1014961B9A0ADEC0"/>
And for their Relations, tho' it be ſome Comfort to receive them again from the Dead; yet the Conſideration, that they are returned to them in the ſtormy Sea, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the new Sorrows and Troubles, from which they were lately free; and in a ſhort time they muſt part with them again, and feel the double Sorrows of a parting pull, which others feel but once, ſurely ſuch a particular Reſurrection conſidered in it ſelf, is no ſuch Ground of Comfort as at firſt we might imagine it to be.</p>
            <p>It remains then, that the Ground of all ſolid Comfort and Relief againſt the Death of our Relations, lies in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and laſt Reſurrection,<note place="margin">In to furtra R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if we judge not ſo, it is becauſe our Hearts are carnal, and meaſure Things rather by Time and Senſe, than by Faith and Eternity.</p>

            <p>Here then you find many Aggravations of Sorrow meeting together: A Son, an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son, is carrying to the Grave; yet Chriſt commands the penſive Mother, not to mourn. Hence we note.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Chriſtians ought to moderate their Sorrows for their dead Relations, how many afflicting Circumſtances and Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations ſoever do meet together in their Death.</hi>

            <p>And firſt, How much ſoever we cenſure and condemn immoderate Sorrow, <hi>yet the afflicted muſt be allowed an awakened and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Senſe of the Lord's afflicting hand upon them.</hi> It's no vertue to <hi>bear</hi> what we do not <hi>feel.</hi> Yea it is a moſt unbecoming Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not to tremble when God is ſmiting.</p>
            <p>The Lord ſaith to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Miriam,</hi> Numb. 12.24. <hi>If her Father had ſpit in her Face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed Seven Days.</hi> The Face is the Table and Seat of Beauty and Honour; But when it is ſpit upon, it is made the Sink of Shame.

How much more ſho'd ſhe take it to Heart, and be ſenſible of this Rebuke of mine, who have filled her Face with Leprous Spots, the Signs of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt her?

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:039945_0014_10149622F394BA28"/>
It is not Magnanimity, but Stupidity to make light of God's Corrections, and for this the afflicted are ſmartly taxed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>I have ſmitten them, but they have not grieved.</hi> When God ſmote <hi>Job</hi> in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Children, and Eſtate, he aroſe and rent his Mantle, and put Duſt upon his Head, to ſhew he was not ſenſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected, and yet bleſſed the afflicting God, which as plainly ſhewed he was not Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious and unſubmiſſive.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We muſt allow the Mourning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Soul a due and comely Expreſſion of his Grief and Sorrow, in his Complaints both to God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is much more becoming a Chriſtian ingenuouſly to open his Troubles, than ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly to ſmother them. There is no Sin in complaining to God, but much Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in complaining of him. Griefs are eaſed by Groans, and Heart Preſſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Utterance. This was <hi>David</hi>'s Courſe, and conſtant Way, who was a Man of Afflictions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2.2, 3. <hi>I poured out my Complaint before him, I ſhewed before him my Trouble: When my Spirit was overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med within me, then thou kneweſt my Path.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom ſhould Children go, but to their Father to make their moan? Whence may they expect Relief and Comfort but from him? The 102 <hi>Pſalm</hi> is entituled, <hi>A
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039945_0014_10149622F394BA28"/>Pſalm for the Afflicted, when he is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and poureth out his Complaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Happy were it, if every afflicted Soul would chuſe this way to expreſs his Sorrows. Did we complain more to God, God would complain the leſs of us, and quickly abate the Matters of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint. O you cannot think how moving, how melting, how prevailing it is with God when his poor burdened and afflicted Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in a Day of Diſtreſs and Deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when Deep calleth unto Deep; and one Wave drives on another, then for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Soul with Humility, filial Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Faith, to turn it ſelf to the Lord, and thus beſpeak him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Father, What ſhall I do: My Soul is greatly bowed down by Trouble, I am full to the Brim, my vain Heart hath looked for Relief this Way, and that Way, but none comes, every Door of Comfort is ſhut up againſt me: Thou haſt multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Sorrows, and renewed thy Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt me: Comfort is removed from my outward, and Peace from my inner Man, ſharp Afflictions without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reflections within. O Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me. Fathers of the Fleſh pity their diſtreſſed Children when they complain to them, and wilt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039945_0015_10149625ACA1BC48"/>not thou, O Lord, whoſe Compaſſions as far exceed Creature-Compaſſions, as the Sea exceeds a Drop: O my Father, pity me, ſupport me, deliver me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Oh how acceptable is this to God! how advantageous to the Soul!</p>
            <p>We may alſo make our Complaint to Men; ſo did <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 19.21. <hi>Have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have pity on me, O ye my Friends, for the Hand of God hath touched me.</hi> And it is a Mercy if we have any Friends that are Wiſe, Faithful, and Experienced. They are born for ſuch a Time as this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. But be they what they will, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Pity as God, relieve and ſuccour as he: And oftentimes we may ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> Ch. 21.4. <hi>As for me, Is my Complaint to Men? And if it were, Why ſhould not my Spirit be troubled;</hi> q. d. What great Advantage can I get by theſe Complaints? I may Burden the Heart of my Friend, but how little doth that eaſe my own? Yet the very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Heart to an experienced ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtian is ſome Relief, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging his Prayers is more. Thus far you moan ſafely: In all this there is no Danger.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The afflicted Perſon may (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naril) accuſe, judge, &amp; condemn himſelf, for being the Cauſe and Procurer of his own Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hath God ſmitten thy Child or Friend, and didſt thou not foreſee ſome ſharp Trial coming? Did not thy fond, ſecure, carnal Temper need ſuch a Scourge to awaken, quicken and purge thee?

            <p>And having found the Root and Cauſe of their Troubles, ingenious Souls will ſhame themſelves for it, and give Glory to God by an humble Submiſſion and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Equity of his Proceeding, <hi>Job</hi>

            <p>When Affliction preſſeth us above Strength, when it diſables us for Duty, or when it gives Advantage to Temptation, then we may ſay with <hi>David, Remove thy Stroke from me, I am conſumed by the blow of thine Hand,</hi> Pſalm 39.10.

            </p>
            <p>It often falls out, that the ſetting of one Comfort clouds and benights all the reſt. Our Tears for our loſt Enjoyment ſo blind our Eyes that we cannot ſee the many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mercies which yet remain: We take ſo much Notice of what is gone, that we take little or no Notice of what is left.

               <hi>Ignorance, Ingratitude,</hi> and great <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Sin ſpringing from Ignorance. Did we know the Deſert of our Sin, we would rather wonder to ſee one Mercy left, than that twenty are cut off. They that know they have forfeited every Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhould be thankful that they enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and patient when they loſe any of their Comfort.</p>
            <p>Did we know <hi>God,</hi> even that Sovereign Lord, at whoſe Diſpoſe our Comforts come and go, who can the next Moment blaſt all that remain, and turn you into Hell, afterwards you would prize the Mercies he yet indulges to you at an higher Value. Did you underſtand the fickle vaniſhing Nature of the Creature, what a Flower, what a Bubble it is; Oh how thankful would you be to find ſo many yet left in your Poſſeſſion!</p>

            <p>Beſide, what vile Ingratitude is in this? What, are all your remaining Mercies worth

What! and yet ſink at this rate, as if all your Mercies, Comforts, and Hopes, even in both Worlds were buried in one Grave. Muſt <hi>Ichabod</hi> be written upon your beſt Mercies, becauſe Mortality is written upon one? Fye, Fye, What ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ingratitude is here?</p>
            <p>And really, Friend, ſuch a Carriage as this under the Rod, is no ſmall Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord to go on in Judgment, and make a full end of all that remains, ſo that Affliction ſhall not riſe up the ſecond Time.</p>
            <p>What if God taking Notice how little thou regardeſt the many undeſerved Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours thou yet poſſeſſeſt, ſhould ſay, Well if thou think'ſt them not worth the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither do I think them worth the continuing? Go, Death, there's a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a Wife, other Children yet left, ſmite them all.

And yet if you be out of Chriſt, you are in Danger of a far Sadder Stroke than any or all yet mentioned. What if God ſhould ſay, prizeſt thou not my Mercy?

            <p>O think then what you have done, by provoking the Lord through your vile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude! It is a dangerous thing for to provoke God, when he is already in a Way of Judgment. And if you be his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo out of the Danger of this laſt and worſt Stroke: Yet know you have better Mercies to loſe than any you have yet loſt. Should God cloud your Soul with Doubts, let looſe Satan to buffet you, remove joy and Peace from your inner Man, how ſoon would you be convinced, that the Funeral of your deareſt Friend is but a Trifle to this?</p>
            <p>Well then, what-ever God takes be ſtill thanful for what he leaves. It was the great Sin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, that though God had delivered them from their cruel Servitude in <hi>Egypt,</hi> miraculouſly fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Sorrows then become ſinful and exorbitant, <hi>When they divert us from or diſtract us in our Duties, ſo that our intercourſe with Heaven is ſtopt and interrupted by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How long can we ſit alone muſing upon a dead Creature? Here our Thoughts eaſily flow, but how hard to fix them upon the Living God! when our Hearts ſhould be in Heaven with our Chriſt, they are in the Grave with our Dead. May not many afflicted Souls juſtly complain, that their Troubles had taken away their Chriſt from them, I mean as to ſweet ſenſible Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laid the dead Child in his Room?</p>
            <p>Poor Creature, ceaſe to weep any longer for thy dead Relation, and weep rather for thy dead Heart. Is this thy Compliance with God's Deſign in afflicting thee? What to grow a greater Stranger to him than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore! or is this the Way to thy Cure and Comfort in Affliction, to refrain Prayer, and turn thy Back upon God?</p>
            <p>Or if thou dareſt not wholly neglect thy Duty, yet thy Affliction ſpoils the Succeſs and Comfort of it; thy Heart is wandring, dead, diſtracted in Prayer &amp; Meditation, ſo that thou haſt no Relief or Comfort from it.</p>
            <p>Rouze up thy ſelf, Chriſtian, and conſider, this is not right. Surely the Rod works not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039945_0020_10149632D6CD8E10"/>kindly now. What, did thy Love to God expire when thy Friend expired? Is thy Heart as cold in Duty, as his Body is in the Grave? Hath natural Death ſeized him, and ſpiritual Deadneſs ſeized thee? Sure then thou haſt more Reaſon to lament thy dead Heart, than thy dead Friend. Divert the Stream of thy Troubles ſpeedily, and labour to recover thy ſelf out of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quickly; leſt ſad Experience ſhortly tell thee, that what thou now mourneſt for, is but a Trifle to what thou ſhalt mourn for hereafter. To loſe the Heavenly Warmth and Spiritual Livelineſs of thy Affection, is undoubtedly a far more conſiderable Loſs, than to loſe the Wiſe of your Boſom, or the ſweeteſt Child that ever a tender Parent laid in the Grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> If this be thy Caſe, Thou haſt Reaſon to challenge the firſt Place among the Mourners. It is better for thee to bury Ten Sons, than to remit one Degree of Love or Delight in God.

               <hi>Worldly Sorrow works Death,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10. that is, Sorrow after the Manner of Worldly Men,<note n="*" place="bottom">Triſtitia mundi eſt Triſtitia ſecundum mundum, quae ex amore mundinaſcitur. <hi>Eſti in loc.</hi>
               </note> Sorrow in a meer carnal natural Way, which is not relieved by any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reaſonings and Conſiderations: This falls ſo heavy ſometimes upon the Body, that it ſinks under the Weight, and is caſt into ſuch Diſeaſes as are never more wrought off, or healed in this World. <hi>Heavineſs in the Heart of a Man makes in ſtoop,</hi> ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. 12.25.

            <p>It is with the Mind of Man, ſaith one, as with the Stone <hi>Tyrrhenus,</hi> as long as it's whole it ſwimmeth but once broken it ſinks preſently. Grief is a Moth which getting into the Mind, will in a ſhort Time, make the Body be it never ſo ſtrong &amp; well wrought in a Piece, like an old feary Garment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philoſophers</hi> &amp; <hi>Phyſicians</hi> generally reckon Sorrow among the chief Cauſes of ſhortning Life. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Griefs, and this ſome think,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039945_0021_10149634AD3541E8"/>was the Reaſon that he appeared as a Man of Fifty, when he was little more than Thirty Years old, <hi>John</hi> 8.17.

            <p>Many a Man's Soul is to his Body, as a ſharp Knife to a thin ſheath, which eaſily cuts it through; and what do we by poring and pondering upon our Troubles, but whet the Knife that it may cut the deeper and the quicker? Of all the Creatures that ever God made (Devils only excepted) Man is the moſt able and apt to be his own Tormentor.</p>
            <p>How unmercifully do we load them in Times of Affliction? How do we not only waſte their Strength by Sorrow, but deny Relief, and neceſſary Refreſhment? They muſt carry the Load, but be allowed no Refreſhment: If they can eat the Bread of Affliction and drink Tears, they may feed at full; but no pleaſant Bread, no quiet Sleep is permitted them. Surely you would not burden a Beaſt, as you do your own Bodies; you would pity and relieve a brute Beaſt groaning and ſinking under an heavy Burden, but you will not pity nor relieve your own Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:039945_0021_10149634AD3541E8"/>
Some Mens Souls have given ſuch deep Wounds to their Bodies, that they are never like to enjoy many eaſie or comfortable Days more whilſt they dwell in them.</p>
            <p>Now this is very ſinful, and diſpleaſing to God; for if he have ſuch a tender care for our Bodies, that he would not have us ſwallowed up of over much Grief, no tho' it be for Sin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. but even to that Sorrow ſets Bounds. How much leſs with outward Sorrow for Temporal Loſs? May not your Stock of natural Strength be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to better Purpoſes think you than theſe? Time may come, that you may earneſtly wiſh you had that Health and Strength again to ſpend for God, which you now ſo laviſhly waſte, and prodigally caſt away upon your Troubles to no Purpoſe, or Advantage.</p>
            <p>It was therefore an high Point of Wiſdom in <hi>David,</hi> and recorded, no doubt, for our Imitation, who when the Child was dead, ceaſed to mourn, but aroſe, waſhed himſelf, and eat Bread, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>When Affliction ſours the Spirit with Diſcontent, and makes it inwardly grudge againſt the Hand of God, then our Trouble is full of Sin, and we ought to be humbled for it before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever God doth with us or ours, ſtill we ſhould maintain good Thoughts of him.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039945_0022_10149636D053A830"/>A gracious Heart cleaves nearer &amp; nearer to God in Affliction, and can juſtify God in his ſevereſt Stroaks, acknowledging them to be all Juſt and Holy. Pſal 119.75. <hi>I know alſo that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulneſs hath afflicted me.</hi> And hereby the Soul may comfortably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to it ſelf its own Uprightneſs, and ſincere Love to God. Yea it hath been of ſingular Uſe to ſome Souls, to take right Meaſures of their Love to God in ſuch Trials; to have lovely and well pleaſed Thoughts of God, even when he ſmites us in our neareſt and deareſt Comforts; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth plainly, that we love him for himſelf, and not for his Gifts only: And that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Heart is deeper, than any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Intereſt is. And ſuch is the Comfort that hath reſulted to ſome from ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of their own Hearts by cloſe ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Afflictions; that they would not part with it, to have their Comforts, whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval occaſioned them, given back in Lieu of it.</p>
            <p>But to ſwell with ſecret Diſcontent, and have hard Thoughts of God as if he had done us wrong, or dealt more ſeverely with us than any. O this is a vile Temper, curſed Fruit ſpringing from an evil Root; a very carnal ignorant, proud Heart; or at leaſt from a very diſtempered, if renewed Heart.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039945_0022_10149636D053A830"/>So it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> when God ſmote his Gourd, <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I do well to be angry even unto Death,</hi> Jonah 4.9. Poor Man, he was highly diſtempered at this Time, and out of Frame; this was not his true temper or ordinary frame, but a ſurprize, the Effect of a Paroxyſm of Temptation, in which his Paſſions had been over-heated.</p>
            <p>Few dare to vent it in ſuch Language. But how many have their Hearts imbittered by Diſcontent, and ſecret Riſings againſt the Lord? Which, if ever the Lord open their Eyes to ſee, will coſt them more Trouble than ever that of Affliction did, which gave the Occaſion of it.</p>

            <p>I confeſs, Uſes of Comfort to the Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are not, ordinarily, in Uſe among us, and it may ſeem ſtrange whence any Thing of Support ſhould be drawn for them that have no ſpecial Intereſt in Chriſt, or Promiſes.</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:039945_0026_10149641425C85D0"/>
I confeſs alſo, that I find my ſelf under great Diſadvantages for this Work, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offer them thoſe reviving Cordials that are contained in Chriſt, and the Covenant, for God's afflicted People; but ſuch is the Goodneſs of God, even to his Enemies, that they are not left wholly without Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, or Means to allay their Sorrow.</p>
            <p>If this therefore be thy Caſe, who readeſt theſe Lines; afflicted and unſanctified, mourning bitterly for thy dead Friends, haſt more cauſe to mourn for thy dead Soul, Chriſtleſs and Graceleſs, as well as Childleſs or Friendleſs: No comfort in hand, nor yet in Hope, full of Trouble, and no vent by Prayer or Faith to eaſe thy Heart.</p>
            <p>Poor Creature, thy Caſe is ſad, but yet do not wholly ſink, and ſuffer thy ſelf to be ſwallowed up of Grief; thou haſt laid thy dear one in the Grave, yet throw not thy ſelf headlong into the Grave, after him; that will not be the way to remedy thy Miſery: But ſit down a while and ponder theſe three things.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:039945_0026_10149641425C85D0"/>alſo; for Hell follows that pale Horſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.8. If a Believer dies, there's no Danger of Hell to him, the Second Death hath no Power over him; but wo to thee if it overtake thee in thy Sin; beware therefore what thou doſt do againſt thy Health and Life. Do not put the Candle of Sorrow too near that Thread, by which thou hangeſt over the Mouth of Hell.</p>
            <p>O it is far better for to be Childleſs or Friendleſs on Earth, than hopeleſs, and remedileſs in Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Own and admire the Bounty and Goodneſs of God manifeſted to thee in this Affliction; that when Death came into thy Family to ſmite and carry off one, it had not fallen to thy Lot to be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; thy Husband, Wife or Child is taken, and thou art left; Had thy Name been in the Commiſſion, thou hadſt been now paſt Hope.</p>
            <p>O the ſparing Mercy of God! the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Long Suffering of God towards thee; Poſſibly that poor Creature that is gone; never provoked God as thou haſt done; thy poor Child never abuſed Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, neglected Calls, treaſured up the thouſandth part of that Guilt thou haſt done So that thou mighteſt well imagine if ſhould rather have cut thee down, that
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039945_0027_10149643E96D6C48"/>hadſt ſo provoked God, than thy poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one.</p>
            <p>But oh the admirable Patience of God! Oh the Riches of his Long-ſuffering! thou art only warned, not ſmitten by it: Is there nothing in this worth thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement? Is it not better to be in Black for another on Earth, than in the Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever? Is it not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to go to the Grave with thy dead Friend, and weep there; then to go to Hell among the Damned where there is Weeping, and Wailing, and Gnaſhing of Teeth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Affliction for which thou mourneſt, may be the greateſt Mercy to thee that ever yet befel thee in this World. God hath now made thy Heart ſoft by Trouble, ſhewed thee the Vanity of this World; and what a poor Trifle it is which thou madeſt thy Happineſs: There is now a dark Cloud ſpread over all thy worldly Comforts. Now, O now! if the Lord would but ſtrike in with this Affliction, and by it open thine Eyes to ſee thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable State, and take off thy heart for ever from the vain World which thou now ſeeſt hath nothing in it; and cauſe thee to chuſe Chriſt the only abiding Good, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thy Portion. If now thy Affliction may but bring thy Sin to Remembrance, and thy dead Friend may but bring thee to a
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:039945_0027_10149643E96D6C48"/>Senſe of thy dead Soul, which is as cold to God and ſpiritual Things, as his Body is to thee; and more loathſome in his Eyes than that Corps is, or ſhortly will be to the Eyes of Men; Then this Day is certainly a Day of the greateſt Mercy that ever thou ſaweſt. O happy Death, that ſhall prove Life to thy Soul.</p>
            <p>Why this is ſometimes the way of the Lord with Men, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9. <hi>If they be bound in fetters, and holden in Cords of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction then he ſheweth them their work, and their Tranſgreſſion, that they have exceeded: He openeth alſo their Ears to Diſcipline, and commandeth them that they return from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O conſider, poor penſive Creature, that which ſtole away the Heart from God, is now gone: That which eat up thy Time and Thoughts, that there was no Room for God, Soul, or Eternity in them, is gone: All the vain Expectations that thou raiſedſt up unto thy ſelf, from that poor Creature which now lies in the Duſt, are in one Day quite periſhed. O what an Advantage haſt thou now for Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond whatever thou yet hadſt If God will but bleſs this Rod, thou wilt have Cauſe to keep many a Thankſgiving-Day for this Day.</p>
            <p>I pray let theſe three Things be ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:039945_0028_1014964792124820"/>by you; I can beſtow no more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts upon you, your Condition bars the beſt Comforts from you; they belong to the People of God, and you have yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore turn from you to them, and preſent ſome choicer Comforts to them to whom they properly belong, which may be of great Uſe to you in reading; if it be but to convince you of the bleſſed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege &amp; State of the People of God in the greateſt Plunges of Troubles in this World, and what Advantages their Intereſt in Chriſt gives them for Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beyond that State you are in.</p>
            <p>And here I do with much more Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Hope of Succeſs, apply my ſelf to the Work of counſelling and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Afflicted. You are the Fearers of the Lord, and tremble at his Word; the leaſt Sin is more formidable to you than the greateſt Affliction. Doubtleſs you would rather chuſe to bury all your Children than provoke and grieve your heavenly Father. Your Relations are dear, but Chriſt is dearer to you by far.</p>

            <p>It's a Shame for a Child to ſtrive with his Father; a Shame for a Servant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with his Maſter: But for a Creature
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:039945_0029_101496491AEB6350"/>to quarrel and ſtrive with the God that made him, O how ſhameful is it? Surely 'tis highly reaſonable that you be ſubject to that Will whence you proceeded, and that he who formed you and yours, ſhould diſpoſe of both as ſeemeth him good. It is ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.36. <hi>That whatſoever the King did, pleaſed all the People.</hi> And ſhall any thing the Lord doth, diſpleaſe you? He can do no wrong. If we pluck a Roſe in the Bud as we walk in our Gardens, who ſhall blame us for it, it is our own, and we may crop it off when we pleaſe? Is not this the Caſe; Thy ſweet Bud which was cropt off before it was fully blown, was cropt off by him that owned it, yea by him that formed it. If his Dominion be abſolute, ſure his Diſpoſal ſhould be acceptable.</p>
            <p>It was ſo to good <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do, what ſeemeth him good.</hi> And it was ſo to <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>I was dumb.

            <p>The glorious Sovereignty of God is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly diſplayed in two Things, his <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Providences.</hi> With reſpect to the firſt he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. <hi>I will have

            <p>And as to his <hi>Providences,</hi> wherein his Sovereignty is alſo manifeſted. It is ſaid, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Be ſilent, O all Fleſh, before the Lord, for he is raiſed up out of his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It's ſpoken of his providential work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Changes of Kingdoms, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations that attend them.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing the Caſe ſtand thus, that the Lord hath done it, it is his Pleaſure to have it ſo; and if that it had not been his Will, it could never have been as it is: He that gave thee, rather lent thee, thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, hath alſo taken him.

            <p>The ſpecial Limit is that Proportion of Time, which God by his own Counſel and Will hath allotted to every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and it is only known to us by the Event: This we affirm to be a fixed and unmoveable Term, with it all Things ſhall fall in, and obſerve the Will of God in our Diſſolution at that Time. But becauſe the general Limit is known, and this ſpecial Limit is a Secret hid in God's own Breaſt; therefore Man reckons by the former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and may be ſaid when he dies at Thirty or Forty Years old to be cut off in the midſt of his Days; for it ſo, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the general Account: Though he be not cut off till the End of his days; reckoning by his ſpecial Limit.</p>
            <p>Thus he that is wicked dies before his Time: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> The Time he might attain to in an ordinary Way: But not before the Time God hath appointed. And ſo in all other objected Scripture.</p>
            <p>It is not proper at all in a Subject of this Nature, to digreſs into a Controverſie. Alas! the poor Mourner, overwhelmed with Grief, hath no Pleaſure in that; it is not proper for him at this Time; and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:039945_0033_10149652010A7AC0"/>therefore I ſhall for the preſent, wave the Controverſie, and wind up this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with an humble and ſerious Motion to the Afflicted, that they will wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Matter, the <hi>Lord's</hi> Time was come. Your Relations lived with you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Moment that God intended them for you, before you had them.</p>
            <p>O Parents! mind this, I beſeech you; the Time of your Child's Continuance in the Womb, was fixed to a Minute by the Lord; and when the parturient Fulneſs of that time was come, Were you not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it ſhould be delivered thence into the World? The tender Mother would not have it abide one Minute longer in the Womb, how well ſoever ſhe loved it: And is there not the ſame Reaſon we ſhould be willing when God's appointed Time is come to have it delivered by Death out of this State, which in Reſpect of this Life of Heaven, is but as the Life of a Child in the Womb, to its Life in the open World.</p>
            <p>And let none ſay the Death of Children is a praemature Death. God hath Ways to ripen them for Heaven, whom he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to gather thither betimes, the which we know not: In Reſpect of Fitneſs they die in a full Age, though they be cut off in the Bud of their Time.</p>
            <p>He that appointed the Seaſons of the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:039945_0034_101496538A8B8238"/>Year, appointed the Seaſons of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Relations: And as thoſe Seaſons cannot be altered, no more can theſe.

It is God's uſual way when ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Calamities are coming upon the World, to hide ſome of his weak and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ones out of the way by death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.1, 2.

            <p>Juſt as a careful and tender Father, who hath a Son abroad at School, hearing the Plague is broken out in, or near the Place, ſends his Horſe preſently to fetch home his Son, before the Danger and Difficulty be greater.

            <p>Surely, when National Calamities are drawing on, it is far better for our Friends to be in the Grave in Peace, than expoſed to the Miſeries and Diſtreſſes that are here, which is the meaning of <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.10. <hi>Weep not for the Dead, neither bemoan him; but weep for him that goeth away, for he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more, nor ſee his native Country.</hi>

               <q>Lord Jeſus, here am I a poor guilty Sinner, deeply laden with Sin, Fear and Trouble upon one Hand, and there is a juſt God, a ſevere Law, and everlaſting Burnings on the other Hand; but bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, O bleſſed be God for Jeſus the Mediator who interpoſeth betwixt me and it. Thou art the only Door of Hope at which I can eſcape, thy Blood the only Means of my Pardon and Salvation.

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:039945_0039_10149660D7A442E8"/>with many Doubts and Fears of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue; yet I am willing to come and make a Covenant with thee this Day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I take thee this Day to be my Lord, and ſubmit heartily to all thy Diſpoſals: Do what thou wilt with me or with mine: Let me be rich or Poor, any thing or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this World. I am willing to be as thou wouldeſt have me. And I do likewiſe give my ſelf to thee this Day to be thine; all I am, all I have, ſhall be thine; thine to ſerve thee, and thine to be diſpoſed at thy Pleaſure.

            </p>
            <p>Now, Chriſtian, make good to Chriſt what thou ſo ſolemnly promiſedſt him: <hi>He,</hi> I ſay, He hath diſpoſed of this thy dear Relation as pleaſed him; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by trying thy Uprightneſs in the Covenant which thou madeſt with him.

            <p>It was all, without any Exception, thou then reſignedſt to him, and now wilt thou go back from thy Word, as one that had out-promiſed himſelf, and repents the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?

Doſt read over thoſe Words of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 29. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and comment upon them with many Tears, <hi>O that I were as in Months paſt, as in the Day when God preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me! when his Candle ſhined upon my Head, and when by his Light I walked thro' Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! As I was in the Days of my Youth, when the Secret of God was upon my Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, when the Almighty was yet with me, when my Children were about me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet let the Covenant God hath made with thee, comfort thee in this thy deſolate Condition.</p>
            <p>You know what domeſtick Troubles holy <hi>David</hi> met with in a ſad Succeſſion, not only from the Death of Children; but which was much worſe, from the wicked Lives of his Children. There was Inceſt, Murder, and Rebellion in his Family; a far ſorer Tryal than Death in their Infancy could have been: And yet ſee how ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he relieves himſelf from the Covenant of Grace, in 2 Sam. 23.5. <hi>Although my Houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all Things and ſure; for this is all my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my Deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know this Place principally referrs to Chriſt, who was to ſpring out of <hi>David</hi>'s Family according to God's Covenant made
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:039945_0041_10149665B1B43670"/>with him in that Behalf: And yet I doubt not but it hath another, though leſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Aſpect upon his own Family; over all the Afflictions and Troubles, whereof the Covenant of God with him, did abundantly comfort him.</p>
            <p>And as it comforted him, although his Houſe did not encreaſe, and thoſe that were left were not ſuch as he deſired: So it may abundantly comfort you alſo whatever Troubles or Deaths be upon your Families, who have an Intereſt in the Covenant. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If you be God's Covenant People, though he may <hi>afflict,</hi> yet he will never <hi>forget</hi> you, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3.5. He is ever mindful <hi>of his Covenant.</hi> You are as much upon his Heart in your deepeſt Afflictions, as in the greateſt Flouriſh of your Proſperity.</p>
            <p>You find it hard to forget your Child, though it be now turned to an heap of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and loathſome Rottenneſs; O how doth your Mind run upon it Night and Day! Your Thoughts tire not upon that Object: Why, ſurely it's much more eaſie for you to forget your dear Child whilſt living and moſt endearing, much more when dead and undeſireable; than it is for your God to forget you, Iſa 49.15. <hi>Can a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have Compaſſion upon the Son of her
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:039945_0041_10149665B1B43670"/>Womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can a Woman,</hi> the more affectionate Sex, <hi>forget her ſucking Child?</hi> her own Child, and not a nurſing Child: Her own Child, whilſt it hangs on the Breaſt, and together with the Milk from the Breaſt, draws Love from it's Mother's Heart? Can ſuch a thing as this be in Nature? poſſibly it may; for Creature Love is fickle and varitable: <hi>But I will not forget thee,</hi> it's an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he will never forget you in your Troubles; ſo he will order all your Troubles for your good; It is a <hi>well ordered Covenant,</hi> or a Covenant orderly diſpoſed: So that every thing ſhall work together for your good.</p>
            <p>The Covenant ſo orders all your Trials, ranks and diſpoſes your various Troubles ſo, as that they ſhall in their Orders and Places ſweetly co-operate and join their united Influence to make you happy.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly you can't ſee how the preſent Affliction ſhould be for your Good, you are ready to ſay with <hi>Jacob</hi> Gen. 42.36. <hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not; and ye will take Benjamin away; all theſe Things are againſt me.</hi> But could you once ſee how ſweetly and orderly all theſe Afflictions work under the Bleſſing and Influe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e of,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:039945_0042_1014966954254D88"/>the Covenant to your eternal Good; you would not only be quiet, but thankful for that which now ſo much afflicts and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Covenant is not only well ordered in all things, but <hi>ſure;</hi> the Mercies contained in it are called <hi>the ſure Mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. Now how ſweet, how ſeaſonable a Support doth this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion give to God's Afflicted under the Rod! You lately made your ſelves <hi>ſure</hi> of that Creature-Comfort which hath forſaken you. It may be you ſaid of your Child which is now gone, as <hi>Lamech</hi> ſaid of his Son <hi>Noah.</hi> Gen. 5.29. <hi>This ſame ſhall Comfort us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our work. and Toil of our Hands.</hi> Meaning that his Son ſhould not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them by aſſiſting them in the <hi>Works</hi> of their <hi>Hands,</hi> but for enjoying the Fruit of their Toil and Pains for him.</p>
            <p>Probably ſuch Thoughts you have had, and raiſed up to your ſelves great Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Comfort in your old Age from it; but now you ſee you built upon the Sand; and where were you now, if you had not a firmer Bottom to build upon? But bleſſed be God, the Covenant-Mercies are more ſure and ſolid: God, Chriſt and Heaven, never ſtart or fade as theſe things do.</p>
            <p>The ſweeteſt Creature enjoyments you ever had or have in this World, cannot ſay
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:039945_0042_1014966954254D88"/>to you as your God doth, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> You muſt part with your dear Husbands, how well ſoever you love them; you muſt bid adieu to the Wife of your Boſom, how nearly ſoever your Affections be linked, and Heart delighted in her. Your Children and you muſt be ſeparated, though they be to you as your own Soul.</p>
            <p>But though theſe vaniſh away, bleſſed be God there is ſomething that abides. <hi>Though all Fleſh be as Graſs, and the Goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it as the Flower of the Graſs, though the Graſs withereth, and the Flower thereof fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon it; yet the Word of our God ſhall ſtand for ever,</hi> Iſa. 40.6, 7, 8. There is ſo much of Support contained in this one Conſideration, that could but your Faith fix here, to realize and apply it, I might lay down my Pen at this Period, and ſay, the Work is done, there needs no more.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Conſid. <hi>The Hope of the Reſurrection ſhould powerfully reſtrain all Exceſſes of Sorrow in thoſe that do proſeſs it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them only mourn without <hi>meaſure,</hi> who mourn without <hi>Hope.</hi> The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth not mourn when he caſts his Seed Lorn into the Earth, becauſe he ſows in Hope; commits it to the Ground with an Expectation to receive it again with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:039945_0043_1014966ADB05E090"/>Why thus ſtands the Caſe here, and juſt ſo the Apoſtle ſtates it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>But I would not have you to be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, Brethren, concerning them which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not even as others which have no Hope; for if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them also which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. D. Look not upon the Dead as a loſt Generation: Think not that Death hath annihilated and utterly deſtroyed them. O no, they are not dead, but only are aſleep, and if they ſleep, they ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake again. You don't uſe to make Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries and Lamentations for your Children and Friends when you find them aſleep upon their Beds. Why, Death is but a longer Sleep, out of which they ſhall as ſurely awake as ever they did in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this World.</p>
            <p>I have often wondred at that golden Sentence in <hi>Seneca,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Habui enim illos tanquam amiſſurus, amiſit tanquam habeam. <hi>Seneca</hi> Epiſt. <hi>63.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>My Thoughts of the Dead</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are not as others are; I have fair and pleaſant Apprehentions of them, for I enjoyed them as one that reckoned I muſt part with them; and I part with them, as one that makes account to have them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpeaks, no doubt, of that Enjoyment
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:039945_0043_1014966ADB05E090"/>of them, which his pleaſant Contemplations of their vertuous Actions could give him; for he was wholly unacquainted with the comfortable and Heart ſupporting Doctrine of the Reſurrection. Had he known the Advantages which reſult thence, at what a rate may we think he would have ſpoken of the Dead and of their State? But this you profeſs to believe, and yet ſink at a ſtrange rate. O ſuffer not <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> to out-vie <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Let no <hi>Pagans</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the greateſt <hi>Believers,</hi> to out do them in a quiet and chearful Behaviour under Afflictions.</p>
            <p>I beſeech thee, Reader, if thy deceaſed Friend have left thee any ſolid Ground of Hope that he died intereſted in Chriſt, and the Covenant; that thou wilt diſtinctly ponder theſe admirable Supports which the Doctrine of the Reſurrection affords:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſame Body which was ſo pleaſant a Spectacle to thee, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again; yea, the ſame <hi>numerically,</hi> as well as the ſame <hi>ſpecifically:</hi> So that it ſhall not only be <hi>what</hi> it was, but the <hi>who</hi> it was. <hi>Theſe Eyes ſhall behold him, and not another,</hi> Job 19.27, &amp;c. The very ſame Body you laid, or are now about to lay in the Grave, ſhall be reſtored again: Thou ſhalt find thine own Husband, Wife, or Child, or Friend again: I ſay the ſelf ſame and not another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:039945_0044_1014966D79F7E7A0"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And farther, this is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as you ſhall ſee the ſame Perſon that was ſo dear to you; ſo you ſhall know them to be the ſame that were once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to you on Earth in ſo near a tye of Relation.</p>
            <p>Indeed you ſhall know them no more in any carnal Relation, Death diſſolved that Bond: But you ſhall know them to be ſuch as once were your dear <hi>Relations</hi> in this <hi>World,</hi> and be able to ſingle them out among that great Multitude, and ſay, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>For we may allow in that State, all that <hi>Knowledge</hi> which is <hi>cumulative</hi> and <hi>perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> whatſoever may enlarge and heighten our Felicity and Satisfaction, as this muſt needs be allowed to do. <hi>Luther</hi>'s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Point being asked by his Friends at Supper the Evening before he died,<note place="margin">Melchior <hi>Adam</hi> in vita <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri.</hi>

He being full of the Holy Ghoſt, and endued with the Knowledge of God, ſpake thus. After the ſame Manner we alſo ſhall be in the other Life renewed by Chriſt, and ſhall know our Parents, our Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>And this among other Things was that with which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> comforted the Lady <hi>Italica</hi> after the Death of her dear Husband,<note place="margin">

            <p>It is the concurrent Judgment of ſound Divines, and it wants not Countenance from Scripture and Reaſon that ſuch a Knowledge of them ſhall be in Heaven: And then thy Sadneſs of this parting will be abundantly recompenſed by the Joy of that Meeting. Eſpecially conſidering,</p>

And this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle thought an effectual Cordial in this Caſe, when he exhorted the <hi>Theſſalonians to Comfort one another with theſe words.</hi>

            <p n="10">10 Conſid. <hi>The preſent Felicity into which all that die in Chriſt are preſently admitted, ſhould abundantly comfort Chriſtians over the Death of ſuch as either carried a lively Hope out of the World with them, or have left good Grounds of ſuch an Hope behind them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such there are that carried a lively hope to Heaven with them, who could evidence to themſelves and Friends their Intereſt in Chriſt and in the Covenant. Yea, though they had died in Silence, yet their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations would ſpeak for them, and the Tenour of their Lives leave no Ground of doubting touching their Death: Others dying in their Infancy or Youth, though they carried not ſuch an actual Hope with them, yet they have left good Grounds of Hope behind them.</p>
            <p>Parents, now ponder theſe Grounds; you have prayed for them, you have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Times wreſtled with the Lord on their Behalf; you have taken hold of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for them, as well as for your ſelves and dedicated them to the Lord; and they have not by any Actions of theirs

            <p>Why, if the Caſe be ſo, what abundant Reaſon have you to be quiet and well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with what God hath done? Can they be better than where they are? Had you better Proviſions and Entertainments for them here, than their heavenly Father hath above?</p>
            <p>There is no Chriſtian Parent in the World but would rejoyce to ſee his Child out-ſtrip and get before him in Grace, that he may be more eminent in Parts and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice than ever he was: And that Reaſon can be given why we ſhould not as much rejoyce to ſee our Children get before us in Glory as in Grace? They are gotten to Heaven a few Years before you, and is that Matter of Mourning? Would not your Child (if he were not ignorant of you) ſay as Chriſt did to his Friends a little before his Death, when he ſaw them caſt down at the Thoughts of parting, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.28. <hi>If ye loved me ye would rejoice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I go unto the Father, q. d.</hi> Do you value your own ſenſible Comfort from my Bodily Preſence with you, before my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Advancement in Heaven?

This is rather the Effect of a fond and fleſhly, than of rational and ſpiritual Love: If ye loved me with a pure ſpiritual Love, ye would rejoyce that I am gone to my Father. It's infinitely better for me to be here, than with you here on Earth, under Sin and Sorrow. Weep not for me, but for your ſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alas, though you want your Friend's Company, he wants not yours: Your Care was to provide for this Child, but Jeſus Chriſt hath provided infinitely better for it than you could; you intended an Eſtate, but he a Kingdom for it: You thought upon ſuch or ſuch a Match, but Chriſt hath forbid all others, &amp; married your Child to himſelf. Would you imagine a higher Preferment for the Fruit of your Bodies?</p>
            <p>A King from Heaven hath ſent for your Friend, and do you grudge at the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney? O think, and think again, what an Honour it is to you, that Chriſt hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them out of your Boſom, &amp; laid them in his own: ſtript them out of thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you provided, and cloathed them In white Robes waſhed in the Blood of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:039945_0047_1014967492593078"/>the Lamb. Let not your hearts be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, rather rejoyce exceedingly that God made you Inſtruments to repleniſh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp; bring forth an Heir for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
            <p>Your Child is now glorifying God in an higher way than you can; and what tho' you have loſt its bodily Preſence for a Time, yet I hope you don't reckon that to be your Loſs, which turns to God's greater Glory.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Jacob</hi> heard his <hi>Joſeph</hi> was Lord of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he rather wiſht himſelf with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> than his <hi>Joſeph</hi> with him, in Wants and Streights: So ſhould it be with you. You are yet rowling and toſſing upon a tempeſtuous Sea; but your Friend is gone into the quiet Harbour; deſire rather to be there, than that he were at Sea again with you.</p>

            <p>Cares may break our Sleep, yea, break our Hearts: But they cannot add to our Stature either in a natural, or in a civil Notion: So your ſorrowing may ſooner break your Hearts, than the Yoke God hath laid on you.</p>
            <p>Alas! What is all this, but as the flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of a Bird in the Not, which inſtead of freeing doth but the more entangling it ſelf? It was therefore a wiſe Reſolve of <hi>David</hi> in this very Caſe, when the Will of God was ſignified in the Death of his Child, 2 Sam. 12.23. <hi>But now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt?

            </p>
            <p>Can I bring him back again? No, I can no more alter the Purpoſe and Work of God, thann I can change the Seaſons of the Year, or alter the Courſe of Sun, Moon, Stars, or diſturb the Order of the Day and Night; which are all unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſtabliſhed by a firm Conſtitution and Ordinance of Heaven.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Every comfortable Enjoyment, whether it be in Relations, Eſtate, Health or Friends, is a Candle lighted by Providence for our Comfort in this World, and they are but Candles, which will not always laſt, and thoſe that laſt longeſt will be conſumed and waſted at laſt; but oftentimes it falls out with them as with Candles, they are blown out before they are half conſumed; yea, almoſt as ſoon as lighted up, and then we are in the Darkneſs for the preſent.</p>

His Life was very remarkable for Tenderneſs, and near Converſe with God in his walk; and which was worthy to be noticed, one day after a ſharp Tryal, having his only Son ſuddenly taken away by Death, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alone for ſeveral Hours, and when he came forth did look ſo chearfully, that to thoſe who asked him the Reaſon thereof,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:039945_0051_1014969C08557FC8"/>and wondred at the ſame, in ſuch a Time; he told them, <hi>He had got that in his Retirement with the Lord, that to have it afterward renewed, he would be content to loſe a Son every Day.</hi>

How gladly would I part with the deareſt and neareſt Creature-Comfort I own in this World.</p>
            <p>The gracious and tender Lord hath his Divine Cordial reſerved on Purpoſe for ſuch ſad Hours: Theſe are ſometimes given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome ſharp Tryal, to prepare for it, and ſometimes after, for to ſupport under it.</p>
            <p>I have often heard it from the Mouth, and found it in the <hi>Diary</hi> of a ſweet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:039945_0052_10146BCE39767AD0"/>now with God, That a little before the Lord removed her dear Husband by Death, there was ſuch an abundant Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of the Love of God unto her Soul, for ſeveral Days and Nights following; that when the Lord took away her Husband by Death, though he were a gracious, and ſweet tempered, and by her moſt tenderly beloved Husband; ſhe was ſcarce ſenſible of the Stroke, but carried quite above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things, their Comforts and their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; ſo that ſhe had almoſt loſt the Thoughts of her dear Husband in God. And had not the Lord taken this Courſe with her, ſhe concluded that Blow had not been poſſible to be born by her; ſhe muſt have ſunk without ſuch a Preparative.</p>
            <p>A Husband, a Wife, a Child, are great, very great Things, as they ſtand by other Creatures; but ſurely they will ſeem little Things, and next to nothing, when the Lord ſhall ſet himſelf by them before the Soul.</p>
            <p>And how know you, but God hath bid theſe earthly Comforts ſtand aſide this Day, for to make way for Heavenly ones; it may be God is coming to communicate himſelf more ſweetly, more ſenſibly than ever to your Souls; and theſe are the Providences which muſt caſt up and prepare the way of the Lord.

            <p>Satan is called <hi>the Ruler of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> Eph. 6.12. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> his Kingdom is ſupported by Darkneſs. Now there is a twofold Darkneſs, which gives Satan great Advantage: The Darkneſs of the <hi>Mind, viz.</hi> Ignorance; and the Darkneſs of the <hi>Condition, viz.</hi> Trouble and Affliction.

            <p>That cowardly Spirit falleth upon the People of God when they are down and low in Spirit, as well as State.

And then if your Hearts be truly gracious, that will pierce you deeper than ever your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which occaſioned it did.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore be tender of the Name of God, if you will not be ſo of your own Peace and Comfort.</p>

            <p>You now ſit penſive under the Rod, ſadly lamenting and deploring the Loſs of ſome earthly Comfort, your Heart is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Sorrow, your Eyes run down upon every Mention and Remembrance of your dear Friend. Why, if there were no more, this alone may diſcover the need you had of this Rod; for doth not all this Sorrow at parting, plainly ſpeak how much your Heart was ſet upon, how faſt your Heart was glewed to this earthly Comfort?</p>
            <p>Now you ſee that your Affections were ſunk many Degrees deeper into the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than you are aware of: and what ſhould God do in this Caſe by you? Should he ſuffer you to cleave to the Creature more and more? Should he permit it to purloin and exhauſt your Love &amp; Delight, and ſteal away your Heart from himſelf? This he could not do and love you. The more impatient you are under this Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more need you had of it.</p>

            <p>Yea, What if by this Stroke upon one of the pleaſanteſt Things you had in this World, God will diſcover to you, more ſenſibly and effectually than ever, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity both of that and all other earthly Comforts, ſo as that you ſhall from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth never let forth your Heart, your Hope, your Love and Delight to any of them, as you did before? You could talk before of the Creature's Vanity; but I queſtion whether ever you had ſo clear &amp; convincing a Sight of its Vanity as you have this Day. And is not this a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mercy in your Eyes?</p>
            <p>Now, if ever, God is weaning you from all fond Opinions, and vain Expectations from this World; by this your <hi>Judgment</hi> of the Creature is <hi>rectified,</hi> and your <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> to all other Enjoyments on Earth <hi>moderated:</hi> And is this nothing?

            <p>But ſhe then turned and on her Knees ſays, You ſhould, I am ſure, be Chriſtians, and Men I ſee you are; in taking away our miſerable Lives you do us a Pleaſure: But know, That as we never wronged you, nor yours, you muſt remember to die al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, your ſelves, and one Day give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Cruelty to the Judge of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth: Hereupon they reſolved
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:039945_0057_1014968803ECE9D0"/>not to murder them with their own Hands, but turned them all Naked upon a ſmall Iſland in the River without any Proviſion, there for to periſh.</p>
            <p>The next Day, the Two Boys having crept aſide, found the Hide of a Beaſt which had been killed, at the Root of a Tree; which the Mother caſt over them lying upon the Snow. The next Day a little Boat goes by, unto whom ſhe calls for God's ſake to take them out; but they being <hi>Iriſh,</hi> refuſed: She deſired a little Bread, but they ſaid they had none, then ſhe begs a Coal of Fire, which ſhe obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus with ſome fallen Chips, made a little Fire, and the Children taking a Piece of the Hide, laid it on the Coals, and began to gnaw the Leather; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extraordinary Divine Support, what could this do?</p>
            <p>Thus they lived Ten Days without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny viſible Means of Help, having no Bread but Ice and Snow, nor Drink ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Water. The two Boys being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But, judge whether a natural Death, in an ordinary Way, be comparable to ſuch
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:039945_0058_10149689D4ACB1B0"/>a Tryal as this! And yet thus the Lord did by this Choice and eminently graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Woman.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>Wall,</hi> in his <hi>None but Chriſt,</hi> relates as ſad a Paſſage of a poor Family in <hi>Germany,</hi> who were driven unto that Extremity in the Famine, that at laſt the Parents made a Motion one to the other to ſell one of the Children for Bread to ſuſtain themſelves and the reſt: But when they came for to conſider which Child it ſhould be, their Hearts ſo relented and yearned upon every one, that they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rather all to die together.

We now live partly by Faith, partly by Senſe, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon God, and partly upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Our State is mixed, therefore our comforts are ſo too: But when God ſhall be All in All, and we ſhall be as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God in the Way and Manner of
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:039945_0060_1014968E74597958"/>our Living; how much will the Caſe be altered with us then, from what it is now!</p>
            <p>Angels neither Marry nor are given in Marriage; neither ſhall the Children of the Reſurrection; when the Days of our Sinning are ended, the Days of our Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall be ſo too. No Graves were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened till Sin entered, and no more ſhall be opened when Sin is excluded.</p>
            <p>Our glorified Relations ſhall live with us for ever, they ſhall complain no more, die no more; yea, this is the Happineſs of that State to which you are paſſing on, that your Souls being in the neareſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with God the Fountain of Joy, you ſhall have no Concernment out of him. You ſhall not be put upon theſe Exerciſes of Patience; nor ſubjected to ſuch Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows as now you feel, any more. It is but a little while and the End of all theſe Things will come. Oh therefore bear up as Perſons that expect ſuch a Day of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee at Hand.</p>
            <p>And thus I have finiſhed the ſecond general Head of this Diſcourſe, which is a Diſſwaſive from the Sin of immoderate Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I now proceed to the third. Thing propoſed, namely, To remove the Pleas and Excuſes for this immoderate Grief. It's natural to Men, yea to good Men to
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:039945_0061_1014969221E9D2E0"/>juſtify their Exceſſes, or at leaſt extenuate them, by pleading for their Paſſions, as if they wanted not Cauſe and Reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to excuſe them. If theſe be fully anſwered, and the Soul once convinced, and left without Apology for its Sin, it is then in a fair Way for its Cure, which is the laſt Thing deſigned in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>My preſent Buſineſs therefore is to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thoſe Objections, and anſwer thoſe Reaſons which are commonly pleaded in this caſe, to juſtify our exceſſive Grief for the loſs of Relations And though I ſhall carry it in that Line of Relation to which the Text directs, yet it's equally applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all others.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Plea.</hi> You Preſs me by many great Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations to Meekneſs and quiet Submiſſion under this heavy ſtroke of God: But you little know what Sting my Soul feels now in it.</p>
            <p>This Child was a Child of many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it was a <hi>Samuel</hi> begg'd of the Lord, and I concluded when I had it, that it brought with it the Returns and Anſwers of many Prayers. But now I ſee it was nothing leſs: God hath no Regard to my Prayer about it; nor was it given me in that ſpecial way of Mercy as I imagined it to be. My Child is not only dead, but my Prayers in the ſame Day ſhut out and denied.</p>

1 <hi>Anſ.</hi> That you prayed for your Children before you had them was your Duty, and if you prayed not for them ſubmiſſively, referring it to the Pleaſure of God to give or deny them, to continue or remove them as ſhould ſeem good to him; that was your Sin; you ought not to limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor preſcribe to him, or capitulate with him, for what Term you ſhould enjoy your outward Comforts. If you did ſo, it was your Evil, and God hath juſtly rebuked it by this Stroke: If you pray conditionally, and ſubmiſſively, referring both the Mercy asked, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it to the Will of God as you ought to do; then there is nothing in the Death of your Child, that croſſes the true Scope and Intent of your Prayer.</p>

Now if the Lord have taken away your Child or Friend, &amp; in lieu thereof given you a meek, quiet, ſubmiſſive Heart to his Will, you need not ſay he hath ſhut out your Cry.</p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>Plea.</hi> But I have loſt alovely, obliging and moſt endearing Child, one that was beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſweet; it is a ſtony Heart that would not diſſolve into Tears, for the Loſs of one ſo deſireable, ſo engaging as this was. Ah it's no common Loſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The more lovely and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Relation was, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent will your Patience and Contentment with the Will of God in its Death be; the more Lovelineſs, the more Self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and the more Self-denial, the more Grace. Had it been a Thouſand Times more endearingly ſweet than it was, it was not too good to deny for God. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Obedience to the Will of God do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed maſter natural affections, and that you look upon Patience and Contentment as much more beautiful than the ſweeteſt and moſt deſireable Enjoyment on Earth; it may turn to you for a Teſtimony of the Truth and Strength of Grace, that you can, like <hi>Abraham,</hi> part with a Child whom you ſo dearly love in Obedience to the Will of your God whom you love infinitely more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Lovelineſs and Beauty of our Children and Relations, tho' it muſt be acknowledged a good Gift from the Hand
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:039945_0062_10149693C5C328A0"/>of God; yet it is but a common Gift, and oftentimes becomes a Snare, and is in its own Nature but a tranſitory &amp; vaniſhing Thing, and therefore no ſuch great Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Loſs as is pretended.</p>
            <p>I ſay, it is but a common Gift; <hi>Eliah, Adonijah,</hi> and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> had as lovely a Preſence as any in their Generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> it's not only common to the Wicked, with the Godly, but to brute Animals, as well as Men, and to moſt that excel in it, it becomes a Temptation; the Souls of ſome had been more beautiful &amp; lovely, if their Bodies had been leſs ſo. Beſides, it's but a Flower which flouriſhes in it's Month &amp; then fades. This therefore ſhould not be reflected on as ſo great a Circumſtance to aggravate your Trouble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Anſw.</hi> But if your Relation ſleep in Jeſus, he will appear Ten Thouſand Times more lovely in the Morning of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection than ever he was in this World.

In this Hope you part with them, therefore act ſuitably to your Hopes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Plea.</hi> Oh but my Child was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Did your Friend die young, or was the Bond of any other Relation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved almoſt as ſoon as made? Let not this ſeem ſo intolerable a Load to you; for if you have Ground to hope they died in Chriſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Mr. <hi>Baxters Epiſtle</hi> to the Life of Mr. John Janeway</note> then they lived long enough in this World. It's truly ſaid, he hath ſailed long enough, that hath won the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; &amp; he hath fought long enough that hath obtained the Victory; he hath run long enough that hath touched the Goal; and hath lived long enough on Earth, that hath won Heaven, be his Days never ſo few.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The ſooner your Relation died, the leſs Sin hath been committed, and the leſs Sorrow felt: What can you ſee in this World but Sin or Sorrow? A quick Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through it to Glory, is a ſpecial Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. Surely the World is not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable a Place that Chriſtians ſhould deſire an Hour's Time longer in it for themſelves or theirs, then ſerves to fit them for a better.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Anſ.</hi> And whereas you imagine the parting would have been eaſier, if the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment had been longer, it is a fond and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:039945_0063_101496979C379E18"/>groundleſs Suſpicion. The longer you had enjoyed them, the ſtronger would the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments have been. A young &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Plant may be eaſily drawn up by a ſingle Hand, but when it hath ſpread and fixed its Roots many Years in the Earth, it will require many a ſtrong Blow and hard Tug to root it up. Affections like thoſe under ground Roots, are fixed and ſtrengthened by nothing more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetude, and long Poſſeſſion; it's much eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parting now, than it would be hereafter, whatever you think. However, this ſhould ſatisfie you, that God's Time is the beſt Time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Plea.</hi> O but I have loſt all in one, it is my only one, I have none left in its room to repair the Breach, and make up the Loſs; if God had given me other Children to take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in, the Loſs had not been ſo great; but to loſe all at one Stroke, is in ſupportable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Religion allows not unto Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians a Liberty of expreſſing the Death of their dear Relations by ſo hard a Word as the Loſs of them is.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is no fit Expreſſion to ſay, you have loſt all in one, except that one be Chriſt, and he being once yours, can never be loſt.

Are there not Multitudes of Comforts yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of a higher kind, &amp; more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and durable Nature?

               </gap>amazing. God gave little or no Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:039945_0065_10146BC621CBBBC0"/>to prepare for this Trial: Death exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted its Commiſſion as ſoon as it opened it. My dear Husband, Wife, or Child, was ſnatcht unexpectedly out of my Arms by a ſurprizing Stroke; and this makes my Stroke heavier than my Complaint.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the Death of your Relation was ſo ſudden and ſurprizing, was much your own Fault, who ought to have lived in the daily Senſe of his Vanity, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of your Separation from it; you knew it to be a dying Comfort in its beſt Eſtate; and it is no ſuch wonderful Thing to ſee that dead, which we knew before to be dying: Beſides, you heard the Changes ringing round about you in other Families; you frequently ſaw other parents, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and Wives carrying forth their Dead; And what are all theſe but Warnings given you to prepare for the like Trials?</p>
            <p>Surely then it was your own Security and Regardleſsneſs that made this Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo ſurprizing to you, and who is to be blamed for that, you know.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is much Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſudden Death of Infants, and that of grown Perſons: The latter may have much Work to do, many Sins actually to Repent of, and many Evidences of their Intereſt in Chriſt to examine and clear, in order to their more comfortable Death: And ſo ſudden Death may be deprecated by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:039945_0065_10146BC621CBBBC0"/>
But the Caſe of Infants who exerciſe not their Reaſon is far different, they have no ſuch work to do, but are purely paſſive; all that is done in order to their Salvation, is done by God immediately upon them, ſo it comes all to one, whether their Death be more quick or ſlow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Anſ.</hi> You Complain of the Suddenneſs of the Stroke; but another will be ready to ſay, Had my Friend died in that manner, my Affliction had been nothing to what now it is; I have ſeen many Deaths contrived into one. I ſaw the gradual Approaches of it upon my dear Relation who felt every Tread of Death as it came on toward him, who often cried with <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 3.20. <hi>Wherefore is Light given to him that is in Miſery, and Life to the bitter in Soul? Which long for Death, but it cometh not, and dig for it more than for hidden Treaſures: Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which you reckon the Sting of your Affliction, others would have reckoned a Favour and Privilege. How many tender Parents, and other Relations, who loved their Friends as dearly as your ſelves, have been forced to their Knees upon no other Errand but this, to beg the Lord to haſten the Seperation, and put an End to that Sorrow, which to them was much greater than the Sorrow for the Dead.</p>

7. <hi>Plea.</hi> You preſs me to Moderation of Sorrows, and I know I ought to ſhew it; but don't know how the Caſe ſtands with me: There is a Sting in this Affliction that none feels but my ſelf; and O how intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is it now! I neglected proper Means in Seaſon to preſerve Life, or miſcarried in the Uſe of Means. I now ſee ſuch a Neglect or ſuch a Miſtake about the Means, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but judge greatly to contribute to that ſad Loſs which I now (too late) lament.</p>
            <p>O my Negligence, O my Raſhneſs and Inconſiderateneſs! How doth my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now ſmite me for my Folly! and by this aggravate my Burden beyond what is uſually felt by others. Had I ſeaſonably applied my ſelf unto the Uſe of proper Means, and kept ſtrictly to ſuch Courſes and Counſels as thoſe that are able and skilful might have preſcribed, I might now have had a living Husband, Wife or Child: Whereas I am now not only bereaved, but am apt to think I have bereaved my ſelf of them. Surely there is no Sorrow like unto my Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though it be an Evil to neglect and ſlight the Means ordained by God for Recovery of Health, yet it's no leſs Evil to aſcribe too much to them, or rely too much on them. The beſt Means in the World are weak and ineffectual without God's Aſſiſtance and Concurrence, and they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:039945_0066_1014969DC9700FB8"/>have that his Aſſiſtance or Concurrence, when his Time is come; and that it was fully come in your Friend's Caſe, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted now by the Event. So that if your Friend had had the moſt excellent Helps the World affords, they would have availed nothing. This Conſideration takes Place only in your Caſe, who ſee what the Will of God is by the Iſſue, and may not be pleaded by any whilſt it remains dubious and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as it generally doth in Time of Sickneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Do you not unjuſtly charge and fault your ſelves for that which is not really your Fault or Neglect? How far you are chargeable in this Caſe will beſt appear by comparing the Circumſtances you are now in, with thoſe you were in when your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was only arreſted by Sickneſs; and it was dubious to you what was your Duty and beſt Courſe to take.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly you had obſerved ſo many to periſh in <hi>Phyſicians</hi> Hands, and ſo many to recover without them, that you judged it to be ſafer for your <hi>Friend</hi> to be without thoſe Means, than to be hazarded by 'em.</p>
            <p>Or if divers Methods and Courſes were preſcribed and perſwaded to, and you now ſee your Error in preferring that which was moſt improper, and neglecting what was more ſafe and probable; yet as long as it did not ſo appear to your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at that Time, but you followed the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:039945_0067_1014969F9FC57BE0"/>beſt Light you had to guide you at that Time, it were moſt unjuſt to charge the Fault upon your ſelves for chooſing that Courſe that then ſeemed beſt to you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were ſo in it ſelf or not.</p>
            <p>To be angry with your ſelves for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or omitting what was then done, or omitted according to your beſt Diſcretion and Judgment, becauſe you now ſee it by the Light of the Event far otherwiſe than you did before, it is for to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that you are but Men, or that you are not as God, who only can foreſee Iſſues and Events; &amp; that you acted as all ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures are bound to do, according to the beſt Light they have, at the Time &amp; Seaſon of Action.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To conclude, Times of Great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction are, ordinarily times of great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and it's uſual with Satan than to charge us with more Sins than we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty of, and alſo make thoſe Things ſeem to be Sins, which upon impartial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination will not be found to be ſo.</p>

            <p n="10">10 <hi>Plea.</hi> God hath bleſſed me with an Eſtate, &amp; outward Comforts in the World, which I reckoned to have left to my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity:

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> How many are there in the World, yea, of our own Acquaintance, whom God hath either denied, or deprived both of the Comforts of Children &amp; of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates too? If he have left you thoſe outward Comforts, you ought to acknowlege his Goodneſs therein, &amp; not to ſlight theſe becauſe he hath deprived you of the other.</p>

            <p>Surely we are not ſent into this World to heap up our great Eſtates for our Children; and if you have been too eager in this Deſign, you may now read God's juſt Rebuke of your Folly.

            <p n="12">12 <hi>Plea. Laſtly,</hi> It is objected. O but God hides his Face from me in Affliction: It is dark within as well as without; and this makes my Caſe moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; greatly afflicted, and ſadly deſerted!</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though you want at preſent ſenſible Comfort, yet you have Reaſon to be thankful for gracious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, Though the Light of God's Countenance ſhine not upon you; yet you find that the everlaſting Arms are underneath you; the Care of God worketh for you, when the Conſolations of God are withdrawn from you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Anſ.</hi> To have God hide his Face in the time of Trouble is no new, nor unuſual Thing.

And thus I have ſatisfied the moſt conſiderable Pleas urged in Juſtification of our Exceſſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I come now to the laſt Thing propoſed, namely, The Means of curing and preventing theſe ſinful Exceſſes of Sorrow for the Death of dear Relations.</p>
            <p>And although much hath been ſaid already to diſſuade from this Evil, and I have enlarged already beyond my firſt Intention; yet I ſhall caſt in ſome farther Help and Aſſiſtance towards the Healing of this Deſtemper, by preſcribing the following Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Rule. <hi>If you would not mourn exceſſively for the Loſs of Creature-Comforts, then beware that you ſet not your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Love exceſſively or inordinatly upon them whilſt you do enjoy them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strong <hi>Affections</hi> make ſtrong <hi>Afflictions,</hi> the higher the Tide, the lower the Ebb. According to the Meaſure of our Delight in the Enjoyment, is our Grief in the Loſs of theſe Things. The Apoſtles knits theſe two Graces, <hi>Temperance</hi> &amp; <hi>Patience</hi> together in the Precept, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. And it's very obſervable, how <hi>Intemperance</hi> and <hi>Impatience</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably linked in Experience, yea, the Experience of the beſt Men, You read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.3. How <hi>Iſrael loved Joſeph more than all his Children, becauſe he was the on of his old Age; and made him a Coat of many Colours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Darling; <hi>Jacob's</hi> Heart was exceedingly ſet upon him; his very Life was bound up in the Life of the Lad, Now when the ſuppoſed Death of this Child was brought to him, how did he carry it See <hi>Ver.</hi> 34.35. <hi>And Jacob rent his Cloaths, and put Sackloth upon his Loins, and mourned for his Son many Days: And all his Sons &amp; all his Daughters roſe up to comfort him, but he refuſed to he Comforted; and he ſaid, For I will go down to the Grave to my Son mourning. Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his Father wept for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, as in a Glaſs, are the Effect of exceſſive Love to a Child repreſented. Here you may ſee what Work immoderate Love will make, even in a ſanctified Heart.</p>
            <p>O therefore <hi>let your Moderation be known to all Men,</hi> in your Delights and Sorrows about earthly Things; for ordinarily the Proportion of the one is anſwerable to the other.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:039945_0071_101496AA487B8240"/>
2. Rule. <hi>If you would not be overwhelmed with Grief for the Loſs of your Relations, be exact and careful in diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Duties to them while you have them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Teſtimony of your Conſcience that you have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in all Things to diſcharge the Duties you owed to your Relations, whilſt they were with you, will prove an excellent Allay to your Sorrows for them when they are no longer yours. 'Tis not ſo much the ſingle Affliction as the Guilt charged upon us in Times of Affliction, that makes our Load ſo heavy.</p>
            <p>O what a terrible Thing is it to look upon our dead Friend, whilſt Conſcience is accuſing and upbraiding us for our Duties neglected, and ſuch or ſuch Sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? O you little think how dreadfula Spectacle this will make the dead Body of thy Friend to thee.</p>
            <p>Conſcience if not quite ſtupid, or dead, will ſpeak at ſuch a Time. O therefore, as ever you would provide for a comfortable parting at Death, or meet again at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; be exact, punctual and circumſpect in all your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Duties.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Rule <hi>If you would not be overwhelmed by Trouble for the loſs of dear Relations, then turn to God under your Trouble, and pour out your Sorrows by Prayer into his Boſom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will eaſe and allay your Troubles? Bleſſed be God for the Ordinance of Prayer; How much are all the Saints beholden to it at all Times, but eſpecially in Heart-ſinking &amp; diſtreſsful Times. It's ſome Relief, when in our Diſtreſs we can pour out our Trouble into the Boſom of a Wife, or faithful Friend; how much more when we leave our Complaint before the gracious, wiſe, and faithful God? I told you before of that Holy Man, who having loſt his dear and only Son, got to his Cloſet, there poured out his Soul freely to the Lord, and when he came down to his Friends that were waiting below to comfort him and fearing how he would bear that Stroke; he came from his Duty with a chearful Countenance, telling them he would be content to bury a Son, if it were poſſible, every Day, provided he might enjoy ſuch Comforts as his Soul had found in that private Hour.</p>

O you little know what a bitter Cup others have had given them to drink. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if you compare, you muſt ſay, the Lord hath dealt gently and graciouſly with me.</p>

            <p>Increaſe not your Sorrow by the Sight of, or Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about ſad Objects, and labour to avoid them, as Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions preſented by the Enemy of your Souls, to draw forth the Corruptions of your heart.</p>
            <p>I told you before, why <hi>Jacob</hi> would not have the Child of which <hi>Rachel</hi> died, called after the Name his Wife had given, <hi>Benoni,</hi> the Son of my Sorrow, leſt it ſhould
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:039945_0073_101496AEDB53E150"/>prove a daily Occaſion of renewing his Trouble for the loſs of his dear Wife; but he called his Name <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Patience is like Tinder, or Gun-Powder, ſo long as you can prevent the Sparks from falling on it, there is no great Danger: But you that carry ſuch dangerous prepared Matter in your own Hearts, cannot be too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent them. Do by murmuring as you do by blaſphemous Thoughts, think quite another way, and give no Occaſion.</p>
