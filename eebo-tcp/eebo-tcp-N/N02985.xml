         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear and intirely beloved Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is an afflicting Providence from God, and juſt Cauſe of Shame to me <hi>(for I cannot clear my ſelf from a great deal of juſt Blame</hi>) that I have not done, nor can now do any Thing for you in Regard of thoſe Writings you deſired of me: I have, and am continually preſſed with Variety of urgent Occaſions, and much Time (<hi>in the Way I am in</hi>) is daily taken up from my perſonal Studies, beſides many incident Avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And alas! I can do little, and make but ſlow Progreſs in the long Race of Learning I have to run! And it is my miſerable Guiſe, either by Wickedneſs or Weakneſs, to fall ſhort of that Good I ſhould either get or do; and if it be ſo in this Caſe towards you, it is no Wonder, tho' it ſhould be my deep Sorrow! But yet conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Paſſages in your laſt and former Letters concerning your ſpiritual Condition, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Experience in my ſelf, the Reality of ſuch Complaints; I would not be ſo graceleſs as to neglect you wholly therein. And tho' I can ſay or do very little, yet a Word or two might be of ſome Uſe; nor do I know what Guilt might lie upon me, if I ſhould be ſilent or ſlight in this Caſe! And therefore (<hi>Dear</hi> —) if my barren Heart would ſuffer me, I would preſent you with a few Words, as if you and I were alone in a Corner, in the Preſence of God!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003575_0003_0FF82F680ECF2728"/>The Condition you expreſs, is the common (<hi>but fearful</hi>) Epidemical Calamity of thoſe Times and Places where the Goſpel is preached, and among ſuch as outwardly carry fair: Convinced, but not humbled; ſome Apprehenſions of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Affections now and then, but not deep effectual Mournings; ſomething burdened with Sin and Miſery, and Wrath of God; but yet able to bear it, and contented to live, without being delivered from it: Knowing every Thing and feeling nothing; or rather knowing every Thing, and yet indeed knowing nothing; in ſeeing not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For my own Part, it is that which hath been the baneful Miſery of my Soul (<hi>even that very Thing which you ſay and mean</hi>) ever ſince I knew any Thing; and the Lord knows how little I am delivered from it, and how much of my Work in this Point (<hi>upon which the very Hinges of our Salvation turn</hi>) is yet to do to this Day! Oh <hi>(my</hi> —) if my Heart were not Adamant, I ſhould weep with and for you: And truly when I am moſt near God, I have no greater Requeſt than this for my ſelf and you, that God would uſe any Means to make us ſee Things really as they are, and pound our Hearts all to Pieces, and make indeed Sin moſt bitter, and Chriſt moſt ſweet, that we might be both humbled, and comforted to Purpoſe! An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Work of the Law, and then an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Work of the Goſpel is the Bane and Ruin of us in theſe Days! Some Fears and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then ſome Hopes of Mercy <hi>(without finding full Reſt and Satisfaction in Chriſt only</hi>)
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003575_0004_0FF82F699E04B910"/>
Men reſt in, and here periſh! But hence is the Ground of that you ſpeak of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An Heart that doth not, cannot feel Sin, (<hi>and conſequently, no other Thing that God's Word ſpeaks of)</hi> and the Wrath of God for it, to purpoſe; cannot be ſenſible of Sin or Miſery in an effectual Manner! Now a Word or two of Counſel to you in this Caſe!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Conſider the End and Things you are to ſtrive after. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Way and Manner how: Your Buſineſs is never to reſt till you come to feel Sin as an inſupportable Burden, and then to find Reſt and everlaſting Satisfaction in Chriſt, imbracing him as your own! To go on humbling to be humbled, and to ſee ſuch intolerable Evil in Sin; and to be ſo burdened with the Wrath of God lying upon you for it, as it may make Sin everlaſtingly odious to you, and force you to fly for Refuge to lay hold of the Hope ſet before you; and to have ſtrong Conſolation there! This is a great Thing, not eaſily and quickly gotten: But ſit not down at Quiet, till you come to this! This is the Way to make all ſure. But you will ſay I know not whether I ever had any true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation; whether there is any Thing in me that will ſtand by me, when an Hour of Temptation comes! Therefore now reſolve, I will padle and dally with God and my own Soul no longer, I will never give God reſt till he ſhew me Things really, and till I have attained that Senſe of Sin, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, which is real and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual! This is the Work of our Lives, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. Let me never reſt till it be put out of all Doubt,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003575_0005_0FF82F6BC19B31A0"/>
that God in Chriſt is mine own, and hath made an everlaſting Covenant with me! This I will have, or I will be in Bitterneſs before the Lord while I have any Being; and for the Reſidue of my Days, I will dwell with them that lie down in Sorrow, I will have my Society with ſuch forſaken Souls; who being deſolate and deſerted, are free among the Dead: If the bleſſed God ſhall excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this wretched Soul from his gracious Preſence, <hi>(which yet is but an Act of his moſt holy and juſt Severity.)</hi> O! let me find this Favour in his Sight, that I may alſo excommunicate my ſelf from the Pleaſures and Enjoyments of this preſent World! And reſolve this, If God will not me ſee the Good of his Choſen, (<hi>and I have nothing to ſay why he ſhould.)</hi> I will mourn, I will mourn; let me live &amp; dye in the Houſe of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning! If God will not Comfort me, nothing elſe ſhall; if I may not have Peace and Reſt in God. I'll have none at all; if God will take no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in me; I'll take no Pleaſure in myſelf: Let my Tears be my Meat continually; let me go mourning up and down the World while I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

(<hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.2, 3, 17, 18. and 143.4, 7.) And in a Time of Need God will help; when you are loſt, God will find you, when you are ſick to Death, he will heal you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16, 28, 29. His Bowels will yearn

towards you! Never fear want of Conſolation, if your Humiliation be not ineffectual! And here let me warn you of a Thing or two!</p>
            <p>Take heed leſt ſome leſſer Sorrows and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heal and eaſe you, and ſo you be kept from great and effectual Sorrows and from Comfort by Chriſt only! Many a one ſees himſelf in a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Condition; hereupon he goes alone, he prays (<hi>and weeps too it may be</hi>) very affectionately for Mercy: Upon this he grows well and whole again! His good Affections pleaſe him, and heal him; tho' he be indeed ſtill as far from Chriſt and grounded Comfort as ever! Take Heed of this: As alſo ſecondly, Of reſting in ſome Hopes of Mercy, or in ſome Taſtes of Mercy! Many Things give a Man a good Hope that God may ſave him, and the Words of Comfort are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſweet and refreſhing to his Heart; this quiets him: He hath enough now, he runs away with this, when as Chriſt himſelf is not yet his; nor is he ſatisfied with him only! Many periſh here; not but that theſe Affections and Hopes are very good, and they may be true, <hi>(and be ſure to be exceeding thankful for any ſuch Thing; that you have any Deſire to ſeek God, any Tears at any Time before him, and Hope toward him; it's more than Thouſands have)</hi> and very good Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeek after Chriſt more; but not to be reſted in without Chriſt. It's a Sign a Man's Heart is falſe when a little of any thing will ſerve him! Uſe thoſe Sorrows, Heart-breakings and Hopes, as bleſſed Encouragements and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to follow on ſtill, and get nearer to Chriſt,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003575_0007_0FF82F7004E382B8"/>
and to gain in upon him; but reſt not till you be ſure you have Chriſt; and fully reſt in him, and your Heart live upon him only, alone, wholly and always! Now for the Way you are to take in the Caſe, owned and expreſſed by yourſelf, I would add a little as the Lord ſhall help.</p>
            <p>Do not ſay there is no Hope, and ſo give over ſtriving! Give not Way to a ſullen Deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deadneſs of Heart; to a dulled, ſunk, diſcouraged Spirit, as if it were in vain to ſtir, and will never be better with you! Do not ſay, Thus it hath been, and thus it is, and you cannot help it, and there leave it! No, no, <hi>Ariſe and be doing, and God will be with you</hi>; is an old Rule! Whatever your Caſe be, never be <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged:</hi> Be humble and afflicted under Sin and Miſery, (<hi>the more the better</hi>) but never be <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged!</hi> Reſolve, I will yet follow God for all this, come on me what will! See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20. Know that God is God, and not Man, he <hi>can</hi> help, nay he <hi>will!</hi> He is willing to help you, if you be not unwilling to have it: See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. and 6.36. He hath after Mercies for them that have abuſed former Mercies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1, 22. If it were but a <hi>may be, Amos</hi> 5.15. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. A <hi>who can tell? Jon.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.14. A <hi>Lord, if thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 8.2. It's enough to make us follow after God to the laſt Gaſp! Secondly, Look up to the infinite God to help you for his Name ſake, and for the Lord Jeſus ſake. You know you are miſerable, and have unſpeakable Need of his Help; tho' you do not feel it, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003575_0008_0FF82F7217EC9688"/>
be not affected with it. Upon this Ground <hi>(and this is Ground enough</hi>) go to God and tell him, that the leſs Senſe you have, the greater is your Miſery, and the more Need you have of his Help: None but God can pull you out of this Pit, can inlighten this Darkneſs, and break this Adamant; to him therefore you come according to his own Counſel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. Tell him, He knows you and ſees you, tho' you do not know or ſee him, no, nor your ſelf neither: He can take hold of you, tho' you cannot take hold of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. Bring ſuch an Heart as you have <hi>(longing that it were better</hi>) to him, that he would mend it: Bewail this impenitent Heart, cry out of this ſecure ſottiſh Heart, as the greateſt Evil that could befal you; beſeech him to uſe any Means to break it and change it: Fill your Mouth with Arguments before him; tell him of his free, (<hi>Oh hang there upon free Mercy</hi>) his tender, his preventing, his manifold rich Mercy: Say you are reſolved never to leave him till he give you this Grace effectually, and all the Grace you want, everlaſting Mercy: Cry to him out of the thick Darkneſs, and out of the low Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.55. When you have no Mind to pray, when Devil and World, when Heart and the Gates of Hell are againſt you: Yet then, even then, pray in Spite of all your ſpiritual Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: Offer Violence to the Kingdom of Heaven, ſtir up your ſelf to take hold on God; lay hold on Eternal Life, when nothing but Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Death is about you; when God ſtops his Ear againſt you, and ſhuts up his Heart too;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003575_0009_0FF82F7428A11F80"/>
yet then fall down before him, put your Mouth in the Duſt; judge and loath your ſelf, hate your Sin, that brought you to this Paſs: Look again toward him, (as <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.4, 7.) cloſe with him at and upon the Sword's Point, (<hi>tho' he kill</hi> me, <hi>yet will I truſt in him.</hi>) Bleſs his Name and ſay as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.21. Chatter before him; leave your ſelf to his Mercy, to his abſolute, ſovereign, meer Mercy, renouncing all other Props &amp; Comforts: See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. Tell him as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9. reſolve to follow him, tho' blindfold, and ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32, 33. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. When you are ſhut up under Sin and Unbelief, then look to him who is able to ſave to the utmoſt them that come to God by him: You know not how to look to him, nor what it is to believe, nor how to go about ſuch a Thing; therefore tell God that you come to him for Faith, as well as other Things. You want every Thing, &amp; you come for every Thing: (<hi>the pooreſt Creature that lives)</hi> and know that the bleſſed God would have you come to him in Chriſt for every Thing: Chriſt hath all Power in his Hands to help you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. and ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. Thirdly, continue in ſeeking God till you find him: <hi>Follow on to know the Lord</hi>; and then be your Caſe what it will, you ſhall know him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. Many are very ſerious and earneſt for a Fit; but they give over before the Lord come, and will rather patch up their Comfort and Salvation of any Faſhion, than take the Pains to hold out in ſeeking God with all their Might: Multitudes periſh here. Oh! look to this; for do not think (<hi>eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003575_0010_0FF82F7672364B38"/>
in the Caſe you are in</hi>) to get Grace &amp; Chriſt (<hi>in the Senſe before ſpoken of)</hi> preſently! No, no, God may make you ſeek and wait many a Day; but you ſhall reap in due Time if you faint not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. Diligently therefore and conſtantly attend and improve all the Ordinances and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunites that God gives: In ſpecial, let me ſpeak a Word or two for your better Help in them, <hi>(being more private and perſonal)</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Meditation (a moſt neceſſary and effectual Thing which few Practice:</hi>) Get a little Time to meditate daily, laying aſide other Things, and in other Occaſions too, think as much of ſpiritual Things as you can: We do not ſee nor feel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not think of Things; think of God and of Chriſt, of Sin, of Heaven, of Hell, of Judgment, of Eternity, how few ſhall be ſaved, how neceſſary it is to take the preſent Time: What we come into the World for; of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Paſſages in Scripture, of God's Dealings with you, of your former Life and preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you will ſay, my Heart is ſo vain and ſtupid, I cannot think of Things. I anſwer, Firſt, Let this deeply humble you; and the Vileneſs of your Heart that here diſcovers it ſelf will be worth the while. Secondly, beſeech God to help you. Thirdly, By uſe of Time you will find it more eaſy. Fourthly, Take Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon all the evil Frames that at preſent you feel, to apply and ſet on ſome ſoaking Expreſſion in Scripture: As in Caſe of Hardneſs, Blindneſs, Vanity, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. Yea, hence ſee and ſay, that God is true, and his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003575_0011_0FF82F780A8B7E50"/>
Word is true; for the Scripture tells me of this Heart I feel; and the reſt of it will be verified upon me as well as this. Fifthly, Take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſpecial Seaſons for Meditation, when your Heart is in a feeling Frame (<hi>as after Prayer, after Sermon, if you cannot before</hi>) and lay up what you get: One Truth felt in Meditation, is worth a World, and it will make Way for more. Sixthly, Do ſomething that is equivalent and helping to it, at leaſt when you cannot ſo directly meditate: as reading of a good Book, writing of your former and preſent Life: (<hi>that is a Thing of endleſs Uſe)</hi> gathering up God's Mercies, &amp; your Sins, in writing ſometimes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Prayer,</hi> this is the bleſſed Means of getting a poor Soul to Heaven: And what an Happineſs is it, that we may pray to God! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Family Prayer, get ſome Time for ſecret Prayer, daily leſs or more: Be telling God your Heart alone; I know your Occaſions &amp; Labours (<hi>the Lord break my Heart for you</hi>) would not afford you that Liberty that I (<hi>Wretch</hi>) have: But do what you can; love the Duty, and God will pity you, wherein you are juſtly and by his Providence (<hi>not your own Negligence</hi>) hindred. And this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he that hath an Heart, ſhall never want Time nor Place to pray! Endeavour to order your Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo, as you may have Time for it: And if you could weekly have a Piece of an Afternoon (<hi>as Saturday in the Afternoon an Hour or two or as God guides</hi>) ſet a part for ſecret &amp; cloſe converſe with God by Meditation &amp; Prayer, thinking, writing, reading, examining, mourning before God; and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003575_0012_0FF82F7A268E6C20"/>
do this conſtantly, you will never repent it: The Buſineſs of Salvation is mainly carrried on in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret between God and a Man's own Soul: And by all Means provide, that you may have your Sabbaths as free as poſſible all the Day, and the Evening before and after, for ſpiritual Work: Ply God in ſuch Seaſons as theſe be, and be very thankful if you <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et but any little Ground of your Corruptions and Miſeries: Go about your law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Occaſions, not as a Liberty to the Fleſh, <hi>(as to think that now my Taſk of praying is over, now I may pleaſe my ſelf &amp; refreſh my Heart in the World,</hi> &amp;c.) but as the Service of God, and as unto him, becauſe he bids you be thus employed; as when he bids me pray, I will pray with all my Might; ſo I will work too, when he bids me work; and not do it to pleaſe myſelf (<hi>alas, if I conſider it, what Pleaſure or Comfort is there in this evil World</hi>) but to pleaſe him I will buſy and employ my ſelf in this World, (<hi>becauſe he bids me</hi>) but my Place and my Reſt ſhall be only in God, or no where: As Seamen go to Sea, but build their Houſes on Land; ſo I'll go into the World, but lay up my Heart and Comfort and my whole Support in God! I will live <hi>in</hi> the World, but not <hi>upon</hi> it; I will live only upon God, &amp; have my Portion in him. And do not think that this Sorrow &amp; Senſe of Sin, &amp; mourning after God, ſtands in a monkiſh drooping Sullenneſs and Sadneſs, (<hi>tho' it's certain that by the Sadneſs of the Countenance the Heart is made better; and one ſhould not give himſelf to unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Mirth, which is very poyſonful; nor purpoſely choak his ſpiritual Sorrows with temporal Delights:</hi>)
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003575_0013_0FF82F7C2910F468"/>
But when you have ſeriouſly ſpent your Time with God, and have left your Heart with him, and he calls you to your Occaſions; go about them with Alacrity and Chearfulneſs, ſo as you may diſpatch them comfortably; and carry amiably and delightfully to thoſe about you. And let your Sorrows &amp; Senſe of your Soul's Miſeries lie deep and undermoſt, ſo as you may recall them in their Seaſon; when you come to pray, or be alone with God again! Labour to have a conſtant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual feeling of your ſelf, (<hi>and get as many good Thoughts and Affections as you can, at all Times)</hi> ſo as it may be livelily, actual, eſpecially in your Seaſons of attending upon God; and in them drive on the Buſineſs of your Soul, as if there were nothing elſe to be minded but that. And if you find your Heart gone when the Seaſon of ſeeking God comes, then know that you have in ſome Meaſure backſlidden and forſaken God; and never leave till you have recovered it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and review often the chief Sins of your Life that you can remember; confeſs and aggravate them before God in a ſpecial Manner, <hi>(but have your Times of confeſſing and bewailing all the Sins that ever you can remember</hi>) and think of what Sins or Courſe it was that cauſed God to leave you to this woful Impenitency of Heart, &amp; bewail them bitterly. One thing more I muſt add; Do not think it much to have ſome ſpecial Seaſons of ſeeking God, beſides thoſe I have named. If you had a Friend with whom you might now &amp; then ſpend a little Time, in conferring together, in opening your Hearts, and preſenting your unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003575_0014_0FF82F7E47E6A8C8"/>
Groanings before God, it would be of excellent Uſe: Such an one would greatly ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, beſtead, and further you in your Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Spend now and then (<hi>as Occaſions permit)</hi> an Hour (<hi>or ſo)</hi> with ſuch a Friend more than ordinary <hi>(ſometimes a Piece of a Day, ſometimes a whole Day of extraordinary Faſt, in ſtriving and wreſtling with God for everlaſting Mercy.</hi>) And be much in quickning Conference, giving and taking mutual Encouragements &amp; Directions in the Matters of Heaven! Oh! the Life of God that falls into the Hearts of the Godly, in and by gracious heavenly Conference. Be open hearted one to another, and ſtand one for another againſt the Devil and all his Angels. Make it thus your Buſineſs in theſe and ſuch like Ways, to provide for Eternity <hi>while it is called to Day; looking unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of your Faith.</hi> But you will ſay (<hi>it may be</hi>) and I ſpeak but what I have found in my own Heart: (<hi>Dear — I deal plainly with you, as I know you would have me do, and therefore let me ſuppoſe it ſhould be ſaid</hi>) This is a tedious and hard Taſk, and my Heart likes not to be ſo yoaked and toiled in ſuch Things? I can take no Pleaſure therein; and if I force my ſelf to it for a while, yet it would ſoon weary me: I have no Heart to theſe Things; it may be ſomething might be done in this Way, or another might do ſomething; but I have no Heart to it.</p>
            <p>Anſ. 1. <hi>Wonder not at this, nor think the worſe of that Courſe, becauſe your Heart luſteth againſt it; but think the better of it.</hi> For, the better any
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003575_0015_0FF82F80B300E668"/>
Thing is, and the more inſtrumental for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the more it is oppoſed by our vile Hearts, which are Enemies to God, and conſequently to our own chief Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Confeſs to God this Naughtineſs of your Heart:</hi> Beſeech him to help you againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Devil, to change your Nature, and let this occaſion you to ſee, and loath the Wickedneſs of your Nature, and be enraged againſt it. <hi>The Spirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us luſteth unto Envy, but he giveth more Grace</hi>; Jam. 4.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider what is the Reaſon why this Way ſeems ſo irkſome and tedious, and you have no Heart to it?</hi> Is it not becauſe of inward Blindneſs and Security? becauſe you ſee not Things as they be, nor the Weight and Worth of them? It is an irkſome Thing to a Man to riſe out of his Bed in the Night, when he lies warm, &amp; knows no Danger, nor urgent Occaſion to riſe; but if he awake, and ſee his Houſe on Fire about his Ears, he will make no Demur about the Matter, but be glad he may riſe! Verily, one real Glimpſe of the Wrath of God burning about us, or of <hi>Eternity</hi> that is a coming; one real Glimpſe of God's Anger (<hi>lying upon our Souls</hi>) which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above the moſt awful Apprehenſion of Man or Angel; Oh! this would make us ſkip at a Time to <hi>pray</hi> in, at an Hour to cry out to God for <hi>Mercy</hi> in, eſpecially if we might do it with any Hope of being heard and ſaved, as now we may. So the Reaſon why I have no Heart to this Courſe, is not becauſe there is Want of Reaſon to perſwade me, but becauſe I am blind;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003575_0016_0FF82F82B60FB0F0"/>
and I feel my Blindneſs, I know that I do not ſee Things as they be, and therefore I have good Reaſon to be deaf, to the Counſel of mine own blind ignorant Heart, and to ſtrive by all Means to ſee better; and in the mean Time to believe what I do not ſee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Offer Violence therefore to the Kingdom of Heaven, and be reſolved in this Point:</hi> Let my Heart ſay what it will, let Hell and World be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; my God I muſt have! my God I will have! I muſt get Sight of Sin, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus? I muſt make my Salvation ſure, or elſe I am undone for ever; and therefore pray I will, and follow God I will, in Deſpite of the Devil: Unto him will I look and (<hi>in ſuch a Cauſe as this)</hi> on him will I wait, who giveth the ſame Spirit of Zeal, of Indignation againſt Sin &amp; Self, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was in holy <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he hewed <hi>Agag</hi> in Pieces before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal.</hi> Lord, thou haſt commanded me to <hi>ſeek thy Face, and thy Face will I ſeek:</hi> I will not confer with Fleſh and Blood; I will not conſult with carnal Reaſon; but what God bids me do, that will I do, and do it with all my Might.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Know that if you conſcionably attend upon God, he will by Degrees make it ſweet and eaſy to you: He will ſtrengthen your Heart and Hands in your Way and Work,</hi> Iſa. 40.31. You will find it a ſweet and bleſſed Thing to ſtand confeſſing your Sins before God, and emptying your Heart in his Sight, opening all your Complaints and Soul Concernments to him: You will find it an Happineſs that you may pray to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003575_0017_0FF82F84D39C4380"/>
and have any Communion with him. Our wicked Hearts make religious Duties irkſome; elſe they are in themſelves the ſweeteſt Things in the World: Oh! if ever we come to know God aright, we ſhall account it our Happineſs that we may do any thing in Way of Service to him, and Communion with him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Salvation is worth all our Labour, he it what it will:</hi> Is it a Trifle to be ſaved eternally? Do we think to get to Heaven by a good Wiſh? Or to go thither in a Feather-Bed? No, God will make us ſtrive, and ſweat, and wreſtle for it: and be ſure it will quit the Coſt! It will never repent us of any Prayer we have made, or Tear we have wept, when we come there! Oh! fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not the Guiſe of this ſecure World, that (<hi>in theſe Days</hi>) is caſt into a dead Sleep: Many profeſs, but few know what it is to work out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is another Matter to be a Chriſtian indeed than moſt make of it: And of thoſe that are ſincere and lively, you ſee but their dark Side, you know not what they are in ſecret: Follow not Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but follow the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you the Sum of my Tho'ts, according to my Meaſure and Manner. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to make ſome Uſe of this poor Letter, and read it at ſuch Times as may moſt ſuit you: You may have many Doubts &amp; Difficulties that I do not here touch; but ſeek God, and he will guide you. As for your outward Condition, follow on in theſe Things, and your Trouble for Sin and Soul Miſery will ſwallow up all other

            <p>Now the tender Mercies of God be with you (<hi>Dear</hi> —) and the Lord lead you by the Hand to his eternal Reſt, through all Sins and Sorrows, to his own Glory, and your everlaſting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; ſo I remain,</p>

               <lb/>Carefully corrected from <hi>Five</hi> ſeveral <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts:</hi> By THOMAS PRINCE. <lb/>Being an Anſwer to this Queſtion, <hi>How to live in this World, ſo as to live in Heaven.</hi>

               <salute>DEAR BROTHER,</salute>

            <p>YOurs I received, and thought on. The Queſtion, is, <hi>How ſo to live in this World, as yet to live in Heaven?</hi> It is one of the common Places of my Heart that I have often Occaſion to ſtudy, and therefore takes me not unprovided. It is hard to keep the Helm up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many croſs Winds and Edyes, and Out-Land and boarding of Creatures, as we meet withal upon this Sea of Glaſs and Fire. And truly that Man knoweth not his own Heart who finds it not difficult to break through the Entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements of the World. Creature <hi>Smiles</hi> ſtop and intice away the Affections from JESUS CHRSIT: Creature <hi>Frowns</hi> encompaſs and tempeſtuate the Spirit, that it thinks it doth well to be angry: Both Ways Grace is a looſer. We had all Need to watch and pray, leſt we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into theſe Temptations. The greateſt of

your Conflicts &amp; Cauſes of your Complaints, ſeem here to have their Original. Temptations fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tempers. As there are <hi>two</hi> predominant Qualities in the Temper of every Body; ſo there are <hi>two</hi> predominant Sins in the Temper of every Heart: And <hi>Pride is one</hi> in all Men in the World: the <hi>other</hi> is <hi>Care</hi> about <hi>Futurities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will tell you familiarly what GOD hath done for my Soul, and in what Tract my Soul keeps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf. (1) I am come to a Concluſion to look for no great Matters in the World; but to know JESUS CHRIST and him crucified. I make beſt Way <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> low Gale. A high Spirit and a high Sail together will be dangerous: and therefore I prepare to live low. I deſire not much, I pray againſt it. My Study is my Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo much as to attend that, without Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am bound to plead for; and more I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not. By my ſecluded Retirements, I have Advantage to obſerve how every Day's Occaſions inſenſibly wear off the Heart from GOD, and bury it in it ſelf; which they that ever live in the Noiſe and Lumber of the World, cannot be ſenſible of. (2) I have learned to ſee a Need of every Thing GOD gives me; and to need nothing that he denies me. There is no Diſpenſation, though croſs and afflictive, but either <hi>in</hi> it or <hi>after</hi> it, I find I could not be without it: And nothing that I am without, whether it be taken from me, or not given to me; but ſooner or later GOD quiets me in himſelf without me. (3) I caſt all my Care on the LORD, and live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity on the Wiſdom and Care of my heavenly

Father. My Ways are you know, in ſome Senſe hedged up with Thorns, and grow darker and darker daily; but yet I miſtruſt not my good GOD in the leaſt; and live more quiet in the Abſence of all by Faith, than I ſhould do, I am perſuaded, if I poſſeſſed them. I think the LORD deals kindly with me, to make me <hi>believe</hi> for all my Mercies, before I have them: they will then be <hi>Iſaac's,</hi> Sons of Laughter. For the leſs <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> hath to Work upon, the more freely <hi>Faith</hi> caſts it ſelf on the Faithfulneſs of GOD. I find that while Faith is ſteady, nothing can diſquiet me; and when Faith totters, nothing can eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh me. If I ramble out among Means and Creatures, I am preſently loſt, and can come to no End: But if I ſtay my ſelf on GOD, and leave him to work in his own Way and Time, I am at reſt, and can lie down and ſleep in a Promiſe, tho' a Thouſand riſe up againſt me. Therefore my Way is not to caſt before Hand, but to work with GOD by the Day. Sufficient to the Day is the Work thereof. I find ſo much to do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with my Calling and my Heart, that I have no Time to puzzle my ſelf with Per-adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Futurities.</p>
            <p>As for the State of the Times, it is very gloomy and tempeſtuous: But why do the Heathen Rage? Faith lies at Anchor in the midſt of the Waves, and believes the Accompliſhment of the Promiſe, thro' all theſe Overturnings, Confuſions, and ſeeming Impoſſibilities. Upon this GOD do I live, who is our GOD for ever, and will guide us to the Death. Methinks I lie becalm'd in

his Boſom, as <hi>Luther</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, I am not much troubled; let CHRIST ſee to it. I know Prophecies are now dark, the Books are ſealed, and Men have all been deceived, &amp; every Viſion fails: yet GOD doth continue faithful: it's he that promiſeth, who will alſo do it. I believe theſe dark Times are the Womb of a bright Morning.</p>
            <p>Many Things more I might have added; but enough. O! Brother, keep cloſe to GOD; and then you need fear nothing. Maintain ſecret and intimate Acquaintance with him; and then a little of the Creature will go a great Way. Take Time for Duties in private. Croud not Religion into a Corner of the Day. There is a <hi>Dutch</hi> Proverb, <hi>No body will get by thieving, or looſe by praying.</hi> Lay up all your Good in GOD; ſo as to over-ballance the Sweetneſs and Bitterneſs of all Creatures. Spend no Time in fore-hand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for this World: they never ſucceed: God will run his Diſpenſations another Way. Self-Contrivances are the Effects of Unbelief: I can ſpeak by Experience. Would Men ſpend thoſe Hours they ware out in Plots &amp; Devices, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and leave all on him by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſome believing; they would have more Peace and Comfort. I leave you with your GOD and mine. The LORD JESUS be with your Spirit. Pray for your <hi>own Soul,</hi> pray for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and pray hard for your pour <hi>Brother.</hi>
