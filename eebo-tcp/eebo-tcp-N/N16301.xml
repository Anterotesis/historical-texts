         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>N ACCOUNT OF THE WONDERFUL <hi>OLD HERMIT'S</hi> DEATH AND BURIAL.—AGED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT YEARS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OMETIME in <hi>June,</hi> 1787, Doctor SAMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EL BRAKE, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man eminent both for phiſick and ſurgery, and a man indefatigable in the ſearch of curioſities, hearing of the wonderful account of the HERMIT, ſet out with a full determination to go and find him. The Doctor furniſhed himſelf with the beſt intelligence Capt. <hi>Buckland</hi> could poſſibly give him, and took with him two attendants well armed, and as much proviſion as was neceſſary for ſuch a journey, and being favoured with good weather, they ſoon came to the Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mountains:—Here the Doctor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a certain root never known nor heard of before, which proves a remedy for all diſeaſes.—After a great deal of trouble they found the HERMIT, but it was entirely by accident that they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at laſt to diſcover him; for the country was very wild, covered with ſhrubs as thick as poſſible, and the trees grew large beyond deſcription.—One day the Doctor diſcovered with his ſpy-glaſs, a very high hill at a conſiderable diſtance; and thought he would go and take an obſervation from the top of that hill; when he arrived there, he ſoon found the old HERMIT's path, juſt as Capt. <hi>Buckland</hi> had directed.—They followed the path down the valley, and ſoon came to the HERMIT's cave;— nothing was ſeen of the HERMIT for ſometime, and they ſuppoſed he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in his cave, and not one ſoul durſt venture into his old habitation; at length, whilſt they were liſtening at the mouth of the cave, they diſcovered the HERMIT at a little diſtance, coming with a handful of roots which he had been gathering for food;—he walked in a ſlow and grave manner, and when he ſaw them he came and embraced them;—but did not ſeem to be ſo much ſurpriſed to ſee them as he was when firſt diſcovered by Capt. <hi>Buckland,</hi> &amp;c. —He invited them in a very friendly manner into his cave, and was overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee them. The cave was very curious, which appeared to be dug out of a ſolid white flint rock: But as a particular deſcription has been given of it, it will be needleſs to ſay any thing further concerning it.—The HERMIT made particular enquiry after Capt. <hi>Buckland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fielding,</hi> and ſaid that he received great ſatisfaction from a viſit which they had made him, and added, that they were the firſt human beings that he had ſeen from the time that he firſt landed on this ſhore, which was about TWO HUNDRED YEARS. Dr. <hi>Brake</hi> tarried there ſeveral days, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> became very intimate with the HERMIT, and found ſevearl things which were not diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:—Two books in particular, which he brought with him from England, one in poetry, the other in proſe.—The HERMIT appeared to have had a good education when he was young, and diſcovered a ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of mind. His eyes were good, but his teeth were very poor, he had but little hair on his head, but his beard was very long. He could not articulate his words ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinctly, but his language was better than any ſpoken in England at the time he left it, which makes it appear evident that he was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary genius when he was young. He ſhewed Doctor <hi>Brake</hi> his books, writings, &amp;c. of which he had a large pile in one corner of his cave, ſome were done <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> barks of trees, and ſome o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> made into a kind of parchment. The Doctor obtained liberty to take a copy of the HER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIT's compoſitions. One contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principally moral ſentiments, and the following ſentences were found written in one of them:—"Young men and young women, beware of ſeducing appearances which may ſurround you and recollect what others have ſu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>red from the power of headſtrong deſire.—This world is but a wilderneſs—eager paſſions and violent deſires were not made for man.—Pitch upon that courſe of life which is beſt, and habit will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it moſt delightful."</p>
            <p>After a while the Doctor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to try the HERMIT with a little rum, and ſee what the effect would be; but it was with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uld perſuade him to drink: The Doctor ſaid that it was an excellent cordial that tended to ſtrengthen the conſtitution, and at laſt the poor innocent HERMIT was perſuaded to drink a little of that horrid bane, which hath ſent thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands out of the world.—He drank about three quarters of a gill of that poiſon liquor, and in a quarter of an hour there was a viſible alteration in his looks and conduct; and in half an hour he appeared wild and almoſt mad, and attempted to tell a kind of a love ſtory; and in about an hour he was entirely ſenſeleſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that ſhocking ſituation until 12 o'clock at night and then died.</p>
            <p>Poor old man! he lived about two hundred years in his cave, free from the buſy ſcenes of the world, and enjoying all the happineſs of a retired life! And might perhaps have lived as many more, had he not drank that horrid draught! Curſed liquor! Thouſands have fell a ſacrifice to its bewitching power.</p>
            <p>Among the HERMIT's writings was found his WILL, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been made ſoon after he was diſcovered.—He had given his cave to Capt. <hi>Buckland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as alſo all his writings: His cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cane he willed to one of Capt. <hi>Buckland's</hi> ſervants, which was all the HERMIT was poſſeſſed of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few old ſkins which had ſerved to clothe him, thoſe he gave to the other ſervant, as a reward for his kindneſs in ſinging a love ſong to him before they departed.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Brake</hi> was much affected at the ſudden death of the HERMIT, more eſpecially the manner in which he was brought to his untimely death—but the Doctor ſaid he felt no remorſe of conſcience, as he real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed that a little of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial would ſerve to raiſe his ſpirits, and make him more cheerful with his new viſitors.</p>
            <p>The next day the Doctor and his attendants employed themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout burying the old gentlemen in as decent a manner as poſſible in his cave, which was done with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and good order.—The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ordered one of his attendants to ſhave the HERMIT, and his beard is carefully preſerved as a very great curioſity, it being at leaſt twelve inches long.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> Doctor <hi>Brake</hi> mentions that this good old man made it his conſtant cuſtom to devote himſelf to prayer every day, and there is no doubt of his everlaſting happineſs.</p>
