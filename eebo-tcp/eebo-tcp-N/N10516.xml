            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS is the obſervation of a wiſe ruler, relative to civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the different ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of adminiſtration, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it is placed in good or bad hands—and it having been preſerved in the ſacred oracles, not without provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential direction, equally for the advantage
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013330_0005_0F904D8E2EFC7910"/>
of ſucceeding rulers, and other men of every claſs in ſociety; it will not be thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper by any, who have a veneration for revelation, and the inſtruction of princes, to make it the ſubject of our preſent conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration—Eſpecially as our civil rulers, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of a ſuperintending Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, have invited us into the temple this morning, to aſk counſel of God in reſpect to the great affairs of this anniverſary, and the general conduct of government.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, I ſhall take occaſion from it—to make a few general remarks on the nature and end of civil government—point out ſome of the qualifications of rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—and then apply the ſubject to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our aſſembling at this time.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I ſhall make a few remarks on the nature and end of civil government.</p>
            <p>THE people mentioned are a body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic—But whether the ſpeaker had the Jewiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ate more eſpecially in view; or, as is mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> probable, any civil ſociety or kingdom on earth, is a point we need not preciſely determine.—On either ſuppoſition, civil government is repreſented as being
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013330_0006_0F904D8FEDEA41D8"/>
already eſtabliſhed among them—rule framed, and conſented to, for the conduct of it—proper officers appointed, and veſted with authority, on this conſtitutional baſis, to make and execute ſuch laws, in future, as ſhould be found neceſſary; the public ſecurity and welfare being their grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.—This, at leaſt, appears to be the moſt juſt and rational idea of government that is founded in compact; as, I ſuppoſe, all governments, not withſtanding later u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations, originally were; and if the compact, in early ages, hath not always been expreſſed, yet it has been neceſſarily implied, and underſtood, both by gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and the governed, on their entering into ſociety.</p>
            <p>To this riſe of government, the Hebrew polity, ſo far as it related only to civil matters, is not to be conſidered as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.—For although God, a moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Governor, for wiſe reaſons, and as a diſtinguiſhed favor, condeſcended to become the political head of the Jewiſh ſtate; yet he did not think proper to exerciſe his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute right of government over them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013330_0007_0F904D906AA0FAA8"/>AND when they had fooliſhly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly determined to: give up this form of government, which was ſo wiſely calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the public advantage, and ſubſtitute another in its room; their alwiſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent Governor did not ſee fit to exert his omnipotence to prevent it: Nor did he, as he juſtly might, abandon them for their impiety and ingratitude.</p>
            <p>BUT analagous to the methods of his moral government, he went into a mode of conduct with them, adapted to their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional nature.—He treated them as free agents.—He ſolemnly proteſted againſt the change they were about to make in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and, in order diſſwade them from the raſh attempt, he ſhewed them the manner of the king which ſhould r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gn over them. But ſuch paternal rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="7 letters">
                  <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces proving ineffectual, and the people ſtill perſiſting in their deſign, He not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to purſue it, but actually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them ſpecial aid and direction in the choice of their new king—that they might have one who ſhould ſave them from their enemies—becauſe their cry had come unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013330_0008_0F904D91CBC93640"/>THIS in inſtance of the uneaſineſs of the nation of the Jews, under the moſt perfect form of government, may, perhaps, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by ſome, as an argument of the utter incapacity of a people to judge of the rectitude of adminiſtration, or of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable peeviſhneſs and diſcontent, when they are governed well. It ought, however, to be conſidered, that though God was pleaſed to put himſelf at the head of the Jewiſh polity, yet officers, or rulers taken from among men, were appointed to act under Him; and theſe might not, and in fact did not always keep the great end of their inveſtiture in view.</p>
            <p>THIS was remarkably the caſe in the inſtance before us.—The ſons of Samuel, who had been appointed judges over Iſrael, walked not in his ways, but turned aſide after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment; and the evil effects of their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, and conſequent perverſion of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice being known, and felt by the people, were the immediate occaſion of their general uneaſineſs and complaint.</p>
            <p>IN this ſituation of their affairs, the way, indeed, was open before them. It was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013330_0009_0F904D91E93FAD58"/>
their indiſpenſable duty, inſtead of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their allegiance, to have made their application to God their king, in a way of humble ardent prayer, for a redreſs of ſuch enormities; and undoubtedly, He would have heard their petition, and returned an anſwer of peace, as He had before, in times of other dangers and diſtreſſes, often done.—Their ſin and folly conſiſted in this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and not in groundleſs ſuſpicions, and unneceſſary complaints: they had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt cauſe of uneaſineſs—they were greatly injured, and oppreſſed by ſome of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive officers: Bribery, which ought to be the abhorrence of all ranks, had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the ſeats of judgment, and rendered their perſons and property inſecure, and without the protection of law. Of this they complained, and made it the ground of their requeſt for a king to judge them like all the nations—And however the Iſraelites might be guilty of great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly, as they certainly were, in deſiring, on this account, to depart from a form of government, in which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſided, and wherein they might have had all their grievances redreſſed; and-to adopt one ſimilar to that of other nations;—and how far ſoever God might grant
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013330_0010_0F904D92A74F04D0"/>
their deſire, as a puniſhment of their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, yet, as it appears from Jacob's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the tribe of Judah, not to mention other things, it was in the divine plan, or permiſſion at leaſt, that the Jews, in future time, ſhould come under the governance of earthly kings, it is no improbable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that prevailing wickedneſs, and corruption among ſome in high nation at this period, was the occaſion of God's ſo readily complying with this requeſt.</p>
            <p>THE paſſage, however, which ſtands at the head of our diſcourſe, ſuppoſes the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be judges of the good or ill effects of adminiſtration;—and as the wiſe king of Iſrael is the author, it may, perhaps, have the more weight.— "When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice."—They are ſenſible of their own happineſs in having men of uprightneſs, honor and humanity to rule over them—Men, who make a proper uſe of their authority—who ſeek the peace and welfare of the whole community, and govern according to law and equity, or the original rules of their conſtitution.— "But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn"—they are diſſatisfied and grieved, when
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013330_0011_0F904D94B7368D50"/>
contrary to reaſonable expectation, and the deſign they had in forming into civil ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it turns out, as the hiſtory of ſtates and kingdoms authoriſes us to ſay it often does, that their rulers poſſeſs oppoſite qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities—are inhuman, tyrannical and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and inſtead of guarding, violate their rights and liberties.</p>
            <p>THE great end of a ruler's exaltation is the happineſs of the people over whom he preſides; and his promoting it, the ſole ground of their ſubmiſſion to him. In this rational point of view, St. Paul, that great patron of liberty, ſpeaking of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of magiſtracy, hath thought fit to place it—"he is the miniſter of God to thee for good"—But God's miniſter he cannot be, as a ruler, however he may be in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther capacity, nor is ſubjection required, on any other principle—his making the proſperity of the ſtate the great object of his laws and other meaſures of government, is his only claim to ſubmiſſion: Nor will any one deny that his doing ſo, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently to this very thing, binds the conſcience of ſubjects, and makes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence their indiſpenſible duty. But obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the contrary ſuppoſition, is ſo far
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013330_0012_0F904D95E893EC98"/>
from being enjoined on them, that it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues meanneſs of ſpirit, and criminal ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, unleſs their circumſtances are ſuch as to make ſubjection a duty, on the foot of prudence, when it is not ſo in any other view.</p>
            <p>THE meaſures which rulers purſue, are generally good or bad, promotive of the public happineſs, or the contrary, as are their moral characters. The obſervation of our text is grounded on the truth of this aſſertion, though it ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that there have been wicked rulers, ſuch as Nero, and others of later date, who for a while, have governed well.</p>
            <p>WHETHER righteouſneſs is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted meerly to the virtue of juſtice, or conſidered as comprehenſive of the entire character of piety and religion, where it is ſaid, as in the place before us; "when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice"; it may juſtly be affirmed that men of ſuch a character are by far the fitteſt, other accompliſhments being equal, to be entruſted with the civil intereſt of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; and the people are the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feel the ſalutary effects of government, and be happy in their adminiſtration.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:013330_0013_0F904D96682D2800"/>RELIGIOUS rulers are, in every view, bleſſings to ſociety; their laws are juſt and good—their meaſures mild and humane—and their example morally engaging.</p>
            <p>VENERATION for the authority of the ſupreme ruler of the world, prevailing in their hearts, is the moſt effectual ſecurity of affection to the public, which is a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification abſolutely indiſpenſible—it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with principles of equity and humanity; it begets the deepeſt concern in all their acts of government, to anſwer the great intention both of God and man, in their inſtitution, and renders them truly benefactors to mankind.</p>
            <p>IT is, however, natural to ſuppoſe, every quality neceſſary to the conſtituting a good ruler, is comprehended in the term—righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous—the obſervation would not, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, be without exception.—The inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a people is not always ſo well ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ruler meerly of a religious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it would be by the addition of other qualities.—Religion, indeed, ought ever to be eſteemed as an indiſpenſable recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to public truſt; but other qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are alſo requiſite, and muſt be

joined, to afford reaſonable expectation of happineſs to a community, from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of authority.</p>
            <p>THERE does not appear to be a like reaſon for ſuppoſing the want of every other qualification, as well as that of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in the wicked ruler, to make him incapable of governing well.—He may have many and great endowments in other reſpects—capacity, and addreſs—but if he has no religion—if he is immoral and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, unawed by him whoſe kingdom rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over all; he is commonly unfit to have the care and direction of the public intereſt.—If there have been inſtances of good government under the conduct of rulers of vicious characters, there have been alſo too many of a contrary ſort to make it eligible or ſafe, to put Confidence in ſuch. To whatever lengths natural benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, deſire of fame, education, love of power, and the emoluments of place, may be ſuppoſed ſometimes to carry men in acting for the public advantage, It is certain, and in ſeveral, it has been ſadly verified, that theſe are feeble motives— principles, that can give no ſecurity of laſting happineſs to a people, where the ſuperior invigorating aids of religion are wanting.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013330_0015_0F904D988A73A4D8"/>THE vices of a ruler pervert the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his authority, to the diſadvantage of the community; and mark his public conduct with opprefſſion and ruin. And we are not to think it ſtrange, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fall into perplexity and mourning in conſequence.</p>
            <p>IT is the character of one who is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from among his brethren, to rule over men, drawn by God himſelf, the Almighty guardian of the Rights of mankind—that he "muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God."</p>
            <p>THE ſafety of ſociety greatly depends on the good diſpoſition of rulers, and the regard they have to equity in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of government. If they rule in the fear of God, they will make his laws their pattern in framing and executing their own.</p>
            <p>ADMINISTRATION in every mode of government, is a point of the moſt weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty importance to ſubjects.—Abſolute monarchies, or ſuch forms of government as have the powers of the ſtate lodged in the hands of a ſingle perſon, tho' generally dangerous to the Rights and Liberties of

mankind, and too often have proved ſo, to recommend them to the choice of a wiſe people, have, notwithſtanding, when the reigning Prince has ſupported the character of religion, been the ſource of great peace and ſecurity to the public.</p>
            <p>But the effects have been different— diſtreſs and miſery introduced into ſociety, under the adminiſtratiion of one whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral qualities have been of another complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
            <p>THE ſame is true as to conſequences, in thoſe governments, where the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, legiſlative and executive, is depoſited with a few.—Good or evil enſues to the community, according as the exerciſe of their authority coincides with the eternal rules and laws of reaſon and equity, or the contrary.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:013330_0017_0F904D99899B1758"/>THIS form of government, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſubjects and ſtrangers, is happily calculated for the preſervation of the Rights and Liberties of mankind.—Much, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, depends on union; and the concern of every part to purſue the great ends of government.</p>
            <p>WHEN each department centre their views in the ſame point, and act in their proper direction and character, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of providence, for the promotion of human happineſs, things go well—the Rights of the people are ſecured, and they are contented—gladneſs fills their heart, and ſparkles in their countenance!</p>
            <p>BUT there may be a failure in ſome one or more of the governing parts, in reſpect to public meaſures, and the art of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—And when this happens, though it be but in one, ſince each part is ſtrictly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſtitute the Iegiſlative body— it greatly wounds the ſtate—embarraſſes affairs — and is productive of general unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and diſcontent.— The people ſoon feel inconveniences riſing from jarrs and interference among their rulersa—and as they have an indubitable right, they take

it upon them, to judge what, and how far any thing is ſo, and where to fix the blame.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a government, rulers have their diſtinct powers aſſigned them by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are the only ſource of civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on earth, with the view of having them exerciſed for the public advantage; and in proportion as this worthy end of their inveſtiture is kept in ſight, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, the bands of ſociety are ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and its intereſts promoted: But if it be overlooked, and diſregarded, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet up as the object of their purſuit— we will ſuppoſe it ſhould be, but by one of the ſupreme branches, or, indeed, by a ſingle member of any, who happens to be of leading influence and great abilities, it will go far in making a ſchiſm in the body. —Calamity and diſtreſs may be expected, in a meaſure, to enſue— We need net paſs the limits of our own nation for ſad inſtances of this.— Whether, or how far, it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo been exemplified in any of the American colonies, whoſe governments, in general, are nearly copies of the happy Britiſh ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, by the operation of <hi>miniſterial</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional meaſures, or the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſome among ourſelves, is not for

me to determine: It is, however, certain, that the people mourn!—May God turn their mourning into joy! and comfort them, and make them rejoice from their ſorrow!—</p>
            <p>RULERS are under the moſt ſacred ties to conſult the good of ſociety. 'Tis the only grand deſign of their appointment. For the promotion of this valuable end, they are ordained of God, and cloathed with authority by men.</p>
            <p>IN a ſtate of nature men are equal, exactly on a par in regard to authority; each one is a law to himſelf, having the law of God, the ſole rule of conduct, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on his heart.</p>
            <p>No individual has any authority, or right to attempt to exerciſe any, over the reſt of the human ſpecies, however he may be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſurpaſs them in wiſdom and ſagacity. The idea of ſuperior wiſdom giving a right to rule, can anſwer the purpoſe of power but to one; for on this plan the Wiſeſt of all is Lord of all. Mental endowments, though excellent qualifications for rule, when men have entered into combination
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013330_0020_0F904D9BA7F21300"/>
and erected government, and previous to government, bring the poſſeſſors under mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation, by advice, perſwaſion and argument, to do good proportionate to the degrees of them; yet do not give any antecedent right to the exerciſe of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Civil authority is the production of combined ſociety—not born with, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to certain individuals for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the common benefit.</p>
            <p>AND as its origin is from the people, who have not only a right, but are bound in duty, for the preſervation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and liberty of the whole ſociety, to lodge it in ſuch hands as they judge beſt qualified to anſwer its intention; ſo when it is miſapplied to other purpoſes, and the public, as it always will, receives damage from the abuſe, they have the ſame origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right, grounded on the ſame funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental reaſons, and are equally bound in duty to reſume it, and transfer it to others. —Theſe are principles which will not be denied by any good and loyal ſubject of his preſent Majeſty King George, either in Great-Britain or America— The royal right to the throne abſolutely depends on the truth of them, —and the revolution, an

            <p>BUT it has been objected, that the doctrine which teaches that the people are the fource of civil authority, and that they may lawfully oppoſe thoſe rulers, who make an ill uſe of it, is likely to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the worſt of conſequences—occaſion diſturbance and revolutions in the ſtate, and render the Situation of rulers perpetually unſafe and dangerous.</p>
            <p>IF the rulers are of the latter character mentioned in our text, the ſafety of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity forbids any attempt or diſpoſition to make their ſituation eaſy; and I truſt the objection is without force in regard to thoſe of the former.—It is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to ſuppoſe a number of perſons by a free and voluntary contract, ſhould give up themſelves, their families and eſtates ſo abſolutely into the hands of any rulers, as not to make a reſerve of the right of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves from ruin—and if they ſhould, the bargain would be void, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracting the will of heaven, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful

law of ſelf-preſervation. It muſt be granted that the people have a right in ſome circumſtances, or that they have not a right in any, to oppoſe their rulers—there is no medium—A ſober and rational en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the conſeqences of each ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is the beſt method to determine on which ſide the truth lies—In doing this, I ſhall take the liberty to adopt the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and nearly the words of a writer of the firſt on Government.<note n="*" place="bottom">B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>IF it be true that no rulers can be ſafe, where the doctrine of reſiſtance is taught; it muſt be true that no nation can be ſafe where the contrary is taught: If it be true that this diſpoſeth men of turbulent ſpirits to oppoſe the beſt rulers; it is as true that the other diſpoſeth princes of evil minds, to enſlave and ruin the beſt and moſt ſubmiſſive ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: If it be true that this encourageth all public diſturbance, and all revolutions whatsoever; it is as true that the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth all tyranny, and all the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable perſecutions and oppreſſions ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:013330_0023_0F904DA1CE20C2A0"/>SUPPOSING it to be univerſally admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if rulers contrive and attempt the ruin of the publick, it is the duty of the people to conſult the common happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and oppoſe them in ſuch a deſign; it muſt follow, I think, that the grounds of publick unhappineſs would be removed, and thoſe inconveniences, which by miſtake are repreſented as the conſequence of this doctrine, prevented; for, on this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the worſt of Princes would learn to do that out of intereſt, which the beſt conſtantly do out of a good principle and true love to their ſubjects—No Prince would have any perſons about him, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and incite him to illegal or unjuſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—and if he had at any time been guilty, he would, upon the firſt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and without being forced to it, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledge his error, and ſet all things right again. And let who will ſay it, the diſpoſitions of ſubjects are not ſo bad, nor their love to public diſturbance ſo great, but that a Prince of ſuch conduct may be ſure of reigning in their affections, and of being obeyed out of love and gratitude; which is the ſecureſt foundation any throne can poſſibly be fixed on. —So far is it from being true, that the univerfal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013330_0024_0F904DA316CF89E0"/>
of the doctrine reſiſtance would be the ground of public confuſion and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, that it would prevent the beginning of evil, and take away the firſt occaſion of diſcontent.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be acknowledged, it is becauſe this doctrine, whatever is pretended, hath not been received, that any rulers have been miſled, and encouraged to take ſuch meaſures, as in the end, have proved fatal to themſelves. With reſpect therefore to rulers of evil diſpoſitions, nothing is more neceſſary than that they ſhould believe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in ſome caſes to be lawful. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not for a few diſcontented individuals who may happen to take it into their heads to reſiſt, but for the majority of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, either by themſelves or repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives. Such rulers, indeed, cannot bear the propagation of this doctrine; but the reaſon why they cannot, viz. its being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive of their pernicious deſigns, is an undeniable argument of its being the more neceſſary.</p>
            <p>As for good rulers, they are not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the propagation of it, but may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it themſelves conſiſtently with their
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013330_0025_0F904DA334EBE9A0"/>
own particular intereſt; for it is the chief intereſt of princes to reign in the affections of their ſubjects, free from all ſuſpicion and jealouſy of evil deſign. Nothing can give a nation greater ſatisfaction that their ſupreme magiſtrate ſincerely endeavors to promote their intereſt, or gain him more hearty love and eſteem, than the admiſſion of this doctrine; it looks open, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from baſe and unworthy purpoſes; but a zeal for the oppoſite doctrine, tends, in its nature, and has been ſeen, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> jealouſies in the minds of ſubjects, to take off their affections from a prince, and to lay the foundation of their withdrawing their allegiance from him.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſing it to be univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that it is the duty of the people patiently to ſubmit, and not oppoſe their rulers, tho' manifeſtly carrying forward the ruin of the public, nothing can be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow, but what is of the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to human ſociety, unleſs we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe rulers as angels of God, or rather, as God himſelf, incapable of being miſtaken themſelves, or miſled by others. This ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition leaves no reſtraint on ſuch rulers as have deſigns of their own, diſticnt from
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013330_0026_0F904DA3EE183B60"/>
the public good: Public miſery and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very will therefore enſue; and this is a ſtate of things infinitely worſe than that of public diſturbance, ſuppoſing ſuch ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to take place in conſequence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The inconvenience of the latter will ſoon be felt and rectified by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelves; but the former, on the principle of non-reſiſtance, is abſolutely without a remedy.</p>
            <p>WHEN people feel the influence and bleſſing of a good adminiſtration, they are not, in general, diſpoſed to complain and find fault with their rulers; it is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their own intereſt, and that of their families to do ſo. If we will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on a point of ſuch delicacy by a ruler himſelf, who, as abſolute as he was, had wiſdom and public virtue to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conformable to the nature and truth of things, we ſhall ſee that it is under the influence of an evil adminiſtration the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are diſcontented and mourn; and that under the influence of a good, one they rejoice.</p>
            <p>ALL lawful rulers are the ſervants of the public, exalted above their brethren not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013330_0027_0F904DA54611B218"/>
for their own ſakes, but the benefit of the people; and ſubmiſſion is yielded, not on the account of their perſons conſidered excluſively of the authority they are cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, but of thoſe laws, which in the exerciſe of this authority are made by them, conformably to the laws of nature and equity.</p>
            <p>THIS poſition is ſo far from being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to good rulers, or thought to be derogatory of their dignity, that they eſteem it as implying the higheſt human character, and an official reſemblance of the great Saviour of mankind, who came not to be miniſtered unto, but to miniſter; and accordingly went about doing good.</p>
            <p>THE aſſertion that rulers are conſtituted by the people for the common happineſs, is no denial of St. Paul's doctrine, who, ſpeaking of magiſtracy, hath ſaid—There is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God:—any more than it is a denial of the bleſſings of huſbandry, merchandize, and the mechanic arts, or, indeed any thing beneficial to ſociety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, to ſay, that men have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them—They are all from God from
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013330_0028_0F904DA585FE2A18"/>
whom cometh down every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift; and much in the ſame ſenſe, as it is his will that men ſhould be employed in them for their own advantage: But men by their reaſon, which is alſo the gift of God, are the immediate diſcoverers of their utility. It is, however, neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that as civil government holds a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed place among the gifts of God; and, conſidering the human make, the bleſſings of it are productive of a greater aggregate of happineſs, both in a natural and moral view, than moſt others: Much has been ſaid in revelation about it—the divine approbation manifeſted—and the qualification of rulers exactly ſtated.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH government is not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly inſtituted by God, it is, nevertheleſs, from him; as, by the human conſtitution, and the circumſtances men are placed in, He has ſignified it to be his will, that, as a ſecurity of property and liberty, and as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to greater improvements in virtue and happineſs than could be attained in a ſtate of nature, there ſhould be government among them. But it is from man, as for the ſame end—the procuring a greater good to each individual, on the whole, than could
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013330_0029_0F904DA63864EF78"/>
be had without it; they have, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to their make and circumſtances, and the dictates of reaſon, voluntarily inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And thus government is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance both of God and man. And ſo the new-teſtament writers conſider it, and ſpeak of its deſign as being the ſame in both, viz. The public happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS is a ſtriking indication to rulers, not only as to their aims in accepting any public office in a community, but as to the obligations they are under to diſcharge the duties of it with fidelity. They are the truſtees of God, veſted with authority by him, in the benevolent deſigns of his providence, to be employed in guarding and defending the juſt Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mankind; and as far as they can, advancing the common welfare.</p>
            <p>AND as they are reſponſible to him who is no reſpecter of perſons; they are not to expect their public conduct is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from his moſt ſtrict and impartial ſcrutiny.</p>
            <p>THEY are alſo the truſtees of ſociety, as their authority, under God, is derived
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013330_0030_0F904DA6ED24F220"/>
from the people, delegated to them with deſign it ſhould be exerciſed for, and to no other purpoſe than, the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; and this renders them juſtly accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their human conſtituents, whoſe tribunal, however ſome have affected to deſpiſe it, is full of dign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> and majeſty— Kings and emperors have trembled before it!</p>
            <p>WHILE neerly to poſſeſs places of dignity and eminence is ſufficiently grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to ſome minds, the chief joy of rulers, mindful of the importance of their ſtation, ariſes from a conſciouſneſs of ſuch behaviour, in their public capacity, as will be approved of God, and accepted of men. For this great and valuable purpoſe, they will be careful to deſerve the character firſt mentioned in the text —be juſt and impartial in every part of adminiſtration; and with their integrity, endeavour to join thoſe other accompliſhments which are requiſite to the honorable diſcharge of their reſpective truſts.</p>
            <p>BUT this brings us in the ſecond place to point out ſome of the qualifications of rulers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:013330_0031_0F904DA7C0BDD990"/>AND ſuperior knowledge may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as one, that greatly exalts and adorns their character.</p>
            <p>THEY ſhould, therefore, be ambitious to become poſſeſſed of it, that they may be at no loſs how to conduct, or which way to turn themſelves in any difficult and embarraſſed ſtate of affairs; but may know what the people ought to do, and be able and ready to lead and adviſe them in the more bolſterous and alarming, as well as in calm and temperate ſeaſons.</p>
            <p>DISTINGUISHED abilities and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, tho' happily placed in rulers, are not indeed ſo abſolutely neceſſary, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to underſtand the conſtitution, or the general rules of any particular mode of government a people have choſen to put themſelves under, as for other important matters in adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>ALL fundamental laws and rules of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are, in their nature and deſign, and ever ought to be, plain and intelligible —ſuch as common capacities are able to comprehend, and determine when, and how far they are, at any time, departed

Were not this the caſe, people's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into ſociety, and erecting government, could not be juſtified on the principle of reaſon, or prudence; as government inſtead of protecting them in the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet enjoyment of Liberty and property, might be made an engine of their deſtruction, and put it in the power of rulers of evil diſpoſitions, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext of purſuing conſtitutional meaſure to introduce general miſery and ſlavery among them.</p>
            <p>THE knowledge which the people have of the conſtitution, or original fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal laws of government, whereof the plain law of ſelf-preſervation is neceſſarily the chief, in all forms of government, is the only adequate check on ſuch ruinous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>THE people being judges of their own conſtitution of government, is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from which the Britiſh nation acted, and on the truth of which they are to be juſtified, when they determined, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was invaded by their ſovereign, and that he was carrying on deſigns, which if purſued, muſt iſſue in the deſtruction of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:013330_0033_0F904DA92917CE50"/>BUT if they were no judges of ſuch matters, if they meddled with that which did not belong to them—the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and ſucceſſion of an illuſtrious houſe, may have taken place without right, againſt law and reaſon, being founded in miſconception and error; and the heirs of an abjured popiſh prince, ſtill remain the only juſt, and lawful claimants to the Britiſh throne; a doctrine, which, I am ſure, no American, and I hope, but few in great Britain, will ever admit. If the foundations be deſtroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
            <p>BUT high degrees of knowledge are requiſite in rulers for other great and weighty purpoſes in government. If they would act with dignity and advantage in their public capacity, they ſhould be well acquainted with human nature, and the natural rights of mankind; which are the ſame under every form of government: They ſhould alſo be acquainted with the general rules of equity and reaſon, and the right application of them, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances vary; with the laws of nations, their ſtrength, manners, and views; but eſpecially with the genius, temper, cuſtoms and religion of the people they are called
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013330_0034_0F904DA9ECC87658"/>to govern: This will enable them to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate public meaſures to public ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and to frame ſuch laws and annex ſuch ſanctions, from time to time, as may be beſt calculated to encourage piety and virtue, induſtry and frugality, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent immorality and vice, and every ſpecies of oppreſſion and miſery— They ſhould moreover know, in what inſtances na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural equity and a regard to the good of the whole require former laws to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, or varied—new ones enacted, and other penalties applied, and in what way government may be the moſt effectually, honorably and eaſily ſupported.</p>
            <p>LEGISLATORS, whom I have chiefly had in view, ſhould know how to give force, and operation to their laws, that every member of the community may feel their effects, and be treated in a juſt and reaſonable manner; and as far as may be, according to his perſonal circumſtances and merits. This, indeed, is to be done by means of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive part, but the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power is ſtrictly no other than the legiſlative carried forward, and of courſe, controulable by it.— Theſe, and others that might be adduced, are points requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013330_0035_0F904DAAB6DDE9E8"/>
capacity and knowledge in rulers: And among other means for the attaining them, it is their indiſpenſible duty, in imitation of a wiſe king, to pray for an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, that in all their acts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may diſcern between good and bad, and lead the people in the paths of righteouſneſs and peace.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER qualification of rulers, is a public ſpirit, and a compaſſionate regard to mankind.</p>
            <p>WHEN we take into consideration the great deſign of civil government, no one can be thought a proper perſon to rule over men, who has not a prevailing regard to their intereſt, and a fixed determination to purſue it.</p>
            <p>THIS, certainly is the great object which magistrates, as ſuch, are under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to keep in their eye —as men, they have like other men, private intereſt, and private views, and may as lawfully purſue them; but in their public capacity, they can, of right, have no other end, than the public advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:013330_0036_0F904DAB86A52430"/>AND if they make uſe of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the influence of their rank for any different purpoſes—if it be their chief aim to aggrandize themſelves, their poſterity or friends by means thereof; if the ſelfiſh paſſions predominate and guide and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their public conduct; if they are ſlaves to covetouſneſs, ambition or effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; if, led by flattering proſpects, they are devoted to the meer will, and arbitrary mandates of others greater and higher than themſelves; if there be any thing they are more ſolicitous to obtain or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote than the good of the ſociety they are connected with, and are bound to ſerve, —they ignominiouſly proſtitute their truſt, and baſely counteract the main deſign of their inſtitution.</p>
            <p>BUT rulers of a patriotic ſpirit are actuated by better and more noble prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they have a ſincere regard to the public; their time and abilities are cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employed in the promotion of its intereſt; this they ſet up as the object of their meaſures, and eſteem it as their own good, they ſeck the proſperity of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the peace thereof they ſhall have peace — The honors and emoluments
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013330_0037_0F904DAC843A7948"/>
of their ſtation, though juſtly due and freely rendered by a ſenſible, obliged and grateful people, are but inferior motives with them—happy ſuch rulers in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of the multitude, happy in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of their own minds!</p>
            <p>BUT that which compleats the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of rulers and adds luſtre to their other accomplishments, is religion.</p>
            <p>THIS is the beſt foundation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the people; if they fear God, it may be expected they will regard man. Vice narrows the mind and bars the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of a public ſpirit; but religion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and ſtrengthens the former, and gives free courſe to the operations of the latter.</p>
            <p>BY religion I would be underſtood to intend more than a bare belief of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine exiſtence and perfections— The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then world by a proper uſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may attain to this, becauſe that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them.</p>
            <p>BUT what I intend by religion is, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth as it is in jeſus, and a temper and conduct conformable to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:013330_0038_0F904DACF4280D00"/>IT is the wiſdom of chriſtian ſtates, to have chriſtian magiſtrates, and as far as may be, ſuch as have imbibed the ſpirit of the goſpel, and are actuated in their high ſtation, by the principles it inſpires. If it be allowed, as to be ſure it ought, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of deiſtick principles, may have a regard to the civil intereſt of mankind, and do many worthy deeds for ſociety; it muſt alſo be allowed that they are not ſo likely, as thoſe of chriſtian principles, to be nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing fathers to the church of Chriſt, which, agreeable to ancient prophecy, magiſtrates, under the preſent diſpenſation of the divine grace, are obliged to be.</p>
            <p>NOR will they be ſo much concerned to learn from the ſacred oracles, for the guidance of public meaſures, what is the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</p>
            <p>WHEN a people have rulers ſet over them, of a religious character on the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel plan—who own and ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt as their Lord and Saviour, who are ſanctified by the divine ſpirit and grace, and, in a good meaſure, purified from thoſe corrupt principles which too often work

in the human heart, they have reaſon to expect the preſence and bleſſing of God will be with them, and that things will go well in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>AND on reflection, we cannot forbear the acclamation of the pſalmiſt—happy is that people, that is in ſuch a caſe!—yea, happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord!</p>
            <p>THE religion of rulers is a guide to their other accompliſhments—it has a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary active influence into all their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of government, and leads them to the nobleſt exertions for the advancement of the common weal.</p>
            <p>THE minds of the governed are ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with their conduct, rejoice in their adminiſtration, and reſt aſſured that no harm will ever happen to them, by their means, unleſs it be by miſtake, to which all men are liable. By the bleſſing of the upright the city is exalted, but it is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>

            <p>BUT I could not obtain forgiveneſs of my own mind nor of the public, if I ſhould forbear explicitly to affirm, that the two honorable branches of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we before have had, which derived their political exiſtence more immediately from the people, have been in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct and meaſures, but eſpecially in the late months and years of our diſtreſs and controverſy, accepted of the multitude of their brethren.</p>
            <p>IT is our ardent wiſh and confidence, the ſame vigilance, circumſpection and public ſpirit, may diſtinguiſh the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the two houses of aſſembly for the current year —that which is now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with marks or approbation and honor, from their conſtituents, and the other,

which according to royal charter, is this day to be choſen.</p>
            <p>THIS anniverſary, which is ſo auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the civil liberties of this province, fills every honeſt heart with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I truſt with the ſincereſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to almighty God, the great patron of liberty, and benefactor of the world.</p>
            <p>THE choice of perſons from among ourſelves, to ſit at council board, both in a legiſlative capacity, and as his majeſty's council to give their advice to his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative here, on all matters of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as circumſtances may require, we eſteem a great ſecurity of our natural rights; and one of our moſt invaluable privileges—a privilege, which we never have forfeited, and we are reſolved we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will, or voluntarily reſign it into the hands of any of our fellowmen—though it muſt be acknowledged, I ſpeak it with ſhame and bluſhing, that for the many cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins, and enormities committed in our land, it would be righteous in the divine government, if we were deprived of this and all our mercies.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:013330_0042_0F904DB16BCE3008"/>THE appointment of one to fill the chair, is, by royal charter, reſerved to the crown. Of this we have not been much diſpoſed to complain; for though we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member our firſt charter with affection, and the arbitrary deſpotic manner of its diſſolution with abhorrence, yet we have been uſed to put great confidence in the paternal goodneſs of our gracious ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns; and to expect ſuch governors to be appointed over us, as would ſeek the peace and welfare of this people; and however it might be thought poſſible for them, in any future time to receive ſuch orders from the higher ſervants of the crown, as would be inconſiſtent with our rights and privileges, we have ſuppoſed, notwithſtanding they would conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as being under prior obligations to the king of kings, and obey God, rather than men.</p>
            <p>WE have been uſed to think they would eſteem the ſervice of his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty within this province, and the good of the province, as being the ſame, and that it is as impoſſible for his majeſty to have any good in America, ſeparate from the good of his American ſubjects, as it is to have any good in Great-Britain ſeparate from the good of his Britiſh ſubjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:013330_0043_0F904DB234636468"/>THE end of government, certainly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires men of ſuch diſpoſitions and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to rule over this people. Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive itſelf is not a power to do any thing it pleaſes, but a power to do ſome things for the good of the community, in ſuch caſes as promulgated laws are not able to provide for it.</p>
            <p>ON theſe principles it is reaſonable to expect that his Excellency who is lately appointed to the government of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and of whoſe candor and moderation we have heard with pleaſure, will enter on the duties of his high ſtation, with honor to himſelf and advantage to the publick, and make the happineſs of this people the great object of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the ſureſt way to conciliate their affections, and eſtabliſh his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. We wiſh his Excellency much of the divine preſence and guidance—the ſupports of religion—and the plaudit of his final Judge.</p>
            <p>THE honorable Gentlemen, who are, this day, to he concerned in the exerciſe of an important charter privilege, the election of his Majeſty's Council, will not,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013330_0044_0F904DB56A808610"/>
'tis preſumed, be unmindful of the very intereſting nature of this publick tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor how far its influence may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>MUCH lies at ſtake, honored Fathers—much depends, and will probably turn on the choice you make of Councellors, not to this province only, but to the reſt of the colonies. In the preſent ſcenes of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and perplexity, when the conteſt in regard to the rights of the coloniſts, riſes high, every colony is deeply intereſted in the public conduct of every other.</p>
            <p>THE happy union and ſimilarity of ſentiment and meaſures which take place thro' the continent in regard to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſufferings, and which have added weight to the American cauſe, muſt be cheriſhed by every prudent and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal method, and will, we truſt, meet with your countenance and cultivation.</p>
            <p>THE acknowledged weight of the Council Board, in the government of this province, and its influence into the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of our churches, from its connection with, and inſpection over a very reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013330_0045_0F904DB699654C08"/>
ſeminary of learning, are not your only motives. But the united voice of America, with the ſolemnity of thunder and with accents piercing as the lightning, awakes your attention, and demands fidelity.</p>
            <p>THE ancient advice dictated to Moſes, by the prieſt of Midian, and approved of God, is admirably calculated, civil Fathers, for your direction on this occaſion—Tis a ſignificant compendium of the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the perſons whom you ought to favor with your ſuffrages.—Thou ſhalt provide out of all the people, able men—ſuch as fear God, men of truth, and hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them.</p>
            <p>THE preſent ſituation of our public affairs requires good degrees of knowledge, firmneſs of ſpirit, patriotism, and the fear of God, in thoſe who ſtand at helm and guide the ſtate—they ſhould be men able to investigate the ſource of our evils, point out adequate remedies, and that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and public ſpirit to apply them.</p>
            <p>OUR danger is not viſionary, but real—Our contention is not about trifles, but
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013330_0046_0F904DB6B68CFB28"/>
about liberty and property; and not ours only, but thoſe of poſterity, to the lateſt generations. And every lover of mankind will allow that theſe are important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, too ineſtimably precious and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyments to be treated with neglect, and tamely ſurrendered:—For however ſome few, I ſpeak it with regret and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, even from among ourſelves, appear ſufficiently diſpoſed to ridicule the rights of America, and the liberties of ſubjects; 'tis plain St. Paul, who was a good judge, had a very different ſenſe of them—"He was on all occaſions for ſtanding faſt, not only in the liberties with which Chriſt had made him free, from the Jewiſh law of ceremonies, but alſo in that liberty, with which the laws of nature, and the Roman ſtate, had made him free from oppreſſion and tyranny."</p>
            <p>IF I am miſtaken in ſuppoſing plans are formed, and excuting, ſubverſive of our natural, and charter rights, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and incompatible with every idea of liberty, all America is miſtaken with me.</p>
            <p>OUR continued complaints—Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, humble, but fruitleſs, unregarded
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013330_0047_0F904DB76FC63598"/>
petitions and remonſtrances—and if I may be allowed the ſacred alluſion, our groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which cannot be uttered, are at once indications of our ſufferings, and the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe we have of them.</p>
            <p>WE think we are injured—We believe we are denied ſome of thoſe privileges, enjoyed by our fellow ſubjects in <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain,</hi> which have not only been inſured to us by Royal Charter, but which we have a natural independent right to.</p>
            <p>AND it bears the harder on our ſpirits, when we recollect the deep inwrought affection we have always had for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate—our well known loyalty to our Sovereign, and our unremitting attachment to his illuſtrious houſe, as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable toils, hardſhips and dangers which our Fathers endured, unaſſiſted, but by Heaven, in planting this American wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and turning it into a fruitful field!</p>
            <p>BUT in ſuch circumſtances, we place great confidence in the wiſdom and patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of our civil rulers—Our eyes are fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, and under the ſmiles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven we expect a redreſs of our grievances
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013330_0048_0F904DB838626AF0"/>
by their inſtrumentality. Or, at leaſt, that they will not be wanting, in any thing in their power, conſiſtent with the duties of their ſtation, to effect it.</p>
            <p>WE ſincerely hope, and truſt, the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this day will turn on men, who ſhall be diſpoſed in their proper depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reſtore and eſtabliſh our rights—Men acquainted with the ſeveral powers veſted in the honorable board, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, with perſevering ſpirit, to aſſert and uphold them—Men, in every view, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the conſtitution of government in this province, and reſolved to maintain it, undiminiſhed, and entire.</p>
            <p>YOU will pleaſe to remember, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that in this weighty affair, you do not act meerly for yourſelves—you act for the whole community—every member has an intereſt in the tranſaction.</p>
            <p>BUT above all, ſuffer me to remind you, that you act for God, and under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, by whoſe providence, this truſt is committed to you—and that you muſt one day give an account to Him whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, of the motives of your conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:013330_0049_0F904DB9078FDA20"/>WHEN the buſineſs of the day is finiſhed;—the legiſlative body will enquire into the interior ſtate of the province, and enter upon public concerns relative to the well ordering, and directing its affairs.</p>
            <p>BUT whether circumſtances require any new laws to be enacted, or new regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, in any reſpect, made, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly refer to the ſuperior wiſdom and conduct of the guardians of our common intereſt—I would, however, take the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rty to ſay, that the public good, the peace, and proſperity of this province, ought ever to lie near your hearts, and be kept in view, as the pole ſtar, by which all your debates, and governmental acts, are to be directed.</p>
            <p>AND if you can do any thing more effectual, than has yet been done; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the too general prevalence of vice, and immorality, and promote the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and practice of religion and godlineſs among us, you will perform great good ſervice for the public—you will, hereby, give us the higheſt reaſon to hope, and believe, that our infinitely good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, the tenor of whoſe providence, hath always, from the beginning, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably

            <p>BUT if you can do no more for ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a purpoſe; let us, notwithstanding, for your own ſakes, and for ours, be aſſured of the benefit of your example.</p>
            <p>WE are eaſily led by the example of our ſuperiors, whom we reſpect and revere, and when it is turned on the ſide of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and virtue, it cannot fail of happy influence into the religion of our minds, and the morality of our lives.</p>
            <p>DID men of exalted ſtations and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, conſider how much it is in their power to reform or corrupt the age, —the lower ranks and claſſes of mankind, we might expect a conduct from them, that would teach us to connect the ideas of greatneſs and religion, —at leaſt, more nearly than we too generally have done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:013330_0051_0F904DBB0A4610E0"/>WE are therefore, willing to think, us we ſincerely wiſh, that from a proper zeal for the divine glory, and a generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their fellow men, our civil fathers will go before us in the uniform practice of pure religion, and undefiled, before God and the Father.</p>
            <p>UNDER the adminiſtration of rulers of ſuch a character, we ſhall not rejoice meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a civil view, but in the proſperity of our ſouls ſhall we be glad, and rejoice before God, exceedingly.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I cloſe, I may not omit put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole body of this people in mind to be ſubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>THIS is the direction given to Titus by the ſame Apoſtle, who in another Epiſtle has limited the obedience of ſubjects, to ſuch rulers as anſwer the end of their appointment; the like limitation is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be underſtood here—To ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates as rule well, who are a terror, not to good works, but to the evil, which is the reaſon St. Paul has aſſigned why ſubjects are obliged, in point of conſcience, to ſubmit to them—to ſuch magiſtrates, I ſay, the moſt

chearful obedience is due from the people, as being the greateſt bleſſings ſociety can enjoy—and to withhold obedience from ſuch, is the greateſt of crimes, as it directly tends to public confuſion and ruin.</p>
            <p>As a people we have ever been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably tender both of our civil and religious liberties; and 'tis hoped, the fervor of our regard for them, will not cool, till the ſun ſhall be darkened, and the moon ſhall not give her light.</p>
            <p>BUT juſtice to ourſelves requires us to ſay that we have been as remarkable for our ſteady, uniform ſubmiſſion to thoſe who have had the rule over us.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be affirmed that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of general complaint and uneaſineſs has been known among us from the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of our Fathers in America, but when our liberties have been evidently ſtruck at, I believe, impartial hiſtory would ſupport the ſentiment.</p>
            <p>IF we have complained, we have had too manifeſt occaſion for it; and all writers on government but thoſe of a rank, arbitrary, popiſh complexion, allow of complaints, and remonſtrances, and even
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013330_0053_0F904DBBEE8C2B10"/>
oppoſition to meaſures, in free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the people know to be wrong; and indeed were not this the caſe, there would ſoon be no ſuch governments on earth.</p>
            <p>THE people in this province, and in the other colonies, love and revere civil government—they love peace and order—but they are not willing to part with any of thoſe rights and privileges, for which they have, in many reſpects, paid very dear.</p>
            <p>THE ſoil we tread on is our own, the heritage of our Fathers, who purchaſed it by fair bargain of the natives, unleſs I muſt except a part, which they afterwards, in their own juſt defence, obtained by conqueſt—We have therefore an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive right to it.</p>
            <p>FOR, how far ſoever diſcovery may operate, in acquiring a right in wild unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited countries; every one muſt allow it could acquire none in this inhabited, as it was, who is not willing to grant, that the natives of America would have acquired as good a right to Great Britain or any part of Europe, if their navigation had been able, at the same time, to have waſted them in ſight of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:013330_0054_0F904DBCAABBD1C0"/>BUT while we are diſpoſed to affert our rights, and hold our liberties ſacred, let us not decline from our former temper, and deſpiſe government; but may we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ready to eſteem and ſupport it, in its trueſt dignity and majeſty. Let us reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and honor our civil rulers, and as much as poſſible lighten their burdens by a chearful obedience to their laws, without which the great end of government, this public ſafety and happineſs, cannot be promoted.</p>
            <p>UNDER the preſſing, growing weight of our public troubles and difficulties, our hearts, tho' perplexed, have not fainted—We wait for the ſalvation of God—It is better to truſt in the Lord than to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in princes—Let us go on to truſt in him, 'till God himſelf ſhall riſe to ſave us—Let us not divide and crumble into parties, on little irregularities, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aggravated by ſome, are, in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, almoſt unavoidable. But may we have that wiſdom which is profitable to direct, and diſtinguiſh between what has, and what has not, a tendency to `re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move our burdens, and prolong our juſt rights' and liberties; eſpecially, let us be on our guard against a ſpirit of licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013330_0055_0F904DBDC7495370"/>
which is the reproach of true liberty, and has been the overthrow of free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</p>
            <p>AND by whatever titles and characters we may be diſtinguiſhed, in the limited governments of this world, let us bear it on our hearts, that we are all ſubjects of the divine, univerſal government, which is adminiſtered in righteouſneſs; and muſt ſhorly render an account of our conduct under it to God, the judge of all.</p>
            <p>IF this important consideration was duly impreſſed on the minds of all ranks and orders of men, it would lead us to acquire and cultivate the ſpirit of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is a ſpirit of love and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and beget a conduct, which while it ripens us thro' grace for immortality and glory, would be greatly promotive of the preſent benefit of human ſociety.—</p>
            <p>AND when, by the efficacious influence of the bleſſed ſpirit our rational and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal part is eſtabliſhed in its juſt supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy—when appetites and paſſions are ſubject to its authority, and, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires regular, modeſt &amp; juſt—Then ſhall our righteouſneſs go forth as brightneſs and our ſalvation as a lamp that burneth.</p>
