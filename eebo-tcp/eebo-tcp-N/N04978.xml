            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I HAVE expreſſed the Deſign of the following Treatiſe in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle—My Motive to this Deſign was an Apprehenſion of Duty—I thought the Scheme of the Sermon was to prove That agreeable to the Doctrines of Chriſt, which is abſolutely forbid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and that to ſupport that Scheme, it perverted the true Meaning of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Paſſages of the holy Scriptures; which, I hope, will be eſteemed a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Apology for my Attempt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it—I ſhould have been very well pleaſed if this Concern had fallen upon ſome Perſon endued with greater Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and more Experience in Religion. But however weak the Performance may be, my Intention is honeſt and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:006239_0003_1027FFF9D054C940"/>ſincere—As I had ſeen ſeveral Treatiſes upon the ſame Subject, I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Liberty to make uſe of ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Expreſſions therein, when they ſuited my Purpoſe—I dedicate it to the Service of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, recommend the ſerious Peruſal of it to the Impartial and Unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and heartily wiſh Salvation and Peace unto all Mankind.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Deſign of the Goſpel Diſpenſation, was to redeem Man from the deplorable Corruption which was the Conſequence of his Fall, and to reſtore him into the State of Purity and Peace, wherein he was created; by informing his Judgment, rectifying his Will, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Paſſions, and making him a <hi>New-Creature:</hi> In Purſuance of, and to compleat this Deſign, it pleaſed God, after the Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion of our Bleſſed Saviour, to pour forth the Holy Spirit upon the primitive Apoſtles and Believers. This Spirit was to continue with all true Believers, thro' ſucceſſive Generations, agreeable to many Prophecies, particularly that of the Evangelical Prophet, ſpeaking of the Coming of the Redeemer to <hi>Zion—As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my Words, which I have put in thy Mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed's Seed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever, Iſa.</hi> lix. 21. And our Saviour confirms this, <hi>Lo I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World, Mat.</hi> xxviii. 20.</p>
            <p>So long as the primitive Believers were faithful to the Appearance of this divine Spirit, and obeyed the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006239_0005_10280000E58F2C60"/>and Directions thereof, Chriſtianity remained in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but when this was forſaken, the Apoſtacy began, which ſoon ſpread, and became general; then Form was ſet up inſtead of Power, and Men being vain in their Imaginations, their fooliſh Hearts became darken'd, ſo that they knew not the Nature nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Chriſt's Kingdom, but under a Pretence of being his Miniſters, and of having the Right of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining his Laws, they got Power into their Hands, and enforced Obedience: Thus the Simplicity of the Goſpel being forſook for worldly Pomp and Power, inſtead of the peaceable, loving, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Temper, which it enjoined, it was miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to allow of Violence and Oppreſſion. In this Apoſtacy from the Life and Spirit of Chriſt, many Evils which the primitive Chriſtians were redeemed from, came to be reckoned neceſſary and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p>But when it pleaſed Almighty God to viſit our primitive Friends and Elders, with the Diſcovery of his divine Light and Truth in their Souls, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that notwithſtanding there had been among Proteſtants a great Reformation from the black and groſs Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet the Purity and Perfection of the Goſpel Diſpenſation, required a much further and more eminent Change: And in Obedience to this Light, they proclaimed Deliverance from all Sin, as a State attainable, thro' Faith in Chriſt, and true Obedience to his Spirit, <hi>A Meaſure or Manifeſtation whereof,</hi> was <hi>given to every Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 7. And that this Spirit was an infallible Teacher; that by it alone Men could come to a right Underſtanding of the Scriptures; that it led into all Truth, redeemed from all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, gave Victory over the fallen Paſſions, and renewed the Image of God in the Soul of Man. This was the primary and chief Article that they
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006239_0006_10280003F6B0FA00"/>were firſt convinced of themſelves, and found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to publiſh to others.</p>
            <p>By this Spirit they were convinced of the Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many Things, which other Profeſſors of Chriſtianity were in the Practice of, and thought allowable, <hi>viz.</hi> War, Perſecution for different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in Religion, a Man-made and Hireling Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe they thought incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Purity and Perfection of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion—And that War can be now proved to be ſo, by fair and candid Interpretations of the Scriptures, will I hope appear in the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of a late Sermon on that Subject.</p>
            <p>But to obviate Objections, let me here obſerve, that our Friends have never (that I know of) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſuch in the Uſe of Carnal Weapons, who are not yet convinced that the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel forbids them: But they did, and now do call all Men to believe in the inward and ſpiritual Appearance of Chriſt in the Soul, who will teach all that ſo believe, and hearken to him, to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to forſake a Dependance upon human Means, and truſt in God alone; and they eſteem it their Duty to teſtify that ſuch are not in Unity with them, who, making Profeſſion of this inward Principle, manifeſt a Conduct contrary to it.</p>
            <p>The Sermon which I am about to conſider, is upon <hi>Exodus</hi> xv. 3. <hi>The Lord is a Man of War</hi>— This was Part of a Song of Praiſes for a miraculous Deliverance, wrought by the immediate Hand of God, without any human Contrivance or Force— The Command to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when cloſely purſued by their Enemies, was, <hi>Fear ye not, ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of the Lord—The Lord ſhall fight for you, and ye ſhall hold your Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the Sermon endeavours, from his Text, and ſome other Appellations given to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006239_0007_1028000582CA37D8"/>in the Old Teſtament, <hi>viz. The Lord of Hoſts, The God of the Armies of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. to prove that War was thence agreeable to him.

                  <hi>The Lord doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</hi> Lam. iii. 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Though ſome Wars under that Diſpenſation were commanded of God, and therefore thoſe Appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were then ſuitable and proper, yet I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they diſcover any Approbation of War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and purſued at the meer Pleaſure and Will of Men—I rather take them to denote the Greatneſs of his Power and Superiority, and therefore the Juſtneſs and Propriety of an entire Dependance upon him—They convey an Idea of Sufficiency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the Enterprizes of the moſt numerous Hoſts, or to bleſs with Succeſs the Endeavours of a few at his Command. The Inſtances of his manifeſting this Almighty Power, in both theſe Reſpects, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent—The Caſe of <hi>Gideon, Judges</hi> vii. when he prepared to go againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> is a very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable One: He had an Army of 32,000 Men, but the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>The People that are with thee, are too many for me, to give the Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites into their Hand, leſt Iſrael vaunt themſelves againſt me, ſaying, Mine own Hand hath ſaved me.</hi> Wherefore he at the Command of God, reduced his Army to 300—And the Lord directed him in what Manner to proceed, and as he obeyed, the mighty Hoſt of the <hi>Midianites</hi> was put to flight—Here (though the Uſe of outward Means was permitted) a ſtrong and entire Dependance upon God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, even in that Day: Can ſuch a Dependance be leſs neceſſary in a Day of Goſpel Light?</p>
            <p>Many Parts of the Old Teſtament have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by religious Writers, as Types and Figures of future Times: Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> is in ſome Inſtances a Type of Chriſt; and the Building of the outward
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006239_0008_1028000860957DE0"/>Temple, a lively Figure of the Gathering of the Church in the latter Days—<hi>David</hi> had been a Man of War, at the Direction of God: He had it in his Heart to build an Houſe to the Name of the Lord, but he was not permitted to execute that Deſign— The Reader is deſired to remark the Reaſon in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Words, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxii. 7, 8, 9. <hi>And David ſaid to Solomon, My Son, as for me, it was in my Mind to build an Houſe unto the Name of the Lord my God; but the Word of the Lord came to me, ſaying, Thou haſt ſhed Plood abundantly, and haſt made great Wars: Thou ſhalt not build an Houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Name, becauſe thou haſt ſhed much Blood upon the Earth in my Sight; behold a Son ſhall be born to thee, who ſhall be a Man of Reſt, and I will give him Reſt from all his Enemies round about, for his Name ſhall be Solomon, and I will give Peace and Quietneſs unto Iſrael in his Days.</hi> If a Ceſſation from War was neceſſary for the Building that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Temple, how much more ſo is it, for the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of all Nations to be Members of the Church of Chriſt? <hi>The Glory of this latter Houſe ſhall be greater than of the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts: And in this Place will I give Peace, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Hag.</hi> ii. 9.

The "Only Mean" here, is War, and whether the Expreſſion ſuits with the Belief of an Over-ruling, Omnipreſent Providence, without whoſe Permiſſion no Evil can happen, and who alone hath the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of every Thing, I would have a little to be thought upon.—It will appear from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtory, that there were Times when, to human Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, there was no Way for thoſe valuable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to be preſerved but by War, and yet they were delivered without the Uſe of this Mean.—The Caſe of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the <hi>Red Sea</hi> when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> purſued them, <hi>Exodus</hi> xiv.—That of the coming up of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> xviii. 19.—That of ſeveral Nations joining together againſt <hi>Judah</hi> in the Time of <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xx. are Proofs of this. And there are ſeveral Inſtances, that when the Mean of War hath been uſed, 'till there was no Appearance to the natural Eye of Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Almighty hath provided a Deliverance without the Help of human Means. What an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumſtance did he deliver <hi>Samaria</hi> from, when beſieged by the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> vi. 7. when the Famine among the Beſieged was ſo great, that Aſſes Heads, and Doves Dung, ſold for a very great Price, and Women agreed to eat their own Children; in the midſt of this ſore Diſtreſs—<hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha ſaid, Hear ye the Word of the Lord, Thus ſaith the Lord, To-morrow about this Time, ſhall a Meaſure of Fine Flour be ſold for a Shekel, and two Meaſures of Barley for a Shekel, in the Gate of Samaria</hi>—This Prediction doubtleſs appeared, to natural Reaſon, very unlikely to come to paſs ſo ſoon, and yet the Almighty cauſed it to be fulfilled—And the Lord (upon whoſe Hand the King leaned) who diſbelieved the Prophecy, loſt his Life in ſeeing it fulfilled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being permitted to partake of the Plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006239_0010_1028000E2CCF6F80"/>
Could the Almighty deliver in that Day? Could he then preſerve without the Aſſiſtance of human Strength and Abilities? And can he not equally do ſo now? <hi>Behold the Lord's Hand is not ſhorten'd, that it cannot ſave: Neither his Ear heavy, that it cannot hear, Iſaiah</hi> lxix. 1.</p>
            <p>We are told in the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 8. That the Light of Nature, the Law of God, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, conſpire to evince the Divine Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Lawful War—Lawful War is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the three following Inſtances.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1ſt, When undertaken for neceſſary Defence againſt unjuſt Invaſion of ſuch as deſign to do us Harm, either by aſſaulting our Perſons, or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing us of, and ruining our Eſtates.</p>
               <p>2dly, When commenced for the Recovery of ſomething of great Importance unjuſtly taken from us, which we cannot do well without, nor, after Application, obtain by milder Meaſures; eſpecially when the Conſequences of the Loſs are like to be more prejudicial and diſtreſſing, than the Conſequences of the War entered into to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it: Thus <hi>David</hi> purſued the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who carried his and his Peoples Wives away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, together with their Sons and Daughters.</p>
               <p>3dly, War is no doubt lawful, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approved by God, when undertaken by the Magiſtrate, for the Puniſhment of ſome great Injury or Wrong, which much affects the Credit and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a Nation or People, after all ſofter Means for Redreſs fail of Succeſs: Thus the Royal Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt commenced War againſt the <hi>Ammonites</hi> for their contemptuous Uſage of his Ambaſſadors.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In theſe three Inſtances we are told poſitively War is lawful; but before we examine his Proofs of this, let it be obſerved, that in the ſecond Caſe, where <hi>David</hi>'s purſuing the <hi>Amalekites</hi> is ſuppoſed to be a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006239_0011_10280012345CC130"/>Parallel, though an extreamly afflicting one, when the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had, in the Abſence of <hi>David</hi> and his Men, ſmitten <hi>Ziclag,</hi> and burnt it with Fire, and had taken Captives their Wives, and their Sons, and their Daughters, and to add to his Difficulty, the People were ſo enraged that they ſpake of Ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, yet <hi>David,</hi> before he purſued, <hi>Enquired at the Lord, ſaving, Shall I purſue after this Troop? Shall I overtake them? And he anſwered him, Purſue; for thou ſhalt ſurely overtake them, end without fail recover all:</hi> Upon which the learned <hi>Poole</hi> obſerves, <q>
                  <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was ſenſible of his former Error in neglecting to aſk Counſel of God, by the Ephod, when he came to <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and when he went out with <hi>Achiſh</hi> to the Battle, and his Neceſſity now brings him to his Duty, and his Duty meets with Succeſs.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It is very probable <hi>David</hi> likewiſe enquired before he went up againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as he had before ſuffered for the Breach of this Duty.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If then it had been an Error not to have enquired of God, in ſo pinching a Caſe as this, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence fairly deducible is, That ſhould we be in the like Circumſtances, we muſt make the like Enquiry, and receive the Divine Permiſſion and Command, otherwiſe <hi>David</hi>'s Example will not be wholly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
            <p>The firſt Proof propoſed (in the Sermon) That War in the foregoing Inſtances is lawful, is from the Light of Nature; and I ſhould not have attacked the Arguments drawn from thence, had not this Writer aſked, <q>Who is the Author thereof but God himſelf?</q> The following Diſtinction ſeems therefore neceſſary to be made.</p>
            <p>God created Man good, upright and holy; and had he continued in this State, there never would have been any War, and conſequently no need of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence; but Man falling, thro' Diſobedience, his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006239_0012_102800154904F5C0"/>Nature became corrupted, his Faculties depraved, and the whole intellectual Syſtem diſordered: Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſhedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the unhappy Conſequence of Sin—I hope this Writer will not venture to ſay, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted: The Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of, was holy, innocent, and perfect; but the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in Nature from whence proceeded Violence and Bloodſhed, was occaſioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan. Let any Man therefore retain this Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he will not at all wonder, that <q>the univerſal Practice of all Nations, as well of the moſt civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed, as of the moſt rude and barbarous, do all with one Conſent oppoſe Force to Force</q>—for it is not from the degenerate fallen Light of Nature that Arguments are to be drawn for the Formation and Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtian Principles, neither are any from it, of any Weight in Oppoſition thereto. It would be eaſy however to prove from the Writings of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philoſophers, that they were convinced Man had fallen from the Condition he was once in, that he had been miſled and corrupted by ſome evil Principle, and that they could not conceive it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a holy, juſt God, ſhould make him ſubject to evil Paſſions, apt to commit Injuries, and fond of Revenge—Leſt any ſhould imagine they all thought Force the beſt Way to repel Force, hear what <hi>Plato</hi> ſays <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <q>Injury is to be done upon no Account; nor if you have ſuffered Injury, are you at Liberty to take Revenge, as the Vulgar believe. He who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Evil, if in like Manner he returns Evil to him, who did it, is not Juſt, as the Vulgar ſays, but Unjuſt; for to bring Evil upon Men, differs nothing from doing them an Injury—It is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006239_0013_10280016D0431600"/>and right to do Evil to any Man by Way of Revenge, whatſoever you may have ſuffered (or whatſoever Provocation you may have received) from others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Proofs, under this Head of the Light of Nature, I ſhall take notice of two or three other Paragraphs.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If it be not lawful (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 11) to oppoſe by Force unjuſt Invaders, then the Goods of Providence are vouchſafed to us in vain; and Men of the ſtricteſt Integrity, as well as Females of the moſt unblemiſhed Virtue, will ever be expoſed as an eaſy Prey to the vileſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of the moſt ſcandalous Scoundrels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To baniſh Self-defence, tho' purſu'd by Force, would be ſo far from promoting Peace, that it would rather contribute to the utter Ruin of the human Race.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe extraordinary Conſequences are true, what a ſtrong Faith in and Dependance upon God, do thoſe manifeſt, who have embraced, and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly maintain the peaceable Doctrine? Methinks this ſhould have inclined the Writer to remember, that whatſoever the Almighty commands or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of his Creatures, he gives them Strength to do, and will ſupport them in—That if any Nation or People were fully perſuaded in their Minds that the Almighty required them to forbear the Uſe of Arms, he could, if he pleaſed, prevent any ſuch Miſery happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; for to Him the Winds and Waves, and every Thing elſe is ſubject, and nothing can do us any Harm, but by his Permiſſion; by him the very Hairs of our Heads are numbered, and whatſoever doth happen, will, as ſuch keep faithful to him, work for their Good.</p>
            <p>That he can diſappoint the Deſigns of wicked and ambitious Men, without the Uſe of the Sword, every Body may remark in the late great Deſtruction of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006239_0014_10280019CF801808"/>the <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Jebucta</hi> Fleets—The former threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd much Diſtreſs to our Mother Country; and what a terrible Scourge was the latter likely to be to theſe Colonies, if the Protection and Care of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had not been ſufficient, without the Uſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 12) that ſuffers his Life to be taken from him, by one that hath no Authority for that Purpoſe, when he might preſerve it by Defence, incurs the Guilt of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder, ſince God hath enjoined him to ſeek the Continuance of his Life, &amp;c.</q>—<q>and that it is every Man's Duty to love his own Life, to deſire its Continuance, and uſe proper Means for its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Author ſhould have conſulted the Meaning of "Self-murder" before he uſed that Term ſo freely in ſeveral Parts of his Sermon—Murder is defined to denote a wilful and felonious killing another, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon prepenſed Malice, &amp;c. <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> or a Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murderer, is he that commits Felony, by willingly and deliberately killing himſelf; ſo that the Caſe in the Sermon does not reach this Deſcription, unleſs we can ſuppoſe, he who does not endeavour to defend himſelf, is unactive from a wilful and deliberate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of being killed.</p>
            <p>It is without doubt every Man's Duty to uſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means for the Preſervation of Life; but if any Man is convinced that Chriſt hath forbidden him the Uſe of military Preparations, and yet will uſe them, they are to him very improper Means— Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our Saviour's Words, <hi>Matthew</hi> xvi. 25, 26. <hi>For whoſoever will ſave his. Life, ſhall loſe it, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will loſe his Life for my ſake, ſhall find it? For what is a Man profited if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006239_0015_1028001DDE895E18"/>
               <hi>Poole</hi> annotates thus upon this Paſſage; <q>Beſides Bodies, which may be killed by Perſecutors, you carry about with you immortal Souls, of infinite more Value; and beſides a temporal Life, of which you are in Poſſeſſion, there is an eternal State which awaiteth you: You are Creatures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to an eternal Exiſtence, either in Miſery or in Happineſs. Admit you could by pleaſing yourſelves, denying me, ſhifting the Croſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining a Life according to my Precepts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, prolong your temporal Life; yet what will you get by it, conſidering that by it you muſt ſuffer Loſs, as to your eternal happy Exiſtence; for I ſhall then deny you before my Father, and his holy Angels. Can any Thing you can get or ſave in this World, be a proportionable Exchange for eternal Happineſs?</q>
            </p>
            <p>If any ſincere Chriſtian underſtands it to be his Duty not to make any Defence at all, his forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uſe any will never incur Guilt.</p>
            <p>The Sermon, after deſcribing the Wickedneſs of Self-murder, in <hi>Page</hi> 13, ſaith, <q>Well, if Self-murder be a heinous Sin, it will follow by the Law of Contraries, that Self-defence is an important Duty: Surely he who is unjuſtly attacked, and does not endeavour by ſuitable Means to preſerve his Life, eſpecially if there be any Probability of Succeſs in ſo doing, betrays it; and ſo is guilty of <hi>Suicide,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Paſſage I would remark, that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the moſt ſuitable Means to preſerve Life, when thus attacked, is to deliver up that for which the Attack is made, which is commonly for Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, without fighting with the Robbers—Fighting is very often the moſt "Suitable Means" to deſtroy Life when attacked—Eſpecially if uſed by one who believes the Goſpel prohibits it.—If however I were
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006239_0016_1028001F6628AD40"/>thus attacked by Villains who were ſo wicked as to determine to take away my Life, were I in the meek and peaceable Diſpoſition which the Goſpel incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, I believe that would have ſuch an Effect even on the worſt of Men, that it would diſarm their Malice; but if it did not, my ſubmitting calmly, and reſigning my Life, rather than running the Riſk of taking away another's, would be ſo far from <hi>Suicide,</hi> that it would be acting agreeable to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Temper of the Goſpel, and conſequently highly rewardable.</p>
            <p>The Sermon ſaith, <hi>Page</hi> 12, <q>If we may not defend ourſelves by Force, why did the bleſſed God allow the <hi>Jews</hi> to kill a Night-robber with Impunity? And why did the bleſſed Jeſus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join his Diſciples, that each of them who wanted a Sword, ſhould ſell his Coat and buy one?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The former of theſe Caſes, the Text thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth—<hi>If a Thief be found breaking up, and be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that he die, there ſhall no Blood be ſhed for him</hi>—
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Exodus</hi> xxii. 2.</note> That is to be underſtood in the Night, for the next Verſe ſays, <hi>If the Sun be riſen upon him, there ſhall be Blood ſhed for him</hi>—Though I do not look upon this Inſtance to be at all applicable to the Queſtion whether War is now lawful or not—Yet if it proves any Thing on the Side of the Sermon-writer, it is, that if their Enemies attack them in the Night, they may defend themſelves at the Expence of their Lives; but if the Attack be made in the Day-time, they muſt not—The Perſon who kill'd the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robber, is not ſaid to be clear of Guilt, though his Life was excuſed—And yet the Defence of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the Loſs of the Robber's Life in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, we ſee, was even under the legal Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be puniſhed with Death—I ſuppoſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of excuſing the Life of him who ſlew the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robber
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006239_0017_1028002399C7AF88"/>to be, that as they had a ſtanding Law from the Time of <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>Whoſoever ſhed Man's Blood, by Man ſhould his Blood be ſhed,</hi> it was neceſſary the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould know what was an Exception to that general Rule; that it was a reaſonable Exception, appears from apprehending that it might be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, whilſt the Owner of the Houſe was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neceſſary Defence, the Darkneſs of the Time in which the Attack was made, and the Surprize occaſioned thereby, might cauſe him, without De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to take away the Life of the Robber.</p>
            <p>As to that Paſſage of Chriſt's enjoining his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that each of them <q>who wanted a Sword, ſhould ſell his Coat and buy one,</q> upon which the Note at the Bottom of the Page, hath this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <q>If Chriſt was againſt all Fighting and War, to what Purpoſe did he counſel his Diſciples to buy Swords; muſt they be bought and never uſed, or bought for nothing.</q> I anſwer, That we have no Account of his Diſciples ever uſing Swords after his Aſcenſion, and we have ſeveral ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong Intimations in their Writings that they did not—Which ſufficiently demonſtrates, That they did not underſtand the Text in its preſent literal Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Upon <hi>Luke</hi> xxii. 35, 36. <hi>Poole</hi> hath the following Remark:—<q>Thoſe who interpret <hi>v.</hi> 35, 36, as a Precept of our Saviour's impoſing a Duty upon his Diſciples, or a Counſel concerning the providing Arms, which they might uſe for the Protection and Defence of themſelves, will not only find a Difficulty to reconcile their Notion of it to ſeveral other Precepts, and the Will of God declared by the Apoſtle's Practice, who never went about by Force and Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves in the firſt Plantation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel; but alſo to reconcile it to the laſt Words of our Saviour, who ſaid,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006239_0018_102800265E34CDA8"/>when his Diſciples told him they had two Swords, <hi>It is enough.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> one of the Fathers, ſo called, ſpeaks thus, reſpecting that Paſſage, <q>O Lord! Why commandeſt thou me to buy a Sword, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeſt me to ſmite with it? Why commandeſt thou me to have it, whom thou prohibiteſt to draw it? Unleſs perhaps a Defence be prepared, not neceſſary Revenge: And that I may ſeem to have been able to revenge, but that I would not; for the Law forbids me to ſmite again: And therefore, perhaps, he ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> offering two Swords (<hi>It is enough</hi>) as if it had been lawful until the Goſpel Times, that in the Law there might be learning of Equity, but in the Goſpel a Perfection of Goodneſs.</q> 
               <hi>Barc. Apol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>War (we are told in <hi>Page</hi> 14 of the Sermon) was lawful under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, and therefore it is lawful under the New.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us ſee how this extraordinary Inference will hold in other Caſes; Burnt-offerings, Sacrifices and Circumciſion, were lawful under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Diſpenſation, Are they therefore ſo now?</p>
            <p>But we are further told, <q>It is certain that God approved of, and appointed his People to make War, under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law: The ſixth Commandment does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly imply a lawful War; for if we muſt not kill others, much leſs ourſelves, and if we muſt have no Hand in our own Death, we muſt defend our Lives, againſt unjuſt Violence, which ſometimes cannot be done without War. Now the bleſſed Jeſus never came to deſtroy the moral Law of Nature, which is in ſubſtance the ſame, but to fulfil it, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſuch ſtrange Abſurdities in this Manner of declaiming, and drawing Concluſions, a Man muſt be very blind that cannot ſee them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006239_0019_10280027EAF734E0"/>
A poſitive Precept, is made to imply its direct reverſe. A Commandment not to kill is implied to authoriſe killing: And in Conſequence thereof, the bleſſed Jeſus is ſuppoſed to approve of War; whether this be agreeable to his Life and Doctrines, the Reader is deſired to conſult.</p>
            <p>I would now aſk, Is the moral Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> beſt fulfilled or kept, by underſtanding the Goſpel to forbid War, or to allow of it? Where there is one of thoſe that take it in its firſt Senſe ſlain, are there not many Thouſands of the latter killed in the Practice of Fighting?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Moral Precepts are (ſaith the Sermon) grounded upon invariable Equity, upon the Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Things, and therefore cannot be altered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can any Man poſſibly think that War is a Part of the moral Law, couched under this Precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> and does it follow that therefore War muſt for ever be lawful—This Method of making Texts mean what they never meant, our Author had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Page</hi> 9. with this Paſſage in the <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii. 3. <hi>The prudent Man, foreſeeing evil, hides himſelf; " i. e.</hi> (ſaith the Sermon) prepares for his Defence." ſo that hiding ones ſelf, and preparing for Defence, are ſo exactly alike, that they are taken one for the other.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>P.</hi> 14) if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is ſtill the ſame Neceſſity of it under the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as before, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now: It is abſurd to ſuppoſe that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, who is infinite in Wiſdom, and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Nature, would determine contrarily at different Periods of Time, concerning a Caſe that is ſubſtantially the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If this Manner of Arguing proves any Thing, it proves offenſive War, as lawful as defenſive.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006239_0020_1028002C892A1D78"/>God approved of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> taking away the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of many Nations: He commanded them to deſtroy ſome utterly; is it therefore equally lawful to do ſo now, whether we have his Command or not? The War that he approved of formerly, was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by his Counſel and Direction.</p>
            <p>The latter Part of the Paragraph does not belong to the Argument, unleſs it is firſt proved, either that People now-a-days have the expreſs Command of God to go to War, or that he hath determined Man to be a ſufficient Judge when it is ſuitable, and when not.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Nature of Man (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>P.</hi> 15) in his fallen State, does not alter by a Succeſſion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Multitudes do now graſp after Wealth and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as much as formerly, and do concert and purſue as unjuſt Meaſures to obtain them; and if we are now deprived of that, which is the only Barrier againſt Injuſtice and Violence, <hi>viz.</hi> Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence, and muſt tamely ſuffer our Lives, our Liberties, both Civil and Religious, and all that is dear to us as Men and Chriſtians, to be made an eaſy Prey of by inſulting Enemies, our Caſe is really miſerable, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Fore-part of this Paragraph is lamentably true; but how would the Face of Things be altered, if the glorious Doctrines of the bleſſed Meſſiah did but obtain, and were faithfully practiſed among the Nations? Which in Time will certainly be the Caſe, whatever Difficulties may at preſent appear to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it—For he is faithful and true, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it.</p>
            <p>But is Self-defence then our only Barrier againſt Injuſtice and Violence? God forbid it ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſo; miſerable ſhall we be indeed, when that is our State; and eaſily made a Prey of by inſulting Enemies, whether we uſe our feeble Force or not:
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006239_0021_1028002F507D9A78"/>But there are many who depend and confide ſolely in another Barrier, <hi>viz.</hi> The Eternal and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Providence, <hi>Whoſe Eye is over the Righteous for Good, and his Ear is open to their Cry, Pſal.</hi> xxxiv. 15. To ſuch he hath promiſed, <hi>In Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhalt thou be eſtabliſhed: Thou ſhalt be far from Oppreſſion, for thou ſhalt not fear; and from Terror, for it ſhall not come near thee,</hi> Iſa. liv. 14. <hi>And my People ſhall dwell in a peaceable Habitation, and in ſure Dwellings, and in quiet reſting Places,</hi> Iſa. xxxii. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is ſtrange to think (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>P.</hi> 15) and hard to reconcile it with any juſt Notion of divine Goodneſs, that Almighty God ſhould under this laſt and brighteſt Diſpenſation of his Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Children of Men, inſtead of enlarging, diminiſh our Privileges, and that in ſo tender and important a Point. Indeed, methinks, ſuch a Notion tends to caſt a diſhonourable and inglorious Reflection upon the divine Benlgnity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What Privileges are here meant, thoſe of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Poſſeſſions, gaining Riches, enjoying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Though Riches acquired by honeſt Means, may not be inconſiſtent with the Doctrines of Chriſt; and though we may poſſeſs in the World many near and dear Enjoyments, yet Chriſt and his Teſtimony, ought to be preferred above all Things, if we would render ourſelves acceptable in his Sight—<hi>If any Man</hi> (faith he, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 26) <hi>come to me, and hate not (i. e.</hi> comparatively) <hi>his Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Neither is this at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the moſt juſt Notions of divine Goodneſs—It would not be difficult to ſhew, that our Saviour's enjoining the young Man (<hi>Mat.</hi> xix.) to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006239_0022_10280030D966F1E8"/>ſell what he had, and give to the Poor, would, had there been Obedience on his Part, have proved his trueſt Intereſt. Man is a dependant Creature; his Happineſs conſiſteth not in Abundance of Wealth, Honour or Worldly Pleaſure; theſe are often his great Enemies: But it conſiſts in being what God his Maker would have him be. Every true Chriſtian knows this, and will be apt to think that this All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Being, as he is the Governor of the Univerſe, and knows beſt what is ſuitable and neceſſary for him, will certainly diſpenſe it: Such an One there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can be reſign'd in any Station or Circumſtance, becauſe he is ſure he is under the Care of a gracious Being, who permits nothing to happen to him, but what is for his Good: And ſhould he be in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Affliction, through an Adherence to what he knows to be his Duty, he will be ſupported under it, and amply rewarded for it. Theſe dare not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at any Privation of their Privileges, nor think it <q>A diſhonourable and inglorious Reflection upon the divine Goodneſs,</q> that they thus are afflicted, or are liable to be ſo; ſince the preſent Afflictions will certainly work <hi>A far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 17.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid thus much in Anſwer to the laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Paragraph, upon a Suppoſition that a faithful Adherence to the Doctrines of Chriſt, may, in this Age, as it has frequently in former Ages, be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Loſs of outward Poſſeſſions, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Fleſh—Let it however be remember'd, that theſe Things are not the Effects of Chriſt's Doctrines, but are occaſioned by a Diſobedience to them in thoſe to whom they are equally offered— Whoſe Condemnation will therefore be great, and the Reward of the Obedient will be infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Why, my Brethren (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 15) ſhould it be now a Sin to perform (in reſpect
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006239_0023_102800339E178978"/>of Things of a moral Nature) that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation a Sin to neglect? Was not <hi>Meroz</hi> expoſed to a bitter Curſe, becauſe ſhe came not to help the Lord againſt the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>i. e.</hi> as appears by the Context, becauſe they came not to aſſiſt their Brethren engaged in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in a good Cauſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Queſtions, I really think, not applicable to the Point in Diſpute, becauſe there is not any Part of the moral Law which enjoins War; and the Reaſon why <hi>Meroz</hi> was ſo ſeverely curſed, <hi>Poole</hi> ſays, was, <q>To ſhew the Sinfulneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of their cowardly Deſertion of this Cauſe, becauſe it was the Cauſe of God; and they had the Call of God to it, whom they knew to be able eaſily to cruſh that Enemy whom they dreaded, and who had promiſed to do it.</q> So that upon this View of the Caſe, there is this only proved by the Parallel, that it is a Sin to neglect go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to War in the Cauſe of God, when he calls to it. This, therefore, cannot at all operate againſt thoſe who refuſe Fighting, becauſe they apprehend God hath forbidden it
<note n="*" place="bottom">Now it is well known, that the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who ſcruple Fighting, have never been remarkable for being Cowards; their conſtant Practice of ſuffering valiantly in Times of hot Perſecution (when many of the ſame Profeſſion with this Sermon-writer hid themſelves) is a Proof of Courage, when they thought the Cauſe they were engaged in was right—If the Reader will conſult <hi>William Sewell</hi>'s Hiſtory, and <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Works, he will meet with ſundry Paſſages there, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of this Remark.</note>.</p>
            <p>If it be a Difficulty with any to reconcile God's commanding War under the Old Teſtament Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, with his prohibiting it now, I beſeech them to remember, that he ſuffered and required many Things of the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe of the Hardneſs of their Hearts, which were not to continue in his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006239_0024_102800379E76A908"/>Church, after the bright Diſcovery of the Goſpel was manifeſted. The World was then in very great Darkneſs and Ignorance, and it pleaſed God to chuſe a peculiar People, whom he determined to make great and famous: This was not to be the Caſe in the Exhibition of the Goſpel: The Partition Wall between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was then broken down, and all Nations were invited to become the People of God. The Kingdoms of this World were to become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and his Chriſt (<hi>Rev.</hi> xi. 15) Is it therefore reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that this univerſal, glorious Deſign, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of War and Fighting? Eſpecially between ſuch Nations as profeſs to be under the Government of the ſame Lord and Law-giver.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Can we think, my Brethren (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 16) that God would enjoin and approve of any Practice formerly, that was contrary to the moral Law and Goſpel which the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed? Surely no; that is contrary to his unalterable Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, of which the moral Law is a legible Copy and Exemplar. Well, if a juſt War was not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the moral Law, under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and before it, why ſhould it be ſo now, in the like Circumſtances of Neceſſity? And if it be not contrary to the moral Law, the ſtanding and unalterable Rule of our Conduct, Why ſhould any ſcruple it, or oppoſe it now?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have already obſerved, that the Almighty's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining and Approving of ſome Wars formerly, does not authorize any Wars begun and carried on at the meer Will and Pleaſure of Men. <q>The like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Neceſſity,</q> muſt be, when we have the Divine Command and Direction, and not otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>If it be a Doubt why the dark and diſtant Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of the Goſpel, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, did not diſcover to them in general, that the Time ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006239_0025_1028003A74BA4E68"/>come when outward War ſhould be laid aſide, the ſame Difficulty recurs with reſpect to Sacrifices, Burnt-offerings, Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet ſome of the inſpired Prophets foreſaw that Time. If it be objected, That Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; ſo, in my Opinion, were the outward Wars and Fightings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and are conſidered in that Light by religious Writers of many Denominations.</p>
            <p>That the moral Law is the ſtanding and unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Rule of our Conduct, I grant, as far as it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: But it is not from thence that a Scruple againſt Fighting ariſes. The bleſſed Jeſus hath taught ſome Chriſtians (both by the immediate Dictates of his Spirit, and the Expreſſion of his Will, when perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon Earth) that the beſt Way to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill;</hi> and, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour;</hi> is not to harbour any Ill-will, or Revenge againſt any, but to <hi>Love Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. And that <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery</hi>—is beſt kept by forbearing to look upon a Woman with a luſtful Eye, or to entertain ſuch a Thought: And that <hi>Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. is beſt kept by Speaking the Truth, without Swearing at all.</p>
            <p>The next Paragraph in the Sermon, and to <hi>Page</hi> 20, is to prove, <q>That the Office of the Magiſtrate neceſſarily requires War; and that it is his Duty to uſe it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Upon which I remark, That whenever the Magiſtrate is convinced that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſt forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to thoſe Doctrines. However, the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do not undertake to condemn our Superiors engaging in War, in the preſent unhappy State of human Affairs: We rather think it probable, that as they have ſhewn a noble and Chriſtian Diſpoſition, in granting Liberty and Protection to ſuch as are of tender Conſciences, it may pleaſe God to bleſs their Arms with Succeſs, and reward them for their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006239_0026_1028003C02F249A8"/>to his People, who deſire to live in Obedience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to Purity and Perfection: And agreeable to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> we find it our Duty to put up our Prayers for Kings and them that are in Authority, <hi>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>We are now come to the Sermon's New Teſtament Proofs, which are thus uſher'd in, <q>I may add, that the Lawfulneſs of War, eſpecially Defenſive, is ſignified in the New Teſtament in divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</q>—If he makes this out to be true, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge myſelf to have been miſtaken—The Words, "Eſpecially Defenſive," <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould ſeem to convey an Idea, as if the Lawfulneſs of offenſive War was alſo ſignified in the New Teſtament—Let us obſerve the Proofs.</p>
            <p>The firſt is in <hi>Page</hi> 20, from the Behaviour of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to the Soldiers, who aſk'd him, <hi>What they ſhould do? John</hi> told them, <hi>Do Violence to no Man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with your Wages, Luke</hi> iii. 14. From whence this Writer argues thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>While he counſels to be content with the Wages of War, does he not, of Neceſſity, approve the Work? Or would he have Wages paid for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Can we reaſonably conjecture, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Perſon would give Directions how to conduct a Manner of Life that was ſimply unlawful and hateful to God? Would he not rather have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it abſolutely, and exhorted the Soldiers ſpeedily to forſake and abandon it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Theſe (<hi>Poole</hi> ſays) were the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, kept by them to maintain their Conqueſt of <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>John</hi> was a <hi>Jew.</hi> Some of theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers hearing him preach Repentance, apply to him for ſome Advice. He very wiſely tells them wherein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006239_0027_1028003EDC135120"/>their moral Conduct (which he did likewiſe to the Publicans, who aſked the ſame Queſtion) as a preparatory Step to their receiving greater and more ſublime Doctrines. Now if abſtaining from War be the very Perfection of the Chriſtian Religion, that is, a Point the moſt difficult to be learned, and hardeſt for Nature to ſubmit to, is it likely or reaſonable to expect, that <hi>John,</hi> upon the <hi>Pagan</hi> Soldiers firſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, ſhould declare that to them? I think not. Nor can I conceive, that while he counſels them to be content with their Wages, that he of Neceſſity approves the Works they received it for—He might adviſe them to be content with their Wages, that they might not plunder and rob thoſe among whom they were ſtationed: And if I were in ſuch a Situation, that is, ſaw my own Nation ſubject to Soldiers of a foreign Power, though my religious Principles might not permit me to fight, yet I could freely adviſe ſuch Soldiers to be eaſy, and content to live upon the Pay their Maſter allowed them, without ravaging and plundering my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Countrymen. There is not therefore the leaſt Proof from this Argument, that War is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but the reverſe; for <hi>John</hi> forbad doing Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to any Man; Can War ſubſiſt without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence?</p>
            <p>
               <q>Nor did (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 21) our Lord Jeſus rebuke the Centurion or <hi>Roman</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on Account of his military Employment, when he apply'd to him for the Cure of his ſick Servant; but commended his Faith, tho' he uſed his Calling as an Argument to ſupport it.</q> This, and the Remainder of the Paragraph, which puts the Proof upon our Saviour's not taking that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to declare againſt War, is likewiſe no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to me on this Point—Our Saviour did not initiate the <hi>Romans,</hi> or any others, upon their firſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006239_0028_1028004065719628"/>Belief in him, into the whole Nature and Deſign of the Goſpel: His own Diſciples, long after they had followed him, were ſo ignorant, that they thought he intended to aſſume an outward Kingdom: Our Lord knew that the beſt Method to deal with frail fallen Mortals, was to lead them by Degrees, and not at once to Perfection.—If the Sermon-writer could have proved that after this Miracle, which our Lord wrought upon the Centurion's teſtifying ſuch an extraordinary Degree of Faith, that he eſpouſed the Doctrines, and joined himſelf with the Diſciples of Chriſt, that he became a faithful Aſſerter of the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and yet retained his military Employ, there would have been ſome Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his Argument; but as he hath not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee that the Paſſage is any Thing to his Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But methinks (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 22) our Lord ſignifies his Approbation of War more expreſsly elſewhere, in theſe Words, <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World; if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>John</hi> xviii. 36.</note> The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which is apparently this, That tho' War and Fighting is no proper Mean to promote the Spiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, yet that if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Deſign of his Humiliation had permitted him to aſſume a Temporal Crown, then his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ought to fight, in Defence of his Perſon and Dignity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I think this apparent Meaning not deducible from the Text—<hi>Pilate</hi> had aſked Chriſt, if he was the King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> In Anſwer he lets him know that his Kingdom was not of this World, which himſelf might eaſily perceive, by his not permitting his Servants to fight for him. <hi>Poole</hi> thus interprets that Paſſage;—<q>I cannot deny but that I am the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006239_0029_10280045C51EAB40"/>King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but not in the Senſe they take it; not ſuch a King as they look for in their Meſſiah; my Kingdom is Spiritual, over the Hearts and Minds of Men, not earthly and worldly; and of this thou thyſelf may'ſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced: for was there ever an earthly Prince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and bound, for whom none of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would take up Arms? Here's none of my Diſciples takes up Arms, or offereth to fight for me; which is a plain Evidence that I pretend to no kingly Power in Diſturbance of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If this be the fair and genuine Meaning of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, it does not imply that "his Servants ought to fight"—nor in the leaſt Degree ſhew an expreſs Approbation of War, as the Sermon-writer hath vainly imagined—And here I ſhall deſire him to conſider, whether Chriſt's directing us to pray that his Will may be done in Earth as it is in Heaven, doth not much more clearly expreſs an Injunction to live in Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Does not (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 23) <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt highly commend <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Centurion of the <hi>Italian</hi> Band, without any Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Invective upon his martial Office? And is he not alſo adorn'd with the Angel's Teſtimony? And why is all this but to ſignify the Lawfulneſs of War in Goſpel Times?

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But is <hi>Cornelius</hi> commended by the Evangeliſt, or the Angel, for his military Poſt? Does either of them ſay a Word of the Conſiſtency of it with the Doctrines he was about to receive? No; he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for being <hi>A devout Man, and one that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, with all his Houſe, which gave much Alms to the People, and prayed to God alway:</hi> This Character he had, before he was inſtructed in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006239_0030_10280048ADC5E540"/>Principles of the Chriſtian Religion; <hi>Now he ſaw in a Viſion an Angel, who directed him to ſend for Peter —He ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to do</hi>—Which plainly ſhews he had ſomething material yet to learn. Whether he continued in his military Station, after <hi>Peter</hi> had taught him, and he received the Holy Ghoſt, the Hiſtory is ſilent; but to make the Compariſon of any Weight in ſupport of War, it muſt firſt be proved that he did.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 23) inſinuates the Lawfulneſs of War, in that Expreſſion of his, where he enjoins us to live peaceably as much as poſſible with all Men; which ſuppoſes that it is ſometimes impracticable, impoſſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here again I differ in Sentiment from this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Apoſtle's Words are, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all Men</hi>—Which I think is as much as to ſay, Whatever Aſſronts or Provocations you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, let it not anger you, or beget any Deſire in you to return Injury for Injury, tho' ſome may make War upon you, or try to diſturb you, yet let nothing appear on your Side but a meek and quiet Spirit, which is willing to ſuffer ill Treatment, rather than let a quarrelſome or warring Diſpoſition appear. The Apoſtle had in the preceding Verſe exhorted, <hi>Recompence to no Man Evil for Evil</hi>— And in the laſt Verſe of ſame Chapter, he again preſſes the ſame meek and forgiving Behaviour, <hi>Be not overcome with Evil, but overcome Evil with Good</hi>—<q>This Verſe (faith <hi>Poole</hi>) is a divine Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm; therein the Apoſtle anticipates an Objection: Some might be ready to ſay, if we ſhould follow this Advice, we ſhould be counted Cowards and Daſtards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this he Anſwers, That 'tis the ready Way to be Triumphers and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006239_0031_1028004B6CC6FB70"/>By Evil here, he means the Wrongs and Injuries of Men; and to be overcome of Evil, is to be moved and provoked thereby to Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Malice; when 'tis thus with a Man, he is overcome or conquered: In Revenge of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he is a Loſer that gets the better. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorts us rather to overcome Evil with Good, that is a noble Victory indeed: This is the Way not to be even with him that wrongs us, but to be above him; thus <hi>David</hi> overcame <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Bands of <hi>Syria.</hi> This is the Way to overcome ourſelves, and our Adverſaries too; ourſelves, in denying our Luſts that egg us on to Revenge; our Adverſaries, in winning them to relent and acknowledge their Miſcarriages.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now Reader, conſider this Interpretation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the Precept, <hi>Recompence to no Man Evil for Evil,</hi> and then try if thou can'ſt conceive that the Apoſtle intended (when he adviſed <hi>to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as much as poſſible with all Men</hi>) to inſinuate the Lawfulneſs of War.</p>
            <p>The next Obſervation in the Sermon, is from the Improbability of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s recording the military Proweſs and Exploits of divers antient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, as <hi>Gideon, Barack, Sampſon, &amp;c.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Hint of any Alteration in Goſpel Times in that Reſpect, and vet he himſelf of a contrary Sentiment. But where is this Difficulty? Does not the Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter commend the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> in leaving his own Country, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his only Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> at the Command of God? Now will or can this be conſtrued to infer, that becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> did theſe Things at the divine Command, and the Apoſtle does not give the leaſt Hint of any Alteration in Goſpel Times in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that therefore a Chriſtian may follow that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample without ſuch Command? And yet this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006239_0032_1028004CF35B6278"/>is as fair, as to infer that becauſe <hi>Gideon, &amp;c.</hi> did go to War at the Command of God (which this Writer grants thoſe Worthies did) and the Apoſtle commends them for it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſtians may follow their Example without ſuch Command—If, however, this Paſſage is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to vindicate the Conduct of ſuch who go to War in Obedience to the Command of God— I ſhall not pretend to ſay that ſuch War is unlawful. The Object of the Faith, through which thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies wrought ſuch Wonders, was, <hi>Deus loquens, &amp;c.</hi> God ſpeaking, and conveying to them a clear Knowledge of Duty, and Aſſurance of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>But we are told that <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <q>virtually and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially ſignified his Approbation of War by his Practice, in not rejecting the Protection of an arm'd Force;</q> and <hi>Acts</hi> xxiii. is referr'd to for a Proof—I requeſt the Reader to peruſe the Chapter, and he will not find that <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo much as make any Application for the Protection of an arm'd Force, though he knew there was a Conſpiracy form'd for the taking away his Life; he only took the neceſſary Steps to inform the Chief Captain (in whoſe Cuſtody he was) of that Deſign, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but he would have ſo much Juſtice, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch a private Murder. The Chief Captain being thus informed of the Deſign, ſends a Number of Soldiers, who, <hi>as it was commanded them,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>took Paul, and brought him by Night to Antipatris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, would it be reaſonable or prudent, ſuppoſing the Apoſtle to have been ever ſo clear in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that War was unlawful to Chriſtians, for him, then a Priſoner, to refuſe being conducted by the Soldiers, whither their Superior had ordered them to take him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:006239_0033_1028004FC1EF21E8"/>
We are told in the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 25, That the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> iv. 1. does not ſay, <q>That War is ever unjuſt and ſinful upon both Sides, or unneceſſary in Man's fallen State, but that the original Cauſe of War is Evil,</q> or proceeding from Luſt.—</p>
            <p>Can a true Chriſtian then, who hath known the Ax laid to the Root of the Tree; <hi>i. e.</hi> The Spirit of God giving him Victory over Luſt, join with, countenance or encourage, that which hath Luſt for its Original? And ſhould he not rather, by his Doctrine and Practice, be concern'd to open the Eyes of Men? and to turn them from the <hi>Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God? Acts</hi> xxvi. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But (ſaith the Sermon) it is again objected, that the Apoſtle obſerves to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>The Weapons of their Warfare were not carnal.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 4.</note> The Application of this, to mean no more than that they did not uſe carnal Weapons againſt Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſpiritualy, is not doing Juſtice to the Text; it is rather charging it with an Abſurdity—The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had in the preceding Verſe told them, "<hi>For though we walk in the Fleſh, we do not war after the Fleſh:</hi> This, therefore, is an expreſs Declaration, that they did not uſe carnal Weapons; and a poſitive Proof, that they did not War at all after the Fleſh: And his ſpeaking in the plural Number, may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to mean, that the Chriſtians in general were in the ſame Practice; for, in the foregoing Verſes, when he ſpoke of himſelf, he uſed the ſingular Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: So that this Objection againſt the Lawfulneſs of War to Chriſtians, remains in its full Force.</p>
            <p>
               <q>There is (ſaith the Sermon) a great Difference between the War we muſt ſuſtain between Sin and Satan, and a War with wicked Men. To pretend to vanquiſh the former by carnal Weapons, is as
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006239_0034_10280053B60D47C0"/>abſurd, as to expect a Conqueſt over the latter (always) without them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, Reader! what an abſurd Company of People, according to this Writer, the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were! Tho', agreeable to the Apoſtle's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony juſt now quoted, they did not War after the Fleſh; their Weapons were not carnal; and yet they paſſed thro' a wicked World, and were Overcomers of Evil with Good.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is preſumptuous (ſaith the Sermon) to expect an End without the Uſe of Means adapted to it: To expect a Crop by the Dint of our Supplications, without Plowing, Sowing and Fencing, our Ground, would be exceeding fond and vain: And ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Protection from unreaſonable and violent Men, without uſing proper Means for Defence, on Account of our Piety and Prayers, is equally unreaſonable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Means which the Goſpel allows for Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and Keeping of Peace, are in the firſt, and chiefeſt Place, the Practice of Chriſtian Virtues, Humility, Meekneſs, Beneficence, Charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With and by theſe Means, the firſt Settlers of this Province cultivated a good Underſtanding and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with numerous warlike ſavage Nations, which ſtill ſubſiſts: And I really think, were but theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues generally practiſed, and Almighty God truly honoured and feared by us, and the Truſt repoſed in the Civil Power for the Puniſhment of Evil-doers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> faithfully diſcharged, we ſhould be ſo bleſſed and favoured with the peculiar Care of Heaven, that no violent Men would be permitted to make a Prey of us: <hi>When a Man's Ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at Peace with him, Prov.</hi> xvi. 7. I cannot think that to expect a Crop by the Dint of our Supplications, and to expect Protection on Account of our Piety and Prayers—are ſimilar Caſes.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006239_0035_1028005682137E80"/>The Means to procure a Crop are neceſſary, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and uſeful to the Creation; but War is ruinous and deſtructive to it—However true it may be, that it is unreaſonable for ſuch as are not convinced that War is forbidden by the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, to expect Protection without the Uſe of military Preparations, yet it is not ſo to thoſe who have learned of their Lord not to fight. Such can, with well-grounded Aſſurance, depend upon Protection from Heaven, becauſe they are in the Uſe of the Means neceſſary to obtain that End, and ſo are not charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with Preſumption or tempting God. Such think, that the Perfection of human Reaſon, conſiſts in an humble Reſignation and Acquieſcence with the Mind of the eternal Reaſon—He hath taught them to confide and truſt wholly in him, both for Food, Raiment, and Preſervation of Life. Some Means, <hi>viz.</hi> Plowing, Sowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath been made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, on our Part, for the obtaining thoſe Ends: Were theſe Means uſed only to provide the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Life, without making Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof; were God regarded in and through them, as the alone efficient Cauſe of their being ſucceſsful, and humbly thanked for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; we ſhould then act like reaſonable Men, and Chriſtians. But we do not, when we expect a Crop without thoſe Means which are neceſſary, and NOT FORBIDDEN—And we eſteem it unreaſonable for us to engage in War, or Preparations for it, becauſe when God requires any Thing of Men, it is in the higheſt Degree reaſonable for them to obey him: And any People that imagines they act reaſonably, when they are in the Practice of any Thing which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light hath convinced them to be diſagreeable to the Mind of God, will, in the End, find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fatally miſtaken.—Now, as ſome Chriſtians are aſſured God hath forbidden them to engage in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006239_0036_102800580876CF20"/>outward War: Which, then, to theſe is moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, to uſe Means which he hath forbidden, or to depend ſolely upon him in the Uſe of ſuch Means as are acceptable to him; that is, Piety and Prayers, which have ever been bleſs'd and favour'd of the moſt High, ſometimes by his delivering out of, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſupporting under Difficulties, Straits and Afflictions, and always by rewarding with infinite Bliſs in the World to come, whatever may have been the Circumſtance in this Life?—Give me leave here to aſk—Is it not more conſiſtent with the Duty of a Miniſter of the meek, ſelf-denying Jeſus, to recommend Piety and Prayers as the only acceptable Means neceſſary to obtain Protection from Heaven, than to repreſent thoſe Means unreaſonable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient without human Means?</p>
            <p>We are now come to that excellent and glorious Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ii. 4. <hi>And he (i. e.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſhall judge among the Nations, and ſhall rebuke many People, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-books, Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> Upon which the Sermon ſaith, <q>It is probable that this Scripture at leaſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally reſpects the ſpiritual and internal Peace of Chriſt's Kingdom,</q> and that <q>there is a vaſt Difference between the internal and ſpiritual Peace of Chriſt's Kingdom, and that which is political and external.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems deſigned to evade the Force of the Text, which plainly ſays that Chriſt's judging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations, and rebuking the People, ſhall occaſion outward War to be laid aſide, and the very Art and Study of it to be diſuſed; that the Weapons uſed therein for Deſtruction, ſhall then be turned into Impliments of Huſbandry—The Cauſe and the Effect are both foretold in this Prophecy—
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006239_0037_1028005C01F9BCC0"/>The Cauſe is the Judging of Chriſt internally in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, and the Effect that wherever this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is experienced, there is in ſuch a Ceſſation from all War. <hi>A good Tree bringeth not forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fruit, Luke</hi> vi. 43. But War is corrupt Fruit, becauſe it hath Luſt for its Original, and an impure Fountain can never ſend forth clear Streams—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe who are acquainted with this inward Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Governing of Chriſt in the Soul, bring not forth ſuch Fruit. They know the Efficacy of Divine Love ſhed abroad in their Hearts to be ſuch, that they can truly and ſincerely love their Enemies; and are ſo far from a Will to Injure or Diſtreſs them in any Shape, they could ſuffer deeply to do them Good. A Diſpoſition truly ſublime! It hath the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stamp of Heaven upon it. And there are many who bleſs and praiſe the God and Father of all our Mercies, for his great Condeſcenſion and Goodneſs, in raiſing up a People, in theſe latter Days, as a Kind of Firſt-fruits (ſince the dark and gloomy Night of Apoſtacy) in the Accompliſhment of this Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—May theſe walk humble, and be faithful to the high and holy Calling! May they be as ſhining Lights to the diſtracted World! <hi>O Houſe of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the Light of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. ii. 5. And may all Nations become Partakers of the Excellency and Perfection of this Diſpenſation! Then ſhall <hi>Peace be extended like a River, and the Glory of the Gentiles be like a flowing Stream,</hi> Iſa. lxvi. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He ſhall root out (ſaith <hi>Poole,</hi> on <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ii. 4.) thoſe great Animoſities and Hoſtilities which were between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Epheſ. ii. 13. and between ſeveral Nations; ſubduing Mens Pride, and Paſſions, and Luſts, which are the Cauſes of all Wars and Contentions; and working Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Meekneſs, and Self-denial, and true and fervent Love to all Men, from whence Peace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006239_0038_1028005EC1A157D8"/>follows. This was the Deſign of the Goſpel in all, and the Effect of it in thoſe that rightly received it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood this Prophecy
<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield's Defence of the Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</hi>
               </note> to relate ſolely to the Times of the Meſſiah; and alledge it as a ſtrong Argument that the Meſſiah is not come: For, ſay they, War and Fighting is not ceaſed, and the Sword is uſed as well by thoſe called Chriſtians, as other People. How will our mighty Pleader for War anſwer this Objection? By telling them, <q>It is not neceſſary that Prophecies reſpecting the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah's Kingdom, ſhould be accompliſhed at the Beginning of it; it is enough that they be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the End of it.—</q> I believe this would not remove the Weight of the Objection. The antient Fathers of the firſt two Centuries after Chriſt had much better Arguments; they did affirm theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies to be fulfilled in the Chriſtians of their Times, who were moſt averſe from War.—<hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (who lived in the ſecond Century) in his Apology for the Chriſtians, cites theſe Words of this Prophecy; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation; neither ſhall they learn War any more</hi>—And ſays, <q>That this is thus fulfilled, you have Grounds to believe; for we who in Times paſt killed one another, do not War or Fight with our Enemies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>It is certain (ſaith the Sermon) that the Goſpel inclines all that receive it in Truth, to live as much as is poſſible in Peace with all Men: It ſubdues, in a Meaſure, Mens Corruptions, which are the fatal Sources of Contention and War, and makes them humble and meek.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I think this Conceſſion, would overſet the whole of the Scheme, if the Words, <hi>In a Meaſure,</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; for Humility and Meekneſs are quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006239_0039_1028006048A1E278"/>to War and Fighting, which proceed from Pride and Covetouſneſs—But does not the Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Goſpel received in the Love of it, only in a Meaſure ſubdues Mens Corruptions, imply a Deficiency in the Power? And can it be conſiſtent with our Lord's Doctrine—<hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, John</hi> iii. 3. A new Birth implies an entire Change. <q>'Tis uſual (ſaith <hi>Poole</hi> on this Paſſage) by the civil Laws of Countries, that none enters into the Poſſeſſion of an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by the Right of Birth; and for the obtaining the Kingdom of Heaven, there muſt be a new Birth, a heavenly Renovation of the whole Man, Soul, Body and Spirit, to give him a Title by the wiſe and unchangeable Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God in the Goſpel, and to qualify him for the Enjoyment of it.</q>—This is what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> terms, <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible Seed, but by incoruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> i. 23. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a New-Creature: Old Things are paſt away, behold all Things are become new,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 17. Theſe, and many other Paſſages in the New Teſtament, poſitively declare (if we become the Children of God) the Neceſſity of having our Corruptions whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued; the Deeds of the Fleſh thoroughly mortified, with the Luſts and Affections thereof; and the Grace of God is entirely ſufficient, as it is believed in and obeyed, to complete this great Work—<hi>The Goſpel of Chriſt, is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every One that believeth, Rom.</hi> i. 16. Such faithful Followers of the divine Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, are redeemed from the fatal Sources of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and War—And whereas in their former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they had Strife, Envyings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they now
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006239_0040_102800634B995470"/>witneſs pure Love to God and all Men, to be the governing Principle in their Minds—This Victory and Diſpoſition, is a State truly deſirable, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our utmoſt Diligence and Pains to attain— It is real Happineſs in this Life (<hi>Such are redeemed from the Fear of Evil, Rev.</hi> ii. 10) it gives the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Reliſh and Taſte of temporal Bleſſings—Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens every bitter Cup, makes the greateſt Pains and Afflictions tolerable, chears the Mind in the moſt gloomy and diſtreſſing Circumſtances, and carries with it a ſure and undoubted Evidence of Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and full of Glory in the Life to come— <hi>Wherefore forgetting thoſe Things which are behind, let us reach forth unto thoſe Things which are before,</hi> Phil. iii. 13.</p>
            <p>The Sermon ſaith (leaſt the Prophecy before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould be ſuppoſed to intend an outward Peace) <q>Chriſt himſelf aſſures us that an external Peace would not be the immediate Iſſue of his Coming, <hi>I came not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſend Peace on Earth, but a Sword</hi>—Tho' the Doctrines and Power of his Religion tend to Peace, yet our Lord prophecies that thoſe who reject them, would kindle the Flame of an unjuſt War and Perſecution againſt his Followers, upon a religious Account.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Sword which our Lord came to ſend, was that of the Spirit, <hi>Which is the Word of God, Eph.</hi> vi. 17. And yet I do not contend that the aforeſaid Prophecy was to be univerſally fulfilled upon the firſt Publication of Chriſt's Doctrines; all that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on from it is, that it was and is fulfilled upon as many as did, or now do receive the Goſpel in the Love of it, and faithfully obey it; and the Means and Power of ſo receiving it, is offered to all.</p>
            <p>When "the Flame of an unjuſt War" broke out againſt the Followers of Chriſt, did they reſiſt? Did they defend themſelves? If not, how will the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006239_0041_1028006622441070"/>Sermon's Concluſion in Page 24, ſtand good? <q>If the Offenſive be unjuſt, the Defenſive muſt of Conſequence be juſt.</q> Alas! thoſe holy Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of a meek and crucified Saviour, did not conceive the Juſtneſs of ſuch a Defence; they, like their Pattern, were led as Sheep to the Slaughter, they ſuffer'd patiently and quietly, whatever Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Pains, or Sufferings, wicked and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men were permitted to inflict upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flying to human Help, to make Uſe of carnal Weapons, or to war after the Fleſh, which is now declared by ſome that would be eſteem'd Chriſtian Miniſters, to be abſolutely neceſſary, and conſiſtent with the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 28) does not our Lord enjoin us not to reſiſt Evil, and that if one ſmite us on the right Cheek, we muſt turn to him the other, and that if a Man take away our Coat, we ſhould let him have our Cloak alſo? And likewiſe that we ſhould love our Enemies, bleſs thoſe that curſe us, and ſhew Kindneſs to thoſe that deſpitefully uſe us.</q>

            <p>It is probable our Author thought he ſhould make this Objection too ſtrong, if he had given the Reaſons which the Text uſes, for enforcing Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to theſe Doctrines, <hi>That ye may be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your Father in Heaven, for he maketh his Sun to riſe on the Evil, and on the Good, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Rain on the Juſt, and on the Unjuſt—Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>

            <p>This Conſtruction appears to me to be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too much confined—A Prohibition of Injuries, and a Command to endure them, muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as relative to the Conſequence if allowed—A ſmall Injury is attended with a Degree of Injuſtice, and the enduring it, rather than returning it, ſhews in ſome Degree a Chriſtian Diſpoſition—Now conſider that Conſequence with reſpect to greater; the endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them rather than returning Evil for Evil, doth certainly ſhew a much greater Degree of that <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Lowlineſs of Heart</hi> which Chriſt taught his Diſciples to <hi>learn of him</hi>—And indeed were but his Example conſidered, as explanatory of his Laws, it would amount to a full Proof that he intended to prohibit all Return of Injuries among his Followers.</p>
            <p>Again, if every particular Member of the Church be forbidden Revenge, it is becauſe allowing of it would manifeſt a want of Patience and Fortitude to endure, and encourage Envy, Strife, Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which produces Deſtruction to Particulars—Surely then this Reaſon is much ſtronger for forbidding national and publick Revenge—Becauſe allowing it produces thoſe wicked Fruits in an abundant greater and more univerſal Manner—Beſides, Can thoſe who are ſeparately forbid a Thing, be at Liberty collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to do it—Suppoſe ten Men are each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their Prince to abſtain from a particular Diet, becauſe it is pernicious; it cannot ſurely be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to that Prince that theſe ten Men together
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006239_0043_1028006D1FFB9B58"/>ſhould do, what ſeparately he had forbid them— Upon this View of the Caſe, does it look reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe that Chriſt intended to prohibit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate particular Revenge, and allow of national and publick? Can it be conſiſtent with his Laws, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh leſſer Degrees of Evil, and juſtify greater? Did he not reprove the Scribes and Phariſees for omitting weightier Matters, whilſt they tythed Mint, Anniſe and Cummin—<hi>Ye blind Guides which ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel, Mat.</hi> xxiii. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>And according to the Reaſon given by Chriſt himſelf immediately after thoſe Precepts, they muſt certainly intend a Prohibition of all Injury and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or elſe the Compariſon is not very proper— <hi>That ye may be the Children of your Father in Heaven</hi>— For he diſpences his temporal Bleſſings upon all, even upon the moſt publickly Prophane; upon Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, Idolaters, and the vileſt of human Race. Will my putting up with ſmall and tolerable Injuries, not indulging private Revenge, but reſiſting with Violence great Injuries, and returning with my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Force all the Evil in my Power, in Revenge for national Grievances, be coming up to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the Almighty's univerſal Beneficence and Kindneſs to thoſe that do their utmoſt to affront and diſpleaſe him? I conclude it does not; and therefore think the Precepts extend to all Kind of Injuries whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It may be further obſerved (ſaith this Writer) that if the aforeſaid Scripture be taken in a ſtrict and literal Senſe, going to Law is as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted thereby as defenſive War. But the former is abſurd, and therefore the latter.</q> Where is this Abſurdity? There are many pious Chriſtians who look upon the Precept to extend thus far, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not ſue at Law at all: And if there are others
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:006239_0044_1028006EB0385470"/>who think it may be done, without contradicting the Text, provided it be in Uprightneſs, and without any Hatred, Malice or Revenge. Yet the Practice of theſe does not in the leaſt make void or leſſen the Authority of the Precepts, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil, Love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in his <hi>Apology, Page</hi> 559, hath upon this Text the following Obſervations:</p>
            <p>
               <q>And truly the Words are ſo clear in themſelves, that (in my Judgment) they need no Illuſtration to explain their Senſe: For it is as eaſy to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the greateſt Contradictions, as theſe Laws of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with the wicked Practices of Wars; for they are plainly inconſiſtent. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can reconcile this, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> with <hi>Reſiſt Violence by Force:</hi> Again; <hi>Give alſo thy other Cheek,</hi> with <hi>Strike again:</hi> Alſo, <hi>Love thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> with <hi>Spoil them, make a Prey of them, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them with Fire and Sword:</hi> Or, <hi>Prey for thoſe that perſecute you, and thoſe that calumniate you,</hi> with <hi>Perſecute you by Fines, Impriſonments, and Death itſelf; and not only ſuch as do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, but who heartily ſeek and deſire your eternal and temporal Welfare.</hi> Whoever, I ſay, can find a Means to reconcile theſe Things, may be ſuppoſed alſo to have found a Way to reconcile <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Devil, Chriſt</hi> with <hi>Antichriſt, Light</hi> with <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> with <hi>Evil.</hi> But if this be impoſſible, as indeed it is, ſo will alſo the other be impoſſible; and Men do but deceive themſelves and others, while they boldly adventure to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſuch abſurd and impoſſible Things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The primitive Chriſtians thought themſelves bound to comply literally with theſe Precepts to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it is recorded in antient Hiſtory, that when their moſt bitter and ſevere Perſecutors have been ſick and afflicted, they have tended upon, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:006239_0045_10280072CA402928"/>wept around them with the Cordiality and Affection of Brethren, and have rejoiced in Opportunities of Serving and Aſſiſting them.</p>

And can we be imagined to exerciſe ſuch an Innocence and Purity of Life, if we did not believe there was a God who preſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over Mankind? No certainly: But being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced, that we ſhall one Day give an Account of our Lives and Actions to the great Creator of us, and all the World, we chuſe ſuch a gentle, meek, and GENERALLY DESPISED Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Life, aſſuring ourſelves that we can ſuffer no Evil from our Perſecutors, no, tho' it were the Loſs of our very Lives, which can be of any Value or Conſideration, when compared to that exceeding great Reward which God will give us hereafter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, Reader, were Diſciples, that inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing away the greateſt Part of the Force of their Maſter's Precepts, took up their Croſs, denied themſelves, and faithfully practiſed them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But here (ſaith the Sermon, <hi>Page</hi> 30.) it may be further Queried, How Killing of our Enemies is conſiſtent with Love to them? I anſwer, it is more conſiſtent, than Self Murder is with Love to ourſelves!</q>
            </p>
            <p>But are either of theſe Caſes in the leaſt Degree conſiſtent—Are they not rather as oppoſite as Eaſt to Weſt? A Man can never deſignedly injure what he really loves; and 'tis his Duty really and truly to love Enemies.—And Self-murder is not proved to be in any Shape a Conſequent of that Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Paragraph in <hi>Page</hi> 31, wherein the Sermon-Writer undertakes to prove, that no more is meant
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006239_0047_10280075932D12A8"/>by Chriſt's Command to love Enemies, than was enjoin'd under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſpenſation, is (in my Opinion) a Piece of Sophiſtry, and cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the Manner in which our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth this Doctrine—<hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour, and hate thine Enemy: But I ſay unto you, love your Enemies,</hi> &amp;c.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Matthew v. 43, 44.</note> And what is thus ſaid in a Note, <hi>Page</hi> 30, <q>It cannot be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that Chriſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth by this Doctrine, the Laws which the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> does not at all operate againſt thoſe who think War prohibited by the Goſpel; becauſe they do not think that Chriſt oppoſed the moral Law, but improved it, or ſhewed the beſt Way to fulfil it: Thus the moral Law obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to love their Neighbours, which was conſtrued to mean only thoſe of their own Nation, and that nothing in it prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited them from hating their Enemies: Our Lord therefore not only repeats that Command, but adds to it, <hi>Love your Enemies.</hi>—Now a Man who keeps the latter, muſt be ſuppoſed capable of Keeping the former. Upon this Subject <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marc.</hi> ſpeaks thus: <q>Chriſt truly teacheth a new Patience; even forbidding the Revenging of an Injury, which was permitted by the Creator—</q> And <hi>Lib. de pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien.</hi>

I have now gone through the Arguments uſed in the Sermon to prove the Lawfulneſs of War, I think I have not omitted any that are material, nor I hope done any Injuſtice to them. I have expreſs'd my Thoughts why they are not ſufficient for the Purpoſe for which they were intended, and ſhall take Leave of this Writer, with remarking the great Difference between his Muſing, mention'd in <hi>Page</hi> 36, and the Diſpoſition of a true Chriſtian: The latter is reſign'd in all Things; conſiders this Life as a State of Probation and Tryal; acknowledges an over-ruling Providence, who ſuperintends human Affairs; and can ſay, Come Life or come Death, thy Will, O God, be done—Whereas the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the utmoſt Surprize and Conſternation even at imaginary Dangers, and in his Fright ſeems to forget his Maker—The next Time he hears Great Guns go off, I would recommend to him the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the following Obſervations from <hi>John Weſley</hi>'s Journal, <hi>Page</hi> 67.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Finding the unaccountable Apprehenſions of I know not what Danger (the Wind being ſmall, and the Sea ſmooth) which had been upon me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days, increaſe; I cried earneſtly for Help; and it pleaſed God as in a Moment to reſtore Peace to my Soul. Let me obſerve hereon, 1. That not one of theſe Hours ought to paſs out of my Remembrance, till I attain another Manner of Spirit, a Spirit equally willing to glorify God by Life or by Death. 2. That whoever is uneaſy on any Account (bodily Pain alone excepted) carries in himſelf his own Conviction, that he is ſo far an Unbeliever. Is he uneaſy at the Apprehenſion of Death? Then he believeth not, <hi>That to die is Gain.</hi> At any of the Events of Life? Then he hath not a firm Belief, <hi>That all Things work together for his Good.</hi> And if he bring the Matter more cloſe,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006239_0050_102800811D5844A0"/>he will always find, beſide the general want of Faith, every particular Uneaſineſs is evidently ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the want of ſome particular Chriſtian Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would now offer ſomething further to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Reader.</p>
            <p>I think it is univerſally allowed that the Reign of Chriſt is deſcribed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in Chap. xi. where, among other Expreſſions which denotes that wherever it came to be truly received, it would produce Meekneſs, Humility and Peace, even in the rougheſt Tempers and Diſpoſitions of Men, he hath this, <hi>They ſhall not burt nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain; for the Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> Some of the antient Writers amongſt the primitive Chriſtians, as <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Theodoret, &amp;c.</hi> took the holy Mountain in this Prophecy to be ſpoken of the Church of Chriſt; and they appeal'd to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> whether they did not ſee and obſerve, by the Behaviour and Manners of the Chriſtians, a Fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thoſe glorious Prophecies: Such was then the Peaceableneſs and Innocency of their Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poole</hi> likewiſe ſays, the Mountain here means the Church, and adds, <q>Wherever the Goſpel comes and prevails, it will have this Effect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Prophet, in Chap. xxxv. ſpeaking of the Way of the Lord, ſays, <hi>No Lion ſhall be there, nor any ravenous Beaſt ſhall go up thereon; it ſhall not be found there, but the Redeemed ſhall walk there</hi> —And again confirms this, Chap. lxv. repeating, <hi>They ſhall not burt nor deſtroy in all my holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> ſpeaking of Goſpel-times, in Chap. ii. ſaith, Verſe 18. <hi>And in that Day will I make a Covenant for them, with the Beaſts of the Field, and with the Fowls of Heaven, and with the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006239_0051_10280082A4C65E20"/>creeping Things of the Ground; and I will break the Bow, and the Sword, and the Battle out of the Earth, and will make them to lie down ſafely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Poole</hi> upon this Verſe remarks, <q>It is a full and gracious Promiſe of Abundance of Peace, Safety, and Love among all through the Creation. But if brute Beaſts do not hurt, yet unleſs more brutiſh Creatures, bloody Men, be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>med, there will be little Safety to the Church; therefore God will put an End to Wars, and make Men peaceable in their Diſpoſitions, far more peaceable than heretofore they have been.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> in ſpeaking of the latter Days, uſes much the ſame Expreſſions with <hi>Iſaiah — And he ſhall judge among many People, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke ſtrong Nations afar off, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plowſhares, and their Spears into pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Hooks: Nation ſhall not lift up a Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more,</hi> Chap. iv. 3.</p>
            <p>Theſe Predictions, and ſome others of the like Tendency, together with the Examples and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians, that Obedience to the Goſpel had that Effect, not only to give them inward Peace, but to take away the Uſe of carnal Weapons, are very ſtrong and cogent Proofs, that War cannot be conſiſtent with the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Perfection of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>And here I would further obſerve, that when the Angel had appeared to the Shepherds, and declared the Birth of Chriſt—<hi>There was with the Angel a Multitude of the heavenly Hoſt, praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on Earth Peace, Good-will towards Men</hi>

I have already mentioned ſome of the Teſtimonies of the Antients on War, and it may not be improper to add a few more.

            <p>In the Time of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> (which was the Beginning of the third Century after Chriſt) Chriſtians were ſo far from Wars, that he teſtify'd, that they had no Marks or Signs of Violence among them, ſaying, <q>Neither are the Faces of Idols to be painted, which ſo much as to regard is forbidden, neither Sword, nor Bow, to them that follow Peace: As <hi>Sylvius Diſc. de Rev.

            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> (who wrote in the Beginning of the third Century) in his Anſwer to <hi>Celſus,</hi> a moſt virulent Adverſary, who had charged the Chriſtians with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to bear Arms, and to enter into military Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, writes thus
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Origines contra Celſum, Lib.</hi> 8. <hi>P.</hi> 426, <hi>Cantabrigiae Editio.</hi>

               <q>Laſtly, <hi>Celſus</hi> exhorts us, That we ſhould aſſiſt the Emperor with all our Might, and aid him in all his juſt Undertakings and Engagements, and when requiſite, bear Arms, and fight for him. To this we anſwer, that we do aſſiſt the Emperors, if I may ſo ſay, with a Divine Aid, having on us the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God; and this we do, in Obedience to the Words of the Apoſtle, who ſays, <hi>I exhort, therefore, firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks to be made for all Men; for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</hi> And by how much the more pious any Man is, by ſo much the more he lends Aſſiſtance to Emperors, yea more than they who ſtand in Battle Array, and cut down as many of the Enemy as they can. We may alſo reply to you, who are not of our Belief, and urge us to bear Arms and Fight; your own Prieſts, and thoſe who belong to your Temples, keep their Hands from being defil'd with Blood, by Reaſon of the Sacrifices they muſt offer with unbloody and unpolluted Hands, to thoſe you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem your Gods. And when you go to War, you never take any of the prieſtly Order for Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. If then you think that reaſonable, Why ſhould you not think it more ſo in thoſe, who, when others go out to fight, they, as Prieſts and Miniſters of God, lift up holy Hands, and wreſtle in Prayer with God, for them who fight in a juſt
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:006239_0054_1028008C902D47F8"/>Cauſe, and for the Emperor who reigns well, that God would be pleaſed to remove every Thing that, is againſt them? Therefore all evil Spirits, which ſtir up Sedition, break Treaties, and diſturb the publick Peace, being quaſh'd by our Prayers, we do greater Service to Emperors than thoſe who are for Fighting: And we labour for the common Good, by putting up Prayers in Holineſs; and by our religious Exerciſes and Practice, we teach how to deſpiſe and ſhun the pleaſing Baits of Sin. Thus we fight better than others for the Emperor: But ſhould he go about to compel us to Fight, or bear Arms under him, we cannot do it. <hi>Sic nos prae aliis pugnamus pro Imperatore: cum ipſo, licet nos impellat, non militamus.</hi>

            <p>This is a full and plain Declaration of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Practice of the Chriſtians—'Tis not <hi>Origen</hi>'s ſingle Opinion, but an Apology in Behalf of the Chriſtians in <hi>Origen</hi>'s Time; and they were then very numerous.</p>
            <p>And farther, to prove beyond all Contradiction, that it was held unlawful for a Chriſtian to bear Arms, and to fight, not only in the Days of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> but later down, even to the Emperor <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi>'s Time: I ſhall produce the Teſtimony of one <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who ſuffer'd Death under that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Reign, for refuſing to bear Arms.

            <p>The Reader has here a Teſtimony againſt bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms and Fighting, remarkable both for its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqeity, and the Tokens it bears of the Courage and Fortitude ſo conſpicuous in the primitive Chriſtians. —I ſhall conclude with a Quotation from a late Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>A modeſt Plea in Behalf of the People called Quakers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The more Men depend on their Creator for their own Preſervation, rather than do the leaſt Evil, the more will Divine Providence be exerted in their Favour, and a powerful Teſtimony be raiſed in the Hearts of others in Favour of the Innocent; it will be in vain to talk and preach about loving and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving our Enemies, unleſs we ſhew the World by
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006239_0058_10280097B96E87A8"/>uniform Practice in what high Examation we hold the Laws of Chriſt and his holy Example: And he who to a righteous Life, and a meek Spirit, annexes (rather than do the leaſt Evil) a firm Reliance on Providence, will never be miſtaken in the End, but find a full and gracious Repay; Men may indeed deviſe very innocent Means fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their own Safety, but this is nothing to what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is able to do for his People. <hi>Jacob</hi> after a long Abſence from his Brother, and great Fear of falling by the Hand of Revenge, very wiſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a Preſent to appeaſe his angry Brother; but it looks to me, as if the Lord his God, whoſe Providence had all along awaited his Servant <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> had been beforehand with <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſoften'd his hard and rugged Spirit, that ſought Revenge, into a quite contrary Temper of Compaſſion and Brotherly Love—And there is one Thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in reſpect to our Teſtimony againſt Fighting, that as we all of this Society profeſs to be led and guided by the divine Spirit, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be hard to find a ſingle Perſon who can truly aver a Licence to fight, was ever in his own Mind reconcilable with a ſtrict and devout Adherence to this inward Monitor: And I intreat our younger Brethren to conſider, that ſeveral of our former Friends were, without conſulting each other, brought in this Reſpect into a perfect Uniformity of Sentiment.
