            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The title of this book led us to think that it did not belong to our department. But as it was ſent to us for our opinion of its merits, we thought it only juſtice to give it a reading, and we muſt acknowledge we were very much pleaſed with it. Whatever engages the youthful mind, and at the ſame time inculcates the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion or morality, deſerves no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhare of praiſe. In theſe the author has ſucceeded; and ſhe has rendered her work ſo intereſting, that we found it difficult to lay the book aſide till we had got through it. Her plan of improving the minds of young people in uſeful branches of education, unites pleaſure with inſtruction. And it deſerves our notice, that whatever tends to inſpire with a contempt for what is frivolous, and to give the mind a taſte for rational pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, promotes the intereſts of Chriſtianity. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this character may be juſtly viewed as the handmaid of religion, endeavouring to bring the gay, the giddy, and thoughtleſs, within the reach of her divine and enchanting voice. This may be truly aſſerted in the preſent caſe, as we find, along with the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of uſeful knowledge, well-directed efforts to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vicious habits and propenſities, and to point out the beauty and excellence of virtuous diſpoſitions and actions.</p>

            <head>Amuſement Hall, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AMUSEMENT HALL, though not a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perb, is a handſome ſtructure, ſituated in a delightful ſpot, on a riſing ground, commanding a pleaſing view of the road and adjacent country. The ſurrounding hills are interſperſed with hanging woods and ſhady groves, the manſions of the opulent, and the cottages of the poor: thus is the eye gratified with an extenſive proſpect, while the diverſified ſcenes that it exhibits, afford ample materials for contemplation to a reflecting mind. The furniture of the houſe is elegantly neat; the library, though not large, contains many valuable productions. Mrs. Smith, the proprietor of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is deſcended from an ancient family: ſhe poſſeſſes this eſtate in her own right, beſides an ample fortune left her by Mr. Smith. She is generous, though not profuſe; no object of diſtreſs is paſſed by unnoticed; ſhe diſtributes not her bounty through the hands of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but viſits the cottages herſelf, and relieves them that are in want, according to their various neceſſities. As induſtry leads to happineſs, ſhe finds the Poor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment ſuited to their abilities: there are none idle in the village; the children are employed according to their different ages, and are taught to read and write
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029987_0004_0FE3B59759E37CB8"/>
under her own inſpection. Her company is ſought by the lovers of literature: her converſation is eaſy and unaffected; ſhe ſeeks not to kill time, but to improve it, and therefore never finds it hang heavy on her hands. By the cheerfulneſs of her temper, her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is made apparent to all; even thoſe, who follow a round of folly and diſſipation, approve of her conduct, though they have not reſolution to imitate it.</p>
            <p>Her ſiſter, Mrs. Denew, is alſo a very amiable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and has the happineſs of being united to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gentleman, whoſe manners and diſpoſition accord with her own. They are bleſſed with ſeveral children. Amelia, the eldeſt daughter, poſſeſſes every advantage which can be derived from education, good ſenſe, and and an amiable diſpoſition. She was about ten years of age at the period, to which this little hiſtory refers, and had juſt obtained permiſſion of her papa and mamma to pay a viſit to her aunt at Amuſement Hall, which was about twenty miles from Mr. Denew's.</p>
            <p>Upon Amelia's arrival, the following converſation took place:</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>I am glad to ſee you, my dear, again at Amuſement Hall; I hope your mamma will give you leave to ſpend ſome months with me.</p>

               <speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>

                  </gap> your indulgence would ſpoil me; but when I returned home, my papa and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029987_0005_0FE34DD15B96D9D8"/>
mamma were both pleaſed to find me ſo much improved, and ſaid, if my aunt requeſted it, my viſit ſhould be longer next time. When your letter came, I jumped for joy; my brothers and ſiſters cried, "Pray, mamma, let me go—pray, mamma, let me go." Mamma told them, that they muſt ſtay till they were old enough to leave the nurſery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>My dear, it is time you ſhould have ſome refreſhment after your journey; juſt touch the bell, that I may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tea. How does your little friend Miſs Laura do?</p>

               <speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
               <p>She was almoſt wild when I told her I had an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Amuſement Hall, and teazed her papa every day to let her come with me. He told her he could not take the liberty to ſend ſuch an ungovernable rude girl to you, eſpecially without an invitation. When I took leave of her, ſhe cried ſo, I thought the poor creature would have broken her heart; but indeed, aunt, ſhe always does ſo when ſhe can't have her own way: her papa is ſo good, that he does n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>But, my dear child, is not more to your advantage for your friends to ſee your faults, than for others, who might make the ſame remarks on you, as you do on Miſs Laura? It is in love to you that your parents admoniſh and correct you, that you may appear amiable in the eyes of the world; and when you attend to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and reproofs, it endears you the more to them: were your mamma to leave you to do and ſay what you pleaſe, I fear you would be as unhappy as Miſs Lloyd, who, if under proper government, might, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, equal, if not exceed, my dear Amelia. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>I believe ſhe is a few months older.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith received, by return of poſt, a very polite letter of thanks from Mr. Lloyd, accepting the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expreſſing the mortification he felt in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to accompany his daughter, as he was about to ſet off on a journey of ſome weeks, but would ſend her the next day.</p>
               <p>Amelia, impatient to ſee her little friend, was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the window when Mr. Lloyd's carriage arrived. She flew to receive her, and, on introducing Miſs Lloyd to her aunt, ſaid, "Now, madam, you have made me happy, for I do love Laura."</p>

               <p>Laura's grief is occaſioned by my anſwers to her enquiries concerning our amuſements. When I told her the morning was to be ſpent in working and reading, ſhe burſt out a crying, and ſaid ſhe ſhould with herſelf at home again.</p>

               <p>Indeed, my dear Laura, you are miſtaken; I ſhould think a day very tedious, in which I did not do any work; beſides, you cannot think what pleaſure I find in working with my mamma: you would have thought I was well repaid, had you ſeen how pleaſed my papa was with the firſt ſhirt I finiſhed; he ſaid he ſhould ever look on it with pleaſure, as his dear Amelia's little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>I don't like your gardener, madam: my papa would have turned his away, were he as idle as your's: look at this piece of ground! ſee how it lies all in diſorder, and covered over with weeds! it ſpoils the view of the whole garden; for it ſtrikes one's attention the moment one enters.</p>

at this bed; but, by my orders, left it in the ſtate in which you now ſee it. I was in hopes it might afford a uſeful leſſon to Miſs Lloyd, and it gives me pleaſure to find it has ſtruck you juſt as I wiſhed it ſhould. I have known you from your infancy; and with concern per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that to this hour your mind has continued uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, as the piece of ground before you. Your exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior form attracts our attention; and you are bleſſed with a large ſhare of vivacity: from ſuch an appearance we have much to expect: but I am ſorry to ſay it, the prevailing qualities of your mind are ſo many moral weeds; and you muſt not wonder if they are ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſeverely cenſured. We are apt to paſs by a hundred beauties unnoticed, if but one ſtriking defect appears, as you have juſt now done. My gardener has taken peculiar care of the ſurrounding beds; obſerve the order in which they lie, and the various flowers that adorn them; all theſe you paſſed by unnoticed, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that this uncultivated plat ſpoils the whole. So it is, my dear, with young ladies, however pretty they may think themſelves, if their minds are uncultivated, and unadorned with uſeful knowledge.</p>

               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt not be diſcouraged, if you meet with a few difficulties, which Amelia did not, having been led in the paths of knowledge from her infancy. What ſay you to being of our party to-morrow morning?</p>

               <p>It was Rover that did it; he played very prettily for ſome time with me in the pleaſure-ground; but when we came by the fiſh ponds he jumped in: when he came out, he ran and rolled himſelf in the duſt, and then jumped upon me.

and beat him; upon which he ſeized on my frock, and tore it; I endeavoured to get rid of him, but he ſtill kept his hold.

I told her I never would ſubmit to aſk Molly's pardon. She ſaid, I am ſorry to hear you ſay ſo, Miſs; you had much better do it at firſt, for you muſt at laſt, as my miſtreſs never retracts her word. I replied, I'll fret and cry, and then Mrs. Smith will let me come down into the parlour, leſt I ſhould be ſick. No, Miſs, ſaid ſhe, you are quite miſtaken, if you think to gain any thing by that; for my miſtreſs would order you to have water-gruel, and be put to bed: I told her I could never bear that: then it will be very eaſy for you, Miſs, to aſk Molly to forgive your ſtriking her. She then left me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with Molly, who ſaid, I am come, Miſs Lloyd, to aſk your pardon for being ſo rude as to laugh at you. I ſtarted up, No, Molly, it is I that ought to aſk your pardon for ſtriking you, and I do it ſincerely.</p>
               <p>I ſhall always have an eſteem both for Molly and Nanny for their kindneſs to me; and now, madam, if I obtain your forgiveneſs, I ſhall be quite happy again.</p>

               <p>I am perſuaded it is for want of attention, rather than of memory: accuſtom yourſelf to think while you read, and what you read will faſten on your memory. Amelia imbibed this habit very early, ſo that it is no difficulty to her. I would wiſh you to adopt the ſentiment of the two following lines:
<q>

                     <l>Unweary'd diligence your point will gain.</l>

In the afternoon Amelia repeated the following ſtory out of Hume's Hiſtory of England:</p>
               <p>Edward the third, when he retook Calais, after a ſhameful revolt, was ſo incenſed, that he was determined to take exemplary vengeance on the inhabitants, and would not receive the town on any conditions which ſhould confine him in the puniſhment of thoſe offenders. Edward was at laſt perſuaded to more moderation, and inſiſted on ſix of the moſt eminent citizens being ſent to him, to his camp, with the keys of the city, bareheaded, and barefooted, with ropes about their necks; and on theſe conditions he promiſed to ſpare the lives of all the remainder.</p>
               <p>When this intelligence was conveyed to Calais, there was a general conſternation. To ſacrifice ſix of their fellow-citizens to certain deſtruction, when they had all ſignalized their valour in a common cauſe, appeared to them more ſevere than that general puniſhment they were before threatened with; and they were irreſolute in ſo cruel and diſtreſſing a ſituation: at laſt one of the principal inhabitants, called Euſtace de St. Pierre, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth, declaring himſelf willing to encounter death, to ſave his friends and companions: animated by his example, another made a like generous offer, and a third and fourth, till the whole number was completed. Theſe ſix brave men, with ropes about their necks, thus appearing like malefactors, laid the keys of the city at Edward's feet, who ordered them to execution.</p>

               <p>But the intreaties of his Queen Phillippa ſaved his memory from that infamy: ſhe threw herſelf on her knees before Edward, and, with tears in her eyes, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the lives of theſe citizens. Having obtained her requeſt, ſhe conducted them into her tent, ordered a repaſt to be ſet before them, and, after making them a preſent of money and clothes, diſmiſſed them in ſafety.</p>

               <p>A good temper is one of the principal ingredients of happineſs: this, it is ſaid, is born with us, and ſo in a great meaſure it is; yet often-times it may be acquired by art, and always improved by culture: almoſt every object that attracts our notice, has its bright and its dark ſide. He that habituates himſelf to look to the diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide, will ſour his diſpoſition, and conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his happineſs; while he, who conſtantly looks on the bright ſide, inſenſibly meliorates his temper, and, in conſequence, improves his own happineſs, and that of all about him.</p>
               <p>Arachne and Meliſſa are two friends, both women in years, and alike in birth, fortune, education, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. They were originally alike in temper too; but by different management are grown the reverſe of each other. Arachne has accuſtomed herſelf to look on the dark ſide of every object. If you ſhew her a new publication, ſhe ſlightly ſkims over the paſſages that would give her pleaſure, and dwells only on thoſe that fill her with diſlike. Her garden is a very delightful one; but if you take a walk with her in it, ſhe talks of nothing but blights and ſtorms, of ſnails and caterpillars.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029987_0019_0FE34DC95026F2E0"/>
If you ſit down with her in the temples to enjoy a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proſpect, ſhe obſerves to you, that there is too much wood, or too little water; that the day is too ſunny, or too gloomy; that it is ſultry or windy; and finiſhes with a long harangue upon the wretchedneſs of our climate. In company ſhe caſts a gloom over all, by giving you the hiſtory of her own bad health, or of ſome melancholy accident that befel one of her daughter's children. Thus ſhe inſenſibly ſinks her own ſpirits, and the ſpirits of all around her, and at laſt diſcovers, ſhe knows not why, that her friends are grave.</p>
               <p>Meliſſa is the reverſe of all this: ſhe is cheerful herſelf, and communicates it to all about her. If any misfortune has befallen her, ſhe conſiders it might have been worſe, and is thankful to Providence for an eſcape. She opens every book with a deſire to be entertained and inſtructed, and, therefore ſeldom miſſes what ſhe looks for. Walk with her, though it be but on a heath or common, and ſhe will diſcover numberleſs beauties, unobſerved before, in the hills, the dales, the broom, the brakes, and the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated flowers of weeds and poppies. She enjoys every change of weather and of ſeaſon, as bringing ſomething of health or convenience. In converſation, it is a rule with her never to ſtart a ſubject that leads to any thing gloomy or diſagreeable; you, therefore, never hear her repeating her own grievances, or thoſe of her neighbours, or (what is worſt of all) their faults and imperfections. Thus Meliſſa, like the Bee, gathers honey from every weed; while Arachne, like the Spider, ſucks poiſon from the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029987_0020_0FE3B5DAC78E3FF8"/>
faireſt flowers: the conſequence is, that of two tempers, once nearly allied, the one is for ever ſour and diſſatisfied, and the other always cheerful.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
               <p>Auguſtus, who was prone to anger, got the following leſſon from Athenodorus, the philoſopher: That as ſoon as he ſhould feel the firſt emotions of anger, he ſhould repeat deliberately all the letters of the alphabet; for, that anger was eaſily prevented, but not eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. To repreſs anger, it is a good method to turn the injury into a jeſt. Socrates having received a blow on the head, obſerved that it would be well if people knew when to put on a helmet. Another time, being attacked with opprobrious language, he calmly obſerved, that the man was not yet taught to ſpeak reſpectfully.</p>

               <p>This was likely to have a better effect than puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have had; for the wiſeſt of men ſays, "a ſoft anſwer will turn away wrath."

               <p>There is no difference at all in our birth: were the infant of a rich man, and the infant of a poor man, to be dreſſed in the ſame manner, and laid on the ſame bed, you would not know the one from the other; and were I to ſay to you, Now, Laura, point me out the child of the poor, I ſhould impoſe a taſk on you, which I am ſure you would be utterly unable to perform;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:029987_0030_0FE3B60641CFC2A8"/>
for the gifts of nature are equal. The difference of our perſons and manners ariſes ſolely from education; if any one of the women now in the field had, from her infancy, been brought up with all the delicacy of the fine lady, ſhe would have had the ſame languors, and be as ſoon fatigued.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould think not, if I may judge from what I have been witneſs to. I have ſeen the fine lady diſcontented with every thing; this was a miſery! and the other was a miſery: and ſhe was ſurrounded with miſeries!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
               <p>Then ſhe was miſerable without a cauſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>It was entirely owing to peeviſhneſs and laſſitude, ariſing from the want of exerciſe and employment. The poor have none of theſe artificial miſeries; if they have food to eat, though coarſe, they enjoy it; for exerciſe carries off thoſe ridiculous vapours, which deſtroy the appetite, and create endleſs complainings.</p>

               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>No; but we muſt expect to enjoy more or leſs health and ſpirits, as we uſe or neglect proper exerciſe; at any rate, we ought always to be employed. The diſtribution of happineſs is much more equal than we in general imagine; for it does not conſiſt in what we poſſeſs, but in the diſpoſition of mind with which we poſſeſs it.</p>
               <p>In this book, which I have juſt been reading, I have found a great, though poor man, and his views of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty ſtrengthen what I have ſaid, that happineſs is more equally diſpenſed than we are apt to imagine.</p>

               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>He was a Roman citizen; and being a virtuous ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, he was often employed in ſtate affairs. At this time, he was ſent as an Ambaſſador, with others, to Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, then at war with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, to treat with him for the ranſoming of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, who honourably entertained them, and ſent the priſoners back to Rome without any ranſom. Pyrrhus, admiring Fabricius, and underſtanding he was poor, endeavoured to win him over, by making him conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offers, which were rejected by Fabricius with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>

               <speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
               <p>But if he was poor, how did he ſupport the dignity of an Ambaſſador?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>While he was employed in the ſtate, they provided him with all neceſſaries ſuitable to the ſituation he was in; but I will read you part of his ſpeech to Pyrrhus: "It would be needleſs (ſaid Fabricius) for me to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the experience I have had in ſtate affairs, as well as in thoſe of a private nature, ſince you have been told theſe things by others. You alſo ſeem to be ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of my poverty, that there will be no occaſion for me to acquaint you, that I have neither money to put out to intereſt, nor ſlaves to produce me any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; all my wealth conſiſting of a little houſe, and a ſmall field, which yields ſufficient for my ſubſiſtence. Though I am not poſſeſſed of a conſiderable eſtate, I never thought, nor can yet think, my poverty ever did me the leaſt injury. With regard to my fortune, ſo far from repining at it, I look upon myſelf as the happieſt of men, when I compare my condition with that of the rich; and I even feel, on this occaſion, a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and pride. My little field, though not over fruitful, furniſhes me ſufficiently with all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, provided I do but beſtow the proper culture, and preſerve the produce of it. Do I need any thing more? All food, when ſeaſoned by hunger is agreeable to me. When I am parched with thirſt, it is luxury to quench it; and when I am fatigued, I take the ſweets of ſleep
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:029987_0033_0FE3B61363A050C8"/>
with exquiſite pleaſure; I content myſelf with a ſuit that ſhelters me from the inclemency of the weather; and, among the ſeveral moveables, which may be of the like uſe, the meaneſt always ſuits me beſt.</p>
               <p>"It would be unjuſt in me to accuſe fortune, ſince ſhe furniſhes me with all that nature requires. It is, indeed true, that for want of this affluence, I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented aſſiſting the neceſſitous, which is the only advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for which the opulent may juſtly be envied. Even with my little, I aſſiſt where that little can be of uſe, and I do my fellow citizens all the ſervice in my power."</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>SICK LADY.</speaker>
               <p>Your kindneſs, madam, demands all the ſatisfaction in my power to give you. My father was a man of large fortune; his name was Brown: I was his only child. My mother died when I was very young. My father ſpared no pains or expence in my education; his love for me was great; and not any young perſon could be happier than I was, till I ſaw Captain Smith, who gained my affections; but my father would not conſent to the union. The Captain perſuaded me to riſk my father's diſpleaſure, and become his, telling me, when once we were married, I ſhould ſoon be received into favour again;—that as I was his only child, he could not do otherwiſe. The moment I forſook my dear father's houſe, all happineſs fled. My father declared he would never ſee me again, and nothing could alter his determination. My huſband, when he found that my father would by no means be reconciled, ſlighted and neglected me, declaring he only married me for my fortune; and though I was young and handſome, his pleaſures were not to be confined, and that he wanted my fortune to purſue them; but, ſince he had loſt his aim, he cared not how ſoon he got rid of me. Ah, madam! you will eaſily conceive what my feelings muſt
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029987_0038_0FE3B6290E6EA808"/>
be, to hear ſuch a declaration from the man I loved, and had forſaken all for! I ſpent moſt of my time alone: books were my chief amuſement; and the educating of my dear children beguiled many an hour: but the keen reflection of my diſobedience to my dear father, was the bittereſt ingredient in my bitter lot: had I followed his advice, I had ſtill been happy. He knew the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the man I married better than I did, and all he told me has ſince proved true; but I could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to think, that a man, who manifeſted ſuch polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, attention, and tenderneſs, could ever alter.</p>
               <p>The laſt letter I wrote to my dear father, for I ſtill love him, and could I ever have thought that he would never more have ſeen his dear Eliza, as he uſed to call me, not any thing would have tempted me from him; but I thought, as moſt young people do, that his love for me would overcome his anger: the laſt letter I wrote to him was on the birth of my dear William, now three years old; but it is impoſſible to deſcribe the anguiſh I felt, when I received his anſwer, which was to this effect:—That he had a daughter, a once dearly beloved daughter, who had torn herſelf away from him; he had found it very hard to forget her; his houſe, his gardens were a deſart without her, and though years had elapſed ſince her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he was ſtill ſolitary: he heard, from various perſons, that his once beloved child was miſerable, and that the Captain had avowed that he treated his wife ill, in hopes to haſten the old fellow her father's death, that he might get poſſeſſion of his fortune. As that was the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029987_0039_0FE3B62DE71084D0"/>
caſe, he intended to cut off all his expectations; he was upon the point of ſelling his eſtates, and leaving Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that he might, in a foreign land, forget all that was dear to him in his native country;—as for her children, he never wiſhed to ſee them; they had a father to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them.—I fainted with the letter in my hand. My cruel huſband entered at that moment, read the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and rouſed me by his ſtorming and raving; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to leave me, and the children, and flew out of the room.

               <p>My ſtrength, my dear madam, will not permit me to enter into a detail of the ill treatment I met with, till within a month of his death. One day he came to me, and ſaid, he had been the baſeſt of men to one of the beſt of women, but it would never be in his power to make me amends;—That he muſt leave me for a time, and perhaps ſhould never ſee me more, as he was going on a ſecret and dangerous expedition; but if he ſhould return he would not treat me as he had done;—he was now ſtung to his very ſoul, to think he had driven my father from me. He then ſaid, "My Eliza, take this," (which was a note of 100 l.) it is all that is left of your uncle's legacy: then embracing me and the children, with tears in his eyes, left the room, and I never ſaw him more. The next news I heard was, that on his arrival on the continent, he was taken ill of a fever,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029987_0040_0FE3B6331845A750"/>
and was carried off in a few days. Thus was I left in accumulated diſtreſs: the lodgings I was in were ready furniſhed, and expenſive: at the end of ſix weeks I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed my ſervant, quitted my lodging, and came to this cottage, where my Eliza was nurſed.

               <p>The Captain's father was a man of fortune, lived at—, in Suffolk, left his eſtate to his ſon William, his only ſurviving child: he ſold the eſtate, and entered into the army; and it was not long before he ran through the whole, when he thought to retrieve his affairs by my fortune. He ſometimes mentioned a firſt couſin of his father's, whoſe name was Harvey Smith;—that he had ſeen him when he was a child; but whether he was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or dead, he could not tell.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Smith left the room, and went to the children. Eliza, on ſeeing her, enquired how her mamma did.

               <p>No, madam; the firſt time I ſaw her was when the Captain was at our county town with part of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we uſed to ſupply them with fruit. Mrs. Smith took a liking to me, and being diſtreſſed for a wet-nurſe, aſked me to take Miſs Eliza. Ah! when I brought the dear little infant home, little did I think her mamma would die at my houſe! Indeed, who ſhould ever have thought ſuch a lady could ever condeſcend to be in two ſuch ſmall rooms! though to be ſure they are neat and clean. When ſhe came, I was quite ſurpriſed to ſee her ſo ill, and offered to go and take lodgings in the town for her, for I was ſure mine were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029987_0045_0FE3B6486BCD8BF8"/>
and the ſituation of my houſe would contribute, if any thing could, to reſtore her to health. I was ſurpriſed ſhe did not bring a ſervant with her, but ſhe was of ſuch a ſweet temper, that ſhe was pleaſed with every thing I did for her.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe was interrupted by the return of John, who informed his miſtreſs the coach was at the gate.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith took an affectionate leave of the children, promiſing to ſee them the next day.</p>
               <p>As they were riding home, Mrs. Smith aſked Laura if ſhe felt any regret that the rain had ſent them to the cottage.</p>

               <p>They made us feel for them, they were ſo diſtreſſed: when you was up ſtairs, they ſaid, if their mamma died, they ſhould have nobody to take care of them: but I was quite rejoiced, aunt, when you ſaid you would take them; for I begin to love them already.</p>

               <speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
               <p>You are very generous, Amelia; but perhaps you do not think of the conſequences. Your aunt's love will then be more divided.</p>

               <speaker>AMELIA.</speaker>
               <p>I eſteem the affection of my friends as my greateſt treaſure; at firſt, I own, I felt hurt, and thought my aunt would give us all up for theſe ſtrangers. (I hope, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029987_0046_0FE3B64CB83E4120"/>
you will pardon this ungenerous thought.) A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle recollection brought right ideas to my mind. I put myſelf in their place, deſtitute of father, mother, or friend, and every ſelfiſh motive vaniſhed. I was then willing they ſhould ſhare in your affections.</p>

               <p>Dionyſius the Elder was a prince of great political and military abilities, and had occaſion for them all, in raiſing himſelf, as he did, from a mean condition to ſo high a rank. After having held the ſovereignty thirty-eight years, he tranſmitted it peaceably to a ſucceſſor of his own election, and had eſtabliſhed his power upon ſuch ſolid foundations, that his ſon, notwithſtanding the ſlenderneſs of his capacity for governing, retained it twelve years after his death; all which could not have been effected without a great fund of merit as to his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. But what qualities could cover his vices, which rendered him the object of his ſubjects abhorrence? His ambition knew neither law nor limitation; his
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029987_0049_0FE3B6599DDA6908"/>
cruelty had often no regard to the affinity of blood; his avarice ſpared nothing, not even the moſt ſacred places; and his open and profeſſed impiety only acknowledged the Divinity to inſult him.</p>
               <p>The amazing precautions that Dionyſius thought neceſſary to the ſecurity of his life, ſhews to what anxiety and apprehenſion he was abandoned. He wore under his robe a cuiraſs of braſs. He never harangued the people but from the top of a high tower, and thought proper to make himſelf invulnerable by being inacceſſible. Not daring to confide in any of his friends or relations, his guard was compoſed of ſlaves and ſtrangers. He went abroad as little as poſſible, fear obliging him to condemn himſelf to a kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. Theſe extraordinary precautions regarded, without doubt, certain intervals of his reign, when fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſpiracies againſt him, rendered him more timid and ſuſpicious than uſual; at other times we have ſeen that he converſed freely enough with the people, and was acceſſible even to familiarity. In thoſe dark days of diſtruſt and fear, he fancied that he ſaw all mankind in arms againſt him. He never went into the chamber of his wives at night, till they had been firſt ſearched with the utmoſt care and circumſpection. His bed was ſurrounded with a very broad and deep trench, with a ſmall draw-bridge over, for the entrance. After having locked and bolted the doors of his apartment, he drew up the bridge, that he might ſleep in ſecurity. Neither his brother, nor even his ſons, could be admitted
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:029987_0050_0FE3B65E796A5570"/>
into his chamber, without changing their clothes, and being viſited by the guards.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of his greatneſs, poſſeſſed of riches, and ſurrounded with pleaſures of every kind, during a reign of almoſt forty years, notwithſtanding all his preſents and profuſion, he never was capable of making a ſingle friend. He paſſed his life with none but trembling ſlaves and ſordid flatterers, and never taſted the joy of loving, or being beloved, nor the charms of ſocial truth, and reciprocal confidence. This he owns himſelf.</p>

The moſt beautiful ſlaves, in the moſt ſplendid habits, ſtood around, watching the leaſt ſignal to ſerve him. The moſt exquiſite eſſences and perfumes had not been ſpared. The table was ſpread with proportionate magnificence. Damocles was all joy, and looked upon himſelf as the happieſt man in the world, when, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately caſting up his eyes, he beheld, over his head the point of a ſword, which hung from the roof only by a ſingle horſe-hair. He was immediately ſeized with a cold ſweat; every thing diſappeared in an inſtant; he could ſee nothing but the ſword, nor think of any thing but his danger. In the height of his fear, he deſired permiſſion to retire, and declared if this was happineſs, he would be happy no more.</p>

                  <hi>(reads.)</hi> Cyrus did not think a man worthy to reign over others, unleſs he was more wiſe and virtuous than thoſe he governed: he was alſo perſuaded that the ſureſt means for a prince to gain the reſpect of his courtiers, and of ſuch as approached his perſon, was to have ſo much regard for them, as never to do, or ſay any thing before
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029987_0052_0FE3B667B25E3210"/>
them, contrary to the rules of decency and good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Liberality he looked upon as a virtue truly loyal; nor did he think there was any thing great or valuable in riches, but the pleaſure of diſtributing them to others. "I have prodigious riches (ſays he to his courtiers) I own, and I am glad the world knows it; but you may aſſure yourſelves they are as much yours as mine. For to what end ſhould I heap up wealth? For my own uſe, and to conſume it myſelf? That would be impoſſible, if I deſired it. No: the chief end I aim at, is to have it in my power to reward thoſe who ſerve the public faithfully, and to ſuccour and relieve thoſe that will acquaint me with their wants and neceſſities."</p>
               <p>Croeſus one day repreſented to him, that by continual giving, he would at laſt make himſelf poor; whereas he might have amaſſed infinite treaſures, and have been the richeſt prince in the world. "And to what ſum (replied Cyrus) do you think thoſe treaſures might have amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?" Croeſus named a certain ſum, which was immenſely great. Cyrus thereupon ordered a little note to be writ to the lords of his court, in which it was ſignified to them that he had occaſion for money. Immediately a much larger ſum was brought to him than Croeſus had mentioned. "Look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>s I keep my riches in, are the hearts of my ſubjects."</p>
               <p>But as much as he eſteemed liberality, he ſtill laid greater ſtreſs upon kindneſs and condeſcenſion, affability
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029987_0053_0FE3B66D78A15080"/>
and humanity, which are qualities ſtill more engaging, and more apt to acquire the affection of a people, which is properly to reign. For a prince to be more generous than others in giving, when he is infinitely more rich than they, has nothing in it ſo ſurpriſing or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as to deſcend, in a manner from the throne, and to put himſelf upon a level with his ſubjects.

               <p>It was about thoſe great creatures the Elephants, who are ſaid to be from ſeven to fifteen feet high: but what pleaſed me moſt was, that they have trunks, formed of many rings, ſo that they can turn them about as they pleaſe, can even take up a halfpenny, or a glove, and give it to the owner, as I was informed by a lady, who ſaw it.</p>

               <p>The eyes are extremely ſmall, the legs ſhort, and the tail like that of a hog; in the upper jaw are two tuſks, of ſix or ſeven feet long, from which we obtain our ivory. When united in droves, and enraged, it would require an army to repel them. They were formerly uſed in battle, to carry towers with ſoldiers in them. They ſleep ſtanding, and have been known to live from 120 to 130 years.</p>

               <p>I will tell you, madam, what I heard of the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an elephant. A drove uſed to go daily to water; and a woman that ſold greens particularly noticed one, and conſtantly gave it ſomething from her ſtall, as it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. One day, as they were returning from the water, the woman having left her little child, it had fallen off the ſtall into the road, and would have been trodden to death, if it had not been for the elephant, whom the woman uſed to feed, who ſaw the child, and carefully took it up with its trunk, and laid it on the ſtall.</p>

               <p>What my ſiſter has related reminds me of one, who took a laughable revenge on ſome taylors, who were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at work with the windows open. An elephant put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his trunk into the window, the taylors pricked the end of it with their needles; the elephant went down to the river, and filled his trunk full of water (which they ſay will contain near a pail full) and came and poured it upon the taylors, to the amuſement of all that ſaw it.</p>

               <p>The inhabitants of a great town offered Marſhal de Turenne 100,000 crowns, upon condition he would take another road, and not march his troops their way. He anſwered them, "as your town is not in the road I intended to march, I cannot accept the money you offer me."</p>

               <p>Yes, madam, about a curious cotton tree, from which our cotton clothing is derived. There are three ſorts; one creeps on the earth like a vine; the ſecond is thick, like a buſhy dwarf-tree; and the third is tall, as an oak: all the three, after they have produced very beautiful flowers, are loaded with a fruit as large as a walnut, and whoſe outward coat is entirely black. This fruit when it is fully ripe, opens and diſcovers a down extremely white, which is called cotton. The ſeeds are ſeparated from the cotton by a mill; the cotton is afterwards ſpun, and prepared for all ſorts of fine works, ſuch as ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, waiſtcoats, quilts, and conveniences of various kinds.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>(reads.)</hi> The king of Armenia, who was vaſſal to the Medes, looking upon them as ready to be ſwallowed up by the formidable league formed againſt them, thought fit to lay hold on this occaſion to ſhake off their yoke.</p>
               <p>Accordingly he refuſed to pay them the ordinary tribute, and to ſend them the number of troops he was obliged to furniſh in time of war.</p>
               <p>This highly embarraſſed Cyaxares (who was uncle to Cyrus): at this juncture he was afraid of bringing new enemies upon his hands, if he undertook to compel the Armenians to execute their treaty; but Cyrus, having informed himſelf exactly of the ſtrength and ſituation of the country, undertook the affair. The important point was to keep his deſign ſecret, without which he was not likely to ſucceed: he therefore appointed a great hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing match on that ſide of the country; for it was his cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to ride out that way, and frequently hunt with the king's ſon, and the young noblemen of Armenia.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:029987_0066_0FE3B6AAAEF57818"/>
On the day appointed he ſet out with a numerous retinue. The troops followed at a diſtance, and were not to appear till a ſignal was given. After ſome days hunting, when they were come pretty near the palace where the court reſided, Cyrus communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to his officers, and ſent Chryſanthes with a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ordering them to make themſelves maſters of a certain ſteep eminence, where he knew the king uſed to retire, in caſe of an alarm, with his family and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <p>This being done, he ſends a herald to the king of Armenia, to ſummon him to perform the treaty, and in the mean time ordered his troops to advance. Never was court in greater ſurpriſe and perplexity. The king was conſcious of the wrong he had done, and was not in a condition to ſupport it; however, he did what he could to aſſemble his forces together from all quarters,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029987_0067_0FE3B6AFD361A798"/>
and in the mean time diſpatched his youngeſt ſon, called Sabaris, into the mountains, with his wives, his daughters, and whatever was moſt precious and valuable; but when he was informed by his ſcouts, that Cyrus was coming upon his heels, he entirely loſt all courage, and all thoughts of making a defence. The Armenians, following his example, ran away, every one where he could, to ſecure what was deareſt to him.</p>
               <p>Cyrus, ſeeing the country covered with people, that were endeavouring to make their eſcape, ſent them word that no harm ſhould be done them, if they ſtaid in their houſes; but that as many as were taken running away ſhould be treated as enemies. This made them all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their habitations, excepting a few that followed the king.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, they that were conducting the princeſſes to the mountains fell into the ambuſh Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanthes had laid for them, and were moſt of them taken priſoners. The queen, the king's ſon, his daughters, his eldeſt ſon's wife, and his treaſures, all fell into the hands of the Perſians.</p>
               <p>The king, hearing this melancholy news, and not knowing what courſe to take, retired to a little eminence where he was preſently inveſted by the Perſian army, and obliged to ſurrender. Cyrus ordered him, with all his family, to be brought into the midſt of the army. At that very inſtant arrived Tigranes, the king's eldeſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029987_0068_0FE3B6B45A925670"/>
ſon, who was juſt returned from a journey. At ſo moving a ſpectacle he could not forbear weeping. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, addreſſing himſelf to him, ſaid, <q>Prince, you are come very ſeaſonably to be preſent at the trial of your father.</q> And immediately he aſſembled the captains of the Perſians and Medes, and called in alſo the great men of Armenia; nor did he exclude the ladies from this aſſembly, who were in their chariots, but gave them full liberty to hear all that paſſed.</p>
               <p>When all was ready, and Cyrus had commanded ſilence, he began with requiring of the king, that in all the queſtions he was going to propoſe to him, he would anſwer ſincerely, becauſe nothing could be leſs worthy a perſon of his rank than to uſe diſſimulation or falſhood.</p>
               <p>The king promiſed he would. Then Cyrus aſked him, but at different times, propoſing each article ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and in order, Whether it was not true, that he had made war againſt Aſtyages, king of the Medes, his grandfather? Whether he had not been overcome in that war, and, in conſequence of his defeat, had concluded a treaty, by which he was obliged to pay a certain tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, to furniſh a certain number of troops, and not to keep any fortified place in his country? It was impoſſible for the king to deny any of theſe facts, which were all public and notorious. <q>For what reaſon, then (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Cyrus) have you violated the treaty in every article?</q> 
                  <q>For no other (replied the king) than becauſe I thought it a glorious thing to ſhake off the

               <p>
                  <q>It is really glorious (anſwered Cyrus) to fight in defence of liberty; but if any one, after he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſervitude, ſhould attempt to run away from his maſter, what would you do with him?</q> 
                  <q>I muſt confeſs (ſays the king) I would puniſh him.</q> 
                  <q>And if you had given a government to one of your ſubjects and he ſhould be found to commit malverſations, would you continue him in his poſt?</q> 
                  <q>No, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; I would put another in his place.</q> 
                  <q>And if he had amaſſed great riches by his unjuſt practices?</q> "I would ſtrip him of them." <q>But, which is ſtill worſe, if he had held intelligence with your enemies, how would you treat him?</q> 
                  <q>Though I ſhould paſs ſentence upon myſelf (replied the king) I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth! I would put him to death.</q> At theſe words Tigranes tore his hair from his head, and rent his garments: the women burſt into lamentations and outcries, as if ſentence had been actually paſſed upon him.</p>

               <p>Amelia, proceed.</p>
               <p>Cyrus having again commanded ſilence, Tigranes addreſſed himſelf to the prince to this effect: <q>Great prince, can you think it conſiſtent with your wiſdom to put my father to death, even againſt your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?</q> "How againſt my intureſt?" (replied Cyrus.) "Becauſe he was never ſo capable of doing you ſervice." <q>How do you make that appear? do the faults we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit enhance our merit, and give us a new title to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and favour?</q> 
                  <q>They certainly do, provided they ſerve to make us wiſer. For wiſdom is of ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable value. Are riches, courage, or addreſs, to be compared to it? Now it is evident that this ſingle day's experience has infinitely improved my father's wiſdom. He knows how dear the violation of his
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029987_0071_0FE3B6C1B3490358"/>
word has coſt him. He has proved and felt how much you are ſuperior to him in all reſpects. He has not been able to ſucceed in any of his deſigns? but you have happily accompliſhed all yours: and with that expedition and ſecrecy that he has found himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and taken, before he expected to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the very place of his retreat has ſerved only to enſnare him.</q> 
                  <q>But your father (replied Cyrus) has yet undergone no ſufferings that can have taught him wiſdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The fear of evil (anſwered Tigranes) when it is ſo well founded as this is, has a much ſharper ſting, and is more capable of piercing the ſoul, than the evil itſelf. Beſides, permit me to ſay, that gratitude is a ſtronger, and more prevailing motive, than any other whatever; and there can be no obligations in the world of a higher nature than thoſe you will lay on my father. His fortune, liberty, ſceptre, life, wives, and children, all reſtored to him with ſuch a genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Where can you find, illuſtrious prince, in one ſingle perſon, ſo many ſtrong and powerful ties to attach him to your ſervice?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Well, then (replied Cyrus, turning to the king) if I ſhould yield to your ſon's intreaties, with what number of men, and what ſum of money, will you aſſiſt us in the war againſt the Babylonians?</q> 
                  <q>My troops and treaſures (ſays the Armenian king) are no longer mine—they are entirely yours. I can raiſe
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029987_0072_0FE3B6C46D8F0660"/>
forty thouſand foot, and eight thouſand horſe; and as to money, I have about three thouſand talents; all theſe are wholly at your diſpoſal.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Cyrus accepted half the number of troops, and left the king the other half, for the defence of the country againſt the Chaldeans, with whom he was at war. The annual tribute which was due to the Medes he doubled, and, inſtead of fifty talents, exacted a hundred, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed the like ſum over and above, in his own name. <q>But what would you give me (added Cyrus) for the ranſom of your wives?</q> "All I have in the world" (anſwered the king).

               <p>Cyrus then conducted them all to his tent, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them at ſupper. It is eaſy to imagine what tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of joy there muſt have been upon this occaſion. Cyrus, before they parted, embraced them all, in token of a perfect reconciliation. This done, they got into their chariots, with their wives, and went home full of gratitude and admiration. Nothing but Cyrus was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the whole way; ſome extolling his wiſdom, others his valour; ſome admiring the ſweetneſs of his temper, others praiſing the beauty of his perſon, and the majeſty

of his mien. <q>And you (ſays Tigranes, addreſſing himſelf to his lady) what do you think of Cyru's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and deportment?</q> 
                  <q>I do not know (replied the lady); I did not obſerve him.</q>

               <p>No, madam, I was only drawing a contraſt between our ſituation, and that of one of our play-fellows, who was left in ſimilar circumſtances; but ſhe met with all ſorts of mortifications; while we, in our new mamma, meet with every indulgence; ſo that I could not help weeping for joy.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:029987_0074_0FE3B6CD59037140"/>
for which reaſon ſhe was almoſt conſtantly with us, my mamma being very fond of her. About two years ago her papa died, and left her quite deſtitute. My dear mamma wept over her, regretting that it was not in her power to provide for her; but a diſtant relation of her mamma's, who was a mantua-maker, took her, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring her up to her own buſineſs. My mamma ſent us one day to ſee her; her couſin ſaid ſhe was a proud little thing; ſhe had only aſked her to ſweep up the hearth, and truly Miſs had refuſed, telling her ſhe had done it before ſhe came, and might now, for ſhe was not uſed to do ſuch things; but added, I hit her a good ſlap, and brought down her pride.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould be quite provoked, and ſay ſhe was a proud, good-for-nothing girl; for that could be no hardſhip; it is not like ſweeping the hearth.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>MRS. SMITH.</speaker>
               <p>But would you not conſider her dignity?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>LAURA.</speaker>
               <p>I think ſhe ought to conſider her poverty, and be thankful ſhe was not aſked to do any thing worſe; and if ſhe would not do that willingly, I think ſhe ought to be made.</p>
               <p>Now, Laura, draw a compariſon between yourſelf and Miſs Lee's couſin: before we condemn the conduct of others, we ought to put ourſelves in their place. It would be as much below the dignity of Lady Mary to fetch Miſs Lloyd's cap, as for Miſs Lee to ſweep her couſin's hearth, though it would be the duty of each to ſubmit to their benefactors. Miſs Lee's couſin aſked her to do only what ſhe herſelf was accuſtomed to do, and therefore thought it pride in her to refuſe. I own there was want of feeling in beginning ſo haſtily: and ſhe for a moment put herſelf in Miſs Lee's ſituation, ſhe would have adopted a milder way of urging her point. My dear Laura's falling into the ſame error, is from the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029987_0076_0FE3B6D490E05000"/>
ſame cauſe, not entering into the feelings of others. Though your father is rich, yet you have been taught that you have feet to carry you to your drawers, and hands to take out what you want; while Lady Mary has a ſervant ſtanding behind her all the time ſhe is dreſſing, to fetch and carry every thing ſhe wants. If you ever do any perſon a kindneſs, always do it as if you were the moſt obliged; there is more in the manner of beſtowing a favour, than in the favour itſelf; and, by removing every thing that gives pain, we imperceptibly bring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into our own ideas of things. Amelia, ſhould you have treated Lady Mary the ſame? You are ſilent; don't be aſhamed to own the truth. I endeavour to fathom your hearts out of love to you; you have much to learn; but what will be of the moſt ſervice to you is to know yourſelves.</p>

               <p>The Prince of Wales, commonly called the Black Prince (from the colour of his armour) who diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his conduct and bravery in the battle of Poic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, was not leſs admired, after the victory, for his modeſt and generous behaviour to his priſoner King John. The evening after the battle, the Prince refuſed to ſit down with the King at ſupper; but ſtanding behind his chair, entertained him with his diſcourſe. As the king's thoughts were wholly employed about his preſent

misfortune, the Prince ſaid to him, in a modeſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected manner, "That his Majeſty had one great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be comforted, which was, that the battle was not loſt by his fault; that the Engliſh, to their coſt, had experienced him to be the braveſt of princes, and that God alone had diſpoſed of the victory; and (continued he) if fortune has been your adverſary, you may, at leaſt, reſt ſecure, that an inviolable regard ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for your perſon; and that you ſhall experience in me a very reſpectful relation, if I may glory in that title."</p>
               <p>The king upon this, recovering himſelf, turned to the Prince, and ſaid, with an air of ſatisfaction, "That ſince it was his deſtiny to be vanquiſhed, and taken, in an action wherein he had done nothing unworthy of his character, he found great comfort in falling into the hands of the moſt valiant and generous Prince alive."</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that when King Edward, father to the Prince, received the news of the battle, he declared, that his ſatisfaction at ſo glorious a victory was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to what he felt from the generous behaviour of his ſon.</p>

               <p>The very ſame.</p>
               <p>The year after he was ſent out with the army againſt Pyrrhus, their camp lying at no great diſtance, Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus's phyſician came to Fabricius by night, offering to diſpatch Pyrrhus by poiſon, if he would reward him for it.</p>
               <p>Fabricius inſtantly ordered him to be bound, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back to his maſter; and that Pyrrhus ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what propoſals the phyſician had made againſt his life.</p>
               <p>The king was ſo ſtruck with admiration, that he is reported to have ſaid: "Fabricius is a perſon of ſuch virtue, that it is more difficult to divert him from the paths of honour, than the ſun from his courſe."</p>

               <p>I think, madam, it means that the avaricious can have no enjoyment of their riches, and that an unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generoſity, without oeconomy, muſt bring on ruin; but that a prudential care, with a generous heart, will make riches a bleſſing to the poſſeſſor, and to all around him.</p>

               <p>Some days after, as they were ſitting at work, Eliza ſtarted up: Oh, madam! there is a gentleman flung from his horſe! Mrs. Smith rung for the ſervants, and flew to the aſſiſtance of the gentleman, who, they found, had broken his leg, and was ſtunned by the fall. They conveyed him into the houſe, and then ſent for a ſurgeon who ſet his leg, and ordered him to be kept very ſtill, being apprehenſive from the blow on his head. Mrs. Smith learned, from the gentleman's ſervant, that his maſter's name was Carbonnel; that he had lived with him only ſix months, which time had been ſpent in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carbonnel continued ſome days in a ſtate of inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. Mrs. Smith going into the room one day, he ſtarted: "What! is it my daughter?" recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "O no! madam, I aſk your pardon; where am I?"</p>

               <p>Mr. Carbonnel, on his ſervant's entering, ſaid, "Thomas, how came I into this ſituation? and whoſe houſe am I in?"</p>

Alcibiades was a young nobleman, who was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally boaſting of his wealth, and the great eſtates in his poſſeſſion. He was pupil to Socrates, who one day car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to a geographical map, and aſked him to find Attica. It was ſo ſmall it could ſcarce be diſcerned upon that draught; he, however, found it with difficulty; but, upon being deſired to point out his own eſtate there: "It is too ſmall," ſays he, "to be diſtinguiſhed in ſuch a narrow compaſs." "See then," replied Socrates, "how much you are affected about an imperceptible point of land."</p>

that we inhabit dwindles into a point; but if we extend our ideas to the fixed ſtars, and conſider each of them as a diſtinct ſun, the centre of a ſyſtem like our own, our world ſinks into nothing; and as for the poſſeſſions of the greateſt monarch on earth, they are but as a mere atom, loſt in the abyſs of bodies, and the boundleſs dimenſions of ſpace.

               <p>The Lacedemonian youth were taught to reverence and reſpect the aged, and to give them proofs of it upon all occaſions; by ſaluting them, by making way for them, and giving them place in the ſtreet, by riſing up, to ſhow them honour in all companies and public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; but, above all, by receiving their advice, and even their reproofs, with docility and ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>By theſe characteriſtics a Lacedemonian was known wherever he came; if he had behaved otherwiſe, it would have been looked upon as a reproach to himſelf, and a diſhonour to his country.</p>

               <p>I admire with what eaſe the Miſs Smiths relate what they have read; and their being accuſtomed to make remarks on what they read, will be of great advantage to them when they grow up. I am much indebted to them for their endeavours to amuſe me: a day or two ago they brought me their game of arithmetic. I was ſurprized to find even little William ſo ready at caſting up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Another day they preſented me with their game of geography, chooſing me their preſident to aſſign and diſtribute their rewards, each anſwering to the counters they took out of the bag; ſo that they went through every county and principal town in England, Scotland and Ireland, with the counties watered by the ſea-ports, bays, and capes, pointing out each on the plain map.</p>

               <p>It gives me pleaſure, Sir, to find that their amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments meet with your approbation. We are much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Abbé Gaultier, and other learned men, who have condeſcended to enter into the playful ideas of children; ſo that learning is no longer a taſk, but a pleaſure; and what is attained by their own free-will makes an abiding impreſſion on their minds.</p>

               <p>But, at the ſame time, they muſt have a good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. You, madam, have ſo happily blended inſtruction with amuſement, that you can ſcarcely fail of gaining the hearts of your little pupils. They tell me the firſt thing they attend to in a morning is reading the Scriptures: even here you have ſtudied the peculiar propenſities of youth, by forming the hiſtorical parts into dialogues, and have thereby given yourſelf an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying inſtruction of the utmoſt importance in a pleaſing and imperceptible manner. Miſs Smith has been ſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging as to lend me the manuſcript. Your Hiſtory of the Jews, from the time of the Babyloniſh captivity to the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by Titus, in letters, as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the hiſtory of the Bible, is a part of hiſtory which I have long wiſhed children to be acquainted with, as it tends to illuſtrate the ſacred writings by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us how fully the prophecies therein contained were fulfilled in the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jews for their rejection of the Meſſiah.</p>
