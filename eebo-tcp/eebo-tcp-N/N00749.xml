            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LERTTER From Dr. <hi>BRAY,</hi> to ſuch as have Contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Propagating <hi>Chriſtian Knowledge</hi> in the <hi>Plantations.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEing apprehenſive that my ſo ſudden Return for <hi>England,</hi> may occaſion ſome Miſconſtructions till the true Reaſons thereof ſhall be underſtood, to the prejudice of thoſe Deſigns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which you do ſo nobly ſupport, for the Deſtruction of the Powers of Darkneſs, and the Enlargement of Chriſt's Kingdom in His Majeſty's Plantations, I thought my ſelf in Duty, Gratitude, and in Prudence bound, to repreſent hereby a General View of thoſe Reaſons, which have induced me to make it ſo ſoon, and unexpectedly. And they are as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST,</hi> It is purſuant to the Deſire of the General Aſſembly of <hi>Mary-Land</hi>; who having moſt unanimouſly paſſed a Bill of the Higheſt Conſequence for the Eſtabliſhment of our Church, voted that I ſhould be deſired to requeſt my Lord's Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and my Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to favour that good Law, by obtaining His Majeſty's Royal Aſſent to the ſame, with all convenient Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And the Members, who gave me an Account of paſſing ſuch a Vote, told me withal, that it was the General Opinion, that I could be moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable herein, by waiting perſonally upon Their Lordſhips, rather than by Letters: In which I could not crowd all that may be neceſſary to be repreſented concerning the preſent State of the Church, and the Neceſſity, at this time, of their utmoſt Patronage. And it was in Debate, whether I ſhould not be deſired by the Aſſembly ſo to do: But that it was thought this would be to unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable a Requeſt, they being ſenſible of the great Charges and Fatigues I had been already at, in the Service of that Province; as they had a few days before acknowledged by a Meſſage from the Houſe, with their Thanks for the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SECONDLY,</hi> It is at the joint Requeſt of the Clergy of <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> who at the Cloſe of my Viſitation, amongſt other preſſing Reaſons, urged me with this, that they found it to be the earneſt Deſire of the moſt ſenſible, and well-affected to our Religion, throughout the Province, that I ſhould go over with the Law for <hi>England</hi>; Now that the Quakers are openly, and the Papiſts more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly, making their utmoſt Efforts againſt the Eſtabliſhment of our Church, by falſe Repreſentations at home, of the Numbers and Riches of their Party; and by inſinuating, That to impoſe upon them an Eſtabliſh'd Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the Clergy, would be prejudicial to the Intereſt of the Province, by obliging ſo many wealthy Traders to remove from thence. The Falſity of which they thought me beſt able to make appear, by means of my late Parochial Viſitations, throughout the greateſt Part of the Province; more eſpecially, by the Returns given in upon my <hi>Tabula prima Parochialium Inquirendorum</hi>; by which, when they ſhall be all ſent in, I ſhall be enabled to give an Account of the Names of all Heads of Families, and not only of the Religion, but in a good meaſure of the Morals of every Man, Woman and Child, Freeman and Slave, White and Black, throughout <hi>Mary-Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIRDLY,</hi> Having anſwer'd the Clergy, that I could eaſily be perſwaded, either to go or ſtay, by the ſame Motives that urged my coming ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000903_0002_0FAC9C66213724B0"/>
Miles to viſit them; <hi>viz.</hi> as it ſhould appear to me wherein I could be moſt ſerviceable to the Church, by the one, or the other: Yet being reſolv'd to pay the greateſt Deference to thoſe in Authority, I ſhould determine my ſelf in ſo nice a Point by the Judgment of the Governor. Upon which the Clergy having addreſſed his Excellency with their Reaſons, he was pleaſed to prevent my wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, by coming to me immediately as ſoon as the Viſitation was finiſhed, and declared himſelf to be very much of the ſame Opinion with the Clergy, as to the Importance of my going over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RTHLY,</hi> It is to repreſent to my Superiors the State of Religion in <hi>Mary-Land, Penſylvania,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Jerſeys,</hi> which requires ſome ſpeedy Conſideration; and with reference to which, I have ſeveral things to propoſe to my Superiors, wherein I ſhall want their Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIFTHLY,</hi> It is in order to make the better Choice of proper Miniſters for the Service of thoſe Churches, agreeable to what I have obſerved of the State, the Temper, and Conſtitution of the Country and People: Of which Miniſters, as there are ſtill-wanting at leaſt Thirty; ſo they muſt have ſome peculiar Qualifications, if they would do good there. To ſupply which want, and to get ſuch qualify'd Perſons, it is neceſſary to confer with my Lord of <hi>London</hi>: As alſo to write to ſuch of my Lords the Biſhops, and the Reverend Arch-Deacons, as I have the Honour to be known to, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to me proper Perſons, ſuch as they know to be, not only of an exact Conduct, both as to Prudence, and all other good Morals, and have been for ſome time Curates, well experienced in the Paſtoral Care; but alſo of a true publick, diſintereſted; in one word, of a <hi>Miſſionary Spirit,</hi> having a Zeal for God's Glory, and the Salvation of Mens Souls; and ſuch as are by no means grown into Years, who cannot endure Fatigue; (the Pariſhes as yet being very large) nor yet on the other ſide, raw young Men, who can never preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above Contempt amongſt a People of ſuch quick Parts, and good Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, as the Plantation-People are generally obſerv'd to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SIXTHLY,</hi> It may perhaps appear of leſs weight than it really is, ſhould I give it as one of my Reaſons, that I may procure, and carry back with me a conſiderable number of <hi>Carpenters, Bricklayers,</hi> and <hi>Joyners,</hi> to finiſh ſome <hi>Churches,</hi> and to build <hi>Parſonage-Houſes</hi> upon the Glebes; which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready procured, and hope in a ſhort time to have ſettled throughout the Province. The want of Workmen makes Building there exceſſively chargeable; ſo that I find upon auditing the Accounts of the ſeveral Veſtries in my Parochial Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that the large Sums laid out in building their Churches, is by no means anſwer'd in the Fabricks: And therefore to husband the Charity of the Country, that ſhall be given towards building of the Parſonage Houſes, ſo as it ſhall be more extenſive, I have brought the Clergy into a Subſcription, to maintain every one his Work-man, and to allow him much better than the Cuſtom of the Country is to do, and yet to be no Loſers thereby themſelves. By which means I am enabled to make ſuch Propoſals, as will give ſufficient Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to good Workmen, and ſober Perſons, to go over with me. But though this may be too mean a Conſideration; yet,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LASTLY,</hi> I hope this may appear of ſome weight; that it is, Becauſe I find there comes under my Cognizance ſeveral very important Caſes to be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily tried, with relation to the Clergy and Laity. To determine ſeveral of which, being of ſo high a Nature, as <hi>Forgery of Holy Orders, Polygamy</hi> and <hi>Inceſt,</hi> I want Inſtructions as to the Manner and Forms of Proceedings: And as it appears to me, have no Power, by my Commiſſion, to give ſuch Sentences as the Nature of the Crimes will require. And in the due Execution of which, as I perceive that I have many Eyes upon me; ſo the Country expects that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be done effectually in that Matter; and ſhould I fail therein, my being there would be to no manner of purpoſe of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>neceſſary Regulation of the Clergy and Laity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000903_0003_0FAC9C66E1C464D8"/>I hope theſe Reaſons may appear ſufficient to Perſons of that ſingular Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and Goodneſs, which I have found in you. But becauſe it is fit you ſhould be in ſome meaſure ſatisfy'd at preſent (tho' I intend to do it hereafter in an ample and publick manner) of the good that has been wrought by your means; I do aſſure you, that beſides the very uſeful Libraries, which are provided through your Benefactions, and are ſettled in <hi>Penſilvania, New-York, New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Carolina, Bermudas,</hi> are begun in ſeveral of the <hi>Leward Iſlands,</hi> and are far advanc'd in <hi>Mary-Land</hi>; I have received in the latter the Acknowledgments of the moſt publick Perſons, that the Face of Things, as to Religion, Humanity, and good Morals, is very much alter'd for the better within theſe few Years, that a Clergy have been ſent amongſt them: And have, I hope in my Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſet the Clergy in ſuch Methods, as, with the Divine Benediction upon their Endeavours, will render them a continued Bleſſing to thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>And it may not be amiſs to add, that as I have perſonally found the whole Body of the <hi>Mary-Land</hi> Clergy (excepting two, who have in part met alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and will ſufficiently feel the Effects of Diſcipline,) to give me an unuſual Demonſtration of their <hi>Paſtoral Care</hi>: And ſome of them to have ſo ſignalized themſelves, by their Induſtry, in the Inſtruction of the <hi>Negro's</hi> within their reſpective Pariſhes, (of which they have baptized great Numbers) that theſe poor Barbarians are not now the moſt ignorant, and leaſt Solemn, Part of their Aſſemblies; So at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> the Congregation of Church-People, which amounted but to 60, at the moſt, not two Years ago, through the Bleſſing of God upon the Endeavours of a late <hi>Miſſionary,</hi> is now increas'd, chiefly from <hi>Quaker-Converts,</hi> to upwards of 700. And the People of that Province do earneſtly deſire to be ſupply'd with ſeveral Miniſters more; as indeed I think the Field is there, and the Neighbouring Parts, ſo happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſown by the excellent Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> that it is become now as ripe for Harveſt, as in any part of the Chriſtian World. And it being a main part of my Deſign in coming over at this time, to procure, and take back very ſpeedily with me, right worthy Men, ſuch as are capable to do the greateſt good, I do earneſtly deſire, that if you know any Clergyman ſo qualified, and alike Spirited as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized above in the Fifth Article, you would lay before him what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he may do to the Church of God in thoſe Parts, now that there is ſo happy a Diſpoſition therein to receive the Truth. I am ſorry that, in the preſent State I find that Church, which is but in its Infancy, I cannot promiſe that their Places will be very conſiderable, the Glebes which I have, and am about to get, being as yet uncultivated. But I can aſſure them, they may at this juncture be very <hi>Extraordinarily</hi> inſtrumental to the Glory of God, the beſt Argument I can uſe to ſuch Perſons as I want; and that which has been the great Motive, and ſole Support, during a five Years Service to thoſe Churches, to him that uſes it: Alſo that their Livings will be improvable, and that they ſhall find all poſſible Encouragement that may be contriv'd, and procur'd by their moſt Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Brother, and</p>
