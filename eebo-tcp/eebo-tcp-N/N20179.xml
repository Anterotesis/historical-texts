            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>I have for ſeveral years paſt had it in contemplation to write and publiſh ſome remarks on the pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſlavery. Being appointed, by the ſociety for the promotion of freedom, to deliver the annual Oration at Hartford, in May 1793, I took this opportunity of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together a few thoughts on the ſubject contemplated, and finding that the compaſs of an Oration would not be ſufficient to admit even the general ideas and facts which, it was apprehended, might be neceſſary to illuſtrate the ſubject, I have choſen to publiſh the following remarks in the form of an</hi> eſſay <hi>or</hi> ſmall treatiſe, <hi>and addreſs it to the ſociety, as a tribute of gratitude for the reſpect paid me, and as the beſt ſervice I could render to the inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The views of ſlavery here exhibited, if not novel, are certainly important; and more time and materials than I can now command, are neceſſary to give them their due conſideration.</hi>

            <head>EFFECTS of SLAVERY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE injuſtice of enſlaving any part of the human race has been the ſubject of ſo much public diſcuſſion, and is ſo generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the inhabitants of Connecticut, that any attempt to prove it, would be a very ill compliment to the underſtandings of my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened fellow citizens. Nor could any efforts of mine add nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to the ſubject; ſo numerous, elaborate and diffuſe have been the eſſays, and ſo powerful the eloquence employed in vindicating the violated rights of humanity, that language and rhetoric are exhauſted.</p>
            <p>BUT men, inſtructed by their avarice in a ſpecies of ſubtle caſuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have learnt to make a material diſtinction between <hi>abſtract rights</hi> and <hi>private intereſt or policy.</hi> In defending the African Slave trade, its advocates, compelled by the powers of reaſon to abandon the <hi>right,</hi> have taken refuge under the <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of the traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. Here entrenched as in a ſtrong hold, they maintain their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and bid defiance to the attacks of reaſon and religion. To drive them from this citadel of defence, it becomes neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them with their own weapons, and upon their own ground.</p>
            <p>As the only ſteady, permanent and uniform ſpring of men's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is a regard to their ſuppoſed intereſt, if we would effectually reſtrain them from the purſuit of any object, we muſt firſt convince them that the object, if obtained, will not produce them the real benefit and happineſs which they expect. It is not ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade nations concerned in the ſlave trade, that the practice of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving their brethren of the human race, is barbarous and wicked, and that it is a violation of the laws of nature and ſociety. Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their relinquiſhing the practice, they muſt be convinced that ſuch relinquiſhment will not be materially prejudicial to their intereſt.</p>
            <p>To endeavor to prove this important truth, that <hi>ſlavery,</hi> in all its forms and varieties, is repugnant to the private intereſt and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic happineſs of man, is the taſk I have aſſigned myſelf in this eſſay though neither my talents nor my opportunities of acquiring the; neceſſary information, will enable me to do juſtice to the ſubject.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026448_0005_0FD055C9886FF538"/>
In taking this comprehenſive view of the effects of ſlavery on men and nations, the ſociety, to whom this treatiſe is addreſſed, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, if I do not reſtrict myſelf to the conſideration of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſlave trade and the more immediate purpoſes of their inſtitution; for the effects of deſpotiſm and a violent reſtraint of the natural lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of man, are the ſame in all countries; ſubject however to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable modifications from climate, ſoil, religion, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental circumſtances.</p>
            <p>SLAVERY may be divided into, <hi>political</hi> and <hi>civil. Political ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> is a ſubjection to the uncontrolled exerciſe of public au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, whether that authority is in the hands of a king, a council, or a popular aſſembly. <hi>Civil ſlavery</hi> is a ſubjection to the abſolute power of a particular proprietor, or maſter.</p>
            <p>SLAVERY alſo exiſts in very different degrees in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. In ſome countries, the ſlave poſſeſſes by cuſtom, or enjoys by indulgence, ſome rights and privileges; in others, he is ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all rights, and his ſervices, his perſon and his life, are at the arbitrary diſpoſal of his maſter. But as I am not about forming a ſyſtematic treatiſe on this ſubject, theſe diſtinctions will not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; it being ſufficient for my purpoſe to exhibit the <hi>general ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſlavery on men and nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF the effects of ſlavery, the firſt in order are thoſe which reſpect the <hi>character of the ſlave;</hi> indeed moſt of the pernicious conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſlavery, whether public or private, may be traced to this one ſource, the <hi>effects of an unnatural and an unwarrantable reſtraint laid upon the will of the ſlave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is evidently the will of heaven that men ſhould be prompted to action by a regard to their own benefit and happineſs. Whenever by the poſitive inſtitutions of ſociety, or by external force, men are ſtripped of the power of exerting themſelves for their own benefit, the mind, having loſt its ſpring or ſtimulus, either ceaſes to act, and men become mere machines, moving only when impelled by ſome extraneous power; or if the mind acts at all, it is at the impulſe of violent paſſions, ſtruggling to throw off an unnatural reſtraint, and to revenge the injury. Hence it is, that ſlaves, with few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may be divided into two claſſes, the <hi>indolent</hi> and the <hi>villanous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN America the lazineſs of ſlaves has become proverbial: indeed the blacks are ſo remarkable for their inaction, their want of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and their diſinoli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation to improvement, as to create very great doubts in the minds of ſome men of a philoſophical caſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not a diſtinct and inferior race of beings.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Hume's Eſſays vol. 1. p. 550. Note. M. Jefferſons notes on Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia, p. 237.</note> But on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining this ſubject, and comparing the blacks of this country, with the ſlaves of other countries, who are confeſſedly of the ſame race with the moſt improved European nation, it will probably be found that, making the uſual allowances for the effects of their native climate, all the peculiar features in the character of the African race in America, may juſtly be aſcribed to their depreſſed condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:026448_0006_0FD055CB4A1EC260"/>
The indolence of the ſlaves in the ſouthern ſtates, muſt indeed approach almoſt to ſtupidity. It is ſaid by gentlemen, well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this ſubject, that three blacks will not perform more labor than one free white in the northern ſtates.<note n="*" place="bottom">MSS. letter from the hon. Dr. Ramſay, of Charleſtown South-Carolina.</note> And it is well known that on every plantation, a negro driver is required, with his whip and his ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, to compel the reluctant ſlave to perform his daily taſk. But are American ſlaves only diſtinguiſhed for their averſion to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor? Hiſtory teaches us a very different doctrine. Among the antient Germans, who, by their vigor and bravery, conquered half the world, ſlavery had the ſame debaſing ſtupi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying influence: and it is remarkable that the word, <hi>lazzi,</hi> which among our Saxon anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, was the denomination or the loweſt order of bondmen or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, is the origin of our Engliſh word <hi>lazy,</hi> a word expreſſive of that indolence and averſion to labor, which remarkably character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize the negroes in America.<note n="†" place="bottom">From the ſame root have ſprung the words <hi>lazaretto</hi> and <hi>lazzaroni,</hi> in the Italian language, the latter of which is the general name given to the idlers and beggars that ſwarm in Italy; and the former, is the name of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals erected for the ſick and infirm among thoſe miſerable wretches. See Moor's Italy and Brydone's tour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> paſſim.</note> If ſlavery had this effect upon our own anceſtors, the warlike heroes of the <hi>north,</hi> ſurely modern philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers need not reſort to an original difference of race, for the cauſe of that dullneſs and want of mental vigor, remarkable in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved natives of the <hi>torrid zone</hi> and their degenerate deſcendants.</p>
            <p>But if we turn our eyes upon the preſent nations of Europe, we ſhall find multiplied proofs of this important truth, that ſlavery ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enervates the vigor of the human mind, in all climates and among all nations.</p>
            <p>In Poland, the peaſants, who are ſlaves, are ſo indolent that they do not furniſh themſelves even with a ſhelter from the inclemencies of the weather. The proprietor of the land to which the peaſants are annexed, like the ſtock of a farm, is obliged to build cottages and barns for them, and to furniſh them with ſeed, plows, horſes, and every implement of huſbandry.<note n="§" place="bottom">Coxe's travels into Poland, &amp;c. vol. 1. p. 160.</note> Nor do theſe miſerable wretches provide themſelves the ordinary comforts of life. Little more is to be ſeen within their hovels, than bare walls, a wooden ſtool, and a bed of ſtraw. People who travel in that deſolate country, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect tolerable accommodations, muſt carry with them their own beds, their proviſions, their knives, forks and ſpoons.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibm. page 251.</note>

From this circumſtance, it happened that Jews in the infancy of commerce became the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of all Europe, and compelled by neceſſity to turn their whole attention to money-tranſactions, they very early reduced them to a ſcience. By this means they commanded almoſt all the money of the countries where they were ſettled in numbers, and partly thro their precarious ſituation, and partly thro the neceſſities of other people, they every where had recourſe to the practice of lending money at an exorbitant intereſt. This increaſed the popular odium which was before entertained againſt this race of unbelievers, and in ſome countries, it ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ANOTHER fact to prove how generally mankind admit the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of ſlavery to corrupt the human heart, and how little they have been hitherto influenced by the important truth, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of a ſlave's teſtimony from trials at Law.</p>

            <p>BY the laws of Poland, the teſtimony of the peaſants, tho not excluded from courts, is conſidered as of leſs weight than that of freemen. If a lord kills his ſlave, the murder muſt be proved by <hi>two</hi> Gentlemen or <hi>four</hi> peaſants; the teſtimony of <hi>two</hi> freemen being deemed equivalent to that of <hi>four</hi> ſlaves.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Coxe's travels into Poland. &amp;c. vol. 1, p. 158</note>

            <p>THE natural enquiry is why a ſlave ſhould be a leſs credible witneſs than a freeman. The anſwer is eaſy; <hi>ſlavery corrupts the heart.</hi> Exceptions to this rule may be found; but the laws or the practice of moſt nations warrants the aſſertion, that ſlaves have generally been conſidered as leſs influenced by a ſenſe of honor and by moral obligations than freemen.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the note in page 9 from Tacitus.</note> Of this fact there can be no doubt; and it is a curious inconſiſtency in legiſlation, that laws ſhould be made, enjoining moral and religious duties and prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt every ſpecies of vice, yet indirectly or expreſsly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing the practice of enſlaving men, which, in the firſt inſtance, is the moſt attrocious act of villany, and in its conſequences, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all ſenſe of moral obligation and introductive of every ſpecies of crimes.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtriking illuſtration of theſe ideas, that countries where the oppreſſions of the feudal ſyſtem and domeſtic ſlavery ſtill exiſt, are much more infeſted with pilferers and robbers, than free republican ſtates, where the citizens are freeholders and not generally proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ſlaves.

foes; to an indulgent one, faithful and affectionate ſervants. I am not perſonally acquainted with any ſlaves in Connecticut, who were born in Africa, and who arrived to manhood in their own country, before they were reduced to bondage. I have therefore had no opportunity to obſerve what general difference exiſts between the moral character of an African, enſlaved after he had grown to years of manhood, and that of a black who was born and bred in ſlavery. On general principles, it is to be preſumed, that Africans, who are bred in freedom, and enſlaved after they have acquired ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of frankneſs and ingenuouſneſs of deportment, will either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain through life a large portion of their early virtues; and if they attempt to redreſs their own wrongs, that they will be bold and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their attacks upon their oppreſſors. Negroes, on the other hand, who are born and nurſed under the preſſure of bondage, will be deſtitute of that openneſs of character which marks the wild free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ſavages, and their minds will ſink into a ſtate of ſullen apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; or prompted to action by a ſenſe of injury and reſtrained by fear from open violence, they will exerciſe their ingenuity in devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and committing petty frauds on their maſters. However this may be, it is a known fact that the blacks in this country, are, with few exceptions, addicted to the practice of committing little clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine frauds, and a large proportion of capital crimes, will on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, be found to be perpetrated by the ſame race of men. Not a year paſſes, but we hear of the burglaries, the rapes, or the murders committed by the blacks in the United States,<note n="†" place="bottom">Two or three inſtances of murder committed by ſlaves on their maſters, happened in Virginia the laſt year.

Thus an act of ſtrict juſtice to the ſlave very often renders him a worſe member of ſociety. This idea is not ſuggeſted as an argument againſt the liberation of ſlaves from the yoke of bondage; but it proves very fully, that a bare emancipation of them is not an act of adequate juſtice, much leſs is it <hi>all</hi> that good citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens <hi>may</hi> do towards correcting their ill habits and rendering them valuable members of the community.</p>

The paſſions of men reſemble the current of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic river, which while it meets with no reſiſtance, glides ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, ſilent and harmleſs; attacked with boiſterous winds, it moves with ſullen dignity, heaving its murmuring waves againſt the reſounding ſhores; but when maſſy mounds impede its progreſs, it riſes in all its force, and burſting its banks with indignant fury, it ſpreads wide havoc and devaſtation over the adjacent plains—Such have been the ravages committed by ſlaves, when, unable any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>SICILY was the fineſt wheat country in the Roman dominions. Rome was ſupplied from its granaries, and many of its cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors became immenſely rich.

            <p>THIS leads me to notice ſome effects of ſlavery on the character of the maſter. It is a general truth that the men who, from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy <hi>hold,</hi> and thoſe who <hi>feel,</hi> the rod of tyranny, become equally hardened by the exerciſe of cruelty, and equally inſenſible to the ſufferings of their fellow men. Such is the nature and tendency of deſpotiſm, that in its operation, it not only checks the progreſs of civilization, but actually converts the civilized man into a ſavage; at leaſt ſo far as reſpects the humane affections of the heart.</p>

            <p>Aſtoniſhingly different is the character of the Poliſh peaſants. The latter, who are ſubject to the moſt unlimited tyranny, are cringing and ſervile in their language and manners; when ſtrangers paſs by them, they bow down to the ground; at the firſt glimpſe of a gentleman's carriage, they ſtop their carts and taking off their hats or caps, hold them in their hands, till the gentleman is out of fight.<note n="†" place="bottom">Coxe's travels, vol. 1. 279,</note> Such manners mark in a ſtriking degree, the abject ſervitude, by which theſe pitiable peaſants are humbled and depreſſed.</p>
            <p>The tendency of tyranny, both civil and domeſtic, to annihilate the ſocial affections, of abridge their operation, is very remarkable in its effect upon <hi>hoſpitality.</hi> In a ſavage ſtate, hoſpitality is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all men, without diſtinction. Among the antient Germans, it was deemed a crime to refuſe entertainment to any of the human race. Every man who travelled among them, whether ſtranger or friend, was received with equal and liberal hoſpitality, and at his departure, he was gratified with whatever he requeſted.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Tacitus.</note> Such is the univerſal practice among the aborigines of America; there is no inſtance in which hoſpitality has been refuſed to Europeans, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Indian natives have been firſt abuſed or provoked to hoſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the treachery of civilized ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>Hoſpitality is the moſt inartificial of all the virtues. It may be conſidered as <hi>natural,</hi> for its exerciſe flows immediately from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. That men are all <hi>brethren,</hi> the children of one common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is an impreſſion of nature; and the heart of man in a ſtate of primaeval ſimplicity, untainted with prejudice, uncorrupted by intereſt, every where recognizes the alliance of nature, and clings to its kindred man.</p>

The nabob and the tyrant, educated in the practice of commanding, perhaps of abuſing their unfortunate ſlaves, very early loſe the ſympathies of their nature, and acquire a habit of deſpiſing all who are placed in meaner circumſtances. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt deſtroys hoſpitality, and thus it happens that the rich and powerful uſually confine their hoſpitable attentions to thoſe of their own rank. The more elevated the man on the pyramid of power, the farther is he removed from the reſt of the human race; the ſmaller is the circle of his equals, and the leſs extenſive is the ſphere of his perſonal attachments.

            <p>But in no particular are the deplorable effects of ſlavery more viſible, than in checking, or deſtroying national induſtry. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we turn our eyes to view the comparative effects of freedom and ſlavery on agriculture, arts, commerce and ſcience, the mind is deeply affected at the aſtoniſhing contraſt.</p>
            <p>About the 12th century, the feudal ſyſtem was eſtabliſhed with nearly an equal degree of rigor, in all the kingdoms of Europe. As to the ſtate of the peaſantry and of agriculture at that period, England and Poland were nearly in the ſame ſituation. The <hi>ſerfs</hi> of Poland and the <hi>churles</hi> of England were ſlaves, incapable of acquiring property and annexed to manors like the ſtock of a farm, much in the ſame manner as the negroes are at this day in the Weſt Indies and Southern American States. From that period to this time, the peaſantry of Poland have continued in the ſame ſtate with little amelioration of their condition. But the churles in England have been more fortunate. To trace the particular ſteps by which the churles and villains of England were raiſed from their abject ſervitude, to the preſent ſtate of the farmers in that country, does not fall within my deſign;<note n="†" place="bottom">See Millar's hiſt view of the Eng. Gov. p. 183. Blacks. Com. vol. 2. p. 90. and the hiſtories of England.</note> it is ſufficient to remark that by gradual means, they have become free tenants, who have a legal prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty in the eſtates which they cultivate. Inſtead of being tenants at will and liable to be turned out of their poſſeſſions at any moment by their capricious lords, they have a permanent intereſt in their eſtates, which the laws of the country protect, and tranſmit to their heirs. This is the principal circumſtance which has rendered the agriculture of England flouriſhing, and the farmers more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent, wealthy and reſpectable than the miſerable ſerfs in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>To labor ſolely for the benefit of other men, is repugnant to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery principle of the human heart. Men will not be induſtrious, nor is it the will of heaven that they ſhould be, without a well founded expectation of enjoying the fruits of their labor. The ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculture of a country therefore will always be flouriſhing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, in proportion to the quantity and duration of intereſt which the farmers have in the lands they cultivate,<note n="‡" place="bottom">The natural ſoil, markets &amp;c. being equal.

That country produces moſt where the farmers are freeholders, poſſeſſing the ſee ſimple of their lands, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little or no rent, and light taxes. That country produces leaſt,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026448_0022_0FD055E3087F5E88"/>
where the cultivators are ſlaves, who have no intereſt in their own labors, and who work only by compulſion. Between theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, the productiveneſs of a country is in proportion to the length of the leaſes of the farms, the ſmallneſs of the rent and the lightneſs of the taxes and impoſts. A tenant who has a leaſe for ſeveral hundred years, at a ſmall fixed rent, not liable to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed at the pleaſure of the landlord, has an intereſt in his farm almoſt equivalent to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee ſimple. A tenant for life, who has little expectation that his heirs will enjoy his farm, is under ſtrong temptations to make the moſt of the land for himſelf, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of the ſoil, the buildings and fences. Inſtead of making im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, he will probably impoveriſh the land and leave the buildings and fences out of repair. The tenant at will has ſtill leſs intereſt in the land he occupies, and if, as in Turkey, he is ſubject to the arbitrary exactions of Pachas, Governors, landlords or collectors of revenue, who take his earnings from him at pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, he has no more encouragement to labor than the ſlave, and of courſe he will look no farther than to make proviſion for the moment.</p>
            <p>The paſt and preſent ſtate of the world, verifies theſe remarks. By the antient laws or cuſtoms of Ireland, before the introduction of the Engliſh laws after the conqueſt of Henry II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the lands were held by the ſingular tenures of <hi>taniſtry</hi> and <hi>gavelkind.</hi> By the cuſtom of taniſtry, when a nobleman died, his caſtles, manors and lands deſcended to the <hi>oldeſt and moſt worthy of his blood and ſurname.</hi> It was often uncertain who, of the blood and ſurname of the laſt poſſeſſor, was the <hi>moſt worthy;</hi> and from this uncertainty aroſe competitions for the inheritance, which not unfrequently ended in civil war.</p>

When a ter-tenant died, the chief aſſembled all the ſept, and throwing all the farms into common ſtock, made a new diſtribution; allotting to each the beſt or greateſt portion, according to his ſeniority. Theſe aſſignments were made by the chief <hi>ex arbitrio,</hi> on the death of every ter-tenant, and of conſequence, the tranſlations of each tenant from one poſſeſſion to another were ſo frequent, that the cultivators of the earth had no ſecurity for the enjoyment of their lands, even for a month.<note n="†" place="bottom">A ſimilar cuſtom prevailed among the antient Germans.

            <p>Ranging ſtill farther eaſtward, the eye reſts upon the kingdom of Poland, where a complicated political and civil deſpotiſm clouds and darkens the proſpect. Until the reign of Caſſimir the great, in the 14th century, a lord could put his peaſant to death with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and when the latter died without children, the lord conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf as his heir, and ſiezed all his effects. Caſſimir, in 1347, preſcribed a fine for the murder of a peaſant, and enacted that if one died without iſſue, his next heir ſhould inherit. But theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary laws, calculated to alleviate the miſeries of the peaſantry, were eluded by the powerful and licentious nobles. It was not till 1768 that the ſtatutes of Poland made it a capital crime to murder a peaſant; and even now, it requires ſuch an accumulation of evidence to convict the offender, that the law is rendered almoſt nugatory.<note n="†" place="bottom">Coxe's travels vol. 1. 156. 158.</note>

Tho we travelled in the high road<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which unites Cracow and Warſaw, in the courſe of about 258 Engliſh miles, we met in our progreſs, only two carriages, and about a dozen carts. The country was equally thin of human habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; a few ſtraggling villages, all built of wood, ſucceeded one another at long intervals, whoſe miſerable appearance correſponded to the wretchedneſs of the country around them.

We could ſeldom procure any other room than that in which the family lived; in the article of proviſion, eggs and milk were our greateſt luxuries and could not always be obtained; our only bed was ſtraw thrown upon the ground, and we thought ourſelves happy when we could procure it clean. The natives were poorer, humbler and more miſerable than any people we had yet obſerved in our travels. Whenever we ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, they flocked around us in crouds, and with the moſt abject geſtures, begged for charity."</p>
            <p>Caſting our eyes, from this diſguſting ſpectable, towards the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe empire of Ruſſia in the north, nearly the ſame diſmal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are preſented to our view. The deſpotiſm of a half-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nobility concurs with the arbitrary nature of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to pillage and debaſe the ſerfs, and render them humble, obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, theiviſh, improvident and inſenſible. Here induſtry is check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcouraged by the arbitrary exactions of the great proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of land, whoſe power over their vaſſals is without controul. A direct tax is laid upon the virtues of induſtry and frugality by a rapacious nobility, who aſſeſs their peaſants in proportion to their ſuppoſed profits, tho the poor wretches are incapable of acquiring and holding property. Thus a maſon or ſmith, who is a good workman, is often rated as high as 6, 12 and even 20l. ſterling a year. It is however ſome alleviation to a benevolent mind, to ſee the ſovereigns of that almoſt boundleſs empire, exerting their power for the benefit of their ſubjects.

            <p>Here ſlavery aſſumes a different form. The conquered natives of the Ottoman dominions are not ſubject to a feudal ſervitude; they are not the <hi>adſcriptitii glebe</hi> of ancient Rome, or modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Ruſſia. But they are ſubject to the worſt ſpecies of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the arbitrary and capricious exactions of numberleſs petty tyrants, the collectors of taxes and governors of provinces, whoſe rapaciouſneſs is reſtrained by no ſuperior power, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When Sultan Selim firſt made a conqueſt of Syria, in order to favor the huſbandman, whoſe worth he knew, he eſtabliſhed the <hi>miri,</hi> a territorial tribute, which was fixed at a certain rate that was not to be augmented or diminiſhed. This tribute was mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and had it not been for the abuſes of the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rkiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it never could have oppreſſed the people. But the Pachas who have moſt of the lands at their diſpoſal, take care, when they make grants, to clog them with burthenſome conditions; they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the half or even two thirds of the crop; they monopolize the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eed and the cattle, ſo that the cultivators are compelled to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe from them at their own price. When the harveſt is over, they cavil about loſſes and pretended robberies, and as they have the power in their hands, they carry off what they think proper. If the ſeaſon fails, they exact the ſame ſum, and to raiſe this they expoſe to ſale every thing the poor peaſant poſſeſſes. Happily his perſon remains free, for the Turks are ignorant of the refinement of impriſoning for debt, when the man has no longer any property.</p>
            <p>Theſe oppreſſions are conſtant, and to theſe is added a multitude of occaſional extortions. Sometimes a whole village is laid under contribution for ſome offence, real or imaginary. A preſent is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on the acceſſion of each new governor; a contribution of graſs is required for his horſes, and of ſtraw and barley for his cavaliers, and all the ſoldiers who paſs muſt be provided for by the poor peaſants. The Villages tremble when a ſoldier appears, as they would at the approach of a robber. He enters as a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and commands as a maſter; "<hi>dogs, rabble,</hi>" he cries, "<hi>bread, coffee, tobacco; I muſt have barley, I muſt have meat.</hi>" If he caſts his eyes on poultry, he kills them, and at his departure, he adds inſult to tyranny. In vain do the peaſants exclaim againſt this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; the ſaber impoſes ſilence; juſtice is remote and difficult of acceſs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

claſs of inhabitants, ruined and unable to pay the tribute, forſake the villages and fly to the cities. But the tribute of the village cannot be diminiſhed; the ſum to be levied muſt be found; the burthen therefore falls with accumulated weight on the remaining inhabitants, and becomes inſupportable. A two years drouth ruins the village, the inhabitants abandon it, and the tax it ſhould have paid is levied on the neighboring lands.</p>
            <p>It is remarked that theſe exactions have made a rapid progreſs, during the laſt 40 years, from which period the people date the decline of agriculture, the depopulation of the country, and the diminution of the Sultans revenue.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Volney's Travels. Vol. 2. Ch. 37.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſituation of the peaſants is wretched beyond deſcription. They are every where reduced to a little cake of barley, onions, len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils and water. In the mountains of Lebanon, they uſe acorns for food, after boiling or roaſting them on the aſhes.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the miſery of the huſbandman, and the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate of his property, cultivation is neglected. The farmer's plow is frequently no more than the branch of a tree, cut below a bifurcation. The country is tilled by aſſes and cows; rarely by oxen. On the borders of Arabia, the countryman, for fear of the wild Arabs, muſt ſow with his muſket in his hand; and when his corn turns yellow, and before it is ripe he muſt reap it and hide it in ſubterranean caverns. In a word, the induſtry of the country is limited to a ſupply of immediate wants; to procure a little bread and a few onions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wretched blue ſhirt and a bit of woollen cloth. The peaſant indeed lives in fear and diſtreſs, but it is a conſolation that he does not enrich his tyrants, and that the avarice of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm inflicts its own puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The arts, ſciences and commerce throughout the Turkiſh empire have ſhared the ſame fate as agriculture. The manufactures of the people are confined to a few articles of cloathing and arms, their reading extends only to the Koran, a few monkiſh books and legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary tales, and their little commerce is in the hands of Franks, Greeks and Arminians. Moſt of the harbors on the coaſt of Egypt, Syria, Aſia Minor, and the Greek Iſlands, are choaked up with ſand; the Levant is infeſted with pirates; and the depopulation of ſome of the moſt fertile provinces of the Ottoman empire, exhibits the fatal effects of the wide-waſting peſtilential power of a fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious government.</p>
            <p>Yet even in the dark and deſolate regions of tyranny, a few ſcattering rays of liberty ariſe and cheer the melancholy proſpect. On the barren mountains of Syria, between Lebanon and the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the buſineſs was begun and continued, till about 40 years ago when the ſociety of Quakers, under the auſpices of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Anthony Benezet, remonſtrated againſt the ſhameful traffic. From that period powerful efforts have been made by numerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties as well as individuals, to procure the emancipation of thoſe already reduced to ſlavery, and to put a ſtop to further importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Africa. Theſe efforts have been attended with great ſucceſs. In ſome of the northern ſtates of America, all the ſlaves have been ſet free by conſtitutional declarations of rights; in almoſt all of them proviſion has been made by law to introduce a gradual abolition of the exiſting ſlavery, and the further impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is ſtrictly prohibited. At the ſame time we may remark that by a late act of the Britiſh Parliament, the ſlave trade is to ceaſe in the year 1796; and the revolution in France has already produced very important changes in that trade and in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſlaves in ſome of the French Iſlands.

            <p>To give freedom at once to almoſt 700,000 ſlaves, would reduce perhaps 20,000 white families to beggary.

            <p>It has been ſuggeſted that the country may gradually be delivered from its black inhabitants by tranſporting a certain number of them to Africa every year, furniſhed with the neceſſary means of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A ſettlement of this kind has been already begun by a colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from Great-Britain, under the ſuperintendance of Mr. Clarkſon. Indeed if colonial eſtabliſhments of this kind could be effected, without great injury to the United States, humanity and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy would exult at the proſpect of ſeeing the arts of civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions introduced into the heart of Africa. But the practicability of this plan of colonization ſeems to be yet problematical. It ſeems not yet decided by the experiments made, whether ſuch colonies would not dwindle away by diſeaſe, and be perpetually expoſed to the hoſtility of the ſurrounding natives. Indeed, it may be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion, whether even well civilized blacks placed in the torrid zone, where little labor is requiſite to procure their neceſſary food and clothing, would not neglect all arts and labor, beyond what are neceſſary to ſupply immediate wants, and gradually revert back to a ſavage ſtate. How far a commercial intercourſe with ſuch colonies, by exciting a taſte for luxuries and the love of wealth and ſplendor, would tend to preſerve their habits of induſtry and prompt them to encourage arts and manufactures, we have perhaps no certain data from which we can draw even a probable concluſion.</p>
            <p>But other objections oppoſe themſelves to the project of African colonization. Who is to pay the expenſe? The maſter will think the loſs of his ſlaves a ſacrifice on his part ſufficiently great, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out furniſhing them with food, utenſils, and ſhipping for their tranſportation; and the ſlaves are not able to furniſh themſelves with theſe articles. The funds therfore muſt be raiſed by private ſubſcriptions, or ſupplied by government; and theſe reſources cannot be relied on in the preſent ſtate of America. Beſides it is not certain that the ſlaves themſelves would be willing to riſk ſuch a change of ſituation; as moſt of them are born in this country and are total ſtrangers to Africa and its inhabitants. In this caſe, to compel them to quit the country, and encounter the dangers of the ſea, an inſalubrious climate and the hoſtile tribes of Africa; together with the ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of ſtarving, would be a flagrant act of injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, inferior only to the firſt act of enſlaving their anceſtors.</p>
            <p>The objection that the unhealthineſs of the climate renders it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for whites to cultivate rice and indigo plantations, and therefore it is neceſſary to perform this buſineſs by blacks, ſeems to be of little weight; or at leaſt, it cannot be of permanent duration. It is commonly ſuppoſed that the inſalubrity of the air in the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſtates, ariſes in great meaſure, from the ſtagnant waters which cover the rice and indigo plantations. Theſe waters indeed increaſe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026448_0035_0FD055F730B0FB28"/>
the evil; but the principal cauſe is a much more extenſive one; the large marſhes and vaſt tracts of uncleared land in the flat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Marſhes and ſtagnant waters, in which vegetable ſubſtances putrify and diſſolve, produce peſtilential exhalations; and when a country is moſtly covered with foreſts, the air itſelf becomes ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and does not carry off the noxious effluvia generated in low grounds. It is with the air as with water; its purity depends on its motion. To render any flat country healthy, it muſt be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of its foreſts, and laid open on all ſides to the action of the wind. It is not ſufficient to open here and there a plantation, and leave four fifths of the earth covered with wood. Beſides the advantage of giving motion to the air on an extended plain, the clearing and cultivation of the earth lays it open to the ſun, whoſe heat warms and dries the ſurface, and by removing the moiſture, prevents the generation of noxious exhalations. Thus whenever moſt of the land in the ſouthern ſtates ſhall be cleared, the principal cauſe of epidemic diſeaſes will be deſtroyed; and the free circulation of air near the ſurface of the earth will render the putrid exhalations from the plantations and marſh ground which cannot be drained, much leſs fatal. The New-England States, ſixty years ago, were infeſted with the ſame annual fevers, which now prove ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the ſouthern ſtates, but by the clearing and cultivation of the earth, thoſe diſeaſes no longer prevail. The rice fields in Italy and Spain, are all cultivated by white people, and tho they render the air about them leſs ſalubrious than it is in other parts of the country, yet it is not ſo fatal to the health of the people, as to diſcourage the culture of that uſeful grain.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Bourgoanne's travels, vol. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is therefore no queſtion that a general and high ſtate of cultivation will, to a great degree, correct the inſalubrity of the low flat country in the ſouthern States, ſo as to render it cultivable with white laborers; except perhaps in the vicinity of ſuch ſalt-marſhes as cannot be drained. But the obſtacles that preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the project of <hi>colonization,</hi> and to that of a <hi>general ſudden abolition</hi> of ſlavery, appear to be equally inſurmountable.

What then can be done? What method can be deviſed for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorating the condition of the blacks, without eſſentially injuring the ſlave, the maſter and the public. This is the great deſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. There appears to me only one plan or expedient for effecting this deſirable object, which, in its operation, will combine the three ſeveral intereſts which are to be conſulted; this is, to raiſe the ſlaves, by gradual means, to the condition of free tenants.</p>
            <p>Indeed if we judge from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in many parts of Europe, it is no illfounded prediction, that ſlavery in this country will be utterly extirpated in the courſe of two centuries, perhaps in a much ſhorter period, without any extraordinary efforts to abol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh it. The negroes in the ſouthern States are very nearly in the ſituation of the villains in England under the firſt princes of the Norman line. They enjoy certain privileges, ſuch as that of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating a ſpot of earth for themſelves, on a certain day of the week, or that of performing a certain taſk every day. To theſe privileges they adhere with pertinacious obſtinacy. No power or perſuaſion can prevail on a negro to plant or dig, in one day, more than a quarter of an acre of land, nor to labor for his maſter on a day which he has been accuſtomed to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ider as his own time. The ſlaves will therefore relinquiſh no privilege; but it is ſcarcely poſſible to prevent them from gradually acquiring new privileges, which they will immediately challenge as rights, and thus by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees abridge their maſters authority over them. The humanity of ſome maſters, the weakneſs or the policy of others will continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be multiplying and enlarging the privileges of their ſlaves, till multitudes of them acquire ſome property, by which they will be able to purchaſe more ample exemptions from their maſters autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and finally to obtain their freedom. In this manner, and by various other means, the ancient villains of England obtained their freedom, and long before the abolition of military tenures under Charles 2, there were very few villains left in the nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Black. Com. Vol. 2, 96. Sullivan, Lecture 25.</note> By ſuch means, the ſlaves in theſe States would unqueſtionably riſe to the enjoyment of freedom, without any legiſlative proviſion for the purpoſe. But this progreſs would be too ſlow to ſatisfy the friends of humanity, in this enlightened period of the world; too ſlow for the ſpirit of our governments, and too ſlow for our public proſperity. It is therefore highly neceſſary that public meaſures and private ſocieties ſhould lend their aid to accelerate the progreſs of freedom, and with all convenient ſpeed, baniſh the galling chains of bondage from the ſhores of our Republic.</p>
            <p>To the plan of raiſing the ſlaves to the condition of free tenants, many objections may be raiſed; but perhaps none of them will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an anſwer, except this; that if the ſlaves are ſet at liberty, even with the offer of farms on a ſmall rent, they will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> labor but will become vagabonds and ſtarve, or betake themſelves to pilfering, and be a ſcourge to the country. This objection has weight, and as it reſpects a <hi>total</hi> and <hi>ſudden emancipation,</hi> it appears
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026448_0037_0FD055F98ACD7CD8"/>
to me inſuperable. But I cannot believe <hi>all</hi> the ſlaves in this country are ſo dull that motives of intereſt will make no impreſſion on their minds, or that they are ſo unprincipled and ungrateful, that if ſet at liberty, they would turn their hands againſt their maſters, and devote themſelves to an idle life and to ſtealing. Some among them might be found, who, if their maſters would give them farms on a moderate rent, and their liberty, on condition of their being good tenants, would be prompted to induſtry, and exerciſe the virtues of honeſty, and frugality. Every planter might find, among his ſlaves, a few perhaps of the young men, whoſe habits are not firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riveted, on whom the firſt experiments might be made. Once inſpire them with a love of property, let them go to market for themſelves, accuſtom themſelves to make bargains, and begin to furniſh themſelves with clothes and food above their ordinary fare, and to build for themſelves convenient houſes, and their want continually multiplying will beget habits of induſtry and economy. To prompt a ſlave to exertion, his deſires muſt be inflamed, like thoſe of other men, with a proſpect of enjoyments above thoſe of a ſlave—he muſt be inſpired with emulation; and to ſuppoſe the negroes in America to be naturally deſtitute of ſuch deſires, is contrary to hiſtorical facts, and all the known principles of the human conſtitution.</p>
            <p>If a few ſlaves could be found on whom ſucceſsful experiments might be made, the taſk would be half-accompliſhed; as example would have a powerful effect in exciting a ſpirit of emulation. But to give ſucceſs to any efforts for this purpoſe, the ſlaves muſt be aſſiſted with the ſuperintending care and direction of their maſters or overſeers, as well as with the ſtock and utenſils neceſſary for their farms. To put a man upon a farm, who has never had any will of his own, and whoſe faculties, ſubject to perpetual compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, have never had an opportunity to unfold and exert themſelves, is like ſending children into the world to ſeek their living; and to give him land to work on, without ſtock or inſtruments of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, would afford a very unpromiſing proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>But the firſt eſſays would be few and on a ſmall ſcale, ſo that the proprietor need not be terrified at the expenſe, and after the firſt difficulties ſhould be overcome, the tenants would be able to furniſh themſelves with the neceſſary means of managing their farms, and the profits would amply repay the proprietor.</p>
            <p>It is to be wiſhed that ſome patriotic and humane gentlemen in the ſouthern States would make effectual experiments upon their ſlaves, to determine how far a project of this kind will anſwer the double purpoſe of giving freedom to a miſerable race of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring their owners and obſtructing the cultivation of the country. No efforts of this kind have yet been made in America;<note n="*" place="bottom">I am informed by two very intelligent and reſpectable gentlemen, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

from a failure of their own experiments; and the ſucceſs of ſimilar attempts in Europe affords good ground of encouragement.</p>
            <p>A glorious experiment of this kind has been made by Zamoiſki, formerly great Chancellor of Poland, who in the year 1760, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed the peaſants of 6 villages, in the palatinate of Maſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via. The ſucceſs deſerves to be particularly mentioned, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent is important, and ſerves to confirm the principles here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, that ſlavery is pernicious to the morals, as well as to the induſtry and population of a country. On inſpecting the pariſh regiſters of theſe villages, it appeared, that for ten years immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preceding their enfranchiſement, the births amounted to 43 each year on an average; but in the firſt ten years of their freedom, the births on an average, were 62 for each year, and in the ſeven following years they averaged 77. During the ſame period of 17 years, the income of this particular eſtate was tripled.</p>
            <p>While the peaſants were in a ſtate of vaſſalage, Zamoiſki was obliged to build cottages and barns for them, and furniſh them with ſeed, ſtock and implements of huſbandry. But ſince they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their freedom, they are able to provide all theſe neceſſaries for themſelves, and pay an annual rent to the proprietor, in lieu of the perſonal ſervice which was formerly exacted.</p>
            <p>In point of morals, the improvement of the peaſants is equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. While they were ſlaves, they were frequently guilty of groſs crimes, and ſometimes in a fit of drunkenneſs, would murder travellers. For ſuch diſorders their maſter was obliged to pay a fine, called in the poliſh law, <hi>pro incontinentia ſubditorum.</hi> Since their emancipation, ſuch diſorders have almoſt entirely ceaſed.</p>
            <p>Upon ſigning the deed of enfranchiſement, the benevolent Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſki expreſſed to the peaſants ſome apprehenſions, that encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by their freedom, they would fall into every ſpecious of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, and commit more diſorders than when they were under the reſtraints of a maſter's authority. The good ſenſe of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is worthy of particular notice; it was to this effect. "When we had no other property than the ſtick which we hold in our hands, we had no encouragement to a right conduct; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to loſe, we acted on all occaſions in an inconſiderate manner; but as ſoon as our houſes, our lands, and our cattle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our own, the fear of forfeiting them will be a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon our actions." The event has manifeſted the ſincerity of theſe declarations, and the truth of the principles they contain. It has ſilenced the ill founded ſurmiſes of the Poliſh nobles, who repreſented their vaſſals as too ungovernable to make a good uſe of their freedom.</p>
            <p>Zamoiſki, pleaſed with the thriving ſtate of his free tenants, has enfranchiſed the peaſants on all his eſtates; and his example has been imitated by other noblemen with ſimilar ſucceſs. Prince Stanislaus, nephew to the King of Poland, whoſe mind has been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a reſidence in England, warmly patronizes the plan of giving liberty to the peaſants. He has enfranchiſed four villages near War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, and condeſcends to direct and aſſiſt the peaſants. He is ſenſible
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026448_0039_0FD055FC891512C0"/>
that ſlavery benums the faculties of the mind, and renders men unfit to plan and direct the cultivation of a farm. He therefore viſits their cottages, ſuggeſts improvements in huſbandry, inſtructs them in the mode of rearing cattle and bees, and points out the errors into which they are betrayed by their ignorance and incapacity. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing population and value, and the improved agriculture of the enfranchiſed villages, the ſuperior neatneſs and convenience of the cottages, and the eaſe, contentment and more orderly lives of the peaſants, mark moſt ſtrikingly the different effects of ſlavery and freedom, and prove beyond cavil or controverſy that the freedom of the laborer is as advantagous to the proprietor of the farm, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificial to the peaſant and his country.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Coxe's travels into Poland, &amp;c. vol. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Why ſhould not ſuch illuſtrious examples of the happy effects of liberty upon domeſtic and rural economy find imitators in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica? Will American planters ſtill object to ſuch a liberal policy, the dullneſs of the faculties and the inferiority of the nature, of their ſlaves? Will they forever be the dupes of viſionary theories and a ſuperficial philoſophy? Is there no Zamoiſki, no Stanislaus in the ſouthern departments of our free Republic, who will hazard one effectual experiment?

Let Americans remember that in Poland and Ruſſia it is yet generally believed that their peaſants are incapable of obtaining any ſolid advantages from freedom; and that ſo lately as the year 1766, the economical ſociety of Peterſburgh, at the requeſt of ſome unknown perſon, who made them a preſent of money for the purpoſe, offered a large premium, to the author of the beſt Diſſertation on this queſtion; "Whether it is moſt advantageous to the State that the peaſant ſhould poſſeſs land or only perſonal effects, and to what point ſhould that property be extended for the good of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic."<note n="*" place="bottom">One hundred and ſixty-four Diſſertations were ſent to the Society on this occaſion, and the prize was given to a Mr. Bearde, doctor in Canon and civil law at Aix-la-Chapelle.

For it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that ſlavery diſcourages agriculture and manufactures, not only by taking from the laborer every motive that God and Society give him to prompt him to exertion, but by inſpiring the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of lands with a contempt of all manual labor, and rendering <hi>diſreputable</hi> the very occupations from which they derive ſubſiſtence and wealth. Who could imagine that the feudal and papal ſyſtems in Europe ſhould have ſo corrupted and perverted the minds of men, as to render low and degrading the noble employments of huſbandry and manufactures; employments which, in the age of Homer, were the buſineſs of kings and queens; and arts the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of which were deified. Aſtoniſhing truth! The moſt inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Baron of Europe, by a cuſtomary inverſion of all ideas of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and propriety, affects to deſpiſe the occupations over which Ceres and Minerva once preſided with the rank of Goddeſſes. By the eſtabliſhment of feuds and of the papal hierarchy, all ideas of primeval ſimplicity and purity of taſte and manners were loſt or corrupted; kings, prieſts and monks engroſſed all real property, and the military and ſacerdotal profeſſions alone became honorable. To ſo low a condition were huſbandry, manufactures and commerce reduced, that in the opinion of the nobility and higher orders of the clergy throughout Europe, a nobleman could not purſue either of thoſe occupations without degrading himſelf and forfeiting his rank. In a great part of Europe this opinion ſtill prevails, and in ſome countries, it is ſupported by the laws. By a law of Poland, a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a man who poſſeſſes a freehold, or who can trace his deſcent from anceſtors who formerly poſſeſſed a freehold eſtate; who has followed no trade or commerce and is at liberty to chooſe the place of his habitation: but if he follows any trade or commerce, he loſes his title and is degraded.<note n="*" place="bottom">Coxe's Poland vol. 1. 136. 147. 149.</note> By the laws and cuſtoms of Spain, a principal proof of a man's title to nobility is, that he has never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed any of the ſervile profeſſions, and to ſuch and extreme is this ridiculous pride and contempt of buſineſs carried in ſome provinces, that even merchants are not permitted to attend the theater with the nobility.<note n="†" place="bottom">Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

in a greater or leſs degree, is obſervable in the Weſt-Indies and in America, among the proprietors of ſlaves. By the prevalence of ſuch falſe notions, a country is doubly injured—the proprietor and all his family are rendered unproductive hands, and moſtly uſeleſs—the ſlave or cultivator, the mechanic and the trader are rendered leſs productive and uſeful hands, by being robbed of that honorable rank and eſtimation among men which is the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſtimulus to exertion, and which ought ever to be held up as a prize to reward honeſt induſtry.

               </gap>otions render a great portion of the actual capital of a State unproductive; for when men of buſineſs, have acquired fortunes, they aſpire to rank, relinquiſh their buſineſs, and purchaſe titles. Their property, inſtead of forming an active capital in trade or manufactures, is converted into real eſtate or funded ſtock, or what is worſe, loaned to foreigners, and the intereſt conſumed by this new fangled nobility, in idleneſs and diſſipation. Such is the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in many parts of Europe; and wherever this falſe pride pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the productive occupations of life are neglected by the wealthy and well-informed who ought to be their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, and who are the moſt able to render them flouriſhing. The conſequence is, that the nobles themſelves are often poor, and their country is ſtill poorer; deſtitute of arts, of induſtry and reſources.</p>
            <p>This contempt of buſineſs, wherever it prevails, is a moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calamity, as it ſtrikes at the very root of national induſtry, and conſequently of national wealth and power. A very little political arithmetic will ſhow the magnitude of this evil, in a ſtrong point of view. It muſt be obſerved that property, when employed in profitable undertakings, whether mercantile, agricultural or manufacturing, reſembles money at compound intereſt. If one hundred pounds produce ſix pounds clear profit in a year, and the proprietor ſquanders away the ſix pounds at the end of the year, his capital ſtock will never be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But if the ſix pounds of profit, at the years end, are added to the original ſtock, the proprietor then has one hundred and ſix pounds as a capital for the ſecond year. In this manner he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, adding his profits to his ſtock, which is an operation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely ſimilar to that of adding intereſt to principal which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces compound intereſt. Let it then be ſuppoſed that in a ſtate or kingdom, there are 10,000 families of nobility or planters, who cultivate their lands by means of ſlaves and who do not labor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In 10,000 families, we may ſuppoſe about 70,000 ſouls; one fourth or 17,500 adult males; and nearly the ſame number or 17000 females. Suppoſe every able bodied laborer to be worth 60 dollars by the year, which is the general hire of a laboring man in America; and every adult female to be worth 17 dollars a year, which is leſs than the actual value of female labor in America. The whole annual value of the labor of 17,500 men is 1, 050,000 dollars; and that of 17,000 females, 289,000, dollars, in the whole, 1,339,000 dollars. But to be very moderate in my calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, I will ſuppoſe the annual value of the labor of 10,000 fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to be only 1,300,000 dollars; and this ſum to be employed and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026448_0042_0FD048468EA19B00"/>
augmented upon the principles of compound intereſt at 6 per cent. for one century. The reſult would be that a ſtock of 1,300,000 dollars would, in a century, produce upwards of four hundred and twenty millions of dollars. Ten thouſand idle families therefore in a State, would, upon a very moderate calculation, and in one century, make that difference in the value of the products of that State.</p>
            <p>This eſtimate ſuppoſes that ſtock will produce ſix per cent per ann, that no part of the ſtock or produce is diverted from conſtant employment, and that the 10,000 families will produce hands enough, if employed, to work the whole ſtock thro the whole peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. Whatever deductions may and ought to be made in fact from the reſult of this calculation on account of circumſtances not taken into conſideration, ſtill the proceſs will demonſtrate the immenſe difference in the effects of freedom and ſlavery, in regard to the wealth and power of a country.</p>
            <p>But facts as well as calculations corroborate theſe principles. From the moſt accurate accounts of the exports of ſeveral nations of Europe, together with the revenues and imports, we are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in this concluſion, that the actual produce of a country is nearly in an exact proportion to the degree of freedom enjoyed by its inhabitants. The ſoil and climate of ſome countries are leſs favorable to induſtry than thoſe of other countries, and the roads and convenience for navigation may make a conſiderable differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the exports of different countries. But all theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being equal, and the laboring people all enjoying equal freedom and encouragement, the exports of all countries would likewiſe be equal, as well as the internal conſumption. If every man had land or materials of his own, his whole induſtry would be exerted in producing, and his appetites would be fully gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſuming his own productions; the ſurplus would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Theſe are true general principles as they reſpect nations. The exports of a country therefore are one of the principal crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria of the value of its productions. On this principle let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the induſtry of Spain and Poland with that of Great Britain and America. It will be admitted that the natural fertility of both Spain and Poland is equal, if not ſuperior, to thoſe of Great Britain and America, and in point of conveniences for foreign commerce, Spain is not inferior to either. The following table will exhibit the number of Inhabitants in each nation, the annual value of the exports from each in Spaniſh dollars, and what ought to be exported from Spain and Poland, if the inhabitants were as induſtrious, as thoſe of Great Britain and America.</p>

                  <p>It may perhaps be enquired why, upon theſe principles, the exports of the United States of America, are not in proportion to thoſe of Great-Britain; as the inhabitants of America are at leaſt as free as thoſe of Great-Britain. Perhaps the internal conſumption in America, may partly account for this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but a more ſatisfactory anſwer is, that Americans almoſt all cultivate the earth, whereas a great proportion of the people in Great-Britain are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures; and it is a well known fact, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The manufacturers of England alone, are ſuppoſed to be upwards of 4,000,000 perſons or 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Vol. 1. 9. and 10.</note> Suppoſe them 10 per cent. and the intereſt of money five, the net profit is 6 per cent. which difference is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely in favor of that manufacturing kingdom; for lands in America do not produce 4 per cent. net profit; probably not three.</p>
                  <p>But there is a farther explanation of this apparent difference. The exports of Great-Britain conſiſt principally of manufactures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the raw materials of the principal Engliſh manufactures, are imported from other countries; and when the articles are entered for ſhipment and exportation, the price of the raw materials is included with the price or value of the goods at the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom houſe. Thus about ¼ of the wool manufactured in England, is imported from Spain—25,000 tons of iron, which is wrought into hardware, all the cotton and ſilk which are manufactured are imported. Theſe articles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the principal value of the exported manufactures.</p>
                  <p>In America the caſe is different—almoſt all our exports conſiſt of articles produced in the country; proviſions, raw materials, &amp;c. On theſe articles, there is only one advance; that upon the original labor and expenſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them. But on the raw materials imported into Great-Britain, there are two advances—one to the nation producing them—and a ſecond advance upon the labor and expenſe of manufacturing; to which may be added the freight and charges which are paid by the importer, and form a part of the firſt coſt to the manufacturer, and on which like wiſe he has an advance. Suppoſe the ſine wool imported into Great-Britain from Spain, to be worth in the fleece, 1 <hi>ſ</hi> 6 ſterling a pound; at this price 40,000 c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is about the quantity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſent to Great-Britain, will amount to 300,000l. Suppoſe this wool at the place of ſhipment to be worth 20 per cent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more, the value of this article to Spain may be eſtimated at 300,000. Suppoſe the freight and charges to be 5 per cent; this wool will coſt the importer 390,000l.—and if the importer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not the manufacturer, the former muſt alſo have his advance upon the wool; ſo that the manufacturer will probably pay 420,000l. for this quantity of wool. He then works the wool into cloth; but in the proceſs, it goes through ſeveral hands, who all have a profit on their labour; and finally the articles manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured are exported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with an advance or profit of 10 or 12 per cent. on the original value in the fleece, and on all the intermediate advances. To theſe circumſtances, it is probably owing that the exports of Great-Britain, exceed in value thoſe of America, in proportion to her inhabitants; and not to any ſuperior induſtry of the nation. Perhaps alſo the minerals, tin and lead, may furniſh a greater value with a given portion of labor, than land. On this I am not qualified to decide; but England exports in theſe articles about 2½ millions ſterling annually. America exports no mineral productions worth notice. It is probable however, that the lands in England, produce more than in many parts of America, where the ſame labor is beſtowed upon both. The high ſtate of agricultural improvements in that country, warrants this concluſion. America was a wilderneſs 170 year ago; the whole country was covered with one immenſe foreſt. The land was to be cleared of enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous trees—fences were to be made—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oads opened—bridges built—houſes and barns to be erected, before a ſurplus of labor could be applied to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce articles for exportation. New ſettlements ſtruggle many years with theſe difficulties, before they can procure a comfortable ſubſiſtence and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, and a conſiderable part of our inhabitants are yet in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Lands in England, are lately rented at 20<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But whatever may be the productiveneſs of Great-Britain, the enormous duties and taxes paid by the people, counterballance the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits proceeding from their induſtry. All the yearly taxes, and public contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions in Connecticut, including duties on imports and all other charges, are conſiderably leſs than 2 dollars for every ſoul. But the public contributions of all kinds in Great-Britain, amount to ten dollars a ſoul.

Thus from the returns made to the Secretary of the Treaſury, according to his printed report in 1791, the exports of New-York appear to be 2,516,000 dollars, and thoſe of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut only 710,340:<note n="*" place="bottom">The value of the exports of Connecticut is 1,150,000 dollars a year, or ſomething more.</note> Whereas a conſiderable part of the articles exported from New-York are the produce of Connecticut.

It muſt be remarked likewiſe that we cannot any where draw a line which will ſeperate the exports of one State from thoſe of another; that which is here drawn may be as juſt as any. Pennſylvania exports a conſiderable portion of the produce of Delaware; but it is probable a greater portion of the produce of Pennſylvania is ſhipped at Baltimore in Maryland.

                           <p>In the printed report of the Secretary of the Treaſury in 1791, from which the value of exports here uſed is taken, there is mentioned a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the returns from South-Carolina and ſome ſmall ports. This will make a ſmall difference in favor of the ſouthern ſtates. At the ſame time it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed this circumſtance is ballanced by the produce of Pennſylvania export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Maryland and Virginia. Maryland contains only <hi>one ſixth</hi> of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, ſouth of Pennſylvania, yet its exports amount to <hi>one fourth</hi> of the whole exports ſouth of that ſtate, which circumſtance cannot be accounted for, by the greater fertility of its ſoil or induſtry of its inhabitants. Indeed it is well known, that moſt of the produce of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, from the Suſquehanna weſtward, is tranſported ſouthward to Baltimore and the Potomak, and there ſhipped for foreign markets. But ſhould it be found that the exports of the ſouthern ſtates equal thoſe of the northern, it would not be ſurpriſing, conſidering the ſuperior profitableneſs of the principal articles raiſed for exportation in the ſouthern ſtates. There are no conſiderable arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in the northern ſtates, which afford a profit, at all times, equal to that of rice, indigo and tobacco, eſpecially the two former. Beſides, other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are neceſſary to form the baſis of a juſt calculation on this ſubject—ſuch are the expenſe of ſubſiſtence or internal conſumption of home produce, the value of the imports, the balance of trade, the expenſes of each ſtate in maintaining civil government, the clergy, ſchools, roads, &amp;c. I have not materials for even a tolerable eſtimate of this comprehenſive kind. But it is certain the expenſes of ſome of the northern ſtates are beyond compariſon greater than thoſe of the ſouthern. I find the expenſe of maintaining the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in Virginia to be eſtimated by Mr. Jefferſon in his notes, at 25,000 dollars a year. Suppoſe it 30,000. The expenſe of the clergy in Connecticut, who are ſupported moſtly by taxes on their pariſhes, is about 65,000 dollars a year. Virginia contains 747,000 inhabitants—Connecticut 238,000, or leſs than a third of the number—the expenſe of the clergy therefore in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut to that in Virginia, is very little leſs than <hi>ſeven</hi> to <hi>one.</hi> The expenſe of ſchools likewiſe in the eaſtern ſtates, will be found to exceed that of the ſouthern, nearly in the ſame proportion. Many other articles of public expenſe are higher in the northern ſtates. But there is a moſt important difference ſtill to be remarked, between the northern and ſouthern ſtates. The ſtaple articles of export from the ſouthern, are rice, indigo and tobacco. To theſe may be added the wheat of Maryland and Virginia, the tar and turpentine of N. Carolina, the cotton of S. Carolina and Georgia and the lumber of all. Of theſe articles the moſt valuable furniſh a very ſmall part of the immediate conſumption of the inhabitants. Almoſt all the rice, indigo, tobacco, tar, turpentine, and a great portion of the cotton, which are produced in thoſe ſtates, are exported. So many hands are employed in cultivating theſe articles, that there are not mechanics and manufacturers ſufficient to furniſh the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with the neceſſary utenſils and clothing. A large portion of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold furniture, the farming utenſils, carriages, &amp;c. of the ſouthern ſtates, are <hi>imported</hi>—whereas theſe articles are manufactured in the northern ſtates and even <hi>exported.</hi> A great part of the clothing of the ſlaves is imported into the ſouthern ſtates—whereas the northern laboring people manufacture almoſt all their coarſe clothing. The ſouthern ſtates alſo import ſeveral articles of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, as cheeſe; ſome of them import beef and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ork, all which are <hi>exported</hi> from the northern to a conſiderable amount; not to mention wines and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er liquors, of which the ſouthern ſtates require a larger ſupply than the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern. It is probable therefore, that a much <hi>greater proportion</hi> of the <hi>actual produce</hi> of the ſouthern ſtates is <hi>exported,</hi> than of the northern; becauſe a <hi>ſmaller proportion</hi> is conſumed by the inhabitants. This will very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the value of the real products of the ſouthern ſtates. For example, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the northern ſtates to export the value of 10 millions annually, and to conſume of their own productions the value of 70 millions, which is about the actual conſumption, they then import the value of 10 millions in money or goods, and the whole produce is 80 millions. Suppoſe the ſouthern ſtates to export alſo the value of 10 millions, and to conſume of their own productions only 65 millions value, the <hi>whole produce then is only 75 millions.</hi> This ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is probably ſupported by facts; and there is no queſtion that with all the advantages of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when we take into conſideration the great numbers of idle and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive hands in the ſouthern ſtates, we ſhall not be ſupriſed at the fact. The family that cultivates by ſlaves is unproductive itſelf and all its domeſtics. The number of ſuch families I do not know—but if there are in the five ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern ſtates, only 10,000, ſuch families of ſouls each, and each family has ſix menial ſervants, there are 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>0,000 unproductive perſons who add no value to the property of the ſtate, but all ſubſiſt by the labor of others. Of this number of ſouls ½ or ⅓ are adults, capable of labor; the annual labor of 60,000 perſons, half male and half female, would, in the northern ſtates, amount to 2,310,000 dollars, or nearly ¼ of all their preſent exports. Beſides the effect of ſlavery upon the whites is not merely negative; it renders them not only unproductive, but poſitively <hi>prodigal</hi> Idle people are almoſt always profuſe and diſſipated.</p>
                           <p>This view of the ſubject leads to the reaſons why the ſouthern ſtates are ſo deeply involved in debt, why they have leſs enterprize than their northern brethren, and are conſtantly dependant on other nations and ſtates, for ſome of the neceſſary articles of common uſe, the materials for which are in their foreſts and at their doors.</p>
                           <p>Theſe obſervations apply equally well to all the countries of Europe, where the feudal rights remain. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Similar calculations may be made with reſpect to many other countries, and the reſult in every inſtance, will be demonſtrative of the happy effects of freedom. The moſt luxuriant ſoil and the moſt ſalubrious climate are advantages, which, in no country, counterballance the tendency of ſlavery, feudal and domeſtic, to weaken and impoveriſh a country.</p>
            <p>Slavery is equally hoſtile to population, as to national induſtry and enterprize. A country parcelled out into large eſtates is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thinly ſettled, unleſs it has ſome peculiar natural advantages, or abounds with manufacturers or merchants. Even under the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors of the feudal tyranny, Germany and Italy, by engroſſing the

trade of Europe, were conſiderably populous. But France and Pruſſia did not ſhake off the fetters of that ſyſtem till within the preſent century; and Spain, Portugal, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland and Ruſſia, ſhow, by their poverty and ſparſe population, that thoſe countries are ſtill held in chains. England vindicated her rights at an earlier period, and has become proportionably richer.</p>
            <p>Facts of this kind can be neither evaded, nor contradicted; their evidence is concluſive and irreſiſtable; they demonſtrate the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine before advanced, that "ſlavery in all its forms and degrees, is repugnant to the private intereſt and public happineſs of man." Let our efforts then be united to deviſe the moſt eaſy and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual mode of gradually aboliſhing ſlavery in this country. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry the commerce and the moral character of the United States will be immenſely benefited by the change—Juſtice and humanity require it—Chriſtianity <hi>commands</hi> it. Let every benevolent heart rejoice at the progreſs already made in reſtraining the nefarious buſineſs of enſlaving men, and pray for the glorious period when the laſt ſlave who ſighs for freedom ſhall be reſtored to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that ineſtimable right.</p>

P. S. I am lately informed by an intelligent gentleman from Virginia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many planters on the eaſtern ſhore in Virginia have, within a few years, liberated their ſlaves and employed them as hired men; and that ſuch freed men are more profitable as hired men, than they were as ſlaves. I rely on this information and communicate it with pleaſure, as it confirms what has been here advanced; and this ſucceſs will accelerate a general emancipation of ſlaves in the United States—an event devoutly to be wiſhed.</p>

                  <head>REMARKS.</head>
                  <p>From theſe eſtimates, which are founded on the beſt documents and moſt judicious opinions that I have been able to obtain, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the total of public contributions in Connecticut ariſing under the laws of the State (including the expenſe of books and ſtationary for ſchools, which can hardly be conſidered as <hi>public expenditure</hi>) is only 94 cents to each ſoul, or <hi>ſix</hi> dollars and <hi>eleven cents</hi> to each family of 6½ ſouls.</p>
                  <p>It appears alſo that all public contributions under the <hi>laws of the State</hi> are very little more than <hi>one fortieth</hi> part of the annual produce. To theſe muſt be added the duties of impoſt and exciſe paid to the <hi>national</hi> government, which amount to about <hi>one dollar</hi> a head throughout the United States. Each family then pays annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the State and General governments 12 dollars 61 cents, which, on an eſtate of 1166 dollars, the average value of eſtates in Connecticut, is a little more than <hi>one per cent;</hi> or one <hi>twentieth</hi> of the annual produce.</p>
                  <p>If to the foregoing amount of expenditures in Connecticut, we add half a million of dollars for the annual net profit of the labor of the State, we ſhall have ſomething more than <hi>nine millions</hi> of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for the <hi>annual value</hi> of the <hi>productive labor</hi> of the inhabitants. This is more than a <hi>fifth part</hi> of the value of the property, real and perſonal, of the whole State. The reſult is, that the whole value of the real and perſonal property is reproduced in leſs than <hi>five years.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The real eſtate of Connecticut is ſtated above at 30,770,000
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026448_0051_0FD0560E8AEAF7B8"/>
dollars; to which add the ſtock of the farms, 3,600,000, and for the value of utenſils of all kinds, 630,000 and the total amount is 35,000,000 dollars. The exports of the State, being principally the produce of the earth, amount to about 1,150,000 or probably ſomething more. The annual exports then amount to a fraction more than 3 per cent of the value of the real eſtates, ſtock of the farms and utenſils; and nearly to 2¾ per cent of the whole prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of the State.</p>
                  <p>If the value of the whole annual produce of the State is nine millions, and the exports 1,150,000, the exports are a little more than ⅛ of the whole produce; the other <hi>ſeven parts</hi> of the eight remain for home conſumption.</p>

               <p>It has been ſhown that the Inhabitants of Connecticut contribute leſs than two dollars a head for all public purpoſes. Let this fact be compared with the ſtate of taxes in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>The annual revenue of Great Britain is £16,000,000 ſterling or nearly 71,000,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>Taxes for the ſupport of the poor £2,000,000 ſterling or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 8,888,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>The tithes nearly £3,000,000 ſterling or 13,332,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>Total 93,220,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>Other public contributions are not known and omitted.</p>
               <p>This ſum divided among the inhabitants of Great Britain (Ireland is not included) who are eſtimated at 8,500,000, gives 10 dollars 95 cents to each perſon, and 65 dollars, 70 cents to a family of ſix ſouls.—</p>
               <p>This is within a ſmall fraction, ſix times as much as is paid in Connecticut, where public charges are probably as high as in any State in the Union. If many other public charges in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are added the calculation will be nearer the truth, and much more in favor of our own country.</p>
               <p>The expenſe of ſubſiſtence in Great Britain is there eſtimated at <hi>ſix pence</hi> ſterling a day for each perſon, including all deſcriptions of people—This amounts to 40 dollars in a year. More than a <hi>fourth part</hi> of this ſum is paid to Government, to the clergy and the poor; whereas in Connecticut the public contributions amount only to 1-18th of the ſubſiſtence of each perſon, eſtimated at 35 dollars.</p>

               <p>That ſtate of ſociety and that form of government that render the greateſt proportion of the inhabitants <hi>productive</hi> laborers, are beſt calculated to make a nation proſperous, wealthy and powerful; and <hi>e converſo,</hi> the greater number of <hi>unproductive</hi> hands among the people, the poorer and more feeble will they be <hi>as a nation,</hi> tho in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals may poſſeſs immenſe property.</p>

                  </gap>ut, it is preſumed there are not 4000 <hi>unproductive</hi> adults among the whole number of 238,000; which is about 1 to 60.</p>
               <p>I know not the whole number of familes in the five ſouthern ſtates in America that poſſeſs ſlaves; but ſuppoſe 10,000 ſuch fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies, which is probably a moderate ſuppoſition. In each of theſe families may be 6 whites and 6 black menial ſervants, all of whom are <hi>unproductive.</hi> Of theſe 12 ſouls in a family, 4 may be children incapable of much labor; there will then remain 8 adults to a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or 80,000 unproductive adults in the 10,000 families. If we then ſuppoſe all the other unproductive adults in thoſe ſtates to be 20,000, the whole number will be 100,000, which is nearly 1 to 18 of all the inhabitants of thoſe <hi>five</hi> ſtates. This circumſtance alone would make an immenſe difference between the productive labor of thoſe ſtates, and that of the northern. And this is one principal cauſe of the poverty of the feudal and Roman Catholic countries in Europe. Princes and nobility, with all their retainers and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, together with the <hi>regular</hi> clergy and an undue proportion of the <hi>ſecular,</hi> are all <hi>unproductive.</hi> One certain pernicious effect of ſlavery, then is to fill a country with an undue proportion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>productive people; for the maſter and all his family become idlers. Not only ſo, but in America at leaſt, it is a further diſcouragement to induſtry, by preventing the introduction of <hi>free</hi> laborers; few freemen being willing to labor with ſlaves.</p>
               <p>The hire or net profit of a free laboring man in New-England, is 60 dollars a year. The hire of a ſlave in Virginia, is only 40 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, even on a tobacco plantation; yet tobacco is a more profitable article, than the produce of New-England. This circumſtance ſhows the ſtriking difference in the value of the labor of freemen in New-England and ſlaves in Virginia. The ſame difference exiſts in Virginia, for a free white cannot be hired for a year at leſs than 60 or 70 dollars.<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter from the Hon. Mr. Maddiſon.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The average expenſe of feeding and clothing male laboring ſlaves in Virginia, is 18 dollars a year, which added to his hire, makes the annual value of his labor 58 dollars. But a laboring man in New-England, at the loweſt value of the proviſion and clothing, conſumed by people of that deſcription, cannot be maintained for leſs than 50 or 60 dollars a year. The whole value of the labor of a free white in New England, is therefore at leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10 dollars a year.<note n="†" place="bottom">To aſcertain the exact value of the labor of a hired man, his clothing muſt be deducted from the foregoing ſum—a hired man is furniſhed by his employer with <hi>food</hi> and <hi>lodging,</hi> but he furniſhes his own <hi>clothing</hi> out of his wages. Deduct 20 or rather 25 dollars for clothing, and the actual profit of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

little more for the boarding of a man, which is too low. It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the diet of every family in New-England, including men, women and children, riſes nearly to half a dollar a head. Eſtimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the board and lodging of a male laborer at 5-6ths of a dollar by the week, which may be ſafely done, and his hire at 60 dollars a year, and his labor is worth 103 dollars and a third, which is nearer the truth.</p>
               <p>When we take into conſideration, the firſt purchaſe of a ſtock of ſlaves, the riſk of their life and health, the expenſes of ſubſiſtence and overſeers, with the loſs of property by their negligence and thieviſhneſs, we ſhall find this much the moſt expenſive mode of cultivation, A few articles only, as rice, indigo, cotton and the ſugar cane, will bear the expenſes. But when we add the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and profligacy occaſioned among the proprietors by this mode of cultivation, all calculation muſt ceaſe.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid in the foregoing eſſay, that it is probable the internal conſumption of produce in the ſouthern ſtates, is much leſs than in the eaſtern and northern.</p>
               <p>The eſtimated annual charge of ſupporting a male laboring ſlave in Virginia, is 18 dollars. The expenſe of ſupporting children muſt be much leſs—but I will include children, and ſuppoſe 18 dollars a head to be the annual charge of ſubſiſtence and clothing. Virginia conta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Then 292,000 free perſons in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates annually conſume property to the amount of 10,220,000 dollars. This difference of expence or internal conſumption being 4,964,000 dollars, on leſs than 300,000 ſouls, ſhows the difference between the products of the northern and ſouthern ſtates; for it is not ſuppoſeable that the amount of the difference is conſumed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the luxuries of a few planters. The expence of maintenance in S. Carolina is much higher, becauſe of the higher prices of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and clothing; at the ſame time, the culture of the rice and indigo is much more profitable. The annual exports of the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates are leſs than thoſe of the northern, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, by the difference of 720,000 dollars. But taking into conſideration, the immenſe difference in the expenſe of maintaining ſlaves, which makes the difference of internal conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there is little doubt that the actual yearly produce of the ſouthern ſtates, in proportion to the number of ſouls, is leſs than that of the northern by the difference of 5, 6 or 7 millions of dollars.</p>

               <head>No. V. Comparative view of the productiveneſs of Ireland and Connecticut.</head>
               <p>Ireland contains about 3,000,000 people. Its exports amount annually to 3,500,000 ſterling or 15,540,000 dollars. Its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports then equal, or rather exceed thoſe of America, in proportion to its inhabitants. But this will not prove the ſuperior product<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iveneſs of Ireland, for the home conſumption is a material conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

There are in Ireland, according to Arthur Young Eſq. who has examined this ſubject with minute attention, about 2 million of <hi>Cottars</hi> (cottagers) or peaſants, who moſtly live on potatoes and butter-milk. They conſume annually 60 barrels of potatoes in a family of 6 or 7 perſons—a barrel weighing 280lb. and containing about 4 Engliſh buſhels—A barrel, at an average price throughout the country, is worth 2<hi>ſ</hi>7½ ſterling; or 3<hi>ſ</hi>6 lawful money of New-England. Then 60 barrels at 3<hi>ſ</hi>6—10l. 10s. or 35 dollars, which is the principal expenſe of food for a family.</p>
               <p>The cloathing of the Iriſh Cottars is trifling, the children are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt naked great part of the year—and adults are often without ſhoes and ſtockings—ſuppoſe the clothing and additional food of a family to be 45 dollars a year, then 80 dollars is the amount of the ſubſiſtence of a family of 6½ ſouls—which is nearly 12 1-3 dollars a head—Suppoſe it 14 dollars a head then the annual ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of 2 millions amounts to 28,000,000.</p>
               <p>That this eſtimate is near the truth is evident from the price of labor in Ireland; which, for a male laborer, amounts, on an ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thro the year, to ſix pence halfpenny ſterling a day—Deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sundays and three holidays only, there remain 310 days for labor. Suppoſe every man to labor 310 days in the year; the amount of wages of a day-labourer at 6½ ſterling is l. 8. 6s. 11d. or 38 dollars nearly. In two families of 6½ ſouls each or 13 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, there will be found 3 male adults—3 female do. 4 young perſons under adult years and 3 children.</p>
