            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE general intention of occaſions like the preſent, may be ſuppoſed to be rather amuſement and pleaſure than real improvement; and the ſpeaker may be thought to have performed his duty, if he ſhall have gratified the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or animated the paſſions of his audience. Although this be pleaſing to the mind, and ought not to be altogether above our preſent aim: yet, exiſting circumſtances demand ſomething more uſeful than pleaſure, and more ſerious than amuſement.</p>
            <p>ON this day, which is ſet apart by the COLUMBIAN ORDER, to celebrate their Anniverſary, and to renew, in a public manner, their mutual tokens of brotherhood, of friendſhip, and of patriotiſm—At this period when all Europe is involved in confuſion, and wrapt in war, and when even the peaceful hemiſphere of this Weſtern world begins to redden with the martial flame—At this critical ſeaſon, when the intereſts of our country demand one heart, and one ſoul, and one uplifted arm; and when our enemies may be privately employed in ſowing diſſentions among us, and dividing our ſtrength; what ſubject ſhould equally arreſt our attention; what is of comparative importance with
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027169_0006_0FD392F561EE7A48"/>UNION: The proper influence of this principle will diffuſe harmony through all ranks, will encreaſe and eſtabliſh the advantages of the nation, will make ſtrong and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable what before was contemptible and weak, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways oppoſe an impenetrable phalanx to the bold front of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger.</p>
            <p>YOUR attention will, therefore, be called to this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject, which naturally divides itſelf into two branches, the UNION of the STATES, and UNION of SENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</p>
            <p>WHO can caſt his eyes over this extenſive region, and traverſe our country from New-Hampſhire on the north, to Georgia on the ſouth, and not perceive that PROVIDENCE deſigned us to be a great and <hi>united</hi> nation? Our lines are marked by the very hand of nature. On the eaſt the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic waſhes a various and extenſive coaſt; on the weſt, the broad and rapid Miſſiſſippi pours its ſtream along; and on the north the river St. Lawrance, and a chain of auguſt lakes, form a natural boundary. Within theſe limits marked by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable lines, and abundantly extenſive for the purpoſes of one empire, do we not find a variety of climate and of ſoil, and a rich diverſity of productions, ſufficient for all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies and elegancies of life? Have we not hence, ample reſources within the boſom of our country, which, from their very nature, are inexhauſtible, and which require nothing but our united exertions to be adequate to every uſeful purpoſe? Inveſted by nature with ſtrength, it belongs to us to avail ourſelves of it, and to become expert in all the modes of its appropriation. But diſunion would defeat theſe beneficent purpoſes of nature, and totally annihilate thoſe advantages which a kind PROVIDENCE has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:027169_0007_0FD392F75DCCC4D8"/>
THE particular advantages attendant on the cloſe and continued UNION of the States, ariſe from a variety of ſources, are evident upon the leaſt reflection, and are equally certain as to their favourable conſequences. Not to mention the powerful influence which Union would have on MORALITY, the pureſt fountain of national happineſs and glory—Does not COMMERCE always flouriſh in proportion to the excellence of commodities, and the ſafety and facility of reciprocal interchange? and are not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of our country although various, yet generally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſupport of life, and requiſite for the wants of civilized ſociety? Union would therefore give occaſion to a continued and encreaſing exchange of commodities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the different States, to their mutual convenience and emolument. And, if the wealth of a country be an object both ſplendid and uſeful, the ſpirit of Commerce, like the breeze which fills the ſail, ſhould breathe freely and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. But though this domeſtic commerce ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt exorbitant wealth, yet what it does afford, will be conveniently and with little hazard, acquired: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it ought to be remembered, that a nation becomes happy and elegant, not ſo much by the mere accumulation of wealth, as by the rapid circulation of that wealth, in the different channels of induſtry. This is the powerful cauſe which throws life and vigour into every department; gives a ſpring of conſtant activity to the public mind, and diffuſes a poliſh and agreeable ſplendor over the face of ſociety. Who can be made to believe that this country would derive half that ſtrength, half that reſpectability, half that degree of glory from the poſſeſſion of the mines of Mexico and Peru, which ſhe would obtain from a ſmall proportion of that wealth, acquired by labor, by the hazard of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027169_0008_0FD392F838131658"/>and by the exertions of genius? Let the proprietors of thoſe golden mountains examplify the truth which the queſtion ſuggeſts.</p>
            <p>THERE is another advantage intimately connected with COMMERCE, and of no leſs importantce than Commerce itſelf: By a frequent intercourſe between the citizens of theſe States, manners, cuſtoms, and language, would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually aſſimilate; little aſperities would gradually wear away; till, after a certain period, one ſpirit of friendſhip would pervade, and one ſoul of harmony actuate the whole of this free empire. This repreſentation is not the ideal fabric of fancy, it is founded on the nature of ſociety, and will certainly be the happy conſequence of a firmly cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed UNION.</p>
            <p>IF the ſubject be viewed in a POLITICAL point of light the advantages of Union will appear equally obvious and ſtriking. The policy of a meaſure always reſults from its nature, and from attendant circumſtances. The very ſituation of the country, both natural and civil, exhibits the high policy of union. Are we not ſurrounded with a huge chain which ſeems to have been purpoſely deſigned to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace within its mighty circumference, the intereſts, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the liberties of one great nation? So weighty is this chain and at preſent ſo ſtrong, that it will not only require an unnatural and violent concuſſion to burſt its links aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but if once broken, it will probably remain, in defiance of art or ſtrength, of policy or danger, forever ſeparate, and for ever widning into a greater chaſm.</p>
            <p>CONTEMPLATING the firſt ſettlement of this country, when ſmall colonies planted themſelves in different parts of the American territory, ſome preferring the Northern and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027169_0009_0FD392FC09719658"/>ſome the Southern regions, it is eaſy to perceive that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable difference would obtain in the appearance, in the lives, and in the manners of this widely ſcattered ſociety. But, as they chiefly came from one nation, as they ſpoke one language, as they naturally imbibed the ſame ideas of civil government, and drank of the ſame ſpirit of freedom; it is as eaſy to perceive that they would, upon the great ſcale, be marked by a general ſimilarity; and be, in fact, ONE PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE. Here, then, we ſee diverſity amid ſimilarity, and a conſiderable variety amid a general uniformity. What conſequence ought properly to flow from theſe ſeparate qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities? Independent and unconnected States? No. This would be a violation of the principle of uniformity. Ought it then to be one compact and conſolidated empire? This would equally violate the principle of diverſity. The only juſt and natural conſequence would be both a <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>general</hi> government. This would not be the reſult of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome theory, or a choice from the wide field of ſpeculation; it would ariſe from the very nature of the country, and from the civil ſituation of its inhabitants. You perceive, then, my fellow-citizens, that the PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, in forming their preſent political compact, have conformed to their reſpective local and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive poſitions, and acted upon the generous plan which the hand of nature had previouſly ſketched. With ſimilar wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will a people always act, if they enter into deliberation; and, on ſuch important ſubjects, they will always deliberate, if they are free. The governments which we have made for ourſelves, and under which we happily live, are both particular and general. And, if the nation have prudence to keep the wheels of each revolving within their proper ſphere, ſufficiently confined to prevent too wide a deviation;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027169_0010_0FD39301324F1EB0"/>yet, ſufficiently looſe to move with facility; may we not hope that, like the ſun, and the planets which roll round his orb, their revolutions will be performed with equal beauty and harmony, till, the frame of nature disjointed, annihilate all human works, in order to introduce divine?</p>
            <p>IF the preſent <hi>Federal Union</hi> be diſolved; one of theſe two conſequences muſt, if not immediately, yet not very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely, follow—either a CONSOLIDATED EMPIRE, or ſeveral DISTINCT and UNCONNECTED STATES. Would not the firſt require ſuch a high-toned government, ſuch an exorbitant proportion of power in the executive, and ſuch a vaſt multiplicity of officers flowing from it, that the mild influence of law would ſoon yield to the ſuperior ſway of official authority? And if one department embrace ſuch an undue proportion of power, will not its appetite increaſe in a ſimilar ratio? Will it probably be ever ſatiated till it have ſwallowed up the two other departments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Where, then, will be your priviledges, your laws of freedom, and your glorious republican edifice? When the imperial power began at Rome, it amuſed the people with the continuance of the conſular autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and other popular eſtabliſhments, at the ſame time that it was gradually abſorbing their ſtrength, till noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was left, but the ſhadow and paltry form of liberty—till in fact, the conſulate, that dignified office, which awaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ambition of a Cato and a Tully, and other true patriots, became ſo degraded, that a <hi>horſe</hi> was once inveſted with its honors, and I ſuppoſe performed very well, all the duties which it then embraced. So, perhaps, a conſolidated go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wrapped in the ſpecious veil of forbearance and flattery, would at firſt move eaſily along, and preſs as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027169_0011_0FD3930300E9CB90"/>as poſſible upon the public mind: but how ſoon would it be like the "letting out of waters", at firſt gently preſſing through a narrow breach; till, wearing a ſufficient paſſage, they ſweep along with the fury of a torrent, impetuous and irreſiſtible!</p>
            <p>WHAT is meant by this word <hi>Conſolidation?</hi> It has a ſtrong and compact ſound, and ſeems ſomewhat formidable in its very appearance. It expreſſes very well its peculiar meaning. What is it but forcing into one maſs uniform and undiſtinguiſhable that which is by nature, by reaſon, and the power of habit, beautifully diverſifyed? What is it in fine, but a total deſtruction of the State Governments? And if theſe be once demoliſhed, where is the guardian who can ſo well inſpect the affairs, ſo well attend to the wants, ſo intimately feel the particular intereſts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people? Can one eye, however wakeful and piercing, watch the ſacred depoſit with as much ſafety, as the quick and vivid glance of fifteen Sovereign and United States? If you level theſe elevations, on what will you aſcend to view the ever varying aſpects of the political horizon? If you throw down theſe watch towers, whence will you at the encroachment of foreign or civil tyranny, ſound ſo legally the dire alarm? But the American people are too wiſe, are too happy—they have drank too deep of the ſweet ſtream of liberty, and perceive too clearly the advantages of a <hi>federal</hi> union, not to feel themſelves rouſed and indignant at the thoughts of conſolidation. Their voice is unanimous for UNION and FREEDOM, except perhaps a trifling few who ſigh for <hi>garters,</hi> for <hi>ribbons,</hi> and for <hi>ſtars,</hi> pretty royal play things—and who would ſell their rights and their country, for a ſong.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:027169_0012_0FD3930476172EE8"/>
BUT, ſuppoſing that the diſſolution of the federal union, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of terminating in conſolidation, ſhould widen into ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unconnected ſovereignties, would our ſituation be more eligible? If the union be broken, at the ſame moment will decline the common ſpirit of affection which ſo happily pervades this country. The Georgian would no more call the Carolinian brother; and the Pennſylvanian and New-Yorker would begin to eye each other with "mutual aſpect malign." If the union be diſſolved, at that inſtant ſtart up in horrid ſhapes, different intereſts, contrary ſentiments, ſelfiſh views, with all the hated paſſions which pride and mad ambition fire. Though at preſent the ſeveral ſtates are acknowledged to have intereſts ſomewhat different, yet they are held in harmonious arrangment, and are made to promote their mutual advantage by the powerful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influence of Union. But the moment that band is burſt, that moment they all fly at random; mix and claſh and jar with horrid concuſſion, till they produce one diſmal ſcene of woe and confuſion. So a machine, completed by the perfection of mechanic art, performs its operations in equal and orderly movements, till, ſhocked too rudely by ſome unſkilful hand, the governing power gives way, and all the work ſuddenly ſinks into total diſorder. Or, to compare great things with ſmall, thus, the ſolar ſyſtem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving through the vaſt of nature in ſublime and celeſtial harmony, if once looſened from the mighty influence of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, would exhibit beneath the cope of heaven, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and ſuns, and comets, in dire diſorder—now darting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immenſity of ſpace—now claſhing with horrid and loud jarring diſcord, till the whole univerſe has ruſhed into rapid ruin.</p>

IF therefore, we were ſplit by ſome diſcordant power into ſeveral unconected ſovereignties, we ſhould probably ſoon repent of the change. Was there not, about the time of forming the new conſtitution, ſome ſerious converſation reſpecting a diviſion of the American nation into three grand departments—the northern, the middle, and the ſouthern? Where the lines of ſeparation were to run, I believe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, and it is to be hoped, never will be aſcertained. For, it is an incontrovertible maxim, that ſo long as human nature continues the ſame, ſimilar circumſtances will always give riſe to ſimilar events. And, as ſoon as we are a divided people, our ſituation with reſpect to each other, will be like that of the Europeans; and, very probably, we ſhall act over again, thoſe ſcenes of famous folly which they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acted. One of our <hi>new made empires,</hi> perhaps the preſent ſtate of New-York, may fancy that ſhe has received ſome inſult from another of our <hi>new made empires;</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Pennſylvania. We muſt preſerve our dignity; we muſt keep our honor free from ſtain; we will be treated with more reſpect. What! ſhall our national ſovereignty be trampled upon by that proud and imperious people? No. We ſhall teach her a leſſon of humility, and convince her to her ſorrow, that in provoking the reſentment of Yorkers, the has rouſed the ſpirit of heroes. Have we not a firm band of patriotic citizens, who will ſtep forth with proud obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to vindicate the national honor? Have we not twenty thouſand hardy ſons of the north, whoſe breaſts burn for the conflict, and who would glory to reduce that haughty rival? And if theſe be not ſufficient, is not the brave nation of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont always prepared for battle, and always ready to join in league with their former brothers of New-York? Thus, my fellow-citizens, would we ſoon ſwell with pride, adopt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027169_0014_0FD3930AF09D1568"/>the language and imitate the deſtructive conduct of the European nations. League would be added to league, not with the view of repelling common danger, or promoting mutual happineſs; but for the diabolical purpoſe of national revenge. And, dreadful to tell, thoſe who now conceive their proſperity to be reciprocal; who are united by habits, by principle, by affection; and who form the moſt amiable and beautiful republic on the earth, would, like the beaſts of the deſart, furiouſly ſpring upon and devour each other.</p>
            <p>WOULD not every thing, were we once diſunited, invite to aggreſſion and hoſtility? Our contiguity of ſituation, our open and extenſive ſea-coaſt, the weakneſs of ſome and the ſtrength of other ſtates, would quickly excite ideas of agran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement, and afford frequent occaſions for mutual invaſion and conqueſt. Plunder would ſoon become our trade, and war and murder our national glory. It has been confeſſed that the intereſts of the ſtates are ſomewhat different; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union would greatly augment thoſe differences, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſion them more frequently to interfere and claſh. Each ſtate purſuing its own objects, not only without the ſpirit of accommodation, but with the ſpirit of oppoſition, would conſtrue each cauſual claſhing into deſigned provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they would decide their differences by a haſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to arms. For it is very improbable that the complaiſant principle of forbearance and negociation, by which we are at preſent characterized, would in our diſputes with one another, be obſerved with ſuch ſcrupulous punctuality.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſuppoſing what is indeed very difficult to be imagined, that the ſeparated States, ſhould never light up the torch of war in defiance of each other, what would be their ſituation
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027169_0015_0FD3930CD3A816D8"/>with reſpect to foreign powers? If forbearance would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent injury, if uniform ſubmiſſion would keep inſult at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if tameneſs and cowardice would occaſion the return of reſpect and honor; then, and not till then, might diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted America flatter herſelf with the peace and friendſhip of Tranſatlantic Courts. But, if broken aſunder, ſhall we not become weak in the extreme? And, if weak, ſhall we not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the attacks of every lawleſs invader? Do we not know that the ſtrongeſt motive for inſuring juſtice, is to be in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to inforce it? And, that the moſt effectual argument to preſerve peace, is to be prepared and formidable for war? Who does not know that to rely upon the diſintereſted good will of foreign Courts, is to take grimace for ſincerity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality for wiſdom, the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, and Satan himſelf for an angel of light? But, even if the Tranſatlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Nations ſhould be ſo <hi>ſingularly politie,</hi> as not to harraſs our trade, invade our ſeparated territory, or attempt our ſubjugation; yet, how could we keep ourſelves without the dreadful vortex of their dark and myſterious politics? In ſuch a complicated labyrinth of corruption and oppreſſion; in ſuch a diſmal abyſs of injuſtice and tyranny, if we are once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, we ſhall probably be involved forever. We ſhould find it neceſſary to acquire the habits of perfect ſubmiſſion, and to enter with reluctant acquieſcence into every courtly project. The blood of that heroic nation, which once flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo freely in the cauſe of liberty and of man, would ſtain the cold ſoil of ſlavery, and be waſted in the ſervice of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of deſpotiſm. O my country! if once thou art diſunited, what prophetic eye can foreſee all thy calamities; what pen can deſcribe, or what tongue relate all thy woes! From being the beauty of the whole earth, and the wide aſſylum of oppreſſed millions; thou ſhalt thyſelf become a ſcene of oppreſſion, of ſlavery, of blood!</p>
            <p>

YOUR eyes, my fellow citizens, ſhall probably never witneſs ſuch an awful change. But, it is our duty as men, as chriſtians, as members of a free republic, to make the greateſt exertions in order to preſerve to the lateſt ages, the ſacred rights and priviledges of the nation. How will this important object be accompliſhed, but by the happieſt influence of Union?</p>
            <p>BUT, will the UNION of America enſure all that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which it was calculated and expected to produce—will it acquire vigor and permanency—will it, in a word, be more than half complete, if it be a union only as to FORM, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the UNION of SENTIMENT? This is that ſecret power, which firſt attracted, and ſtill binds, in the tie of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine affection, the hearts of Americans. This is the electric fluid, which fired in any part, ſuddenly vibrates through the whole. This is that intimate ſympathy, which nature has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, which habit has refined, and which external force ſhall never deſtroy.</p>
            <p>NUMEROUS have been the motives, and frequent the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which have excited in the breaſts of Americans, the ſame glow of valor, the ſame throb of freedom, the ſame ſentiments of patriotiſm; when their heroes inſpired by the love of their country, fought ſide by ſide, on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguined plain; and, for their children, their friends, and and the deareſt intereſts of humanity, freely mingled their pureſt blood. See! it flows in immortal ſtreams around the land of freedom, and may it forever flow, and form the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal line which tyranny ſhall never paſs: Say, ye defenders of your country; ye, who ardently ſought the poſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; who dared the utmoſt fury of the ſtorm, and ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted amid the "rocking of the battlements"; ſay, were
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027169_0017_0FD39310EA315888"/>ye not animate<hi rend="sup">1</hi> with one ſublime and patriotic ſentiment, which illuminated and inſpired the glorious efforts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica? But, does not the preſent ſeaſon equally demand, equally urge, equally enforce a firmly cemented Union of all the civic and military virtues? Does not this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment call aloud, on all men who love the reign of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who deſire the happineſs of mankind, who pray for the peace and proſperity of America—to lay aſide their ſmaller differences, to ſtrengthen themſelves for the ſervice of their country, and to brighten into luſtre the high hope of patriotiſm? The alarm, it is true, has not yet called our citizen ſoldiers to the field of danger: the foe does not yet march, to ſpread havoc and deſolation over your fertile plains; to ſtain, with horrid joy, his hands of cruelty in the blood of your reverend fires, and your innocent children; to raviſh from your arms the wife of your boſom, or inſult the virgin of your love. Hoſtile armor does not yet dazzle the affrighted eye, nor does the cannon's dire exploſion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the near approach of terror. What then, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved countrymen? Is this a time when the UNITED flames of love ſhould burn languid, or be mixed with jealous fires? Is this a time of leiſure to attend to the whiſpers of party, or to lend an ear to the clamourous voice of faction? Is this a period in which you ought to fancy yourſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, your glorious privileges beyond the hazard of invaſion, and your country perfectly free from danger? Will liberty in America remain at peace, and triumph undiſturbed; when in Europe, ſhe is attacked by the whole force of deſpotiſm, and threatened with extirpation and death? Behold there the ſcenes of blood and horror which rapidly ſtrike the eye, and give agony to the mind! Peace has retired far off, and all the milder virtues follow weeping in her train! War with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027169_0018_0FD3931526F7EFD8"/>all his dreadful throng, famines, conflagrations, peſtilences, and deaths, ravages the faireſt abodes of man! Nothing is heard but noiſe, and tumult, and the loudly reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſhout of battle. Nothing ſeen but hoſtile preparations, and weapons drenched in human gore. All the atmoſphere is black and turbid; all the ſky dreadfully ſtreaked with fire! See the huge armies ruſhing to the fierce onſet, flaming with revenge! Front oppoſed to front, is ſtretched out, as far as ſight can diſtinguiſh the lengthened line. The nodding plume, the proudly prancing ſteed, the dazzling of armor, and the banners unfurled, announce the dreadful approach. At the emboldening ſound of martial muſic, ſlowly advances the moving terror. The grandeur of the ſcene, increaſing with the danger, inſpires an awful elevation of foul. With an eye that ſpeaks deſperate deeds, and with determined aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they advance to a fearful interval—where death awaits the carnage—The muſic makes a moment's pauſe, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſilence reigns, except where the clattering of armor, the tremor of the horſes, and the perturbation of a hundred thouſand ſouls, excite through all the hoſt a confuſed noiſe, which murmurs on the ear like the diſtant roar of dying thunders. All at once the the drum's inſpiring ſound, and and the trumpet's ſhrill clangor, call to high atchievements, and to feats of glory. The inſtruments of deſtruction are levelled, and a thouſand deaths fly hiſſing through the air. Blood ſtains the earth, and the ſight of blood inſpires with fiercer courage, and more deſperate revenge. On they ruſh, regardleſs of the companion falling at their ſide, and the fiery-mouthed cannon diſgorging inſtant ruin. Involved in ſmoke, the hoſtile fronts meet. Now the claſhing ſwords, the exploding muſketry, the continued roar of thunder, with the doleful ſhrieks of the wounded, and the ſhouts of victory,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027169_0019_0FD39317B477BF58"/>aſſail the ear, and riſe in mingled confuſion to heaven. But ſee? through this dread darkneſs, a glory burſts, and ſheds a luſtre on the diſmal ſcene. Behold! ſurrounded with a radient cloud, LIBERTY in her triumphal car, "rides in this whirlwind and directs the ſtorm." On her right, ſits victory flaſhing terror. The vaſt concave of heaven far reſounds to thunder of her call—FREEDOM or DEATH! Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm hears aghaſt the reverberating roar, and from his iron throne ſtarts in trepidation and diſmay.</p>
            <p>HERETOFORE, in the conteſts of the mighty, Liberty has ſeldom appeared; and when ſhe has, ſhe was generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with misfortune and defeat. But men have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the knowledge of their rights, and the dark reign of deluſion has vaniſhed. From the vigorous arm of our brave allies, has deſpotiſm received his mortal wound. This is the cauſe of the Monſter's ſtruggling ſo violently, and bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſo loud. But, remember that his ſinews are of iron, and his bones of braſs; and, that his agony in death will be direful. He may yet make the effort of deſpair, and wrap the whole world in flames.</p>
            <p>WHO knows how thin may be the partition between us and the moſt iminent danger? Who knows, but before the flight of another month, the ſtorm which now lowers in our horizon, may rapidly riſe and involve us in deſtruction? At a diſtance we hear the thunders roar, and ſee the lightnings play; who can tell how ſoon they may flaſh acroſs our ſky, and enkindle all the fire of war? Then, then, when conſternation walks through the land—when the loud alarm is ſounded— TO ARMS, CITIZENS, TO ARMS! the foe is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing thick and formidable—the banners of ſlavery lower
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027169_0020_0FD393192C0787B8"/>over his front. Your wives, your children, your venerable ſires—your rights as men—your glory as freemen, demand your ſtrenuous efforts—TO ARMS, CITIZENS, TO ARMS, and meet the embattled foe!—When this ſhall be our ſituation; in what ſhall be our ſafety, what ſhall give us firmneſs, what ſhall render us formidable—invincible— victorious, but the POWER of UNION? Breathe then, my fellow citizens, O breathe the ſame ſpirit of freedom; vigorouſly co-operate in the ſame honorable meaſures; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle the ſame ardent glow of patriotiſm, and let your ſouls burn with the nobleſt emulation, in the ſervice of your country. Then if the impetuoſity of war deſcend, you ſhall receive the ſhock like men, and return it like heroes. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny ſhall again fly before you, and liberty ride through the air in ſublime triumph.</p>
            <p>BUT, happy Americans! Although you ought vigorouſly to prepare for your defence; although the "war of freedom is better than the peace of ſlavery;" yet remember that a nation involved in war is like a veſſel in a ſtorm, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plunging into the deep, and ſometimes riding on the ſummit of the wave; but always in the midſt of danger. Let our earneſt endeavours and our fervent prayers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be, for the long continuance of the reign of PEACE. How ſtriking the contraſt between them! One is the breeze, which diffuſes health and pleaſure, and happineſs around—the other is the ſtorm, which ſcowls beneath the face of heaven, and hurries with rapid deſtruction over the earth. One, is the pure and gentle ſtream, which ſweetly murmurs as it flows in various channels, and marks all its courſe with verdure, fertil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and beauty—the other is the deluge which has burſt every mound; roars direful as it rolls along; and ſweeps away
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027169_0021_0FD3931AADEBB8D8"/>flocks, and herds, and houſes, and inhabitants, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar of confuſion, to deſtruction. The one, ſurrounded with a ſhining robe of flowing white, holding high her flouriſhing olive-branch, and ſmiling on man with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt benignity, ſtands confeſt a fair inhabitant of heaven—the other, wrapt in a garb of ſmoke, and blood, and flames, looks round for objects of revenge, and darting fury from his dragon eye, proves his foul origin from the region of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>O my favored country! May the God of Peace, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be thy friend; keep from thy ſacred retreats and thy ſhades of freedom, the demon of war, and diſtinguiſh thee with the bright reign of happineſs and peace! Or if his PROVIDENCE ſhall ſuffer the hoſtile flame again to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle around thee, may he, as in former days, diſplay the power of his protecting arm, and crown thy efforts with victory, and thy name with glory!</p>
            <p>BEFORE I conclude, ſuffer me BROTHERS of the TAMMANY SOCIETY, as inclination and as duty prompt, to offer to you the ſentiments of fraternal affection and regard. Within the walls of your wigwam, has my heart often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded with genuine delight. There innocent pleaſure wanders free and unmoleſted, and ſmiles on every gueſt: There, friendſhip, founded on the pureſt motives, knits in the firm knot of UNION, the hearts of every true brother: There, the flame of patriotiſm, kindled by the tongue of eloquence, and the ſweet voice of freedom, darts from ſoul to ſoul, and illuminates your peacefal hall. And there, if I have any love for my country, any ardor in the cauſe of liberty, any ſtrong deſire for the happineſs of mankind, have
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027169_0022_0FD3931DD6A33E08"/>theſe virtues been, both by precept and example, exalted and refined. May you long, very long be diſtinguiſhed by every trait which can make you reſpected as men, and honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ſociety. Let the principles of your inſtitution be deeply engraven on your hearts, and be diſplayed in all your conduct. You will need no other defence againſt the attacks of calumny, no other qualification to enſure the praiſe of virtue.</p>
            <p>BROTHERS, keep in mind that you are the UNION in miniature. Many are your fires, but they all burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame circle; many are your links, but they all conſtitute one bright and ſtrong chain. Continually breathe upon your fires the breath of affection: This will not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from being extinguiſhed, but will keep alive a a pure and gentle flame. Eſpecially, guard againſt the deſperate paſſion, or the guileful art; that would break aſunder the chain, which ſo happily binds you together: Under their fatal influence, how ſoon would its ſtrength depart, its links be covered with ruſt, and its beautiful poliſh vaniſh away forever! May you, therefore, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that your happineſs as a ſociety, like the glory of your country, depends upon the firmneſs, and can be ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the ſtability of UNION. And may time, as it flows equably along, find you continually ſtrengthening in the principles of Liberty, and progreſſing in the light of Virtue, that you may at length ſhine in the patriotic hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, like a conſtellation of ſuperior magnitude, with bright and permanent luſtre.</p>
            <p>BROTHERS, I know you love the fragrant Calumet of Peace, and delight in the happy leiſure which tranquillity
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027169_0023_0FD3936F4E815548"/>affords. I know you love to wander beneath the ſhade of the wide ſpreading Oak, and to pluck the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring cluſter from the arms of the vine. But I know you alſo love FREEDOM, and will never reſign her but in death. Shew yourſelves, then, worthy of this celeſtial viſitant, by obeying her laws, and defending her rights. Let not the "engines of tyranny ever extinguiſh," nor all the floods of war drown the bright flame which burns in your breaſts. But, when your country calls, diſplay your principles by the UNION of your efforts, and by the energy of your action. See that your quivers be well ſupplied with the keen-pointed arrow, and let the twang of your bows ſound dreadful. The warlike tomahawk, you have with pleaſure, "buried deep" beneath the floor of your wigwam; with heroiſm fly to "unbury it" and, raiſe it high for the ſtroke, "when your country's good requires it;" And ſee how many patriots yet remain, "who have been tried on the rough edge of battle when it raged;" whoſe arm is yet ſtrong, and whoſe ſouls yet glow for their country! See alſo the numerous bands of generous youths, who already breathe deliberate valor, and who burn to be led on to the conteſt of glory!</p>
            <p>IF WAR ſhall invade our territory, and we muſt draw again the keenly tempered ſword of freedom, let it be graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtrong hand, and wielded with all the energy of the UNION. It ſhall then ſweep down whole ranks of ſlaves, and flaſhing rapidly over their hoſts, throw them into terror and defeat. Our laws ſhall flouriſh, our rights be never more invaded, and our glory endure while the ſun rolls round the world, and the GREAT SPIRIT walks on the tops of the mountains. Freedom ſo often victorious, ſhall at length entirely demoliſh the throne of deſpotiſm,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027169_0024_0FD39324D552D8D8"/>cauſe the thunders of war to be heard no more, and inſpire ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH with UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED hearts, to raiſe the univerſal hymn to PEACE, to HAPPINESS and to LIBERTY.</p>
