         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>What? Have we been Labouring ſo many years, to bring our People Home unto their only Saviour; &amp; have all our pains been ſo ineffectual,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001759_0007_0FB7D25CFB1BA720"/>that not Half of our People have to this day come to thoſe <hi>Diſpoſitions of Piety,</hi> upon which they may venture to the Table of the Lord?

<q>What?

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001759_0010_0FB7D2655E2EE208"/>it as your Atonement. Humbly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; <hi>O Holy God, Thy Chriſt has been made a Sacrifice for my Sin. Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do I want ſuch a Sacrifice. I deſpair of of all Help from any other. I preſent that moſt valuable Sacrifice before thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee for the ſake thereof to be Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto me.</hi> When you have Truly done this, you may Safely come, &amp; put in your <hi>Claim</hi> for a Part in the Great Sacrifice. This is done by coming to the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord. It is to be the <hi>Intent</hi> and <hi>Language</hi> of your coming thither!</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Tho' you may be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the <hi>Defects</hi> which may ſtill attend the <hi>Work of Grace</hi> in your Souls, yet you muſt feel the working of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Deſires</hi> in your Souls, to have that work effectually carried on. A <hi>Work of Grace,</hi> lies in a Principle, inclining the Soul, <q>To Fear God, and Prize Chriſt, and Hate all Sin, and Sleight this World, and Do all the Good we can to all about us, and Look and Long for the Felicities of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly World.</q> You muſt be heartily
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001759_0011_0FB7D266D437B478"/>deſirous, as to have a Real <hi>Experience</hi> of this <hi>Work,</hi> ſo to have it carried <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unto <hi>Perfection.</hi> The <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord has been Spread, for the nouriſhment of this Glorious <hi>Work.</hi> The Perſon who is heartily <hi>Deſirous,</hi> to have this Work nouriſhed in him will be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> The <hi>Good Things</hi> here, are for that <hi>Hungry</hi> and <hi>Thirſty</hi> Soul. Ah Soul above all things deſirous to have the <hi>Image of God and His Chriſt</hi> brought unto <hi>Perfection</hi> in thee; Soul deſirous to be cleanſed from <hi>all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit,</hi> and brought unto <hi>Perfection of Holineſs;</hi> The Great King will ſay, <hi>Welcome to my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table; I have put a Wedding Garment on that Soul. The ſenſe it has of its own Rags does beſpeak a Wedding Garment for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe things, there lies that which we call, An <hi>Habitual Preparation</hi> for the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord. There is an <hi>Actual Preparation</hi> alſo to be <hi>Endeavoured.</hi> And in order to this, A <hi>Time</hi> is to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for it, a little before your coming. You muſt not begrutch <hi>Time</hi> for ſuch
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001759_0012_0FB7D26BB712B588"/>a weighty and awful affair. Shake off your Secular Encumbrances, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſo much <hi>Time,</hi> as is requiſite for the bringing of your Souls, into an <hi>Heavenly Temper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, In your <hi>Actual Preparation,</hi> One thing is to be this; You muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually go over again the Poincs of your <hi>Habitual Preparation. Actually</hi> On each of thoſe <hi>Three Things</hi> over again; by which you will make it ſure, That you have <hi>Really done</hi> them. No Proof like this; You beſt prove that you <hi>have done</hi> the <hi>Things that accempany Salvation,</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Doing</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>But then, another thing of great conſequence to be now attended is, A <hi>Self-Examination.</hi> So tis required, 1 Cor. XI. 28. <hi>Let a man Examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him Eat of that Bread, and Drink of that Cup.</hi> In the management of your <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> Firſt Implore the Help of God; <hi>Lord, Search me, Try me; ſee, and cauſe me to ſee, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way of Wickedneſs in me, and let not a Deceived Heart cauſe me to Periſh with a Eye in my Right Hand.</hi> Then take the

               <hi>Marks</hi> by which the <hi>Converts of Zion</hi> are to be diſtinguiſhed; and <hi>Examine</hi> your ſelves, how far thoſe <hi>Marks</hi> are to be found upon you.

            <p>Enquire;
<q>Is a Glorious CHRIST moſt acceptable to me in all His <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and with all His <hi>Kindneſſes;</hi> and would I fain have Him to be <hi>All</hi> that unto me, which He is unto all the <hi>Heirs of ſalvation?</hi> Do I rely on Him, as my <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and my <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> before the Righteous God; and alſo my <hi>Leader</hi> in the <hi>Paths of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?</hi> Do I ſee Him out ſhining all <hi>Creatures</hi> in all their <hi>Beauties;</hi> and is it the Grand wiſh of my Soul, to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> unto Him?

            <p>Theſe are the Things, after which your <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> is to be Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But I make ſome Remarks upon the Performance of this Excerciſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Tho' you do not, upon your <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> get beyond all Doubts and Fears, whether you have theſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001759_0016_0FB7D27691F3CF58"/>things Really in you, yet you muſt not be by theſe <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> hindred from going on, and coming to the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the Lord. If you have any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderating <hi>Hopes</hi> that you <hi>have</hi> theſe Things, or cannot fairly and juſtly Pronounce the <hi>Sentence,</hi> that you <hi>have them not;</hi> You may and ſhould come. Come, as the Poor Woman, that came <hi>Trembling,</hi> to touch the Garment of our Saviour. Come and ſay, <hi>Lord, At thy Bidding I come. I durſt not forbear, what thou haſt bidden me to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. While you are in your <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> to Silence your <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> whether you have done theſe things or no, the beſt way is, not only to <hi>Ask</hi> whether you <hi>have done</hi> ſuch things, but now to <hi>Do them.</hi> It is now a Sweet Seaſon to <hi>Do</hi> all that belongs to the <hi>New Creature;</hi> To <hi>Do it,</hi> over &amp; over again; The <hi>Doing</hi> of it, will render the <hi>Being</hi> of it Unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Upon every Stroke ſay, <hi>Lord, Now I do this, if I never did it before!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. It is not only to be now Examined; <hi>Whether you have the Graces
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001759_0017_0FB7D27A7258AC00"/>of a Regenerate Chriſtian?</hi> But it muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo come into your Examination, <hi>What there is yet wanting in your Graces?</hi> You ſhould Enquire, In what you are ſtill <hi>Defective?</hi> And from thence Prepare ſome <hi>Errand,</hi> and ſome <hi>Requeſt,</hi> which you will carry unto the Table of the Lord; in order to the Relief of thoſe <hi>Defects,</hi> which are ſtill found upon you. Sirs, The <hi>Church</hi> is an <hi>Hoſpital;</hi> Tis to ſomething like the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> that you are now approaching. Find out the <hi>Maladies</hi> of which you are to make your <hi>Complaint,</hi> in <hi>Expectation</hi> of here finding ſome <hi>Relief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. You cannot be inſenſible, That this your <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> muſt be accompanied with all other <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that may be ſuitable for a Soul <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to meet the Lord;</hi> with <hi>Contrition</hi> for Sin and <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of it; with <hi>New Reſolutions</hi> of a Better Life; with the <hi>Supplications</hi> of, One <hi>Striving to Enter into the Strait Gate;</hi> And with <hi>Reading</hi> the Word of God, and <hi>Books</hi> which may bring the <hi>Coals from the Altar</hi> to your Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:001759_0018_0FB7D27BD6D34AD0"/>
Having paſſed thro' this <hi>Preparation,</hi> I will now ſet before you, The <hi>Worthy Manner</hi> of coming unto the <hi>Table of the Lord.</hi> It ſhall be briefly recommended, in only Two Inſtructions; <hi>We will put upon you none other Burden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. You muſt behold the <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Elements,</hi> and the <hi>Sacramental Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and affect your Hearts with ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Heart melting <hi>Meditations</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>When you ſee the <hi>Bread,</hi> your Thoughts muſt be on that <hi>Body which God Prepared</hi> for your Saviour, therein to make Himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</hi> When you ſee the <hi>Wine,</hi> your Thoughts muſt be on that <hi>Blood of the Son of God, which cleanſes from all Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Taken</hi> by the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and ſo anon, when the <hi>Wine</hi> is <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Your Thoughts muſt be on that Subject; <hi>I ſee, I ſee, how the Son of God has taken our Nature; How the Word was made Fleſh!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Bleſſed;</hi> Your Thoughts are to be: <hi>Thus was my Jeſus Conſecrated, and ſet apart for the Work of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001759_0019_0FB7D27E1C22F8F0"/>a Redeemer.</hi> And anon, when the <hi>Wine</hi> has <hi>Thanks given</hi> upon it; your Thoughts are to be: <hi>Oh! what Thanks, what Thanks do I owe for my Jeſus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Broken;</hi> You are to think: <hi>Oh! what Griefs was my Jeſus broken withal; when it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe Him, and put Him to Griefs! And He was bruiſed for our Iniquities!</hi> And anon, when you ſee the <hi>Wine</hi> has been poured into the Cup; You are to think: <hi>Oh! how was the Blood of my Jeſus poured out, when his Soul was made a Treſpaſs-offering!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Given;</hi> You are to think: O <hi>my God, Wilt thou give thy Jeſus to me! Yea, God bath ſo Loved the World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you <hi>Receive,</hi> the one firſt, and anon the other; it ſhould be with ſuch Thoughts as theſe; <hi>O my dear</hi> JESUS, <hi>I receive thee, I receive thee; No longer will I deny thee an Entrance into my Soul; at the Door whereof thou art now Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; O my Lard, and my God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you <hi>Eat</hi> the <hi>Bread,</hi> you are to Think, and wiſh; <hi>Oh! Let me be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001759_0020_0FB7D282ADB52430"/>unto my Jeſus, and Strengthened by Him.</hi> When you <hi>Drink the Wine,</hi> You are to Think, and wiſh; <hi>Oh! Let the Blood of my Jeſus be applied unto me, as Purchaſing Life Eternal for me! Oh! Let the Spirit of my Jeſus Enter me, and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs me, and Quicken me for ever-more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Soul thus Engaged, is at a <hi>Feaſt of Fat things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. You may find Intervening <hi>Spaces</hi> while you are about this <hi>Work of the Lord,</hi> for to proſecute many <hi>Special Deſigns</hi> of Godlineſs, which would here have their moſt Effectual Proſecution. There are Intervening <hi>Pauſes,</hi> whereof tis pity a moment ſhould be loſt. Now, it were <hi>all Wiſdom and Prudence in you,</hi> before your coming hither, to Shape ſome <hi>Holy Deſigns,</hi> which you will come upon. Beſides what the <hi>Sermons</hi> Preached on theſe Occaſions may Lead you to think upon; you may aforehand ponder, <hi>What remarkable Deficiency in my Chriſtianity ſhould I now ſeek to have repaired?</hi> Or, <hi>What is the Diſtemper in my Soul, that I will now go to the Lord
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001759_0021_0FB7D28412182420"/>my Healer, for the Healing of?</hi> Or, <hi>What is the Temptation, with which I am now moſt in Danger to find the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too hard for me?</hi> At the <hi>Table</hi> of the Lord, Look upon your Saviour, as firſt <hi>Purchaſing</hi> that Favour of God, which you are now purſuing of. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that you <hi>Receive</hi> what is before you, as a Yoken, that you <hi>Rely</hi> upon Him for that Favour. Then Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Saviour as on the Throne at the Right Hand of God, Able and Willing from thence to diſpenſe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. So go on expreſſing the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of your Soul upon Him, for that <hi>Favour</hi> in all the parts of it; Say, all that you would have; until you can conclude, <hi>Lord, All my Deſire is before thee, and my Groaning is not hid from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A TESTIMONY, <hi>addreſs'd unto the People of</hi> New-England, <hi>from a Number of their Aſſociated Paſtors; Convened at</hi> Dedham, 4 <hi>d.</hi> III <hi>m.</hi> 1714.</p>
            <p>FOraſmuch as by the Suggeſtions of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Enemy</hi> of Mankind, (Whoſe Deſign is to prevent Men of the Enjoyment of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Influences &amp; Bleſſings eſpecially Obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the <hi>Holy Supper of the LORD</hi>) very many
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001759_0022_0FB7D28B10993CB0"/>of the <hi>Children of the Covenant</hi> do <hi>contentedly Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi> in a moſt Scandalous &amp; Criminal Neglect of that Holy Ordinance; moſt abſurdly Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying their Delinquency therein by an Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Unfitneſs</hi> and <hi>Unpreparedneſs</hi> for it, which <hi>itſelf</hi> is an <hi>heinous Iniquity:</hi> And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by this Means the Spiritual &amp; Eternal Eſtates of Men are under no ſmall Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; &amp; the viſible Covenant-People of GOD dreadfully expoſed unto <hi>Unchurching &amp; Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting</hi> Diſpenſations, under the Provoked Wrath of Heaven: Therefore we cannot but be Senſible, that 'tis our Duty to do all that we can (by the Help of our LORD JESUS CHRIST) for the Remedy &amp; Redreſs of this great Evil; And we do hereby moſt Solemnly bear our <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> againſt it; it being Diametrically Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the required Glorifying of <hi>God's Name,</hi> &amp; Advancement of His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> &amp; doing of His <hi>Will,</hi> which, (as our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> has Taught us) Men muſt have moſt at Heart on Earth, if they intend for <hi>Heaven.</hi> And foraſmuch as, our Reverend and Worthy Brother, (whoſe <hi>Praiſe is in the Goſpel throughout the Churches,</hi>) has, (according to the Wiſdom given him of GOD) formed a Diſcourſe, Intituled, <hi>A Monitor for Communicants,</hi> (which upon our Peruſal this Day, we find, not only to be very Solid &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, but alſo judiciouſly Adapted to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Objection above-mentioned, of Mens <hi>Unfitneſs for the Table of the LORD:</hi>) we cannot but think that the general Spreading of it thro' the Land, might be, (by the bleſſing of CHRIST) not a little Conducive to the Putting
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001759_0023_0FB7D28C53B4C108"/>forward the deſired Reformation of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Neglect of the LORDS SUPPER. And we do earneſtly Exhort all, (in the Bowels of Chriſt) into whoſe Hands the ſaid Diſcourſe may come, to Subject their Conſciences and their whole Souls unto the Holy Word of GOD, and Will of CHRIST therein preſented unto 'em; and in the Name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, We ſolemnly Charge ſuch of Our People as are guilty of the Scandalous Neglect of the Sacred Supper of the LORD, to Endeavour to Repent and Reform, as they will Anſwer it to their Great Judge at the <hi>Laſt Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, May the Precious Blood of CHRIST be Sprinkled upon them, and the Pardoning Mercy of our Heavenly FATHER be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to them, and the Verticordious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Eternal SPIRIT be vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to their Souls, for their Salvation! And may That Choice Diſcourſe be Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to 'em for their Spiritual Good! <hi>AMEN.</hi>
