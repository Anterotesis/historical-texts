            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>FABLES are generally pleaſing to children. Since they are ſo; were it not more adviſable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with ſuch as afford <hi>leſſons</hi> ſuited to their age; than to waſte our time in debating whether or no Fable-writing be the moſt deſirable mode of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                  <p>IF I were aſked the queſtion, I ſhould anſwer in the negative.</p>
                  <p>BUT let us conſider that every book the little boy meets with at ſchool, will preſent to him Fables, which he will ſeize with avidity as novelties: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the morals of which are calculated to give an improper bias to his mind; had we not then better indulge him (whilſt in the nurſery) with a few that convey ſimple Morals adapted to the duties of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? I think ſo; or I had not written theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rouſſeau's</hi> remarks upon Fables, as making a part of the Library for Children,<note n="*" place="bottom">However miſtaken, however deteſtable, many notions of <hi>Rouſſeau's</hi> may be; there are uſeful maxims to be gleaned from his work reſpecting children. I wiſh the wheat were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the chaff.</note> ſeem to me juſt: moſt

of his objections militate ſtrongly againſt all the Fables I ever met with. If I did not hope that theſe are exempted from his charges I would not offer them to the public, ſtill leſs would I have preſented them to the dear little ones for whom they were written.</p>
                  <p>THERE muſt always remain one accuſation againſt Fables, namely, Falſehood; but ſurely it is eaſily explained to the children, that it is but their own uſual favourite ſport of, <hi>"making believe,"</hi> as they call feigning viſits, trading, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> with no deſign to deceive; yet, to guard againſt the ſhadow of evil, I have been explicit on that point in ſome of the dialogues; leſt the little books ſhould fall into the hands of any poor friendleſs child, and leſſen his regard to truth. Now I mention the dialogues, I confeſs that I am prepared for ridicule, ſhould any but a tender mother open my volumes.</p>
                  <p>I WEAVE <hi>nets</hi> for <hi>inſects;</hi> and if I ſuit my toils to my game am I to be derided? Who but ſtoops with ſatisfaction to lead an infant by the hand: Who but delights to adapt her ſteps to its ſhort and unequal paces? And ſhall we be leſs tender, leſs indulgent to the unformed mind?</p>
                  <p>A JUDICIOUS mother condeſcends to prattle with her children; to mingle in their ſports; thus ſhe
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:033728_0007_0FF91DE778A5ADB0"/>
infuſes ideas in their tender minds, whilſt ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages their affections; yet without relinquiſhing parental authority.</p>
                  <p>No office is <hi>mean</hi> which concerns the health (<hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> or <hi>mental</hi>) of the riſing generation.</p>
                  <p>WHY then do I make apologies for my infantine dialogues!</p>
                  <p>DOES it proceed from pride? apprehenſive of jeſts from thoſe who are not aware of their uſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Folly!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THOSE who are engaged in educating an infant, will accept them with ſatisfaction; thoſe who are not, (nor ever were) will deſpiſe them, and all that can be ſaid in their excuſe.</p>
                  <q>NUL de nous n'eſt aſſez philoſophe pour ſavoire ſe mettre à la place d'un enfant.</q>
                  <p>YET thoſe who are mothers muſt ſtrive to do it; and defy the deriſion of ſuch as—"never had a child."</p>

                  <head>TO MY LITTLE READERS.</head>
                  <p>You have been good, elſe your mam-ma would not have bought a new book for you.</p>
                  <p>I will tell you a tale. Maſ-ter <hi>Brother-ton</hi> was a good child.</p>
                  <p>When he was three years old, he would bring his book, and learn to read.</p>
                  <p>He ſpelt the words thus, b-r-e-a-d—bread, and ſo on.</p>
                  <p>He was apt, and fond of his book.</p>
                  <p>One day I met with ſome nice, clear, large print let-ters; and I cut them out,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:033728_0009_0FF91DEE27C0BE18"/>
and ſtuck them on card; then laid them thus, c-a-t—cat, d-o-g—dog; and he ſaid the words at ſight.</p>
                  <p>Was not this nice?</p>
                  <p>Then it came in my mind to print with a pen for him; ſo I made tales of the dog, and the cat, and ſuch ſhort words—Should you not jump for joy?—He did.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have ſent theſe to make a book for you, to learn to read in; but there is one now with a name too long for you to read <hi>(Imperial Spelling-Book:)</hi> it is full of prints, and tales in ſhort words; ſo that it muſt be joy of a boy or girl to learn to read in it.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh I had met with ſuch a book three or four years ſince: I ſpent a great deal of time, for want of ſuch an one.</p>
                  <p>You all love a book, and are fond of prints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:033728_0010_0FF91DEFBB5AABF0"/>
One day I bought a book of Fa-bles full of prints; but I found it was all in <hi>verſe:</hi> it was ſad ſtuff: I could not bear the Fa-bles nor the Mo-rals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William</hi> (that was the ſweet boy's name) had a great mind to know what the Hen ſaid, and what the Ape did; yet he was ſo good, that he would not aſk the maids to read to him; (as he knew that I did not like the book) but would look at the prints, and talk of them, and not ſeem to wiſh to read.</p>
                  <p>As he was ſo good (if you be good you will be ſure to meet with things to pleaſe you) I wrote ſome Fa-bles in print, with my pen, to ſuit the prints.</p>
                  <p>I told him that I ſhould not have done this, if he had not been ſo good.</p>
                  <p>Gueſs how full of joy he was! I think I hear you ſay, "I wiſh I could ſee them!"</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:033728_0011_0FF91DF222AC4820"/>
Now that is what I am in hopes you may.</p>
                  <p>"And will there be prints?"</p>
                  <p>That I can not tell: I think there will. But if there ſhould not; yet you will be glad to have the book; you will know that there would have been ſome, if it had been right.</p>
                  <p>You muſt learn to take things as you find them—to take with thanks what is meant to pleaſe you; though it may not be quite what you wiſh.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh my book may have prints, as I know it will give you the more joy; I am glad to pleaſe a good child.</p>
                  <p>This was wrote to teach you to be good.</p>
                  <p>If you be good your friends will love you.</p>
                  <p>If you be good, God will bleſs you.</p>

                        <p>The Kid ran to the door, and took hold of the look—in a fright for the Goat—"But ſtay," "ſaid ſhe, "I am to look out firſt."</p>

She did ſo—and what do you think ſhe ſaw?</p>
                        <p>A great wolf! who thought to cheat her, and get her to let him in—and then he would have made a meal of her.</p>
                        <p>The Kid was wife to do as ſhe was bid—elſe ſhe had ſeen the Goat no more.</p>
                        <p>Think what joy it was to her to tell the Goat this tale, when ſhe came back!</p>
                        <p>Think how the Goat did kiſs her!—how fond ſhe was of her! as ſhe was ſo good.</p>

He ſaw ſome nice Grapes: they were ſo ripe, and black, that he could not go from the vine; but ſtood all day to look at them.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, a fine fat hen ſlipt paſt.</p>
                     <p>A cock crept by at his rump; and got ſafe to his perch.</p>

                     <p>A fat gooſe paſt cloſe by; and made no noiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Fox miſt the good meal which he might have got; and went to his den at night, with no food at all.</p>
                     <p>If he had been wiſe, he would not have ſtood to wiſh, and long in vain.</p>
                     <p>No—he would have gone from the vine, to ſeek for ſuch food as he could reach.</p>

                     <p>The boy knew, that if he ſhould want help, the men who were near would come to him.</p>

You will find that he was a bad Boy.</p>

                     <p>Then the kind men ran to help him—one with a ſtick—one with a ſtone, or a ſtaff—each with what he could ſnatch up, to kill the Wolf.</p>
                     <p>And when they came—what do you think?—there was no Wolf—but the Boy would ſtand and laugh, as if he ſhould ſplit his throat.</p>
                     <p>At laſt the Wolf <hi>did</hi> come—then the boy ran—</p>
                     <p>"O dear!—the Wolf is here—pray come and help me—help!—help!—or I ſhall loſe all my ſheep and lambs—there he goes—I can not keep him out of the fold."</p>

But the men ſaid to him, "Go! go! we will not ſtir—we know you too well—it is all falſe—we know there is no Wolf—we will not be made ſuch fools now!"</p>
                     <p>So the Wolf took all the ſheep and lambs, one at a time; whilſt the Boy could get no help—No one thought he told the truth, as he <hi>had</hi> told lies.</p>
                     <p>In vain did he call, to thoſe whom he had made ſport with in ſuch a way:</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE remarked—(but who has not <hi>felt?</hi>) that the pleaſure of a Fable, is damped to a child, by the tedious unintelligible Moral which is to follow.</p>
                  <p>A Moral, againſt which, perhaps, the complaint already urged, is much the ſmalleſt that might be alledged.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the natural inference from it is <hi>ſuch,</hi> that a child may be the worſe for it all his life.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it tends to teach him to be deceitful, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, covetous—but the ſlighteſt injury which I ſhould apprehend, is a ſatiety and diſguſt at the idea of a <hi>Moral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, having written a few Fables from whence unexceptionable Morals may be drawn, I choſe to make the little folk themſelves ſeem to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them—indeed, I took care they ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently obvious for them to do it—and the frequent repetition appeared to me to be of uſe, as it would enable the child really to make the remarks which I put in his mouth, as well as inculcate more ſtrongly the notions which I wiſhed to infuſe.</p>

                     <hi>WHEN Mrs</hi> Teach well <hi>wrote theſe Fables and Morals in the year 1779, ſhe wrote them for the uſe of her own family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now they are offered to the public, perhaps it may be proper to premiſe, that there is another ſet of Fables adapted to the ſame prints—written for the uſe of an elder child—who is made to converſe upon the ſubject (in the latter part of this little volume) by the name of</hi> George: <hi>the ſecond ſet of Morals going by the name of</hi> George's <hi>Morals.</hi>

                     <hi>Mrs.</hi> Teachwell <hi>is apprehenſive that ſhe ſhall be blamed for raiſing</hi> George's <hi>language above nature, when his early youth is conſidered—therefore ſhe explains her motive—</hi>

<pb facs="unknown:033728_0064_0FF9211D148D5270"/>
for him—Thoſe parents who want leiſure or patience to direct ſuch an exerciſe can explain the words; and ſo make trial of the little reader's memory.</hi>

                        <p>I will tell you.</p>
                        <p>Fa-bles are ſto-ries writ-ten to teach chil-dren what they ſhould do; by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what may hap-pen to them
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033728_0067_0FF9212A0318ADC8"/>
if they do not act as they ought to do. If the ſto-ries were of <hi>Boys</hi> and <hi>Girls</hi> who had not done as they were bid, and had ſuf-fer-ed ſome harm, we do not call them Fa-bles. There is a ſto-ry of a boy who was bid not to go near a horſe, and he did go near him; and the horſe kick-ed him: that was <hi>not</hi> a <hi>Fa-ble,</hi> but a <hi>Tale.</hi> Now the ſto-ry of the good Kid, who o-bey-ed her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo was ſafe: and the o-ther of the naugh-ty Kid, who did not mind the or-ders which the Goat left, to keep her ſe-cure from the Wolf; but was ſo diſ-o-be-di-ent as to o-pen the door with-out look-ing out at the win-dow firſt; and as ſhe did ſo was ea-ten by the Wolf—they <hi>are Fa-bles;</hi> for they are not <hi>true;</hi> nor can they be true of <hi>Kids</hi>—but it is cer-tain, that <hi>Chil-dren,</hi> if they do not o-bey their pa-rents and elders, will come to harm for their diſ-o-be-di-ence. And theſe Fa-bles are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033728_0068_0FF9212BAE1A94F0"/>
written to ſhew them what miſ-chief of-ten happens to thoſe who do diſ-o-bey or-ders.</p>
