         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That as to what's alledged on this point, in behalf of the Defendents, viz. <hi>That the Complainants had Circumvented and Surprized them is the Agreement, and had deceived them, by ſending the firſt Letter by</hi> Quinby, Cornwall, <hi>and</hi> Townſend, <hi>under pretence that they had Correſpondents, when the Defendents alledge, they had none, by which they were damnified.</hi> It appears, <hi>the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had the Articles in their hands for two days before the Execution thereof,</hi> and the Complainants are but Illiterate, and the Defendants men of Figure and Knowledge, which leaves little room to ſuſpect either Surprize or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention on the part of the Complainants. That <hi>its not affirmed by the Anſwer, That</hi> Quinby, Cornwall <hi>and</hi> Townſend ſaid, <hi>they particuarly had Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> but by their Letter, <hi>it appears they wrote not to them as ſuch,</hi> but as to <hi>the Correſpondents of the</hi> Palmers, <hi>and Company,</hi> and <hi>that they had Correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, is admitted,</hi> That by the Second Article of Agreement, in the Defendent, Philips's writing, which was propoſed and agreed to, after the firſt Letter was ſent away, it appears, <hi>the Letter agreed to be ſent, was then to be ſent,</hi> which <hi>Could not be that which had been before Sent;</hi> and <hi>which Letter is acknowleged to have been received by the Defendents,</hi> and <hi>which, with the Deſiſting to make further Proffers,</hi> is a Performance of what, on the Complainants part was to be Performed; and if any room is left to ſuppoſe Surprize or Circumvention, in ſending the firſt Letter, it ſeemeth not ſufficient to make void the Argeement, it not being the Subſtance of the Matter, but <hi>the deſiſting further Proffers</hi> with <hi>the Second Letter by the</hi> Palmers, remain ſufficient Conſiderations for Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the part of the Defendents; theſe being all that appear to be ſtipulated to be done on the part of the Complainants.</p>
            <p>Then as to the <hi>Bounds of the Great or midle Neck,</hi> which is the Chief thing in queſtion, I conceive what appears in the Defendents Anſwer, and has been urged by them, <hi>as to the meaning of the word Neck,</hi> in the Mortgage of <hi>Richbell</hi> to <hi>Richbell,</hi> under which the Complainants now claim, that it extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the flux of the Salt-Water: I conceive it to be an Expoſition which will neither agree with the words of the Patent, nor Deeds that are ſet forth, referred to, and produced either by the Complainants or Defendents, nor with the Intention of the Parties to the Deeds themſelves. It has been ſtrongly inſiſted on by the Defendents Council, that the word <hi>Neck</hi> is a plain familiar Engliſh word, and eaſy to be underſtood, and that it means not nor can mean any more than <hi>a point of Land, limitted or bounded with Water on three Sides,</hi> and can bear the Name of a <hi>Neck</hi> no further than the Water makes it ſo, that is, where the Tyde riſes; and <hi>that the words in the Patent, and all the Deeds contain two ſeveral Grants,</hi> to wit, <hi>One of the Necks,</hi> and <hi>another of the Land, without the Necks, running into the Woods.</hi> Now, whatever there might be in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the word <hi>Neck,</hi> ſtanding ſingly by it ſelf, which yet I do not think will hold; for it is well known, that Valleys between two or more Ridges of Higher ground, far beyond where the Neck reaches, in common acceptation, do as frequently fall under the Denomination of <hi>Necks</hi> of Land, as the other: But leaving that, I ſay, whatever the word <hi>Neck,</hi> ſingly ſtanding by it ſelf, might ſignify in the caſe before me, at preſent, I conceive, <hi>it muſt be underſtood as the Words of the Patent and Deeds of the Grantor deſcribes and intended it.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002940_0013_0FE69B8E42D80ED0"/>It will not be denyed, but that Names both of Places and Things are arbitrary, even tho' very falſe, as <hi>Black and White Acre,</hi> which do not receive thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is Evident, that in the original Grant or Patent of this Land it is deſcribed to be 

  <q>A parcel or Tract of Land, contained within three Necks, the Eaſter-moſt of which is bounded with a ſmall River, called, <hi>Mamaroneck River,</hi> being the Eaſter-moſt Limits or Bounds of this Government, and the Weſter-moſt, by the Gravelly or ſtony Brook or River, which makes the Eſter-moſt Bounds of Mr. <hi>Pells</hi> Purchaſe, having to the South the Sound, and running North-ward from the marked Trees upon the ſaid Necks, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miles into the Woods.</q>

 This <hi>parcel or Tract of Land,</hi> it is plain, is deſcribed under the Name of <hi>one Tract only,</hi> having the Sound to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and <hi>running North-ward Twenty Miles into the Woods;</hi> which is the ſame as to ſay, <hi>being bounded to the South-ward with the Sound,</hi> and <hi>to the North-ward at the Extent of Twenty Miles into the Woods.</hi> It is further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable, That in the ſame Patent, it is granted by the Name of <hi>One parcel or Tract of Land only,</hi> and in the <hi>Habend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Wheat, is reſerved upon <hi>the ſame Tract of Land.</hi> So, I think, by the Patent, there is no doubt but the whole was called and underſtood to be <hi>One Tract of Land, contained in three Necks.</hi> And who can ſay, the Grantor had not a right to extend theſe Necks of Land by the Name of <hi>Necks,</hi> as far back into the Woods as he thought fit. But the Second Deed produced and agreed to by both Parties, is a deed made by the Patentee <hi>John Richbell,</hi> about one year after the Date of the Patent, and is a Grant of the Eaſter-moſt of the ſaid three <hi>Necks,</hi> to one <hi>Rider,</hi> in truſt for a Joynture, to the Grantor <hi>John Richbell's Wife.</hi> Now by this Deed, it is evident, that as the ſaid Tract of Land <hi>was granted or patented by the name of three necks,</hi> ſo the Grantee or Patentee, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, &amp; ſo he calls it; for in this Deed of <hi>Riders,</hi> he diſcribes it by the Name of a certain <hi>tract or parcel of Land upon the Main, containing three necks,</hi> &amp; granted for the uſes in the ſaid Deed mention'd, all that <hi>parcel or tract of Land where be now lives, called the Eaſt-Neck;</hi> &amp; to leave it without doubt, what he means by <hi>neck,</hi> he ſays, <hi>the Neck includes all the Lands, as well North into the Woods above</hi> Weſtcheſter <hi>Path, Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the Path, South-wards towards the Sound.</hi> And after having ſo deſcribed the <hi>Neck</hi> in the Premiſſes of the Deed, ſo in the <hi>Habendum,</hi> he calls it, without the addition of more words, <hi>The ſaid Neck of Land.</hi> And in the Covenant, for further aſſurance, he calls it by the ſame Name of <hi>Neck</hi> only. From all which, it is plain, to a Demonſtration, that the Grantor, <hi>John Richbell,</hi> meant and underſtood by the word <hi>Neck</hi> of Land, <hi>all the Land between the Sound on the South-ward, and the Extent of Twenty Miles to the North-ward.</hi> And looking into the Deed of Mortgage, as us Steenwyck, about five years after date of the Patent, under which Mortgage the Defendents claim, and is by them ſet forth and referred to, in their Anſwer, we find the ſaid <hi>John Richbell</hi> for the ſecuring the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Two Thouſand Four Hundred Guilders, Wampon (which is worth Sixty Pounds <hi>York Money</hi>) did 

  
  <q>Bind his the ſaid <hi>John Richbell</hi>'s Neck or
  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002940_0014_0FE69B9B979110D8"/>piece of Land lying upon the Main, being the moſt Weſterly Neck of Land of the three, to him the ſaid <hi>John Richbell</hi> belonging, Limitting the Neck of Land aforeſaid, to the South, with the Sound, and running from the marked T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es ſtanding on the ſaid Necks, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</q>

 
  
Here he again tells us what he underſtood the ſaid <hi>Neck</hi> to be, and which is contained in as certain words as can well be expreſſed. And ſo, it appears, he had Granted or Mortgaged <hi>both the Eaſt and Weſt Necks,</hi> as they are deſcribed in the Patent, <hi>bounded on the Sound to the South-ward, and running Twenty Miles into the Woods.</hi> But then, as to the Deed or Mortgage of the ſame, <hi>John Richbell</hi> to his Uncle <hi>Robert Richbell,</hi> made about Seven Years after the Date of the Patent, for ſecuring the payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, Boſton Silver Money, which at that time was equal in Value to Six Shillings and Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Pence <hi>per Ounce,</hi> by which he grants 

  
  <q>all his Right, Title and Intereſt in and to One Neck of Land commonly called and known by the Name of the great Neck, bordered or bounded by the Sound on one End, &amp; betwixt his other two ſmall Necks, on each ſide of the great Neck, To have and To hold <hi>the ſaid great neck.</hi>
               </q>

 
  
And thus ſtand the words of this Deed, and upon which the whole Diſpute, at preſent, is. The Defendants ſay, That here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here they urge ſtrongly, That this <hi>Grant of a parcel or tract of Land, contained in three necks having the Sound is the South-ward, &amp; running twenty Miles into the Woods, makes two Different Grants of two ſeveral parcels of Land;</hi> and ſay further, that the words <hi>parcel or Tract of Land,</hi> ſhould be read, <hi>parcel &amp; Tract of Land;</hi> and ſo by changing the Disjunctive into a Conjunctive, it will then be clear, that <hi>the grant of the Twenty Miles into the Woods, from the marked Trees on the ſaid Necks, is a ſeperate Tract of Land,</hi> and cannot paſs by the word <hi>Neck,</hi> which is a Diſtinct <hi>parcel of Land,</hi> unleſs mentioned. And ſo, by the Mortgage, under which the Complainants claim, nothing can paſs but the Land lying between the <hi>Two Creeks,</hi> as high as the Salt-Water flows; And to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this Expoſition, they product a third Mortgage of the ſaid Weſt-Neck, ſet forth and referred to by them in their Anſwers, and made by the ſaid <hi>John Richbell</hi> in One Thouſand Six Hundred and Seventy Eight, to the ſame <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck,</hi> for the ſecuring of One Hundred and Twenty Five Pounds. And by this Mortgage Deed, they ſay, that <hi>John Richbell</hi> granted the ſame <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> and alſo <hi>Twenty Miles into the Woods;</hi> and from thence urge, That as be intended to grant: <hi>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> ſo he took care to expreſs it accordingly. The words of the Deed are theſe, 
  
  <q>Hath Demiſed, Granted, &amp;c. to <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck</hi> all that his Neck of Land lying upon the Main, being the moſt Weſterly Neck of the three, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaid <hi>John Richbell,</hi> the ſaid Neck of Land bordering on the ſtoney or gravelly Water or River, which is the Eaſt-Limits of Mr. <hi>Pells</hi> Land, and having to the South ſide, the Sound, and running from the marked Tree, which is on the ſaid Neck, North-ward, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</q>


  
Now, ſay they, it is plain, that in the grant of the <hi>Eaſt-Neck,</hi> and in both the before-mentioned Grants of the <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> as he intended to grant the <hi>Necks</hi> with the <hi>other Tracts of Land Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> ſo he Expreſſed it: But, as in the Grant of the <hi>Middle Neck,</hi> Nothing is <hi>Expreſſed</hi> but the <hi>bare Neck,</hi> ſo nothing ſhall be intended to paſs, but the <hi>Neck only;</hi> which they ſay, is an eaſy and natural Expoſition of the word <hi>Neck,</hi> and fully
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002940_0015_0FE69B9BB4E5E2A8"/>Expreſſes the Intention of Grantor, and crave great Allowances for the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the times, when there were few or none that underſtood Clerkſhip, or the art of Conveyancing. Then, to corroberate this, they ſet forth in their Anſwer, that ſome of the Complainants themſelves ſo underſtood the word <hi>Neck,</hi> and offered to take a Leaſe from the Defendent <hi>Philipſe,</hi> of part of the Land they now claim. And as a further argument to prove that the Complainants have no Right to any part of the Lands in <hi>John Richbells</hi> Patent, except the Lands in the <hi>great Neck, as far as the Salt-Water flows,</hi> they produce the Deeds of Leaſe and Releaſe of the ſaid <hi>John Richbells</hi> Heir, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants, bearing Date the Eighth Day of <hi>Feburary,</hi> 1722. in which Releaſe the Mortgage of the <hi>great Neck,</hi> by <hi>John Richbell</hi> to <hi>Edward Richbell,</hi> made in One Thouſand Six Hundred and Seventy Three, is recited, and the great Neck is there exactly deſcribed, as it is in the ſaid Mortgage, and ſo from thence conclude, That the Heir of <hi>John Richbell,</hi> granting only the great Neck, as being "Bounded to the South-ward with the Sound, and lying between <hi>"John Richbells</hi> other two ſmall Necks, "Nothing can paſs but what nature makes a Neck. And then, the ſame Defendents produce their own Deeds of Leaſe and Releaſe from the ſame <hi>Edward Richbell,</hi> Heir of <hi>John Richbell,</hi> Dated the Twelfth and Thirteenth Days of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> One Thouſand Seven Hundred and Twenty Three to theſe Defendants, for all the reſidue of <hi>John Richbells</hi> Lands, contained in the before mentioned Patent, except the <hi>great Neck,</hi> before releaſed to the Complainants, or ſome of them, and by virtue of this, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants ſay, they have a good Right to all the Lands <hi>above the Natural Neck Twenty Miles into the Woods.</hi> But I can, by no means, be of the Defendents Opinion, as to the meaning of the word <hi>Neck,</hi> nor allow of ſuch a Change of words, where there is not an abſolute Neceſſity, as in this caſe there is not; Nay, I think ſuch a Change of words cannot be admitted, without making the Patent and the other Deeds contradict themſelves; for when the Grantor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf takes ſo much pains, when he goes about to grant one of theſe <hi>Necks</hi> of Land, to limit, Deſcribe, and in expreſs words, to call it a <hi>Neck of Land,</hi> and ſo to deſcribe its Bounds and Extent, it would be a very great Violence done to the Intention of the Grantor, to change his words, in order either to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh or to Enlarge his Grant, without ſome apparent Neceſſity or Reaſon for ſo doing, upon the bare ſuppoſition of his not intending the <hi>great Neck</hi> ſhould extend as far as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt Necks,</hi> becauſe it is only called <hi>his great Neck lying between his other two ſmall Necks.</hi> I ſay, this would, in my Opinion, be changeing both the Words and Intent of the Grantor; for by the Second Mortgage of the Reverſion of the <hi>great Neck</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> to one <hi>Kellond,</hi> under which the Complainants do alſo Claim, in One Thouſand Six Hundred and Seventy Six, for the ſecurity of One Hundred Pounds, Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and referred to by the Defendents, in their Anſwer, It is manifeſt, that he underſtood the <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> and the <hi>great Neck</hi> to be of the ſame Extent; for having before Mortgaged the <hi>great Neck</hi> to <hi>Robert Richbell,</hi> without adding the words <hi>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> and alſo to <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck,</hi> his <hi>Weſt-Neck, with theſe words Twenty Miles into the Woods.</hi> In this Mortgage to <hi>Kellond,</hi> of the Reverſion of the <hi>two Necks,</hi> to wit, the <hi>great and Weſt-Necks,</hi> he there recites that 
  
  <q>Whereas he had granted to <hi>Robert Richbell</hi> his <hi>Neck</hi> of Land, commonly called, his <hi>great Neck,</hi> for Ninety Nine years, for the ſecuring the payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and had granted to <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck</hi> his <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> for ſecuring the payment of Two Thouſand Four Hundred Guilders,</q>

 he there grants <hi>the Reverſion of the ſaid</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002940_0016_0FE69B9E96BBFDF8"/>
               <hi>Two necks of Land</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Kellond,</hi> without any addition or Deſcription, but that of the <hi>Necks</hi> only, tho' it is mainfeſt, that in the Mortgage of the <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> to <hi>Steenwyck,</hi> here referred to, in this Mortgage, the words <hi>Twenty Miles are contained;</hi> yet when he comes here to mention, that he has formerly Mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it, he calls it <hi>only by the Name of his Weſt-Neck,</hi> and thinks this a full De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. And why as much ſhould not be underſtood here by <hi>great Neck,</hi> as by <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> I have not yet heard a Reaſon. And were I at a loſs to find out the mind of the Grantor, there is yet a <hi>Conſideration,</hi> which in this Court will always have great weight, and that is, 
  <q>To make ſuch Conſtruction of Deeds, when the words will bear it, and ſuch Expoſition does not break in upon any known Rule of Law, that no party may be hurt by the Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

 Now it is plain to me, that to confine the word <hi>Neck</hi> in the manner the Defendents would have it; then <hi>Robert Richbell</hi> had not a Security for a fifth part of the Money by him advanced. It is ſaid by the Complainants, and owned by the Defendents, that the Neck, in the ſenſe the Defendents contend for, contains not above <hi>Three hundred &amp; twenty Acres of Land, the Fee-Simple whereof, at the time of the Mortgage, as the Complainants charge, was not worth above Seventy Pounds, Money of</hi> New-York, <hi>it being a New Country,</hi> &amp; <hi>but very few Inhabitants.</hi> Now, ſhall it be ſuppoſed, that when <hi>John Richbell</hi> Mortgaged the Fee-ſimple of the <hi>weſt-neck, running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> to <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck</hi> for <hi>Sixty Pounds,</hi> that he intended that a term of <hi>Ninety Nine years, in a fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth part of that Quantity of Land,</hi> as a good ſecurity for <hi>Two Hundred</hi> and <hi>Fifty Pounds,</hi> it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe it; beſides, it appears that <hi>John Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> wanted more Money, and was Obliged to Mortgage the Reverſion of both the <hi>great and weſt-neck</hi> for a term of Ninety Nine Years, to commence after the firſt Mortgages upon theſe two <hi>Necks</hi> were cleared off. Now, can it be eaſily ſuppoſed, if that part of the <hi>great Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> had not been Mortgaged, that <hi>Kellond</hi> would have left that, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted ſo mean a ſecurity as a term of Ninety Nine Years, in the Reverſion of <hi>the great and Weſt-Neck,</hi> after the term of Ninety Nine Years ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, or the Sum of two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and Two Thouſand four Hundred Guilders, and Intereſt, ſhould be paid, when he well knew, that no Lands at that time in theſe parts, would let for any annual Rent at all. I ſay, theſe are Improbabilities, and may only be poſſible; but it is the more Rational Concluſion, that <hi>John Richbell</hi> and <hi>Mr. Kellond</hi> well Knowing <hi>both the whole great neck and weſt-neck to be Mortgaged, and that</hi> John <hi>having ſettled his Eaſt-neck for a Jointure on his Wife, he had then nothing left but to give a Second Mortgage on all that he had,</hi> which was the Reverſion of his <hi>great and Weſt-Neck.</hi> Then, as to what was urged by the Complainants, upon reading of the third Mortgage of <hi>Richbell</hi> to <hi>Steenwyck,</hi> under which the Defendents alſo claim the <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> I cannot conclude with them, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this Mortgage neither the Mortgagor, nor the Mortgagee have taken any Notice of any former Mortgage being upon the Weſt-Neck, and that the Mortgagor hath alſo 

  <q>Covenanted, That the ſame ſhall be peaceably held and enjoyed by the Mortgagee, his Heirs, Executors, Adminiſtrators &amp; Aſſigns, freed and Diſcharged from all other and former Bargains and Sales, &amp;c.</q>

 I ſay, I cannot preſume, as the Complainants inſiſt, that the former Mortgage of the Weſt-Neck, to <hi>Steenwyck</hi> the Mortgager, was paid off, and that this laſt Mortgage for ſecuring the payment of One Hundred and Twenty five Pounds to <hi>Steenwyck,</hi> was for all the Money that was then Due by Bond, or other-wiſe, Tho' it ſeems Strange, that <hi>Steenwyck</hi> ſhould advance the Sum of One Hundred
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002940_0017_0FE69B9ED5A0B670"/>and Twenty Pounds upon a New Mortgage of the Weſt-Neck, which was Mortgaged to himſelf before, and not take any Notice of a former Mortgage or the Money due to him upon that Mortgage, nor include the Money due to him upon the ſeveral Bonds ſet forth in the Defendents Anſwer; nor muſt I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that the Obliterations on the back of this Mortgage Deed, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants alledge, are Receipts for payment of Money due upon that Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage; for as they cannot be read, I muſt leave them as they are, and preſume, as the Heir of <hi>Richbell</hi> has done (when he ſold the Reverſion of the Weſt-Neck to the Defendents) that the Money on this and the other Mortgages, was due, and by ſo doing, I hurt no Perſon; and the ſame is not otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in Diſpute now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that the Complainants would ſhow, that the Defendents have no reaſon to endeavour to ſtretch their Claims to the Lands of the great Neck, ſeeing the Lands of the Weſt-Neck are a far greater ſatisfaction than they pretend the Defendents had any Right to; but, as the Heir of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> has Releaſed to the Defendents the Equity of Redemption of the Weſt-Neck, I cannot think the Conſideration of his ſo doing, ought to be Enquired into here, upon this Suit. And the caſe being ſtript of all theſe particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, charged in the Bill, and ſet forth, confeſſed or denyed in the Defendents Anſwer, It will ſtand thus.</p>

  <q>That (whereas it did not appear that the Line running into the Woods between the ſaid <hi>great neck,</hi> and <hi>weſter-moſt-neck,</hi> had ever been ſettled, run or marked out, or even the Courſe that it ought to run, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or limitted, which might occaſion Differences between the Parties, if the ſaid Defendant, <hi>Courtland,</hi> ſhould happen to purchaſe the ſame <hi>Weſt Neck</hi>) the Complainants ſhould deſiſt giving any further Directions to their Correſpondents in <hi>England,</hi> Directly or indirectly, for Purchaſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the ſaid <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> and that by the firſt Opportunity that ſhould offer, they ſhould write to their Correſpondents, to deſiſt making any further Proffers for the Reverſion of the ſame Neck.</q>

               <p>AND <hi>Now upon the whole ſtate of the Caſe,</hi>
 As to the Land in Queſtion, I think it appears very plain, that the word <hi>Neck</hi> muſt be underſtood in the Caſe before me, in the ſame ſenſe it is uſed both in the Patent and Deeds; and in the Patent it appears <hi>the whole Tract of Land is ſaid to be contained in Three Necks, and its South Bounds is the Sound, &amp; its North Bounds is Twenty Miles into the Woods.</hi> Now, it is plain, there is <hi>not two parcels</hi> of Land, for the very Tract that runs Twenty Miles into the Woods, has the Sound for its Bounds to the Southward, and in this ſenſe the Patentee, <hi>John Richbell,</hi> underſtood the word <hi>Neck,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the firſt Grant he made of one of theſe three <hi>Necks,</hi> in about a year after the Date of his Patent, I mean, his Deed to <hi>Rider,</hi> in Truſt for a Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to his Wife: In the Premiſſes of which Deed, he calls it the <hi>Eaſt-Neck,</hi> and deſcribes it by theſe words <hi>including therein betwixt the two Lines, all the Lands, as well North into the Woods above</hi> Weſtcheſter <hi>Path Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the Path towards the Sound,</hi> Habendum <hi>the ſaid Neck of Land.</hi> So here we have as particular an account and Deſcription of what the Grantor, <hi>John Richbell</hi> underſtood to be called a <hi>Neck of Land</hi> as words can expreſs; and in the next Deed he makes, which is the Mortgage of the Weſt Neck to <hi>Steenwyck,</hi> he uſes the word <hi>Neck</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, and Deſcribes it to be his the ſaid <hi>John Richbells Neck or piece of Land,</hi> lying upon the Main, being the moſt Weſterly Neck of the three, limitting <hi>the Neck of Land</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, upon the gravelly or ſtoney Water, which is the Eaſterly Limits of Mr. <hi>

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>John Richbell</hi> had ſaid to his Uncle <hi>Robert,</hi> as the truth is, 
  <q>I have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my <hi>Eaſt-Neck</hi> upon my Wife for a Joynture, and my <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> I have Mortgaged in fee to <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck</hi> for Sixty Pounds; I will now give you a Mortgage of Ninety nine Years on my <hi>Great Neck,</hi> lying between my two <hi>ſmall necks</hi> for two Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</q>

 Now, can any body ſuppoſe, without doing Violence to Reaſon, that becauſe he called it his <hi>great Neck,</hi> and Mortgaged it only for a term of years, and for above double the Sum of Money advanced upon the Fee-ſimple of the <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did not intend him a Twentieth or thirtieth part or quantity of the Land for his Security. I think his having firſt deſcribed the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Necks,</hi> as running Twenty Miles into the Woods, it was a full and compleat Deſcription of the <hi>great Neck,</hi> and of its Extending as far as the others, when he bounded it by his two <hi>ſmall Necks,</hi> on each ſide: And this Opinion is ſufficiently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ſubſequent Mortgage of <hi>John Richbell</hi> to <hi>Thomas Kellond,</hi> where he recites his having before Mortgaged both his <hi>Middle</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Necks;</hi> for tho' he well knew he had formerly, in expreſs words, Mortgaged the <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> running Twenty Miles into the Woods, to <hi>Steenwyck;</hi> and his <hi>Great Neck</hi> only by words of being between his other two <hi>ſmall necks:</hi> yet here when he comes to ſpeak of theſe <hi>Necks,</hi> as being formerly Mortgaged, he ſhews plainly, that he underſtood the word <hi>Neck,</hi> when apply'd to the <hi>great Neck,</hi> to mean the ſame thing as it did, when apply'd to <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> for his words are theſe, 
  <q>Grant, Bargain and to Farm-Let unto <hi>Thomas Kellond,</hi> &amp;c. the Reverſion of one <hi>Neck</hi> of Land, commonly called or known by the Name of the <hi>great Neck,</hi> as alſo the Reverſion of one other <hi>Neck</hi> of Land, being the <hi>moſt weſterly Neck</hi> of Land of the three, which is Mortgaged to <hi>Cornelius Steenwyck.</hi>
                  </q>

 He has not ſaid, as alſo the Reverſion of one other <hi>Neck</hi> of Land, being he moſt weſterly of the three, and running from the marked Trees on the ſaid <hi>Neck</hi> Twenty Miles into the Woods; Here there might have been ſome room to ſay he meant one thing by <hi>Neck,</hi> and another thing by <hi>Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods;</hi> but as he has not ſaid ſo, but the contrary, it would be hard to put ſuch a Conſtruction on his Intentions, when his words would never warrant, but Contradict ſuch a ſtrained Conſtruction. Now if we come to the Parties themſelves, I mean the <hi>Complainants</hi> &amp; <hi>Defendants</hi> in this Cauſe, it does appear that ſomething more than the Quantity of Land lying between the two Creeks, was meant by their Articles of Agreement before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; for there it is ſaid, 
  <q>That foraſmuch that it did not then appear that the <hi>Line</hi> runing into the Woods between <hi>the Great and Weſt-Neck,</hi> had ever been ſettled, markt out, or even the Courſe that it ought to run, appointed or limitted; therefore to prevent differences between the Parties to the ſaid Articles, if the Defendent, <hi>Courtland,</hi> ſhould happen to purchaſe the Reverſion of the <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> the ſaid Complainants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002940_0021_0FE69BB269186A90"/>to view the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>weſt-necks,</hi> and endeavour amicably to ſettle <hi>the line to its Extent into the Woods</hi> between the ſame <hi>Necks.</hi>
                  </q>

 Now, if nothing was underſtood by the Parties, by the word <hi>Neck,</hi> but the Land lying between the two Creeks, as far as the Tide or Salt Water flows, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendents inſiſt: how id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, nay, how abſurd was it to take all this Caution about runing <hi>a Line between the two Necks,</hi> if no more was intended? or, can it be underſtood, that the words <hi>ſettling the Line to its Extent into the Woods,</hi> between the <hi>ſame Necks,</hi> can be ſatisfied with this Conſtruction? No, it is Contradicting common ſenſe, in my Opinion, to ſay ſo; but I do not rely ſo far upon the Articles, as to alter either the words or Intent of <hi>John Richbell,</hi> in his ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Grants or Mortgages, but by the Articles it is evident, as well as by the Anſwer, that the Complainants claimed the <hi>Great Neck,</hi> as Extending <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Twenty Miles into the Woods.</hi> And tho' the words <hi>Twenty Miles</hi> were ſtruck out, as not being a proper Recital of the words of the Mortgage and Releaſe, under which the Complainants claim, yet it appears they all agreed to run <hi>a Line to its Extent into the Woods, between the two Necks.</hi> And for as much as the Defendants well knew the Claim of the Complainants, and at that time talk'd of purchaſing nothing but the Reverſion of the <hi>Weſt-Neck,</hi> upon which they had two Mortgages; and tho' ſome thing was ſaid, as appears by the Anſwer, of getting the Releaſe from the Heir of <hi>Richbell,</hi> ſo General as to include a piece of Land formerly Exchanged with Mr. <hi>Pell,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Richbell</hi> bordering upon the <hi>weſt-neck,</hi> yet it neither appears from the Articles, nor the Anſwer it ſelf, that ever the Defendants Diſcovered the leaſt Deſign of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing any part of the <hi>great Neck,</hi> or of <hi>the Lands,</hi> as the Defendants call them, <hi>running from the ſaid Neck Twenty Miles northward into the Woods,</hi> but the Contrary; and it is plain enough, that what the parties ſeemed apprehenſive of differing about, was <hi>the Running of the Line between the two Necks, to its Extent into the Woods,</hi> that is, leaſt the Owners of the <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to run the <hi>Line</hi> too far <hi>Eaſtward</hi> upon the <hi>Great Neck,</hi> or that the Owners of the <hi>great Neck</hi> ſhould endeavour to run the <hi>Line</hi> too far <hi>Weſtward</hi> upon the <hi>Weſt-Neck;</hi> and this appears plainly to be the intent of theſe Articles, as to the Land in Controverſie: And that both the <hi>Complainants</hi> &amp; <hi>Defendants,</hi> as well as <hi>John Richbell,</hi> underſtood more by the word <hi>Neck,</hi> than the Land between the two Creeks, as far as the Tyde flows. So that what appears here to be meant by the word <hi>Neck,</hi> in the Patent, and the ſeveral Mortgages that have been produced, &amp; by the Articles themſelves, I muſt be of Opinion, that the Deſcription of the <hi>middle neck</hi> is as Extenſive as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Weſt,</hi> &amp; if ſo, the Defendants by their Releaſe of <hi>Ed. Richbells</hi> Right to all the Lands in <hi>J. Richbells</hi> Purchaſe, will not help them, becauſe the <hi>great Neck</hi> is expreſly Excepted in their own Deed which has been produced here. Now if it be enquired, how the Equity of the Caſe ſtands upon the part of the Complainants? I think it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them; for it has been urged by both ſides, 
  <q>That when the words of Deeds are uncertain, they ſhall receive ſuch a reaſonable Conſtruction and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as muſt be without Injury to the Grantor, &amp; with the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Grantee.</q>

 Now, by this Rule, it is plain, that <hi>J. Richbell</hi> having only Mortgaged, &amp; not ſold, his <hi>Great Neck</hi> to his uncle <hi>R. Richbell,</hi> if the Neck be underſtood to Extend <hi>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> &amp; if that were allowed to be too large a ſecurity, yet it was no hurt to <hi>John,</hi> becauſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> had it in his power to redeem it, when he thought fit; but if the meaning of the word <hi>Neck</hi> be limitted, as the Defendants would have it, then the Mortgagee had little or no ſecurity for his Money, and was without any further Relief; for as it appears
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002940_0022_0FE69BC0F5C81CB8"/>by the Mortgage, there was no Covenants for the Payment of the Money to <hi>Robert Richbell:</hi> So that by ſuch an Expoſition or Conſtruction of the words of this Mortgage, as the Defendants would make; This Rule of Law would be Inverted, &amp; the greateſt Wrong would be done to the Mortgagee. But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Great Neck</hi> to run <hi>to us Extent,</hi> or <hi>to the Extent of the Patent,</hi> which I think is the ſame thing, that is, <hi>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants, who claim under the Mortgage to <hi>Robert Richbell,</hi> will have Juſtice done them, and the Defendants, who well knew before their own Purchaſe, that the Complainants had purchaſed the Equity of Redemption of the <hi>great Neck</hi> of <hi>John Richbells</hi> Heir, and Claimed by that Purchaſe, <hi>all the Lands to the Extent of the Patent,</hi> cannot be hurt; for in their Anſwer, it is not ſo much as ſuggeſted that the Lands Releaſed to the Defendants, by the Heir of <hi>Richbell,</hi> is not a full Conſideration for their Money, and of a far greater Value than what they paid for them; and were it otherwiſe, the Defendants being Purchaſers of what they own they knew the Complainants claimed, they could not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Courſe of a Court of Equity, expect to be favoured here; 
  <q>for a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer out of Poſſeſſion, with notice of a former Claim or Incumbrance (and ſuch as its plain the Defendants are) can never hope to prevail in a Court of Equity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am therefore of Opinion, that both by the words of the Deeds, the Intent of Parties, and the Equity of this Caſe, the Great Neck does and ought to Extend as far Northward as the Eaſt and Weſt-Neck.</hi> And accordingly, it is this preſent Day, that is, the Second Day of <hi>May,</hi> in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, <hi>George,</hi> by the Grace of God, of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, France,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> King, Defender of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by his Excellency <hi>William Burnet,</hi>

               <p>The Complainants ſay, The Almighty made every thing that is upon the face of the Earth, but did not aſſign Names to them, but left that to Man to do, and that ſome Men aſſign one, and others another Name to the ſame thing; and ſome by one Name underſtand one thing, others by the ſame Name under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand another thing. <hi>For Exemple,</hi> The Geographers and the Learned World, underſtand by <hi>a Neck of Land,</hi> that which joyns a Peninſula (or what's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an Iſland) to the Continent or Main Land; and the ſimilitude ſeemeth to be drawn from the human Body; for as the Neck there joyns the Head to the Body, ſo a Neck of Land joyns a Peninſula to a Continent; and there, neither the Peninſula nor the Continent are underſtood to be included in the Neck, no more than the Head or Body of a Man are included in his Neck. Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> again, being a little more favourable to the Complainants, than the learned World, in the meaning of a <hi>Neck of Land,</hi> allows it to contain, not only what the Learned World underſtand by <hi>a Neck of Land,</hi> but alſo the Peninſula it ſelf, or ſomething in a groſs way, allows the <hi>Head</hi> to be part of the <hi>Neck:</hi> This certainly is favourable! ſeeing the Complainants can ſhow no Title to the Peninſula, more than to the part of the Main Land they claim; and of Conſequence, had he dealt with them ſo hard as the Learned World, (it ſeems) would do, inſtead of 320 Acres, that he allows them, the learned World would not have left them, perhaps, the 20 Acres; ſo the 300 is a piece of meer Favour and Grace.</p>
               <p>But others again, (in ſtill a more groſs and vulgar way) ſuch as <hi>Governour Lovelace, John Richbell, John Rider, Robert Richbell, Steenwick, Kelland, Edward Richbell,</hi> and the <hi>Complainants,</hi> by the Patent and Deeds before Printed, tell you plainly, that they underſtand, that a <hi>Neck of Land</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, not only the <hi>Neck,</hi> (as the Learned World underſtand it) and the whole <hi>Peninſula,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> is ſo favourable to underſtand it) but alſo a part of the <hi>Main Land</hi> beſides; and even Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> by his Words and Actions, for near one year (as by this and the eleven following <hi>Inſtances</hi> will appear) had the ſame way of Thinking of a <hi>Neck</hi> too. The Complainants
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002940_0043_0FE69C16E21985D0"/>don't deny that the Name is groſs, and far from being accurate and expreſſive the thing meant; but its ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> one Acre.</hi> Nay, for one Name that's accurately Expreſſive, of the thing meant by it, the Complainants will be at no great loſs to aſſign ten Names that are not. But had the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants no ſuch Preſidents of Vulgar Conceptions to cite, they think its a ſufficient Excuſe, that its the Liberty and Priviledge of Mankind to aſſign ſuch Names as they think proper to Things, and alſo to aſſign ſuch Meanings as they think proper to Names; and if a Man will call his Land, or any part of it, a <hi>Head,</hi> a <hi>Neck,</hi> a <hi>Shoulder,</hi> a <hi>Hand,</hi> a <hi>Finger,</hi> or a <hi>Toe,</hi> &amp;c. who can hinder him?

That it was <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi>'s Meaning to accept of this generous Proffer of the Complainants, if this caſe had happened, who can doubt? ſeeing <hi>he Swears, He always was of Opinion,</hi> (or, which is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Man who was lately Satisfied, to accept of much leſs than ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRES <hi>of Land, whereon no Improvement was, for</hi> TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS, ſo great a Change is wrought on him, that for only FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS, for which he has got the Lands Exchanged by <hi>Pell,</hi> to which he had no Pretence before, and the Reverſion of the WEST-NECK, which are admitted to be of much more Value than <hi>Four Hundred Pounds,</hi> Now nothing leſs will ſerve him, for the ſame <hi>Four Hundred Pounds,</hi> than to have, over and above that, ONE HUNDRED TIMES ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRES OF SUCH LAND, and that from People too, who, with their Anceſtor, have been above Twenty Five Years in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it; People who have Expended a great deal in Improving of it, People who have paid the full Value of it, for it; People whom he had Solemnly agreed with, to have no Difference with them about it. Upon the Whole, the Complainants think, The Candid and Judicious Reader cannot long be at a ſtand in Determining, That <hi>Either Mr.</hi> Philipſe
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002940_0045_0FE69C1CB2BD9020"/>
                  <hi>meant more by the Word</hi> NECK, <hi>Thrice mentioned in the Additional Articles, than by his Anſwer, he Swears he always did;</hi> Or elſe <hi>He meant to give more than half of the Incumbrances on the</hi> WEST NECK, <hi>for what's much leſs than</hi> 160 <hi>Acres of Unimproved Land.</hi> If he meant the firſt, the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants think the Reader will be at ſome Difficulty to reconcile it with his Oath; for the Complainants cannot ſee how to Reconcile them; And if he meant the laſt, the Reader will be no leſs at a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſs to Reconcile his then Moderation, and his now Vaſt Demands. And the Complainants think, the Man will be of a happy Invention, that can ſhow what elſe Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> meant, if he meant neither of theſe, barring that of his Meaning as <hi>Hackerton</hi> did of his Cow, or which is the ſame, That he meant, that he was to mean by the Word NECK, when the Complainants ſhould Claim; by it, only ſo far as the Water comes; but when he himſelf ſhould Claim by it, in that Agreement, then he was to mean all that, and Twenty Miles more. This Third Meaning of <hi>Hackerton</hi>'s the Complainants allow, he might have, and therefore they muſt barr the Man of Invention from aſſigning that as another Meaning.</p>
               <p>And now the Complainants will come to the Articles of the <hi>4th Charge,</hi> for ſome <hi>further Inſtances</hi> of Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi>'s Meaning more by the NECKS than he Swears he ever did. Or, &amp;c.</p>

But theſe words, or that act, <hi>of putting off the Time for running the</hi> DIVISION LINE, <hi>between the</hi> GREAT NECK <hi>and</hi> WEST NECK, muſt with all Men of the common way of Thinking, import, That he underſtood the <hi>GREAT NECK</hi> and <hi>WEST NECK,</hi> were then capable of having <hi>A LINE</hi> run betwixt them. So either he thinks different from the Common way of Thinking, or his Sayings and Actions differ much from his Meaning. Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </hi> (call it as he has made it) <hi>to its Extent <hi>into the Woods, betwixt the Necks;</hi>
                  </hi> And in this 2d Article, Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> confeſſes, he told the Complainants, he deſigned to come and take a view of the Premiſſes; the above part of the Articles declares for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; upon this, the ſame Queſtion may be put as in the laſt Inſtance, and the ſame Reſolution muſt be of it; ſo that at that time alſo, it would ſeem, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood differently of the <hi>Necks,</hi> from what he Swears he always did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth Inſtance.</hi> —2— <hi>In February,</hi> 1723-4, its confeſſed, <hi>it was propoſed to meet,</hi> viz. for taking a view in order to ſettling the <hi>Line</hi> amicably. Upon this, the ſame Queſtion and Anſwer may be as before, ſo he then underſtood, that the <hi>Necks</hi> were capable of having a <hi>Line</hi> between them, or all the Abſurdities before muſt follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh Inſtance.</hi> —2— <hi>But being hindered, he ſent them word by Letter he could not go.</hi> From whence, a Man of the common way of Thinking, will
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002940_0046_0FE69C2836854A68"/>underſtand, that Mr.<hi>Philipſe,</hi> when he wrote that Letter, intended (had he not been hindered) to have gone, in order to ſettle the <hi>Line</hi> amicably, betwixt the <hi>Great Neck</hi> and <hi>Weſt Neck;</hi> And if he ſo intended, the like Queſtion and Anſwer may be as before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighth Inſtance.</hi> —1— He confeſſes, <hi>He propoſed afterwards to meet the letter end of March,</hi> viz. in order to ſettling the <hi>Line</hi> amicably between the <hi>Great Neck</hi> and <hi>Weſt Neck.</hi> Upon this the like Queſtion and Anſwer may be, and ſo a further time, when he underſtood differently of the <hi>Necks,</hi> or <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ninth Inſtance.</hi> —2— <hi>But the Arrival of a Veſſel hindered him, and therefore he ſent another Letter.</hi> The like may be ſaid on this, as on the Seventh Inſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenth Inſtance.</hi> —3— <hi>Afterwards, he met the Complainants at New-Rochel,</hi> viz. for to endeavour, amicably to ſettle the <hi>LINE</hi> between the <hi>GREAT NECk</hi> and <hi>WEST NECk,</hi> according to the 3d Clauſe of the Articles. Upon which ſtill, the like Queſtion &amp; Reſolution therof may be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventh Inſtance.</hi> —4— <hi>Afterwards,</hi> ARBITRATORS <hi>were appointed, purſuant to the Articles, for determineing, how the</hi> DIVISION LINE <hi>between</hi> THE TWO NECKS, <hi>should run into the Woods.</hi> Did he then, as before, underſtand that the NECKS were not capable, of having A LINE run betwixt them? other Folks would think, that when People ſolemnly enter into an Agreement about <hi>A LINE</hi> and appoint <hi>ARBITRATORS,</hi> to ſettle how the Courſe of that <hi>LINE</hi> ſhould run, that theſe People really under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, there was ſuch a thing as <hi>A LINE</hi> to be run, which theſe <hi>ARBI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRATORS</hi> were to determine the Courſe of; but, if what Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> Swears be true, he had no ſuch meaning, had no thoughts, nor did not underſtand, that the GREAT NECK and WEST NECK, were capable of ANY LINE betwixt them, at the ſame time that he appointed <hi>ARBITRATORS</hi> to determine the Courſe of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfth Inſtance.</hi> —4— <hi>That the</hi> 16th <hi>or</hi> 17th <hi>of</hi> May, 1724. <hi>the</hi> Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators, <hi>Mr.</hi> Philipſe <hi>and the</hi> Complainants, <hi>came to</hi> New-Rochel, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> For determineing how the LINE OF DIVISION ſhould run into the Woods, between the TWO NECKS purſuant to the Articles, upon which, the like Queſtion and Reſolution may be, as in the Eleventh Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Above, the Complainants have aſſigned a Dozen of Inſtances, and if a neceſſity were for it, could aſſign as many more, wherein, according to the Conception of Men of common Reaſon, the Defendant <hi>Philipſe,</hi> muſt have underſtood more by the NECKS, than to where the Water comes up; and that, he underſtood where the Water ceaſed to divide THE NECKS, they were to begin to be divided by A LINE, from thence running into the Woods: And if every Man of common Reaſon, muſt ſo interpret his Words and Actions; Why muſt all theſe Clamours be againſt the Court for ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them? when without underſtanding them ſo, the groſſeſt Abſurdities and Contradictions muſt of Courſe follow. But the reaſon of his Swearing, he always underſtood ſo of the <hi>Necks,</hi> may be gueſſed at a little; becauſe, if he allows they go beyond the place where the Water divides them, whatever
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002940_0047_0FE69C2859298B28"/>reaſon will carry them one Foot beyond it, will carry them to the Extent of the Patent; for, let but <hi>A LINE</hi> be, and he well knows there's no ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t he conceived not altogether amiſs in, for tho' they very well ſaw that, and many other things herein ſet forth, before the hearing, yet they were very loath to Touch upon them, and what they did towards it, was in ſo tender Touches, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew but Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> himſelf could gather much from them; and that becauſe, they thought the Deeds themſelves, made all clear enough, without dipping into theſe things; and ſo the matter ſhould have remained upon that footing only, if ſo many vile, falſe and ſcandalous Reports. Reproaches and Clamours, had not ſince the Decree, been invented and ſpread thro this Province, of this Cauſe, and of the Complainants, and of moſt who have dared to do their duty in it, (by whoſe means the Complainants ſay not, but leave the Reader to gueſs) that more than ſufficiently, give theſe Complainants cauſe, to keep the Truth no longer hid.</p>
               <p>But to proceed,—5—The Complainants ſhall agree, that Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> now began a little nearer to ſquare his Actions and Words, with what he Swears, always was his Meaning of the NECKS. And in order to that, it being, by the <hi>3d Clauſe</hi> of the Articles of Agreement, in the moſt Expreſs words agreed, <hi>That in caſe the Parties cannot by themſelves agree How the</hi> LINE OF DIVISION <hi>between the</hi> TWO NECKS <hi>shall Run</hi> TO ITS EXTENT (as Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> has made it) <hi>into the Woods, Then they have agreed, to leave the Determination thereof to ſix Indifferent Perſons.</hi> The firſt Step that's taken, is to break th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat Solemn, Plain and Expreſs Agreement: That this his Declining to enter into Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds, was a breaking thro' it, is plain; for when People agree to leave a Thing to the Determination of others, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt be thereby alſo tacitly agreed, to do every thing that may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to impower theſe to Determine, and to compel the Performance of what's determined; and the denying to do theſe things, (as here to enter into Bonds) is a denying to comply with the Agreement, or in plain terms breaking thro' it.—6—The Sequel ſhows, how much of verity there was in this; if he thought that Power from Mr <hi>Courtland,</hi> and his verbal aſſent, impowered the <hi>Arbitrators,</hi> why would not he alſo give his Bond; Its ſaid <hi>AN HONEST MAN,</hi> will never Scruple his Bond where he gives his Word; for AN HONEST MAN, values his Word as much as his Bond, and ſhould think it a Diſhonour to him, for any one to think it of leſs force; but it ſeems Mr. <hi>PHILIPSE</hi> here, did not put an equal Value on them.—7—The next ſtep Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> took, to ſquare his Actions and his Words, with what he Swears always was his meaning; was, <hi>that the Defendant</hi> Philipſe <hi>then obſerved, that the</hi> TWENTY MILES INTO THE WOODS, <hi>was</hi> A SEPARATE GRANT, <hi>and that the</hi> NECK, <hi>cannot go further than the Water makes it ſo.</hi> How much truth was in this Obſervation, and whether this was not the firſt time, he had ever opened his <hi>RESERVE,</hi> by telling the Complainants ſo; the Reader is referred to the Patent, Deeds and Decree it ſelf, which fully diſcuſs that matter; and to the 6th Obſervation on the <hi>3d Charge,</hi> to judge by. And how <hi>Juſt, Equitable</hi> and <hi>Conſcionable,</hi> his pretenſion by <hi>Edward Richbell</hi>'s Releaſe is, the Reader is referred, to the <hi>firſt Charge</hi> and Obſervations thereon, to judge by.—8—Mr. Philipſes <hi>denying, that this was the firſt time, that he had Expreſſed his Sentiments about the Boundaries;</hi> muſt appear very Evaſive and Ambigu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us; when its conſidered, that a Man may have different
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002940_0048_0FE69C2B17901AC0"/>Sentiments at different Times, and declaring any of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe, comes up to all this: and this may as well mean, that he had before declared his Sentiments, that the Boundaries of the <hi>GREAT NECK,</hi> went to the Extent of the Patent, as that they did not; but when its conſidered, that Mr. <hi>Philipſe,</hi> for near a years time, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Executing of the Articles to this time, <hi>had different Sentiments, even at the ſame times,</hi> viz. a Set of <hi>EXPRESSED SENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS</hi> by his Words and Actions that A LINE was to be run between the GREAT NECK and WEST NECK, as appears from the 12 Inſtances before, and a Set of <hi>RESERVED SENTIMENTS,</hi> that NO LINE was to be run at all, ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Swears, he always underſtood the NECKS to reach no further than the Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and of Conſequence, not capable of being divided by A LINE. Now his <hi>Expreſsed Sentiments,</hi> its agreed, this was not the firſt time he declared them, but as to the others, he can hardly ſhow a probability, to induce any Man to believe he did declare them to the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants before; ſeeing, his <hi>Expreſsed Sentiments,</hi> were ſo Diametrically oppoſite thereto. The next Paragraph, <hi>viz. And affirms, that he had long before, and at ſeveral times, told ſome of the Complainants, they had a Right to no more than the <hi>Middle Neck</hi> only; as has been ſet forth before.</hi> When its conſidered, will appear equally Ambiguous with the laſt; for, as to what's before the words, <hi>as has been ſet forth before,</hi> its agreed he might tell them ſo, and the Complainants never pretended to any more than the <hi>Middle Neck;</hi> but they always underſtood the <hi>Middle Neck,</hi> to extend further than what he ſays he underſtood it, ſo that that was juſt nothing. Then does the words, <hi>as has been ſet forth before</hi> determine his meaning here, to be theirs or his? No, for the Complainants ſet forth before, that the <hi>Middle</hi> or <hi>Great Neck,</hi> does extend to the Extent of the Patent, and he otherwiſe, and which of theſe is meant, is left Ambiguous. The next Paragraph is, <hi>The alteration of the Articles, was declared at firſt ſight thereof.</hi> The Complainants need not diſpute that, ſeeing, as before, they were not with him at the firſt ſight thereof, as appears by the 2d and 6th Articles, and latter part of the firſt Article of the 3d Charge, and the Obſervations thereon; and of Conſequence, that declaration was not to them. The next Paragraph is, <hi>And at the time of making the alteration, not objected againſt by them, as is ſet forth before.</hi> That the alteration was objected to, the Complainants conceive plain, from what appears under the 6th Article of the 4th Charge, and Obſervations thereon. But why did not Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> once mention to the Arbitrators, <hi>this (ſo much inſiſted on) Argument,</hi> that he objected to the words <hi>TWENTY MILES</hi> before hand; it ſeems very ſtrange, that what he now conceives, <hi>ſo weighty an Argument,</hi> ſhould have been intirely forgot by him, and not one word of it thought of, at leaſt Expreſſed, during all this Arbitration, the Complainants may well ſay ſo, ſeeing thro' all his Anſwer he does not ſay he did; but to make up for it, he here introduces in his Anſwer, concerning the Tranſactions before the Arbitrators, a repetition of the old Story, in order probably to induce theſe who read it unwarily, to think that it was a matter inſiſted on or mentioned before the Arbitrators: but whoever will but read it, with the leaſt Attention, may eaſily ſee, its not pretended to be a matter mentioned to the Arbitrators; tho' ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly ſo introduced, as to make it ſeem as if it had. And as its Evident from hence, that this mighty new pretence, of having objected to the TWENTY MILES beforehand, and of having told the Complainants thereof, was not ſo much as once thought on, or mentioned before the Arbitrators, the Reader is left to judge, whether that gives not a great deal of Ground, to Suſpect that to be AN AFTER THOUGHT, as is before hinted, under <hi>Charge 3d, No.</hi> 2 and 6; for, had
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002940_0049_0FE69C2BA1FA74B0"/>ſuch a thing ever been, its hardly reaſonable to be ſuppoſed, it would have been then forgot; ſeeing that time, was within a year of the Tranſaction. And to ſuſpect that Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> finding his GRAND ARGUMENT before the Arbitrators (in the next Article) Defeated, by making it ſo obvious to his memory, that the Facts then aſſerted by him were untrue: there was a neceſſity of thinking, or dreaming of ſome colour or other, to make an excuſe, for that flagrant act, of ſtriking out the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when the ſeveral places in the Anſwer, where this Exception or Objection is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now We come to the GRAND ARGUMENT inſiſted on before the Arbitrators, —9— which the Reader is deſired to turn back to, and carefully to peruſe. The GRAND ARGUMENT it may be called, for had it been true, there would have been a great deal of weight in it. As for the other ARGUMENT, <hi>That the</hi> NECKS <hi>are to the Markt Trees, and what's above them is a ſeperate Grant,</hi> it may well be called the LITTLE ARGUMENT, in reſpect of the Other; in ſo far, as any Man of very moderate Capacity, by looking over <hi>Lovelace</hi>'s Patent (above, Printed in <hi>fol.</hi> 1 and 2, of the Decree) cannot be long in Determining, that the Facts of that Argument are Untrue; For its plain, there's not <hi>Two Grants,</hi> but <hi>One Grant,</hi> Not <hi>Two Tracts,</hi> but <hi>One Tract,</hi> granted thereby. But this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appearing ſo fully Refuted in the Decree, there's no need here of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhowing the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Littleneſs</hi> of it. But Unluckily the GRAND ARGUMENT falls to the Ground! That Matter being ſo lately tranſacted, as within a year, and in ſo Unhandſom a manner, (as before, in the <hi>3d Charge</hi> appears) that it could not but leave lively Impreſſions of the Circumſtances thereof, on the Complainants Minds; which being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>id before him in ſo ſtrong a manner, we find it brought the matter too clear in his Memory to deny it. But had this Matter been ſlowly followed, its ſubmitted to the Reader, Whether, probably, <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi> would not have in time, Sworn theſe Things to be True, which he now, before the Arbitrators, ſo gravely Aſſerted to be True, and which by his Anſwer on this Point, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, He was Miſtaken in. Its alſo here ſubmitted to the Reader to judge by this, Whether Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> be any way entitled to the Obſervation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Memories, in the <hi>6th Article</hi> of the <hi>3d Charge?</hi> And if he ſhould be of Opinion, That this no ways entitles him to it, then they refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Obſervations on the Anſwer in general. Its alſo ſubmitted to the Reader to judge, Whether at that time, had he been in the Complainants Caſe, he had not a great deal of reaſon to believe, he ſhould ſoon be clear of the Pretenſions of Mr. <hi>Philipſe,</hi> ſeeing the ONLY ARGUMENTS he then pretended to uſe, before the Arbitrators, were ſo clearly Refuted, as

But notwithſtanding that, —11— Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> again declined to enter into Bonds to impower them, tho' preſſed to it by the Complainants; which, with his ſaying, <hi>He muſt ask Mr.</hi> Courtland <hi>firſt, before he would ſtand to the Articles,</hi> was a beginning, <hi>in expreſs Terms,</hi> to declare, he intended to break thro' that ſolemn Agreement. —12— How Groundleſs and Unfair muſt this Pretence of his be, that he would not ſubmit it in a proper manner, to the Arbitrators, who were ſo willing to Determine? when, <hi>in Conſcience,</hi> he ought to have done it, ſeeing it had been ſo <hi>Solemnly agreed to be done.</hi> And how vexatious muſt the Reader think it, to have given the Complainants the Trouble of ſo many Meetings, to ſettle this matter amicably, when it would ſeem, he had no intention of doing it?

                  </gap>gth; for the Facts pretended to be obviated by it, are not in the leaſt obviated thereby: Is the Complainants Kindneſs and Candidneſs, <hi>in tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Defendants of the Heir, and enquiring whether Mr.</hi> Courtland <hi>had intentions to purchaſe,</hi> any thing the leſs, for the Defendants knowing of the Heir before hand? No ſurely, for their Kindneſs and Candidneſs was the ſame. And this long Story is ſo far from anſwering that purpoſe of Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating theſe Facts, that on the contrary, it plainly demonſtrates a Tract of Unfair Dealing in the Defendants; for <note n="(d)" place="bottom">65.</note> the Defendant <hi>Philipſe calls it <hi>undermining</hi> in the</hi> Palmers, <hi>for to have Treated for the Weſt-Neck, becauſe Mr.</hi> Courtland <hi>had ſo great an Intereſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n it by the Incumbrances he had on it;</hi> Tho' the Complainants acted ſo Candidly, and with Notice, as before. Now if the Complainants Treaty for the <hi>Weſt Neck</hi> deſerves that Name, when the Defendants confeſs, <hi>They had Expended no Money in the Improvement of it,</hi> What muſt this Treaty of the Defendants, for the whole Right of the Heir, and of conſequence for the <hi>Great Neck,</hi> deſerve the Name of? when its confeſſed by the Defendants, <hi>That the Complainants had been ſo long in quiet Poſſeſſion of it, and Expended ſo much in the Improvement of it,</hi> as in the <hi>firſt Charge</hi> appears, and that without any Notice to the Complainants of ſuch Treaty, or asking them, whether they had thoughts of Purchaſing, as in the <hi>Second Charge</hi> appears. Certainly if the Complainants Treaty for the <hi>Weſt-Neck</hi> deſerves the Name of UNDERMINING, this Treaty of the Defendants deſerves no leſs.</p>
               <p>Again, What is it to this Cauſe, if all that's ſaid about Sending the Power of Attorney home, were true? No Man of Senſe will ſay that it affects the Cauſe, but very much affects the Characters of the Complainants and Mr. <hi>Haskoll;</hi> and were it true, ſhows them to be Vile Men, to be guilty of ſuch Underhand and Unfair Dealing (Whether it has any Affinity with giving Orders to Treat with the Complainants Correſpondents, as in the <hi>2d Charge</hi> appears, the Complainants leave the Reader to judge) But will it be a Reaſon becauſe the Complainants (as Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> aſſerts) are Vile Men, and have dealt Unfairly by Mr. <hi>Richbell,</hi> that therefore their Eſtates ſhould be taken from them, and given to Mr. <hi>Philipſe?</hi> The Complainants think, it will
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002940_0054_0FE69C38CD1A10A0"/>hardly make a good Title to <hi>Mr. Philipſe,</hi> nor had he any thing to do with this Matter in this Cauſe; but if they had Injured Mr. <hi>Richbell</hi> thereby, Mr. <hi>Richbell</hi> was the Only Perſon to whom Reparation was due for the Injury. How much the Complainants have Injured Mr. <hi>Richbell,</hi> more than the Defendants would have done, appears (in ſome meaſure) by the Defendants dropping it out in this long Story. <hi>That they might have had Mr.</hi> Richbell<hi>'s whole Right for Four Hundred Pounds;</hi> whereas it appears, he has now got for it, by the Complainants means, hear double that Money.</p>
               <p>But to conſider this Matter a little cloſer; Should any Candid Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to attack anothers Reputation, upon ſo ſlight grounds as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Philipſe</hi> here ſets forth, (viz. <hi>That he has been Informed, and Thinks; by one of the Complainants, that baſe Means were uſed to cauſe this Power of Attorney to be ſent Home</hi>) without firſt making all proper Enquiry about the Matter, which he had the means of doing, the Perſon impowered being upon the Spot, and might be enquired of, as to the Truth of this Matter, at any time ſince? Is that Inſinuation fair, <hi>That thy Complainant</hi> Quinby <hi>could not diſown, but it coſt him Money, to get the Power ſent home? Mr. Philipſe</hi> does not ſay, that ever <hi>Quinby</hi> ſaid any thing to that purpoſe; and if (as the truth is) <hi>Quinby</hi> never heard of any ſuch thing, till he found it in this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> it certainly was impoſſible for him to diſown; what he never heard of, or was Taxed with. How could <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi> ſay, from any thing he there ſets forth, and without enquiry of the Perion having the Power, That SURE IT IS, THE SAME WAS RETURNED? The very nature of the Thing hardly admits of any ſuch Swearing about it; and if ten Thouſand People had told him ſo, it was not ſufficient for him to Swear ſo Poſitively about this Matter; Nay, if even the Perſon having the Power had ſaid ſo, it was not ſufficient for him to Swear ſo.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Impartial Reader;</hi> its conceived, cannot well eſcape being at a ſtand what to think of this SWEARING, but the Complainants Think he will be ſtill more ſo, when they do aver, and offer to prove the following Facts to be True

That the Power of Attorney was never ſent Home again; nor was any thing ever ſaid by Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> or Mr. <hi>Haskoll,</hi> to give any reaſon to any Body, to believe or ſuggeſt, that it was; that they never heard of ſuch a Suggeſtion till it was found to be Sworn in this Anſwer; But <hi>That very Power of Attorney</hi> has ever ſince remained in <hi>Mr. Alexander</hi>'s Hands here. That <hi>Mr. Alexander</hi> ſhowed it to <hi>Mr. Murray,</hi> who is of Council for <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi> in this Cauſe, the firſt time he had an opportunity, after he had a ſight of Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi>'s Anſwer, with much Surprize, that Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> ſhould have Swore ſo!

               <p>The Complainants allow, that ſuch of theſe Facts as appear not in the Anſwer or Deeds confeſſed, they have not the Liberty of uſing them as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before a Court of Judicature in this Cauſe: Yet, as ſo great Liberties have been taken, in inventing and ſpreading of Falſhoods and Slanders thro' this Province, of the Complainants and their Cauſe, they claim the Privilege of telling Truth, in Oppoſition thereto. And if theſe Truths ſhould be hard to bear, <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi> ought to blame the Inventers of theſe Falſhoods and Clamours, whoever they be, and not the Complainants, for Oppoſing them with Truth, in Self-defence.</p>

               <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CLAMOURS,</head>
               <p>AS to the Clamours themſelves, the Complainants think it would be paying them too much Regard, to ſet about to anſwer them one by one, in Print, being well aſſured, the Propogators of them (if any Modeſty they have remaining) muſt Bluſh when any Man of Senſe puts a few Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, ſuch as, <hi>How do you know This? Is this ſufficient Reaſons for you to believe, and Report this again?</hi> But in general, the Complainants ſay, That they think all of them, that concern the Merits of this Cauſe, will appear ſufficiently anſwered, by what appears in the Decree, and what's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to it. As to the other Clamours about this Cauſe, which touch not the Merits of it, they know none of them worth Notice, that have any Truth to ſupport them, except One, and that is about the <hi>Height of the Coſts</hi> of this Cauſe: As to which, it is true, that the <hi>Bill of Coſts</hi> offered for Taxation, amounted to <hi>Seven Hundred Pounds,</hi> which Bill was moderated to and Taxed at about <hi>Four Hundred and Fourteen Pounds,</hi> which its alſo acknowledged is a great deal of Money for the Coſts of one Suit; but whether the Complainants had not more reaſon to clamour for this, than Mr. <hi>Philipſe,</hi> the Reader will be able to judge, when he conſiders what follows.</p>
               <p>The Complainants do conceive, That as <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi> did endeavour to weary them out by Numbers of Attendances, in-order for the Settling this Controverſie in an Amicable manner, as in the <hi>4th Charge</hi> appears; ſo likewiſe his Conduct in this Suit, gives them ſufficient reaſon to believe, his Aim and View was to give Delay, and to ſwell the Proceedings, as much as in his Power, in order to raiſe the Charge of this Suit to ſuch a Height, as that either the Complainants ſhould not be able to carry it on, or to give ground for the Clamours now made about the Coſts.</p>
               <p>For, the Bill of Complaint, in this Cauſe, was filed on the 24th of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> 1725, 6, and the Defendants had even much more Time than, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Court is allowed to make Anſwer in; yet when Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi> was aſhamed to ask more Time of the Court, he prevailed upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants and their Council, to give ſundry Months longer Time, as by Letters, <hi>No.</hi> 1, 2 and 3, following, will appear. And yet, after all that, put the Complainants, at laſt, to the Neceſſity of taking out the Compulſory Proceſs of the Court; by which means the Complainants were delayed, for want of an Anſwer, till the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1726. and then the Defendants gave in an Anſwer conſiſting of <hi>One Hundred and Ninty Nine Sheets,</hi> whereof the greateſt part could be of no other Uſe than to Calumniate the Complainants, as by a Specimen of it in the <hi>Obſervations in General</hi> on the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> before, in part, appears; in which Anſwer there was alſo a Demurrer, which took
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002940_0057_0FE69C3AB4BC1770"/>long Time to argue, and ſend for Council for that purpoſe. And after the Decree was Pronounced, on the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1727. tho' the Defendants Council were often entreated Perſonally, and by Meſſengers, to ſhorten the Anſwer, in order to take ſo much of it only into the Decree as was of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet they would neither do it, nor give a Poſitive Denyal, till the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> when they inſiſted on having the whole Anſwer <hi>Verbatim,</hi> in the Decree. Whereupon the Complainants Council, ſuſpecting Mr. <hi>Philipſe</hi>'s View of raiſing a Clamour, from the Height that this would neceſſarily bring the Coſts to, he made that Froteſt in Letter <hi>No.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>As to Reducing the Bill of Coſts from <hi>Seven Hundred</hi> to <hi>Four Hundred Pounds,</hi> its Notorious that the Complainants employed four Council in, this Cauſe, whereof Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed but for two Council, and nothing allowed for theſe Gentlemens coming here, who cannot be preſumed to come from theſe Provinces for a ſmall matter.</p>
               <p>Which Matters being conſidered, the Complainants think, the <hi>Candid Reader</hi> will come into the ſame way of Thinking with them, concerning <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi>'s Delays, and ſwelling of the Proceedings, <hi>to wit,</hi> That they were deſigned by him either to diſable the Complainants from Proſecuting this Suit, at ſo great a Charge, or to furniſh him with a matter for Clamour, at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> conſidered alſo, That the Sum Taxed does not amount to the one half of the actual Charges the Complainants have been put to, in the Proſecution of this Suit; and, how little ground <hi>Mr. Philipſe</hi> has for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which have occaſioned this Suit; and, how much Pains the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants have taken to Prevent this Suit, by Amicable means, as all through the <hi>3d</hi> and <hi>4th Charges</hi> does appear; No Reaſonable Man can but think, that the Hardſhip is upon the Complainants, and that they had the moſt reaſon to Clamour.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002940_0059_0FE69B5E58AB8188"/>your Anſwer would certainly have been in; and in Aſſurance thereof, they came to Town the 20th of <hi>April,</hi> and were diſappointed.
