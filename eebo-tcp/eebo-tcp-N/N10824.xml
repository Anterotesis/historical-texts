         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ASSOCIATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E his Majesty's most loyal Subjects, the Delegates of the several Colonies of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, the Three Lower Counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, and South-Carolina, deputed to represent them in a continental Congress, held in the city of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, on the fifth day of September, 1774, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our allegiance to his Majesty, our affection and regard for our fellow-subjects in Great-Britain and elsewhere, affected with the deepest anxiety, and most alarming apprehensions at those Grievances and distresses, with which his Majesty's American subjects are oppressed, and having taken under our most serious deliberation, the state of the whole continent, find, that the present unhappy situation of our affairs, is occasioned by a ruinous system of colony-administration adopted by the British Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry about the year 1763, evidently calculated for enslaving these Colonies, and, with them, the British Empire. In prosecution of which system, various Acts of Parliament have been passed for raising a Revenue in America, for depriving the American subjects, in many instances, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutional trial by jury, exposing their lives to danger, by directing a new and illegal trial beyond the seas, for crimes alledged to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in America; And in prosecution of the same system, several late, cruel, and oppressive Acts have been passed respecting the town of Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and the Massachusetts-Bay, and also an Act for extending the province of Quebec, so as to border on the western frontiers of these Colonies, establishing an arbitrary government therein, and discouraging the settlement of British subjects in that wide-extended country; thus by the influence of civil principles and ancient prejudices to dispose the inhabitants to act with hostility against the free Protestant Colonies, whenever a wicked Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry shall chuse so to direct them.</p>
            <p>To obtain redress of these grievances, which threaten destruction to the lives, liberty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his Majesty's subjects in North-America, we are of opinion, that a non-importation, non-consumption, and non-exportation agreement, faithfully adhered to, will prove the most speedy, effectual, and peaceable measure:—And therefore we do, for ourselves, and the inhabitants of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colonies, whom we represent, firmly agree and associate under the sacred ties of virtue, honor, and love of our country, as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> That from and after the first day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember next, we will not import into British Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, from Great-Britain or Ireland, any goods, wares or merchandize whatsoever, or from any other place any such goods, wares or merchandize, as shall have been exported from Great-Britain or Ireland: nor will we, after that day, import any East India tea from any part of the world; nor any molasses, syrrups, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neles, coffee, or piemento, from the British planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or from Dominica; nor wines from Madeira, or the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> That we will neither import, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase any slave imported after the 1st day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember next, after which time, we will wholly discontinue the slave-trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third.</hi> As a non-consumption agreement, strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhered to, will be an effectual security for the observation of the non-importation, we, as above, solemnly agree and associate, that, from this day, we will not purchase or use any tea imported on account of the East-India company, or any on which a duty hath been or shall be paid; and from and after the 1st day of March next, we will not purchase or use any East-India tea whatever, nor will we, nor shall any person for or under us, purchase or use any of those goods, wares, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, we have agreed not to import, which we shall know, or have cause to suspect, were impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the first day of December, except such as come under the rules and diiections of the tenth article hereafter mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth.</hi> The earnest desire we have, not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our fellow-subjects in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the West-Indies, induces us to suspend a non-exportation until the tenth day of September, 1775; at which time if the said Acts and parts of Acts of the British parliament, herein after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, export any merchandize or commodity whatsoever, to Great Britain, Ireland or the West-Indies, except Rice to Europe</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth.</hi> Such as are merchants, and use the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish and Irish Trade, will give orders, as soon as possible, to their factors, agents and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, in Great Britain and Ireland, not to ship any goods to them on any pretence whatsoever, as they cannot be received in America; and if any merchant residing in Great-Britain or Ireland, shall directly or indirectly ship any goods, wares or merchandize, for America, in order to break the said non importation agreement, or in any manner contravene the same on such unworthy conduct being well attested, it ought to be made public; and, on the same being so done, we will not from thenceforth have any commercial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with such merchant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth.</hi> That such as are owners of vessels will give positive orders to their captains, or masters, not to receive on board their vessels any goods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by the said non-importation agreement, on pain of immediate dismission from their service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventh.</hi> We will use our utmost endeavours to improve the breed of sheep and increase their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the greatest extent, and to that end, we will kill them as sparingly as may be, especially those of the most profitable kind; nor will we ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>port any to the West Indies, or elsewhere; and those of us who are or may become overstocked with, or can conveniently spare any sheep, will dispose of them to our neighbours, especially to the poorer sort, on moderate terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eight.</hi> That we will in our several stations encourage frugality, oeconomy, and industry; and promote agriculture, arts, and the manufactures of this country, especially that of wool; and will discountenance and discourage, every species of extravagance and dissipation, especially all horse-racing, and all kinds of gaming, cock-fighting, exhibitions of shews, plays, and other expensive diversions and entertainments. And on the death of any relation or friend, none of us, or any of our families, will go into any further mourning dress, than a black crape or ribbon on the arm or hat for Gentlemen, and a black ribbon and necklace for Ladies, and we will discontinue the giving of gloves and scarfs at funerals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninth.</hi> That such as are venders of goods or merchandize, will not take advantage of the scar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>city of goods that may be occasioned by this asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, but will sell the same at the rates we have been respectively accustomed to do, for twelve months last past.—And if any vender of goods or merchandize, shall sell any such goods on higher terms, or shall in any manner, or by any device whatsoever, violate or depart from this agreement, no person ought, nor will any of us deal with any such person, or his or her factor or agent, at any time thereafter, for any commodity whatever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenth.</hi> In case any merchant, trader, or other persons shall import any goods or merchandize after the first day of <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> next, the same ought forthwith at the election of the owner, to be either re-shipped or delivered up to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the county, or town wherein they shall be imported, to be stored at the risque of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, until the non-importation agreement shall cease, or be sold under the direction of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee aforesaid; and in the last mentioned case, the owner or owners of such goods, shall be reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed (out of the sales) the first cost and charges, the profit if any, to be applied towards relieving and employing such poor inhabitants of the town of Boston, as are immediate sufferers by the Boston Port-Bill; and a particular account of all goods so returned, stored, or sold, to be inserted in the public papers; and if any goods or merchandizes shall be imported after the said first day of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, the same ought forthwith to be sent back again, without breaking any of the packages thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventh.</hi> That a committee be chosen in every county, city, and town, by those who are qualified to vote for Representatives in the Legislature, whose business it shall be attentively to observe the conduct of all persons touching this association; and when it shall be made to appear to the satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faction of a majority of any such committee, that any person within the limits of their appointment has violated this association, that such majority do forthwith cause the truth of the case to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in the Cazette, to the end that all such foes to the rights of British America may be publicly known, and universally contemned as the enemies of American liberty: and thenceforth we respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively will break off all dealings with him or her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfth.</hi> That the committee of correspondence in the respective colonies do frequently inspect the entries of their custom-houses, and inform each other from time to time of the true state thereof, and of every other material circumstance that may occur relative to this association.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirteenth.</hi> That all manufactures of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be sold at reasonable prices, so that no undue advantage be taken of a future scarcity of goods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourteenth.</hi> And we do further agree and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, that we will have no trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> commerce, deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or intercourse whatsoever, with any colony or province, in North-America, which shall not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to, or which shall hereafter vi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>late this asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of freedom, and as inimical to the liberties of their country.</p>
            <p>And we do solemnly bind ourselves and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents, under the ties aforesaid, to adhere to this association until such parts of the several Acts of parliament passed since the close of the last war, as impose or continue duties on Tea, Wine, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasses, Syrups, Paneles, Coffee, Sugar, Piemento, Indigo, Foreign Paper, Glass, and Painters Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, imported into America, and extend the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Admiralty courts beyond their ancient limits, deprive the American Subject of trial by jury, authorize the Judge's certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages, that he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be liable to from a trial by his peers, require oppressive security from a claimant of ships or goods seized, before he shall be allowed to defend his property, are repealed:—And until that part of the Act of the 12. G. 3. chap. 24, entitled, <q>An Act for the better securing his Majesty's dock yards, magazines, ships, ammunition, and stores,</q> by which, any persons charged with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any of the offences therein described, in America, may be tried in any shire or county within the realm, is repealed—And until the four Acts passed in the last session of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> That for stopping the port and blocking up the harbour of Boston—That for altering the charter and government of the Massachusetts Bay—And that which is entitled "An Act for the better administration of justice, &amp;c.—And that "For extending the limits of Quebec, &amp;c. are repealed. And we recommend it to the provincial conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to the committees in the respective Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, to establish such further regulations as they may think proper, for carrying into execution this Association.</p>
            <p>The foregoing Association being determined upon by the CONGRESS, was ordered to be subscribed by the several Members thereof; and thereupon we have hereunto set our respective names accordingly.</p>
