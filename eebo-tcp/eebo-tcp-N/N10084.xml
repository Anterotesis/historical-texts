            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MANKIND are generally averſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations both in religion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Laws and conſtitutions to which they have been long uſed, they are fond of retaining, even though better are offered in their ſtead. This appeared in the Jews. Their law required a burdenſome and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012813_0004_0F8AB96B8FD4FA80"/>
expenſive ſervice: chriſtianity ſet them free from this law. Nevertheleſs, many of them were deſirous of continuing the obſervation of it, after they became chriſtians; and of having the gentile converts alſo ſubmit to it. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly there were ſome Judaiſing teachers who endeavoured to perſuade the Galatians to this ſubmiſſion. The Apoſtle, therefore, in this epiſtle, particularly in the immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chapter, aſſerts and proves, that chriſtians have nothing to do with the ceremonial law of the Jews, they being freed by Chriſt, from this burden. And then as an inference from what he had ſaid, and by way of admonition to the Galatians, he ſubjoins the exhortation in the text; ſtand faſt therefore in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made us free.</p>
            <p>BUT though the words originally refer to that freedom from the Jewiſh law which the goſpel confers on the church of God; yet the reaſon of the inference holds good in the caſe of any other real and valuable liberty which men have a right to: So that this obſervation is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deducible from the text; viz. that it is the duty of all men to ſtand faſt in ſuch valuable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as providence has confered upon them.</p>
            <p>THIS obſervation I ſhall endeavour, by the help of God, to illuſtrate and improve: In order to which, I ſhall ſhew;

                  <item>II. IN what way they ought to ſtand faſt in this liberty, or what they may and ought to do in defence of it.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>After which, I ſhall ſubjoin ſome reflections, and apply the ſubject to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhew what is intended in this diſcourſe by the liberty in which men ought to ſtand faſt.</p>
            <p>THOUGH this word is uſed in various ſenſes, I mean by it here, only that liberty which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to external force and conſtraint, and to ſuch force and conſtraint only, as we may ſuffer from men. Under the term liberty, taken in this ſenſe, may naturally be comprehended all thoſe advantages which are liable to be deſtroyed by the art or power of men; every thing that is oppoſed to temporal ſlavery.</p>
            <p>THIS liberty has always been accounted one of the greateſt natural bleſſings which mankind can enjoy. Accordingly, the benevolent and impartial Father of the human race, has given to all men a right, and to all naturally an equal right to this bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:012813_0005_0F8AB96C65FC8490"/>IN a ſtate of nature, or where men are under no civil government, God has given to every one liberty to purſue his own happineſs in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever way, and by whatever means he pleaſes, without aſking the conſent or conſulting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of any other man, provided he keeps within the bounds of the law of nature. Within theſe bounds, he may govern his actions, and diſpoſe of his property and perſon, as he thinks proper. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Lock on government.</note> Nor has any man, or any number of men, a right to reſtrain him in the exerciſe of this liberty, or puniſh, or call him to account for uſing it. This however is not a ſtate of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, for the law of nature which bounds this liberty, forbids all injuſtice and wickedneſs; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no man to injure another in his perſon or property, or to deſtroy his own life.</p>
            <p>BUT experience ſoon taught that, either thro' ignorance of this law, or the influence of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly paſſions, ſome were diſpoſed to violate it, by encroaching upon the liberty of others; ſo that the <hi>weak</hi> were liable to be greatly injured by the ſuperior power of bad men, without any means of ſecurity or redreſs. This gave birth to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſociety, and induced a number of individuals to combine together for mutual defence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; to give up a part of their natural liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the ſake of enjoying the remainder in greater ſafety; to agree upon certain laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves to regulate the ſocial conduct of each individual; or to intruſt to one or more
<pb n="9"

of their number, in whoſe wiſdom and, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they could confide, a power of making ſuch laws, and putting them in execution.</p>
            <p>IN this ſtate, the liberty which men have is all that natural liberty which has been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, excepting what they have <hi>expreſsly</hi> given up for the good of the whole ſociety; a liberty of purſuing their own happineſs, governing their actions, and diſpoſing of their property and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as they think fit, provided they tranſgeſs no law of nature, and keep within thoſe reſtrictions which they have conſented to come under.</p>
            <p>THIS liberty will be different in different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities. In every ſtate, the members will, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, give up ſo much of their natural liberty, as they think will be moſt for the good of the whole. But different ſtates will judge different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this point; ſome will give up more, ſome leſs, though ſtill with the ſame view, the publick good. And every ſociety have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a right to act according to their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcretion in this matter, this being only an exerciſe of that natural liberty in which all are bound.</p>
            <p>WHEN a ſociety commits to one or a few a power to govern them, the general practice is to limit this power by certain preſcribed rules and reſtrictions. But ſometimes this is omitted, and it does not appear from any act of the people, but that the power, with which they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, is unlimited. In this caſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012813_0006_0F8AB96D132C8DD8"/>
common ſenſe will tell us that the power grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rulers is to be limited by the great end and deſign of ſociety and government: and he muſt be deſtitute of common ſenſe, who does not know that this is the general good, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſafety of the whole ſociety. So that though a people ſhould, through inadvertency, neglect to preſcribe any bounds to the power of their rulers, this power would nevertheleſs be limited, and <hi>they</hi> would be at liberty to refuſe ſubmiſſion to ſuch reſtraints or laws, as were plainly inconſiſtent with the publick good.</p>
            <p>THERE are ſome natural liberties or rights which no perſon can divert himſelf of, without tranſgreſſing the law of nature. A man cannot, for inſtance, give up the liberty of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of religion, or convey to others a right to determine of what religion he ſhall be, and in what way he ſhall worſhip God. A grant of this nature would deſtroy the foundation of all religion in the man who made it, and muſt therefore be a violation of the law of nature; nor would he be obliged to abide by it, if in conſequence of it, he ſhould be required to act contrary to the dictates of his conſcience. Or ſhould a man pretend to grant to others a power to order and govern all his actions that were not of a religious nature, ſo that in all caſes he muſt act agreeable to their direction; this would be inconſiſtent with that ſubmiſſion which he owes to the authority of God, and his own conſcience. The grant would be in itſelf void, and he would, notwithſtanding, be at liberty to act according
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012813_0006_0F8AB96D132C8DD8"/>
to his own conſcience, though contrary to the command of thoſe to whom he had made ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant a donation.</p>
            <p>SHOULD therefore the legiſlature of a ſtate make laws requiring the ſubjects to do things immoral, and which they knew to be ſo, ſuch, for inſtance, as were apparently deſtructive of public happineſs, though it was in conſequence of an expreſs grant of unlimited power, the ſubjects would be at liberty to refuſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and not violate conſcience or deſtroy their own happineſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>All conveyance of abſolute power, whether to a prince or a ſenate, with a precluſion of all rights of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, muſt be a deed originally invalid, as founded in an error about what is moſt eſſential in ſuch tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the tendency of ſuch power to the general good.</q>

               </note> So that only ſuch laws of ſociety as are not plainly inconſiſtent with the end of ſociety, or, in any other reſpect, inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the law of nature, the eternal rules of morality, can reſtrain and limit the natural liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe who belong to it.</p>
            <p>IT is to be further obſerved here, that ſtates or communities, as ſuch, have naturally the ſame liberty which individuals have in the ſtate of nature: but this liberty is reſtrained, in ſome meaſure, by what are called the laws of nations, which are certain rules, that by a tacit conſent are agreed upon among all communities, at leaſt among thoſe who are accounted the polite and civilized part of mankind. <hi>Theſe,</hi> nations are not at liberty to violate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:012813_0007_0F8AB96DCF1B66B0"/>WHAT has been ſaid may be ſufficient to ſhew what that liberty is in which men ought to ſtand faſt. In a ſtate of nature it is all that liberty which is conſiſtent with the law of nature; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der civil government, it is all which is conſiſtent with the law of nature, and with ſuch reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as they have conſented to come under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the law of nature and the end of ſociety: and when we conſider one independent ſtate in reference to another, it is all that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty which is conſiſtent with the laws of nations.</p>
            <p>AND whatever ſhare men enjoy of this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we may properly ſay in the words of the text, that Chriſt has made them free with it; ſince after his reſurrection and exaltation to the right hand of the Majeſty on high, all power in heaven and in earth was committed to him, and he now ſits, and is to continue at the head of God's providential government, till he hath put all enemies under his feet; after which, he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father—that God may be all in all.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am in the next place to ſhew in what way men are to ſtand faſt in their liberty, or what they may and ought to do in defence of it.</p>
            <p>IT is here ſuppoſed that ſome attempts are made to injure it. And it has been found in all ages and places that ſuch attempts have been made by unreaſonable and wicked men. The hiſtory of mankind is filled with inſtances

of this; inſomuch that if from the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of hiſtorical books that have been written, we ſhould leave out thoſe parts that relate to their encroachments upon one another, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and injuſtice, moſt of thoſe huge volumes would ſhrink to a very ſmall ſize. Cain began this practice very ſoon after the creation: and it has been continued ever ſince, both among kingdoms and individuals. And the ſame prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is ſtill to be expected, while human nature continues what it is.</p>
            <p>NOW for men to ſtand faſt in their liberty means, in general, reſiſting the attempts that are made againſt it, in the beſt and moſt effectual manner they can.</p>
            <p>WHEN any one's liberty is attacked or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, he is firſt to try gentle methods for his ſafety; to reaſon with, and perſuade the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deſiſt, if there be opportunity for it; or get out of his way, if he can; and if by ſuch means he can prevent the injury, he is to uſe no other.</p>
            <p>BUT the experience of all ages has ſhewn, that thoſe, who are ſo unreaſonable as to form deſigns of injuring others, are ſeldom to be diverted from their purpoſe by argument and perſuaſion alone: Notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid to ſhew the injuſtice and inhumanity of their attempt, they perſiſt in it, till they have gratified the unruly paſſion which ſet them to work. And in this caſe, what is to be done by the ſufferer? Is he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012813_0008_0F8ABA7B69B07C40"/>
to uſe no other means for his ſafety, but remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance or flight, when theſe will not ſecure him? Is he patiently to take the injury and ſuffer himſelf to be robbed of his liberty or his life, if the adverſary ſees fit to take it? Nature certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbids this tame ſubmiſſion, and loudly calls to a more vigorous defence. Self-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is one of the ſtrongeſt, and a univerſal principle of the human mind: And this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple allows of every thing neceſſary to ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, oppoſing force to force, and violence to violence. This is ſo univerſally allowed that I need not attempt to prove it.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince it has been ſuppoſed by ſome that chriſtianity forbids all violent reſiſting of evil, or defending ourſelves againſt injurjes in ſuch a manner as will hurt, or endanger thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us; it may not be amiſs to enquire brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether defenſive war be not allowed by the goſpel of Chriſt, the Prince of peace.</p>
            <p>AND there are, if I miſtake not, ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages in the new teſtament, which ſhew, that, it was not the deſign of this divine inſtitution to take away from mankind the natural right of defending their liberty, even by the ſword.</p>
            <p>I will not alledge the words of John the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt when in anſwer to the demand which the ſoldiers made; <hi>What ſhall we do?—he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your wages.</hi>

though they plainly imply, that, at that time, the military profeſſion was not unlawful, and, conſequently, that men might uſe the ſword when there was occaſion for it: yet it does not follow from hence, that the religion which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was to inſtitute, would allow of that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the uſe of the ſword.</p>
            <p>BUT there are other paſſages proper to be here alledged.</p>
            <p>THE firſt that I ſhall mention is our Lord's own words to Pilate, when under examination before that Governor. The chief charge bro't againſt Jeſus was, that he was going to ſet up a temporal kingdom inconſiſtent with the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the Roman Emperor. In anſwer to which he declared, that his <hi>kingdom was not of this world</hi>; and then offered the following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the aſſertion: <hi>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: But now is my kingdom not from hence.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John 18.36.</note> There is an ellipſis in the latter clauſe; but the ſenſe of the whole is obviouſly what follows. You know that thoſe who aim at temporal dominion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to eſtabliſh their authority and defend themſelves, by force of arms, when it is nceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: If this had been my aim I ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame method, and ordered my ſervants to fight againſt the Jews when they come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend me: Wherefore, ſince I have made no violent reſiſtance; but, on the contrary, "hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

one of my diſciples from fighting who ſought to reſcue me," it muſt now be evident to you, that the kingdom which I claim is not of this world. Our Lord here, plainly allows that it is fit and proper for temporal kingdoms to fight in defence of their liberty. His own kingdom is not, indeed, to be defended in this way, which being wholly ſpiritual, conſiſting in the obedience of men's wills and affections to the laws of God, is incapable of being directly either injured or defended by the ſword, as the kingdoms of this world, and men's temporal intereſt may.</p>
            <p>CORNELIUS, a centurion of the Italian band, was directed by an angel of God to ſend for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ſhould tell him "what he ought to do." <note n="¶" place="bottom">Acts. 10.</note> But we do not find that the apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to quit his military profeſſion, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that it was inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of chriſtianity; which he certainly would have done, had the character of a ſoldier and a good chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian been incompatible.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle Paul exhorts the Romans thus: <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all men.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 12. 18.</note> Which words plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that notwithſtanding all their endeavours to preſerve peace, it might be impoſſible for them to live peaceably with all men, or not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and be at ſtrife with ſome; i. e. impoſſible in a moral ſenſe, improper, unlawful; for they do not require us to do all which we have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power to do, for the ſake of peace, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012813_0009_0F8AB967D16EB138"/>
all that we can do conſiſtently with higher ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, with our duty in other reſpects.</p>
            <p>ONCE more—let me obſerve, that in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe of St. John, where we have a prophetic account of the future ſtate of the church<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> on earth, till the conſummation of all things, there are ſeveral paſſages which intimate, that the ſaints of the Moſt High, will fight in their defence againſt their enemies; and that though they ſhall in various inſtances be overcome, yet that they ſhall at length, by an amazing ſlaughter of their perſecutors, obtain for themſelves the peaceable enjoyment of that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free. <note n="¶" place="bottom">Chap. XI. ver. 7.XIII.XIV.19, 20.XVII.14.XIX.14—21.</note> Now it cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed that the ſpirit of God would have repreſented his faithful ſervants, as thus fighting againſt their enemies, and being ſo favoured by divine providence, as finally to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over them, if defenſive war was inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>IT is not, however, to be denied that there are ſome paſſages in the new teſtament which ſeem to forbid all war: particularly, our Saviour's own words in his ſermon on the mount. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matthew 5. Romans 12.17, 19.</note> 
               <hi>I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you that ye reſiſt not evil—love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe of the apoſtle Paul; <hi>Recompence to no man evil for evil.—Avenge not yourſelves:</hi> and ſome others of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012813_0010_0F8ABA7BF25A6568"/>
the like import. And from ſuch paſſages ſome have ſuppoſed that chriſtians are not allowed to defend themſelves by force of arms, how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſoever they may be attacked.</p>
            <p>GIVE me leave then, to offer a few remarks to take off the force of this objection.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN our Saviour forbids us to reſiſt evil, he ſeems to have had in view only ſmall injuries, for ſuch are thoſe which he mentions in the following words, as an illuſtration of the precept; ſmiting on the cheek, taking away one's coat, or compelling him to go a mile. And to ſuch injuries it is oftentimes a point of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as well as duty to ſubmit, rather than contend. But it does not follow, that becauſe we are forbidden to reſiſt ſuch ſlight attacks, we may not defend ourſelves when the aſſault is of a capital kind. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUPPOSING our Lord's words to refer on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to ſmall injuries, they ought not to be taken in an abſolute ſenſe. Expreſſions of this nature frequently occur in ſcripture, which are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally underſtood with certain reſtrictions and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations. For inſtance; <hi>Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world.</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">John 2.5.</note> 
               <hi>Lay not up for yourſelves treaſure on earth.</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 6.19.</note> 
               <hi>Give to him that aſketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.</hi> 
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Mat. 5.42.</note> Now, I believe, no body ever ſuppoſed, not even the honeſt <hi>Quakers,</hi> that theſe precepts were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo literally, as to forbid all love of the
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:012813_0010_0F8ABA7BF25A6568"

world, and all care to provide the good things of it; or to oblige us "to give to every idle fellow all he may think fit to aſk, whether in charity or loan." And we have as good a right to limit the precepts which forbid<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our reſiſting evil, by the nature and reaſon of things, as we have to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe other indefinite expreſſions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DEFENDING ourſelves by force of arms againſt injurious attacks, is a quite different thing from rendering evil for evil. The latter implies doing hurt to another, becauſe he has done hurt to us; the former implies doing hurt to another, if he is hurt in the conflict, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe there is no other way of avoiding the miſchief he endeavours to do us: the <hi>one</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from malice and revenge; the <hi>other</hi> mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſelf-love, and a juſt concern for our own happineſs, and argues no ill will againſt any man.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is to be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT neceſſary ſelf-defence, however fatal it may prove to thoſe who unjuſtly attack us, implies no principle inconſiſtent with that love to our enemies which Chriſt enjons. For, at the ſame time that we are defending ourſelves againſt their aſſaults, we may bear good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, wiſh them well, and pray God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend them: All which we doubtleſs ought to do in reſpect of our bittereſt enemies.</p>
            <p>ENOUGH has been ſaid to ſhew the conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of war with the ſpirit of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:012813_0011_0F8ABA7C95E2AD28"/>BUT it is only defenſive war that can be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the ſight of God. When no injury is offered us, we have no right to moleſt others. And chriſtian meekneſs, patience and forbearance, are duties that ought to be practiſed both by kingdoms and individuals. Small injuries, that are not likely to be attended with any very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequences, are rather to be ſubmitted to, than reſiſted by the ſword. Both religion and humanity ſtrongly forbid the bloody deeds of war, unleſs they are neceſſary. Even when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury offered is great in itſelf, or big with fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, we ſhould, if there be opportunity, endeavour to prevent it by remonſtrance, or by offering to leave the matter in diſpute to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judges, if they can be had. If theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are unſucceſsful, it then becomes proper, to uſe more forceable means of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>A PEOPLE may err by too long neglecting ſuch means, and ſhamefully ſuffer the ſword to ruſt in its ſcabberd, when it ought to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in defending their liberty. The moſt graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppreſſive power will commonly let its neighbours remain in peace, if they will ſubmit to its unjuſt demands. And an incautious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le may ſubmit to theſe demands, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till its liberty is irrecoverably gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſaw the danger. Injuries ſmall in themſelves, may in their conſequences be fatal to thoſe who ſubmit to them; eſpecially if they are perſiſted in. And, with reſpect to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, we ſhould ever act upon that ancient max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im of prudence; <hi>obſta principiis.</hi> The firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012813_0011_0F8ABA7C95E2AD28"/>
demands of an encroaching power ſhould be firmly withſtood, when there appears a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repeat and encreaſe ſuch demands. And oftentimes it may be both the right and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a people to engage in war, rather than give up to the <hi>demands</hi> of ſuch a power, what they could, without any incoveniency, ſpare in the way of charity. War, though a great evil, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preferable to ſuch conceſſions, as are likely to be fatal to public liberty. And when ſuch conceſſions are required and inſiſted upon, as the conditions of peace, the only conſideration to be attended to by the abuſed ſtate, is that which our Saviour intimates common prudence will always ſuggeſt in ſuch caſes: <hi>What king going to make war againſt another king, ſitteth not down firſt and conſulteth whether he be able,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 14.31</note>
            </p>
            <p>AN innocent people threatened with war are not always obliged to receive the firſt attack.— This may frequently prove fatal, or occaſion an irreparable damage. When others have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſted an injurious or hoſtile intention, and perſiſt in it, notwithſtanding all the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and remonſtrance we can make, we may, in order to avoid the blow they are meditating againſt us, begin the aſſault.</p>
            <p>AFTER a people have been forced into a war for their own ſecurity, they ought to ſet reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able bounds to their reſentment, or they may become as guilty as the firſt aggreſſors. They ſhould aim at nothing more than repelling the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012813_0012_0F8ABA7D959B4BB8"/>
injury, obtaining reparation for damages ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſecurity againſt future injuries. If, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe ends are obtained, they continue the war, in order to diſtreſs their enemies, or reduce them under their power, they become offenders, and the war on their ſide is unjuſt.</p>
            <p>SUBMITTING the foregoing general obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to your candor, I go on to hint at ſome things proper to be attended to, by every peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order to their being in a capacity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt encroachments on their liberty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY ſhould endeavor to be united and at peace among themſelves. The ſtrength of a ſociety, as well as its honour and happineſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends much upon its union. Our Saviour's max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is founded in reaſon, and has been confirmed by the experience of all ages: <hi>Every kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf is brought to deſolation.</hi> When the body politic is divided into parties, and the members make a buſineſs of oppoſing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is in a fair way to ruin. They are not likely to unite in meaſures of defence againſt a common enemy, and will therefore lie open to the encroachments of violence and oppreſſion, and become an eaſy prey to every invader. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e tyrants of the earth, ſenſible of this, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly acted upon this maxim, <hi>divide et impera</hi>: let us firſt divide the people, whom we mean to enſlave, into parties, and we ſhall then eaſily bring them under our power.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:012813_0012_0F8ABA7D959B4BB8"/>2. THEY ſhould endeavor to maintain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves a general diſpoſition to ſubmit to government. Society cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out government; and there can be no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without laws, and a ſubmiſſion to laws. If a licentious ſpirit prevails among a people, a general diſpoſition to trample upon laws and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe government, they will probably make but a poor figure in defending themſelves againſt a common enemy; for, in making this defence, there muſt be leaders and followers, ſome to command and ſome to obey: And, other things being equal, the more a diſpoſition to ſubmit to rule and order prevails among a people, the more likely will they be to defend their liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt foreign invaſions. Indeed without any enemy from abroad, the general prevalence of a licentious ſpirit may as effectually deſtroy the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a people, as the moſt deſpotic govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for civil "liberty is ſomething as really different from that licentiouſneſs which ſuppoſeth no government, as from that ſlavery which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth tyranny: it is a freedom reſtrained by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial laws, and living and dying with public happineſs." <note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. Hoadly.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT people that would be in a capacity to defend themſelves ſucceſsfully againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, ſhould take care that their internal government be free and eaſy; allowing all that liberty to every one which is conſiſtent with the neceſſary reſtraints of government; laying no burdens upon any, but what are for the good of the whole, and to which the whole ſociety has
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012813_0013_0F8ABA7E181E3990"/>
actually or virtually conſented. Though the contrary evil takes its riſe from the weakneſs or wickedneſs of rulers, yet in every free ſtate it is the right and duty of all, <hi>ſubjects</hi> as well as ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to uſe their influence againſt it: And where the ſubjects have no <hi>conſtitutional</hi> right to do any thing to prevent or remove ſuch an evil, they are already ſlaves, and it may be tho't improper to talk of their defending their liberty; though they ought, doubtleſs, to endeavor to recover it. However, I ſay, it is highly neceſſary that this freedom from unreaſonable reſtraints be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to a people's retaining a ſpirit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and being in a capacity to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt a common enemy. It is juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that great ſtateſman, lord Verulam, that "the bleſſing of Judah and Iſſachar will never meet, that the ſame people or nation ſhould be both the lion's whelp, and the aſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two burdens: neither will it be, that a people overlaid with taxes, ſhould ever become valiant and martial."<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon's Eſſays, p. 113.</note> The laying unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burdens and reſtraints upon a people, will, if they are ſubmitted to, debaſe their minds, break their ſpirits, enervate their courage, and ſink them into cowards: if they are not ſubmitted to, the conſequence will be internal tumult, diſorder, ſtrife and contempt of government; and in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, the defenſive power of the ſtate is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſhed. Behold, then the policy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the madneſs and folly of oppreſſive rulers: if they are ſucceſsful in their injurious meaſures, they are expoſing themſelves and their ſubjects
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012813_0013_0F8ABA7E181E3990"/>
an helpleſs prey to the ravages of ſome ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous neighbour: if they are not; they are raiſing up enemies againſt themſelves at home, and, as it were, ſetting fire to their own habitations.</p>
            <p n="4">4 A PEOPLE who would ſtand faſt in their liberty, ſhould furniſh themſelves with weapons proper for their defence, and learn the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>IT is indeed an hard caſe, that thoſe who are happy in the bleſſings of providence, and diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live peaceably with all men, ſhould be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to keep up the idea of blood and ſlaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and expend their time and treaſure to acquire the arts and inſtruments of death. But this is a neceſſity which the depravity of human nature has laid upon every ſtate. Nor was there ever a people that continued, for any conſiderable time, in the enjoyment of liberty, who were not in a capacity to defend themſelves againſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, unleſs they were too poor and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to tempt an enemy.</p>
            <p>SO much depends upon the military art, in the preſent day, that no people can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect to defend themſelves ſucceſsfully without it. However numerous they may be, if they are unſkilled in arms, their number will tend little more to their ſecurity, than that of a flock of ſheep does to preſerve them from the depredations of the wolf: accordingly it is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a point of wiſdom, in every ſtate, to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012813_0014_0F8ABA8007BBF718"/>
be furniſhed with this ſkill, though it is not to be obtained without great labor and expence.</p>
            <p>IN ſome nations the method has been to truſt for defence and ſecurity to what is called a STANDING ARMY; a number of men paid by the public, to devote themſelves wholly to the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary profeſſion; while the body of the people fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their peaceable employments, without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any attention to the art of war.</p>
            <p>BUT this has ever been thought, by the wiſe and prudent, a precarious defence.</p>
            <p>SUCH armies are, as to the greater part of them, generally compoſed of men who have no real eſtate in the dominions which they are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; their pay is their living, and the main thing that attaches them to their employers; their manner of life tends to corrupt their morals, and, though they are naturally of the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with other men, they ſeldom continue long in this profeſſion, before they become diſtinguiſhed by their vices: So that neither their temporal intereſt, nor their regard to virtue can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to attach them ſo ſtrongly to the country that employs them, but that there will always be danger of their being tempted by the promiſe of larger pay to betray their truſt, and turn their arms againſt it. No people therefore, can with ſafety truſt intirely to a ſtanding army, even for defence againſt foreign enemies.</p>

For though they are really ſervants of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and paid by them; yet this is not common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in their name; but in the name of the ſupreme magiſtrate. The KING'S BREAD, and the KING'S SERVICE, are familiar expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſoldiers, and tend to make them conſider him as their only maſter, and prefer his perſonal intereſt to that of the people.

of giving efficacy to their orders. It has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time been pretended, that this is neceſſary to aid and ſupport civil government. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſiders, that the deſign of government is the good of the people, and the great improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility there is, that a people, in general, ſhould be againſt meaſures calculated for their good, and that <hi>ſuch</hi> meaſures only ought to be enforced, will look upon this as the idleſt pretence. For rulers to uſe a military power, to enforce mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a contrary tendency, is one of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt and moſt unjuſtifiable kinds of offenſive war; a violation not only of the common laws of juſtice and humanity, but of their own ſacred engagements to promote the public good. The keeping up troops ſufficient to guard expoſed frontier poſts, may be proper; but to have an army continually ſtationed in the midſt of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in time of peace, is a precarious and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous method of ſecurity.</p>
            <p>A ſafer way, and which has always been eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the wiſeſt and beſt, by impartial men, is to have the power of defence in the body of the people, to have a well-regulated and well-diſciplined militia. <note n="¶" place="bottom">Our trained bands are the truſtieſt and moſt proper ſtrength of a free nation.

            <p>IT was by a militia, by an army compoſed of men of property and worth of their own nation, that ancient Rome roſe to be miſtreſs of the world. The battles of <hi>Agincourt, Poictiers</hi> and <hi>Creſſy</hi> are memorable proofs of the martial proweſs of the ancient militia of England. Our own country will alſo furniſh us with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the bravery of a militia, both former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and latterly.</p>
            <p>CAUTION however ought to be uſed in conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a militia, that it may anſwer the end for which it is deſigned, and not be liable to be made an inſtrument of tyranny and oppreſſion. It ſhould be ſubject to diſcipline and order, and ſomewhere in the ſtate ſhould be lodged a power of calling it forth to action, whenever the ſafety of the people requires it. But this power ſhould be ſo limited and reſtrained, as that it cannot call it unneceſſarily, or oblige it to commit vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or oppreſſion upon any of the ſubjects. <note n="¶" place="bottom">That wiſe men have thought a people might be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from their own militia, unleſs great caution was uſed in the direction of it, appears from the following quotation:

ONCE more, it is neceſſary for a people who would preſerve their liberty, to maintain the general practice of religion and virtue. This will tend to make them courageous: The trueſt fortitude is ever to be found where the paſſions and affections are in ſubjection to the laws of God. Religion conciliates the favor of God, upon whom ſucceſs in war eſſentially depends; and the hope of this favour will naturally inſpire a brave and undaunted reſolution. Not to mention that the unity, riches, and bodily ſtrength of a people are greatly favoured by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. On the other hand; vice naturally makes men timerous, and fills the breaſt with baſeneſs and cowardiſe. What is here ſaid is agreable to the obſervation of that wiſe King and inſpired writer, who tells us, "<hi>the wicked flee, when no man purſueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. LET me now offer a few conſiderations to ſhew the obligations men are under to defend that liberty which providence has conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>THIS is a truſt committed to us by heaven: we are accountable for the uſe we make of it,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012813_0016_0F8ABA821E23E588"/>
and ought therefore, to the beſt of our power to defend it. The ſervant, who hid his talent in a napkin, is condemned in our Lord's parable; and he who through inattention, indolence or cowardiſe, ſuffers it to be wreſted from him, is little leſs criminal. Should a perſon, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whoſe ability and circumſtances enable him to do good in the world, to relieve his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed brethren, and be an example of charity and other virtues, tamely yield up all his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and become an abſolute ſlave to ſome unjuſt and wicked oppreſſor, when he might by a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſiſtance have ſecured his liberty, would he not be guilty of great unfaithfulneſs to God, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liable to his condemnation? This would in its conſequences be really worſe than hiding his talent in a napkin; it would be not only not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it for the glory of the giver, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying it into hands which will, in all probability, employ it greatly to his diſhonour. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is as applicable to a community as to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual. A kingdom or common wealth, as ſuch, is accountable for the improvement it makes of it's advantages: It is bound to preſerve them, and employ them for the honour of God; ſo far as it can, to be an example of virtue to neighbouring communities, and afford them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief when they are in diſtreſs: but by yielding up their poſſeſſions and liberties to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching oppreſſive power, they become, in a great meaſure, incapable of theſe duties, and are liable to be made the miniſters of ſin through the compulſion of their maſters. Out of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs then, to God, and in order to eſcape the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012813_0017_0F8ABA82A7426A40"/>
doom of ſlothful ſervants, we ſhould endeavour to defend our rights and liberties.</p>
            <p>MEN are bound to preſerve their own lives, as long as they can, conſiſtently with their duty in other reſpects. Would not he, who ſhould loſe his life by neglecting to reſiſt a wild beaſt, be criminal in the ſight of God? And can he be innocent who loſes it by neglecting to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the violent attacks of wicked men, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as fierce and cruel as the moſt ſavage beaſt?</p>
            <p>MEN are alſo bound, individuals and ſocieties, to take care of their temporal happineſs, and do all they lawfully can, to promote it. But what can be more inconſiſtent with this duty, than ſubmitting to great encroachments upon our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? Such ſubmiſſion tends to ſlavery; and compleat ſlavery implies every evil that the malice of man and devils can inflict. Again,</p>
            <p>THE regard which we owe to the happineſs of others makes this a duty.</p>
            <p>EVERY man is bound both by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and revelation, to provide in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he can, for the temporal happineſs of his family; and he that neglects this, has, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the declaration of an inſpired apoſtle, <hi>denied the faith, and is worſe than an infidel.</hi> But in what way can a man be more juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with this neglect, than by ſuffering himſelf
<pb n="33"
                   facs="unknown:012813_0017_0F8ABA82A7426A40"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be deprived of his life, liberty or property, when he might lawfully have preſerved them?</p>
            <p>REASON, humanity and religion, all conſpire to teach us, that we ought in the beſt manner we can, to provide for the happineſs of poſterity. We are allied to them by the common tie of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: They are not here to act their part: A concern for them is a debt which we owe for the care which our progenitors took for us: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has made us their guardians, and intruſted to our care their liberty, honour, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ppineſs: For when they come upon the ſtage, they will be deeply affected by the tranſactions of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpecially by their public tranſactions. If the preſent inhabitants of a country ſubmit to ſlavery, ſlavery is the inheritance which they will leave to their children. And who that has the bowels of a father, or even the common feelings of humanity, can think without horror, of being the means of ſubjecting unborn millions to the iron ſcepter of tyranny?</p>
            <p>BUT further; a regard to the happineſs of mankind in general, makes it a duty to reſiſt great injuries. Yielding to the unjuſt demands of bad men, not only leſſens our power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, but encourages them to repeat their injuries, and ſtrengthens their hands to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: It enables them to give fuller ſcope to their luſts, and more effectually to ſpread cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, diſtreſs and miſery. It is therefore an act of benevolence to oppoſe and deſtroy that power which is employed in injuring others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:012813_0018_0F8ABA835A376530"/>
and as much, when it is that of a tyrant, as of a wild beaſt.</p>
            <p>ONCE more; from a regard to religion men are obliged to defend their liberty againſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, though the attack ſhould not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affect religion. Slavery expoſes to many temptations to vice, and by debaſing and weakening the mind, deſtroying its fortitude and magnimity renders it leſs capable of reſiſting them, and creates a dependance upon, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to wicked men, highly prejudicial to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Hence it has been often obſerved, and is confirmed by experience, that the loſs of liberty is ſoon followed by the loſs of all virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon. <note n="¶" place="bottom">

            <p>BUT I may not enlarge: The conſiderations which have been ſuggeſted ſhew, if I miſtake not, that it is not only the right but the duty of

men to defend that liberty, with which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has made them free: And a duty of high obligation, as the neglect of it may be attended with conſequences, the moſt prejudicial to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man virtue and happineſs, and greatly diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary to God.</p>
            <p>ALL that now remains is to offer ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and apply the ſubject to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHAT has been ſaid may ſerve to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all againſt invading the liberty of others: — Whoever does this, obliges others to reſiſt him: he puts himſelf into a ſtate of war with them, and is juſtly liable to all the evil which their neceſſary ſelf-defence may bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. And though he may think that his power is ſo great, and their's ſo little, that he can be in no danger from their reſentment, the event may convince him of his miſtake. Men, who have a juſt ſenſe and value of liberty, will ſometimes do wonders in its defence.</p>

pates:</hi> It is an old obſervation, that few tyrants deſcend in peace to the grave. If therefore, the laws of God will not, a regard to their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould reſtrain men from invading the rights of the innocent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF it be ſo important a duty for men to reſiſt encroachments upon their liberty; then it cannot be improper for the chriſtian miniſter, to inculcate <hi>this</hi> upon his hearers; to exhort them to be watchful over it, and ready to oppoſe all attempts againſt it. This is ſo far from being improper, that it is, I humbly conceive, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty. Nor can I ſee how he could anſwer it to God, or his own conſcience, if, when he thought his country was in danger of being enſlaved, for want of a proper ſenſe of, and oppoſition to the approaches of tyranny, he ſhould neglect to point out the danger, and with

            <p>IT is readily owned, that <hi>deſignedly</hi> to ſpread falſe alarms, to fill the minds of people with groundleſs prejudices againſt their rulers, or a neighbouring ſtate, to ſtir up faction and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage oppoſition to <hi>good</hi> government, are things highly criminal; and whoever does thus, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver character he may wear among men, is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality a miniſter, not of Chriſt, but of the devil, the father of falſhood, confuſion and rebellion. But to ſhew people their real danger, point out the ſource of it, and exhort them to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ertions

as are neceſſary to avoid it, are acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence becoming every diſciple, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every profeſſed miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. SINCE the preſervation of public liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depends ſo much upon a people's being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the art of war; thoſe who exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to encourage and promote this art, act a laudable part, and are intitled to the thanks of their brethren.

And as this ſociety has in former days furniſhed many brave men, who did worthily in defence of our country; ſo, from the ſpirit which at preſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails among the gentlemen who compoſe it, we doubt not but it will furniſh others, whenever there ſhall be occaſion for it. How far this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by exciting in others a ſpirit of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or emulation, has been the occaſion of the preſent general attention to the military art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, I pretend not to ſay: But whatever be the cauſe, it muſt give pleaſure to every friend of public liberty, to ſee this people ſo generally engaged in military exerciſes. This argues a manly ſpirit, a ſenſe of liberty, a juſt apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its danger, a reſolution to ſtand faſt in it, and, as far as any thing in our power can do it, promiſes freedom to our country.</p>

But we have little reaſon to expect, however ardently we may wiſh, that this country will always be the habitation of peace. Ambition, avarice, and other unruly paſſions have a great hand in directing the conduct of moſt of the kingdoms of this world. Britiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica is already become conſiderable among the European nations for its numbers, and their eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of living; and is continually riſing into greater importance. I will not undertake to decypher the <hi>ſigns of the times,</hi> or to ſay from what quarter we are moſt likely to be moleſted. But from the courſe of human affairs, we have the utmoſt reaſon to expect that the time will come, when we muſt either ſubmit to <hi>ſlavery,</hi> or defend our liberties by our own ſword. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be the caſe ſooner than ſome imagine. No one can doubt but there are powers on the continent of Europe, that would be glad to add North-America to their dominions, and who, if they thought the thing practicable, would ſoon find a pretence for attempting it. The naval power of Great-Britain has been hitherto our chief ſecurity againſt invaſions from that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. But every thing belonging to the preſent ſtate, is uncertain and fluctuating. Things may ſoon be in ſuch a ſituation with Great-Britian, that it will be no longer proper for us to confide in her power, for the protection of our liberty. Our greateſt ſecurity, under God, will be our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a capacity to defend ourſelves. Were we,

indeed, ſure that Great-Britain would always be both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to protect us in our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which, from preſent appearances, we have little reaſon to expect, it would be ſhameful for ſo numerous a people as this, and a people of ſo much natural ſtrength and fortitude, to be, thro' inattention to the art of war, incapable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part in their own defence. Such weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs muſt render them contemptible to all the world.</p>
            <p>BRITISH America, eſpecially the nothern part of it, is by its ſituation calculated to be a nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heroes. Nothing is wanting but our own care and application to make us, with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring colonies, a formidable people. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, honor, patriotiſm, and even ſelf-love, all unite in demanding from us this application and care. This people, it may be preſumed, will never of choice, keep among them a <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army</hi> in time of peace: Virtue, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic peace, the inſulted walls of our State-Houſe, and even the once crimſoned <hi>ſtones of the ſtreet,</hi> all loudly <hi>cry out</hi> againſt this meaſure. But every well-wiſher to the public, ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encourage a military ſpirit among our militia through the province.</p>
            <p>OUR political Fathers have it in their power to do much for this end; and we have a right to expect that, out of faithfulneſs to God and this people, they will not neglect it. From the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which his Excellency and the honorable Council ſhew to the military tranſactions of this

            <p>IT is alſo in the power of perſons of rank and fortune, in their private capacity, greatly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this cauſe by their example and otherwiſe. It is highly abſurd, though not uncommon, that thoſe who have moſt to loſe by the deſtruction of a ſtate, ſhould be leaſt capable of bearing a part in its defence. Riches are frequently the main temptation to war. Where a people are all poor, there is little danger of their being inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: So that there being men of affluence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people, is often the cauſe of their being obliged to defend themſelves by the ſword. It is therefore eſpecially <hi>their</hi> duty, as well as inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, to do what they can to put the people into a capacity of defence. When <hi>they</hi> ſpend their time in idleneſs, effeminating pleaſures, or even in accumulating riches, to the total neglect of the art of war, and every meaſure to promote it, they act unbecoming good members of ſociety, and ſet an example highly prejudicial to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS when gentlemen of fortune, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the allurements of pleaſure on the one hand, and the fatiguing exerciſe of a ſoldier on the other, exert themſelves to acquire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the military art, they are an honor to their circumſtances, and a bleſſing to the public:
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012813_0021_0F8ABA85B87E99C8"/>
Their example will have great influence upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and, other things being equal, ſuch men will be moſt likely to fight valiantly in defence of their liberty, whenever it ſhall be neceſſary. By ſuch a conduct, they ſhew their regard to their country, in a way that will probably be much more beneficial to it, than merely talking, writing, or preaching in favor of liberty. And it ought to be eſteemed as no inconſiderable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, among many others, of a public, truly patriotic ſpirit in the honorable gentleman, <note n="¶" place="bottom">The Hon. JOHN HANCOCK, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </note> who leads his Excellency's company of Cadets, that he has ſo chearfully endured the fatigue of qualifying himſelf to be a good officer, and, by his generous exertions in conjunction with their own, rendered his company an honour to the town, to their commanders and themſelves. This company in general, is indeed an example of what I was urging; of gentlemen of eaſy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances giving proper attention to the art of war, and is on that account the more reſpectable and important.</p>
            <p>BUT we have other laudable examples of attention to arms. The Train of Artillery <note n="†" place="bottom">A Company commanded by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> PADDOCK.</note> has for a number of years paſt been honorably diſtinguiſhed, by their military addreſs. And the reſpectable appearance which the whole mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the town made a few days ago, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together in honor of his Majeſty's birth-day, and the dexterity with which they went through their exerciſes, muſt convince all who had the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012813_0022_0F8ABA866CFC5F68"/>
ſatisfaction of ſeeing them, that they are no ſtrangers to a military ſpirit, and lead us to hope that by perſeverance, the whole body will ſoon equal thoſe, who at preſent excel moſt. May this ſpirit ſtill revive and prevail through the province, till this whole people become as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for their ſkill in arms, as they are for their natural ſtrength and courage.</p>
            <p>THE gentlemen who are engaged in acquiring this art will remember that the true end of it is only defence; that it is to be employed, not to deſtroy, but to protect and ſecure the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and happineſs of mankind; not to infringe the rights of others, but to defend their own. While, therefore, they endeavor to reſemble ſuch men as <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> in military ſkill and valour, they will deteſt the principles from which they acted, in invading and diſtreſſing inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive people. For though they have been honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the name of heroes, they were, in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, public robbers and murderers.</p>
            <p>THEY will alſo remember that the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable liberty, and which we ſhould be ready to defend, is that of a well governed ſociety, which is as eſſentially different from that licentiouſneſs, which is without law or government, as it is from an abſolute ſubjection to the arbitrary will of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. This is the liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free; to which he has given us a right. While, therefore, theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will be always ready to ſtand forth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of true civil liberty, whenever they ſhall ſee her aſſaulted, and be properly called upon; they will never on any conſideration be prevailed
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012813_0022_0F8ABA866CFC5F68"/>
with, to employ their arms for the deſtruction of good government, by aiding either tyranny on the one hand, or licentiouſneſs on the other.</p>
            <p>BUT above all they will remember, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the main concern of man, and a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualification for a good ſoldier. This, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any thing elſe, inſpires with the love of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with fortitude and magnanimity; and this alone can enable them to meet death with a rational compoſure and tranquility of mind, which is an enemy before which the braveſt ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier muſt fall at laſt.</p>
            <p>TO conclude: This whole aſſembly will bear in mind, that there is another and more valuable kind of liberty, than that to which the foregoing diſcourſe more immediately relates, and which, at this day, ſo generally employs our attention and converſation; a liberty, which conſiſts in being free from the power and dominion of ſin, through the aſſiſtance of the divine ſpirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with our own pious, rational and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering endeavours. Whatever our outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may be, if we are deſtitute of this ſpiritual liberty, we are in reality ſlaves, how much ſoever we may hate the name; if we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it we are <hi>free indeed</hi>: And our being free in this ſenſe, will give us the beſt grounds to hope for temporal freedom, through the favour of heaven; and, at length, gain us admiſſion into the regions of perfect and uninterrupted liberty, peace and happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
