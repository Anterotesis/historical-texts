            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Writings both of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the <hi>Turks,</hi> do at this day confeſs them; nor were the Pagans, of the Firſt Ages, in the Volumns which they wrote againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſtill Extant, able to deny them. And the like <hi>Miracles</hi> were continued among the Apoſtolical Preachers of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> after our Lords Departure from us, for Two hundred years together: They ſpoke with <hi>Tongues,</hi> which they had never Learnt before; they Help'd the <hi>Blind,</hi> they Heald the <hi>Sick,</hi> they Rais'd the <hi>Dead,</hi> and they Caſt out the <hi>Devils</hi> from the Poſſeſſed. <hi>No Hiſtory</hi> can be True, if This be not ſo. Now theſe things are <hi>Seals</hi> from God, unto the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> I beſeech you, Do not harbour the leaſt ſuſpicion of a <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo <hi>Sealed</hi> by the God of Heaven, with Ungainſayable Confirmations. But if any <hi>Mahometan</hi> Tempters do aſſault you, Let the words of their own <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſerve to Anſwer them; The words of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> (or Turkiſh BIBLE) are: <hi>The Spirit of God hath given Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to CHRIST, the Son of</hi> Mary; <hi>He is the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Spirit, and the Word of God: His Doctrine is perfect.</hi> And <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in this his <hi>Alcoran,</hi> calls the Goſpel expreſly, <hi>The Right way to Fear God</hi>; &amp; ſays, <hi>That God ſent the Goſpel for no other end, but that they might obtain by it, the Love and Grace of God.</hi> Let the <hi>Mahometans</hi> now know, That you cannot forſake your <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Spirit of God hath given Teſtimony to Him</hi>; and that you cannot forſake His <hi>Doctrine,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>perfect</hi>; and that you cannot forſake His <hi>Goſpel,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000830_0009_0FAB412BF69FF688"/>
'tis the <hi>Right way to Fear God</hi>; as They Themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have confeſſed.

            <p>But, while you hold faſt the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> it is of infinite concern for you, to Experience alſo the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of it. And it may be, the diſmal Affliction of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Captivity,</hi> is come upon you, to Convince you of, and Convert you to thoſe things in <hi>Religion,</hi> whereof you were too inſenſible, when your heard them diſpenſed unto you, in the Ordinances of the Goſpel, which you ſometimes Enjoyed. Yea, t'wil be an happy <hi>Captivity,</hi> that is now come upon you, if the Ears of your Souls be now open to the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> of which it may be, the Lord from Heaven ſaves unto you, <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy Proſperity, and thou wouldeſt not hear me.</hi> You have been particularly told, of your <hi>Miſery</hi> by reaſon of your <hi>Slavery</hi> to your <hi>Interiour Adverſaries</hi>; being, <hi>Sold under Sin,</hi> and being, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Captive by the Devil at his Will.</hi> But, alas, alas, have you hitherto been deeply ſenſible of that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi>? You were in the worſt ſort of <hi>Slavery,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ever the <hi>Corſaires</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> Siezed upon you; Every Sinful Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> is by Nature ſo. It is an horrible thing, to be continually at work for <hi>Satan,</hi> Tempted and Blinded by him, and held ſalt

in the Chains of <hi>Luſt</hi>: And it is of more than a Million Times greater Conſequence to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from this curſed <hi>Slavery,</hi> than from that other, wherein <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> do now trample upon you. Your <hi>Slavery</hi> to the <hi>Monſters</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> will be but ſhort, and you may <hi>Serve God</hi> under it, and <hi>See God</hi> after it: But your <hi>Slavery,</hi> to the <hi>Powers of Darkneſs,</hi> whereinto you are by your Fall from God, precipitated; This alienates you, from the Knowledge and Favour of <hi>God,</hi> and Eternal Confuſions in another World, will be the <hi>Wages</hi> of it. And that which ha's left you, in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Slavery,</hi> is, The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Holy God, which hath arreſted you, in dreadful <hi>Bonds,</hi> for the <hi>Wrongs</hi> that your Sins have done, in Denying, &amp; in Defying of His Majeſty. Methinks, It ſhould fill your Hearts with wonderful Joy, to have the Tidings &amp; Offers, of a <hi>Redemption</hi> from that your Spiritual <hi>Slavery,</hi> This Letter now brings them to you. The Lord JESUS CHRIST is that <hi>Strong Redeemer,</hi> who is, <hi>Able to Save you unto the uttermoſt,</hi> and who ha's Engaged, <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> This gracious Lord, hath paid a Sufficient <hi>Ranſome</hi> unto the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, for the Souls of His Choſen; His very <hi>Life,</hi> even the <hi>Life</hi> of that Man, who is <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and therefore One of infinite Value, has been given by Him, as a <hi>Ranſome</hi> for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They, to whom the Vertue of this <hi>Ranſome,</hi> is actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, are ſet at <hi>Liberty,</hi> from the Hellish <hi>Thraldome,</hi> wherein the Enemies of their Souls have <hi>Enſlaved</hi>

When you have Sincerely thus, Believed on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, then you may Joyfully Sing, <hi>I know that my Redeemer Lives</hi>! Though you Dy in your <hi>African Captivity,</hi> yet you may Dy, Praiſing of God, for Saving you, from your <hi>Spiritual Captivity.</hi> Yea, 'tis poſſible, that you may Live to ſee us again, in this World, and Bleſs God with us, that ever you were ſent into ſuch a ſad part of the World, as <hi>Africa</hi>; for if you <hi>Seek Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Redemption</hi> of your Souls, the other will the ſooner be <hi>Added unto you.</hi>
