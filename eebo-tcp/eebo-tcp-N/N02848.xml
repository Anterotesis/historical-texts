            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And if the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> appears thus <hi>ſhort</hi> even to <hi>Men</hi> themſelves, when ſet in a due light: how much more <hi>inconſiderable</hi> muſt it ſeem in GOD'S Eye! with whom there is no <hi>Beginning of Days,</hi> nor <hi>End of Years</hi>; and in whoſe Sight <hi>a thouſand Years are but as one Day.</hi> Surely in this View of <hi>Life,</hi> it muſt ſink into the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> Point of Time.

of it, for <hi>us</hi> and in <hi>our</hi> ſtead; the <hi>Terms</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are bro't down to our preſent <hi>fallen</hi> State: and nothing more is <hi>abſolutely</hi> requir'd of us, but FAITH in JESUS CHRIST, as the SON of the <hi>living</hi> GOD, including in it the <hi>Seeds</hi> &amp; <hi>Principles</hi> of ſincere <hi>Repentance,</hi> and a true <hi>Goſpel Obedience.</hi> And no ſooner is ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> wrought in our Souls, but our <hi>main Work</hi> is done, and the <hi>great Deſign</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> anſwered. And Perſons not only may, but often are, even in the <hi>beginning</hi> of Life, thus endow'd with <hi>Faith.</hi> And a <hi>little</hi> Time, if it be well improv'd, in the diligent Uſe of proper Means, will ſerve for this purpoſe.

For if they ſhould live over the preſent Life, as bounded by GOD, tho'tleſs of Eternity, and unconcerned to make Preparation for it; and inſtead hereof, ſhould ſpend their Days in Vanity, or the Gratification of their Fleſhly Luſts, there would be but little Hope of their Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and returning to a better Mind, if their Time ſhould be lengthned out to the <hi>longeſt</hi> Period: But on the contrary, great reaſon to fear, that they would only grow more bold and obſtinate in Wickedneſs, and get ſtill at a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſtance from GOD and Happineſs.

               <hi>Man</hi>: he has his <hi>determin'd</hi> Time of Duration; and whenever this comes, in a moment he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires. This Matter is further illuſtrated, Chap. 14.5. <hi>Man's days are determin'd, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Months are with thee: thou haſt appointed his Bounds, that he cannot paſs.</hi> So that, let our Character be what it will; if we are never ſo deſireable, or never ſo uſeful: or let our State be what it will; be we prepar'd or unprepar'd, we muſt at ſuch a particular Point of Time, which GOD from Eternity, has pitch'd upon, be diſmis'd from the Body. And He will ſo order it in his <hi>Active Providence,</hi> that all neceſſary natural Cauſes ſhall <hi>unitedly</hi> concur, to put a Period to our Life, not only At the <hi>very Time,</hi> but after the <hi>ſame manner,</hi> that he has decreed.</p>
            <p>GOD has not indeed alotted to all Men the <hi>ſame</hi> Number of Months and Years: nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to accompliſh his <hi>Decree</hi> upon them, by the <hi>ſame</hi> Means and after the <hi>ſame</hi> manner; but has <hi>variouſly</hi> fix'd the <hi>Periods</hi> of Life in different Perſons, and uſes as great a <hi>Variety</hi> in the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of their Death. And upon this Account it is, that both the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> &amp; <hi>manner</hi> of our going out of the World, are, as to us, Matters of the <hi>greateſt Uncertainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know not <hi>when</hi> we ſhall die: whether in Infancy or Childhood, while our Natures are weak and tender; before we are inſtructed in the Worth of Life, or are capable of exerting
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003402_0015_100314D3DE2BDC98"/>
ourſelves to any valuable purpoſes? Or in <hi>Youth,</hi> our Conſtitutions being ſtrong &amp; healthy; our Powers active and ſprightly, and in the beſt Capacity of ſerving the Ends of Life? Or whether we ſhall continue, till <hi>the evil Days come, and the Years draw nigh, when we ſhall ſay, we have no Pleaſure in them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Know not <hi>Manner</hi> in which we ſhall die: Whether on a Sudden, or by ſlow &amp; leiſurly Steps? in the Height of Proſperity, or Depth of Adverſity? in a Throng of worldly Buſineſs, or free from outward Cares and Incumberances? <hi>Death</hi> will moſt certainly ſeize upon us: but where will it be? In the Cloſet, or the Street? in the Shop, or the Field? at Sea, or on dry Land?—Theſe things are <hi>Secrets</hi> in the Breaſt of GOD alone —.</p>
            <p>In fine, We are abſolutely ignorant by what <hi>Means</hi> GOD will take us out of the World: whether by Diſeaſe, or Accident? according to Nature, or by Force &amp; Violence? He will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs make uſe of natural Cauſes: But what will they be? A Fever, or a Frenzy? the Teeth of an Inſect, or a blaſt of Wind? a Morſel of Meat, or a Hair from our Heads? a fall from a Horſe, or the hand of Malice? Or will <hi>He</hi> ſuffer us to live, till Nature is Spent, &amp; we die of ourſelves?—</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Uncertain</hi> a thing is the <hi>Life</hi> of Man.— And it is an Argument of great Wiſdom and Goodneſs in GOD, that 'tis ſo. For if we Knew the <hi>determinate</hi> Space of Life, or that it would ſurely expire at ſuch a <hi>particular</hi> Term, it wou'd
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003402_0016_100314DAEF6F95D0"/>
have a very unhappy Influence upon us. For, on the one hand, if it was at a <hi>conſiderable</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we ſhould be in utmoſt Hazard of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves Liberty, to <hi>live according to the Courſe of this World; fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh &amp; Mind.</hi> And this we ſhou'd be apt to do, till we came within the near Proſpect of our Diſſolution: and then having ſo habituated ourſelves to Sin as to be harden'd in it; it would be <hi>almoſt</hi> a Miracle, if we were ever prevail'd upon, to <hi>break off our Sins by Righteouſneſs, and our Iniquities by turning to</hi> GOD. For as the Prophet argues, Jer. 13.23. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtom'd to do evil.</hi> And on the other hand, if the Time of Life was <hi>Short,</hi> and to be terminated in the ſpace of a few Years: tho' it might awaken our Conſideration, &amp; put us on Endeavours to make our Peace with GOD, and ſecure an Intereſt in Chriſt; yet how melancholy &amp; uncomfortable, would it be like to make our Abode upon Earth? We ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy no Pleaſure in the World: neither in Friends, nor Relatives; nor any of the good things, GOD has provided for our preſent Happineſs. Such would be our Concern &amp; Fear; ſuch our dark and gloomy Apprehenſions, as would not only unfit us to converſe with one another; but even to live in ſuch a World, as GOD has made this to be.</p>
            <p>But now that the <hi>Time</hi> remains <hi>Uncertain,</hi> both theſe Inconveniences are avoided. Inſtead

of being encourag'd in a Courſe of Sin for the <hi>preſent,</hi> we have one of the ſtrongeſt Arguments to engage us in an <hi>immediate</hi> Care, about the Buſineſs of Religion, and our Soul's Salvation; and at the ſame time, there is room left for the Exerciſe of <hi>Hope,</hi> which layes a Foundation for the Enjoyment of ourſelves and the Comforts of Life.</p>
            <p>We ſhou'd therefore thankfully acknowledge and admire the Wiſdom &amp; Goodneſs of GOD, in keeping us ignorant of the <hi>Time</hi> &amp; <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of our Death: the Knowlege of which, could not be of any real Service to us; but very hurtful upon many Accounts.

It ſhou'd put us upon <hi>Weaning our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the World, and Moderating our Endeavours after it.</hi> And are there any, whoſe Hearts are too much ſet upon the World, &amp; that employ too much Pains in the Purſuit of it? It ſhou'd ſeem incredible, that <hi>Men,</hi> whom GOD has endow'd with Reaſon &amp; Underſtanding, ſhou'd be ſo little govern'd, by a ſenſe of their own Frailty, the exceeding Shortneſs &amp; Uncertainty of the preſent Life. And yet alas! ſo it is. Yea, and the Generality of Perſons are ſo ſtrangely fond of the World as to think, they can never love it too well, nor endeavour too much after it. They will riſe up early, and ſit up late; go thro' Difficulties and Hardſhips; expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Hazards; run all Riſques; ſubmit to any thing, and do any thing, for the Obtaining <hi>only</hi> of a few Scraps or Portions of it. If we were to judge by the Temper &amp; Behaviour of ſome Men, we muſt ſuppoſe they imagin'd, that both themſelves and <hi>their Houſes would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever, and their Dwelling-places to all Generations</hi>: When alas! <hi>Their Life, like a Vapour, appeareth</hi> but <hi>for a little Time, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003402_0022_100314EEEE2F0B38"/>
then vaniſheth away.</hi> How ſhou'd this Tho't beat down the Price of the World in our Eſteem, and check our Endeavours after it? For if at the <hi>longeſt</hi> we muſt <hi>quickly</hi> leave the World; and may in a <hi>Moment,</hi> at any Time, be ſnatch'd away from all the Enjoyments of it: Why ſhou'd our Hearts be wedded to it, and our whole Time and Souls employ'd about it! Is it not far more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to looſen our Affections from the Earth? to ſet light by the good things of it? and ſpend no more Pains in the Purſuit of them, than is realy neceſſary for our preſent Comfort?</p>
            <p>Perhaps we look upon the World, as our only Place of Happineſs: and entertain in our Minds ſuch exalted Apprehenſions of the Value of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enjoyments, as to deſire &amp; aim at nothing higher. But O! let us remember, we ſhan't always have ſuch Tho'ts of the World. We are haſtening apace to the Grave. It won't be long, however far we may put from us the evil Day, before we ſhall find ourſelves in the Agonies of Death. And when this comes to be our Caſe; what think we, will our Apprehenſions about the World be? As we ſhall View it in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Light, ſo will it certainly appear in quite different Colours. It will ſeem altogether Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. We ſhall ſee nothing deſirable in it: but ſhall be amaz'd at our former Folly, in ſetting ſo high a Price on it, and making it the chief Object of our ſollicitous Concern. And at ſuch a Time as this: of what great Advantage will it be to us, if we have gain'd even as much of

            <p>Or if there was nothing of Diſingenuity in ſuch a Proceedure: Yet how infinitely unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "What ſtrange Tho'ts muſt Men have of GOD &amp; Heaven, &amp; what extravagant Conceits of the <hi>little</hi> Evil of Sin, and the <hi>great</hi> Eaſineſs of Repentance, that can impoſe upon themſelves at this rate?" And how ſhall we be able to apply our ſelves to GOD <hi>now,</hi> when we have ſcarce ever had a ſerious Tho't of Him all our Lives? <q>Can we have the Face to beſpeak Him in this manner? LORD, now the World and my Luſts have left me, and I feel my ſelf ready to ſink into eternal Perdition, I lay hold upon thy Mercy to deliver my Soul from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into the Pit. I have heard ſtrange

things of thy Goodneſs, and that thou art merciful even to a Miracle. This is that which I always truſted to, that after a long Life of Sin &amp; Vanity thou wouldeſt at laſt be ſatisfy'd with a few penitent Words &amp; Sighs at the Hour of Death. Let me not, I pray thee, be diſappointed of this Hope, and put to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Is this an Addreſs fit to be made to a wiſe Man, much leſs to the all-wiſe and juſt Judge of the World? and yet this ſeems to be the plain Interpretation of the late &amp; forced Application of a great &amp; habitual Sinner to <hi>Almighty</hi> GOD in his laſt Extremity, and when he is juſt giving up the Ghoſt &amp; going to appear before his dreadful Tribunal<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Tillitſon,</hi> Vol. 1.

            <p>Beſides, is a Time of Sickneſs and Death the moſt fit ſeaſon, in which to make Preparation for Eternity, that we put it off till then? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we have had Occaſion to viſit ſick Chambers, and have taken a View of the Circumſtances of <hi>dying</hi> Perſons, we can never imagine thus! they have now enough to graple with their Illneſs. The whole ſtrength of their Nature is laid out in ſuſtaining the Infirmities of it. And they have little or no Heart to think of their Souls, or make Proviſion for their future Happineſs. Or if they have, they are leſs fit for this now, than they ever were before. For either their Senſes are ſtupify'd, their Tho'ts confuſed and ſhatter'd, their Frame diſcompos'd: Or elſe their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003402_0035_1003151C2393D190"/>
Pains are ſo extream, or their Bodies ſo very weak and faint, as to incapacitate them for the Work of getting ready to go out of the World. And O! how many, when upon a Death-bed, have, with Tears in their Eyes, moſt bitterly lamented their Folly, in deferring to make their Peace with GOD till then; they have <hi>now</hi> found ſo many Difficulties &amp; Inconveniencies in the way, beyond what they would have done, if they had engaged in this Buſineſs ſooner, and in a more proper Time of Life.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there is nothing more precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than a <hi>Death-bed</hi> Preparation for another World. Sinners indeed, at ſuch a time, are often in great Conſternation of Mind; their Cries for Mercy ſerious &amp; affecting, &amp; their Vows &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes particular and ſolemn. — Yet, tis to be fear'd their <hi>Concern</hi> about their State moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ariſes, <hi>only</hi> from an awaken'd Senſe <hi>of what a fearful thing it is to fall into the Hands of the living GOD.</hi> They can't bear to think of going away, <hi>to dwell with devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, and to inhabit everlaſting Burnings.</hi> And becauſe they are in Diſtreſs &amp; Agony of Soul, they themſelves, and perhaps their Friends too, are ready to hope for the beſt, and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to believe that their Sorrows are the Sorrows of a <hi>Repentance unto Life</hi>: When alas! it may be, they are no ways troubled, that they have offended GOD and rejected CHRIST and acted all their Days unworthy of themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Glory of their Natures; but are fill'd
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003402_0036_1003151F65E70C78"/>
with Horrour at the Proſpect, of what is like to be the Conſequence of their evil doings. Many while under Apprehenſions of Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have been as much terrify'd and as heartily troubled; and have made as fair pretences &amp; as ſolemn Promiſes: and yet, when GOD has ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom'd their Lives from Deſtruction, they have forgot the Anguiſh of Spirit they were in, and returned to their former Folly &amp; Wickedneſs: Yea, they have made themſelves ſeven-fold more the Children of the Devil: whereby they have evidently diſcovered it to the World, that their Repentance was not ſincere; and that if they had died, they would have periſh'd forever. And no doubt, this is the Caſe of many, whoſe Lives were not ſpared to them. If they had been raiſed up again, their Repentance would have prov'd it ſelf to have been, nothing more than the Terrours of a guilty Conſcience. In a word, tis a Matter of the greateſt Niceneſs and Difficulty, to determine concerning any <hi>Death-bed</hi> Repentance in <hi>particular,</hi> whether it be ſincere and ſuch as GOD will accept: And after all that can be ſaid, it muſt &amp; will remain very precarious and uncertain.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when we come to lie upon a Sick bed, we ſhan't find the Buſineſs of getting ready for Death and Judgment ſuch an eaſie thing, as at preſent we may imagine it to be. I doubt not, but moſt Sinners have ſlight Tho'ts of the Work of Repentance &amp; Salvation. They ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is but confeſſing their Sins with external
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003402_0037_10031520FB7AA770"/>
ſigns of Sorrow, and putting up a a few Prayers to GOD for Mercy, <hi>and ſo an Entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto them abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our</hi> LORD <hi>and</hi> SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR JESUS CHRIST: and they imagine they can do this as well, juſt at the Point of Death, as at any Time, and ſo put it off till then. But O! what amazing Folly is this! and how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do we impoſe upon ourſelves in a Matter of the higheſt Moment! Is the Work of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſuch an eaſie one, and ſo dependant on our own Pleaſure, that we may thus dally with it? Alas! if GOD ever give us a true Sight and Senſe of things, we ſhall have quite different Tho'ts of it, and find that we were miſerably miſtaken. Heaven is not ſo eaſily obtained. Tis a great and difficult work to prepare our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it, and we ſhall certainly find it to be ſo. And to convince us of this Truth, I tho't now to have gone on to tell you, what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Preparation for Death, that I have been thus long urging upon you. But I ſee the Time will allow me only to obſerve in General,</p>
            <p>That there is a two fold Preparation for Death, the one <hi>habitual,</hi> the other <hi>actual.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients that conſtitute the <hi>former,</hi> are true Faith in CHRIST, an inward rooted Averſion to all Sin, &amp; a prevailing Diſpoſition to univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Holineſs: in order to which, generally Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is neceſſary, that we take a great deal of Pains in the uſe of Prayer, Meditation, reading
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003402_0038_100315241F1AFF58"/>
&amp; hearig GOD's Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the ways, in which He ordinarily <hi>makes known the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Greatneſs of his Power,</hi> in putting Perſons into a State of Salvation. But beſides this, there is an <hi>actual</hi> Preparation; which, tho' not of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity, yet is highly requiſite, as tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a peaceful &amp; comfortable Death. And the beſt way in order to our obtaining this, is to familiarize to ourſelves the Tho'ts of Death; to keep a conſtant ſenſe of our own Frailty upon our Minds; to mortify our Affections to the World, and place them upon thoſe things that are above: and in a word, to look upon every Day of our Lives, as not Knowing but it may be our Laſt; and to live &amp; act every Day, as tho' we were certain, before the next, our eternal State would be determin'd.</p>
            <p>I have now done with my Text: and ſhall only add a few Words on the mournful Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of my diſcourſing to you upon ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at this Time, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lamented Death of that Honourable and vertuous Gentlewoman, Mrs. <hi>SARAH BYFIELD,</hi> whom, laſt Week, we follow'd to the Grave.</p>
            <p>For her Character, I think my ſelf, in Juſtice to her Memory, oblig'd to ſay, — That as ſhe was honoured by her Birth; being <hi>Daughter</hi> to a <hi>renowned</hi> FATHER <note n="*" place="bottom">Gov. LEVERETT.</note> 
               <hi>of this Country,</hi> who, for ſeveral Years, with <hi>univerſal</hi> Love and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003402_0039_10031529D82820B8"/>
Reverence, ſat in the FIRST CHAIR of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over it; ſo that her Temper &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct were every way worthy of ſuch a <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed</hi> Parentage.</p>
            <p>She had <hi>naturally</hi> a weak &amp; tender Body; but a ſtrong &amp; noble Soul: which, being culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated &amp; enrich'd by a good Education and great Induſtry, render'd her truly amiable &amp; deſirable; and fitted her to be a Bleſſing in the Station Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had aſſign'd her.</p>
            <p>Her Temper was lively &amp; chearful; yet far from light &amp; vain: being well <hi>ballaſt</hi> by a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> Diſcretion. In her moſt pleaſant Hours, She was never unfit to enter upon a Serious Subject, and always treated it with a becoming Gravity and Reverence.</p>
            <p>She had a good Taſte in Converſation, and was excellently well turn'd for it: having a ready Wit; a ſprightly Genius; an eaſy ſmooth way of expreſſing herſelf; and being able, without Stiffneſs or Oſtentation, to be both entertaining and profitable.</p>
            <p>She was a <hi>Perſon</hi> of great Sincerity &amp; Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs; meek &amp; humble; patient &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd: which ſhe had frequent Opportunites of diſcovering, by reaſon of thoſe many Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that were inſeparable from ſo <hi>brittle</hi> a Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>In a Word, She was an <hi>Honour</hi> to her <hi>Sex,</hi> in her exemplary Deportment under all the various Characters &amp; Relations of Life: As a Neighbour, Kind &amp; Pitiſul: As a Friend, true &amp; hearty;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003402_0040_1003152D01749EA0"/>
without Diſguiſe &amp; abhorrent to Flattery and Deceit: As a Wife, tender &amp; dutiful; engaging in her Carriage; reverent &amp; reſpectful: As Miſtreſs in a Family, diſcreet in her Management; a Lover of good Order; neat &amp; cleanly; tho'tful of all under her Care; indulgent &amp; compaſſionate to her Servants: eſpecially concern'd about their Souls, and frequent in teaching them the good Knowledge of the LORD; in her Treatment of Strangers, hoſpitable; courteous, pleaſant, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging &amp; edifying to thoſe that came to viſit her.</p>
            <p>But her <hi>chief</hi> Excellency, &amp; what <hi>moſt</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all that knew her, was her <hi>undiſsembled</hi> Piety. She had an habitual prevailing Awe and Reverence of GOD upon her Heart: which <hi>early</hi> diſcovered it ſelf, and <hi>all along</hi> thro' the Courſe of her Life, not only in an utter Abhorrence of every thing that ſavour'd of Prophanneſs &amp; Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; but in a due Treatment of thoſe things, wherein the <hi>Divine Honour</hi> is nearly concern'd. She lov'd the Houſe, &amp; Sanctify'd the Day of God; gave her conſtant devout Attendance on the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, and <hi>all</hi> Goſpel Ordinances; paid a ſingular Regard to the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi>; valued the Miniſters of Religion; and had an univerſal Regard to all good Men. But above all, CHRIST was the <hi>Object</hi> of her Love, her Faith, her Hope. It was in her Account <hi>a faithful ſaying,</hi> and ſhe eſteem'd it <hi>worthy of all Acceptation, that</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>was come into the World to ſave Sinners.</hi> HIM therefore ſhe embrac'd as the <hi>alone</hi> REDEEMER of Souls; HIM ſhe
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003402_0041_1003152E84368590"/>
truſted with the great Affair of her Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; HIM ſhe lov'd with her whole Heart; HIM ſhe made it her Care to pleaſe in all things; HIS Image ſhe was Adorn'd with; &amp; the Graces of HIS SPIRIT ſhe liv'd in the daily Exerciſe of: And we charitably believe ſhe is gone to be with CHRIST, which is beſt of all.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but the Mourning Friends &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives have often refreſh'd their Souls, by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back to her paſt Converſation in CHRIST; and then by turning theiy View forward to thoſe unutterable Glories, ſhe is now poſſeſs'd of, in the Place GOD has ordain'd for the <hi>Spirits</hi> of Believers, in their <hi>ſeparate State.</hi> And while by <hi>Faith,</hi> they are beholding her, as in the Boſome of JESUS, I may well ſuppoſe, they grieve not for <hi>her</hi>; but rather rejoyce, that ſhe is got beyond the Reach of Sorrow, the Power of Temptation and the Poſſibility of Sinning; and that ſhe is entred upon the Reward of Righteouſneſs, which is <hi>Joy</hi> &amp; <hi>Peace, Quietneſs &amp; Aſſurance for ever</hi>:, Yet upon their <hi>own</hi> Accounts, they may have Reaſon to Mourn, and ſtand in need of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>We heartily wiſh, for all the Relatives, Divine Support under this <hi>Tryal of their Faith</hi>; the comforting Preſence of the <hi>Holy</hi> GHOST; and the ſanctifying Influences of ſupernatural Grace, whereby they may be enabled ſo to behave themſelves, as that GOD may be honour'd their own Holineſs increaſed and their future &amp; <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weight of Glory</hi> inhanced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:003402_0042_10031531B9681B20"/>And particularly, we would ſympathize with that Aged &amp; Honourable Servant of GOD, who was moſt nearly related to the Perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed.

But be dumb with Silence;—meekly bear this <hi>Chaſtening of the</hi> LORD; — take a realizing View of it, as coming from your Covenant GOD and FATHER, <hi>who never afflicts willingly, nor grieves his Children</hi>: — Adore the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, the Wiſdom, the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of this Providence. — Let it be your chief Care ſo to carry your ſelf under it, as to give a bright Example of <hi>Subjection to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits</hi>; of Humility, Patience, Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation — And may it ſerve to make you a <hi>Partaker of the Divine Nature</hi> in ſtill greater Meaſures, and ſo advance you yet further in your Preparedneſs for that Eternal <hi>happy</hi> State, you hope and long for, and are arrived at the Confines of! — We heartily pray GOD to be the Staff of your Age, your Joy and Comfort thro' the remaining part of your Life; your Guide thro' Death, and <hi>when your Fleſh and Heart faileth, the Strength of your Heart and your GOD forever.</hi>

            <head>An <hi>APPENDIX.</hi> From the <hi>Weekly News-Letter,</hi> No. 1405. Containing an Account of the Deceaſed. <hi>BOSTON, December</hi> 29. 1730.</head>
            <p>YEſterday were Buried here the Remains of that truly honourable &amp; devout Gentlewoman, Mrs. SARAH BYFIELD, amidſt the affectionate Reſpects and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of a numerous Concourſe. — Before carrying out the Corpſe a Funeral Prayer was made, by One of the Paſtors of the <hi>Old Church,</hi> to whoſe Communion ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd: Which, tho' a Cuſtom in the Country-Towns, is a ſingular Inſtance in this place, but it's wiſh'd may prove a leading Example to the general Practice of ſo chriſtian &amp; decent a Cuſtom.— The Pall was held up by the honourable the late Lieut. Gov. DUMMER, with other Gentlemen of His Majeſty's Council. Among the mourning Relatives went his Excellency Governour BELCHER, and his Honour Lieut. Gov. TAILER: fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by a long Train of Perſons of publick Diſtinction and private Character; paying their laſt Offices to the Dead, and uniting their ſincere Condolences with the Living.</p>
            <p>This Gentlewoman was diſtinguiſh'd by her Birth and Family; being youngeſt Daughter to the late excellent Gov. LEVERETT, whoſe Name is ſtill had in Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and will be always venerable to thoſe that know the Story of <hi>New-England.</hi>— She was honourable alſo
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003402_0045_1003153E1755E080"/>
by her Marriage; being Conſort to the worthy aged <hi>Nathanael Byfield,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſometimes Senior Counſeller for this Province, and now Judge of the Vice-Admiralty; to whom ſhe was marry'd <hi>April</hi> 17. 1718. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his advanced Years, the dear Partner of his Griefs and Joys, and very much his Delight and Ornament.</p>
            <p>But She was moſt of all diſtinguiſh'd by her perſonal Merits; which thoſe have a ſingular Senſe of, that were moſt intimately acquainted with her: and this is one of the ſureſt Teſts of true Worth. She inherited much of the excellent Spirit &amp; Principles, which embalm the Memory of her incomparable Father &amp; Mother, who were ſome of the faireſt Ornaments of their Age. She had a conſpicuous Share of that good Senſe, ſo natural to the Family, and was much improv'd in the moſt uſeful Knowledge. In Conjunction with a ſprightly Wit, She had a thoughtful Genius; and her fervent Temper was govern'd &amp; adorn'd by a rare Diſcretion: which peculiarly accompliſh'd her to ſhine in that ſuperiour Rank where Divine Providence placed her. She honoured the ſeveral States of Virginity and Marriage; and fill'd up the various Characters and Relations ſhe ſuſtain'd, with the Duties belonging to them. While ſhe affected not Appearances, but declined Show and Noiſe, a primitive Simplicity, Humility &amp; Modeſty reflected a Luſtre on all her other Graces &amp; Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and ſhe ſhone with Eminence in the ſeveral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Domeſtick Life, the proper Diſtinctions of her Sex. And here the Prudence of her Oeconomy, joyn'd with a hoſpitable Management, her Civility &amp; Courteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Viſitants, her grave &amp; chearful Converſation, her reverent &amp; engaging Carriage to her honourable Conſort, and wiſe Deportment among his Children; theſe things have merited for her the Privilege &amp; Honour of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s vertuous Woman: <hi>Her Children ariſe up and call her Bleſſed; her Husband alſo, and he praiſeth her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all her Memory is reſpected for that ſerious Piety, and Spirit of Devotion, which brighten'd her early Years, and continued with her to the End. She was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd with a religious as well as ingenuous Education;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003402_0046_1003153F99EB8368"/>
and agreably (in Addition to the Gentlewoman) ſhe had much of <hi>the Chriſtian,</hi> which is a Diſtinction that will laſt, when all others are bury'd in Silence. She was a lover of ſacred Retirements; liv'd upon her Bible, and gave her ſelf to Prayer. An equal Friend ſhe was to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Devotions: and the publick Aſſemblies cou'd wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs her diligent Attendance on all publick Ordinances. She was a ſtrict Obſerver of the LORD's DAY, and took Care to ſanctify the Sabbath in her Conduct at home, as well as at the Houſe of GOD. She took a great deal of commendable Pains in Catechiſing &amp; inſtructing the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants committed to her Charge: Opening her Mouth with Wiſdom, and in her Tongue was the Law of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In her you might ſee the condeſcending &amp; faithful Miſtreſs, the affectionate Mother, the vertuous &amp; prudent Wife, the conſtant Friend, and the obliging Neighbour. And ſurely the World will not envy theſe juſt Honours to the Memory of ſo valuable a Perſon.</p>
            <p>She was born <hi>July</hi> 13. 1673. — and died after a ſhort Illneſs, <hi>Dec.</hi> 21. 1730. Leaving behind her that <hi>good Name, which is better than precious Ointment, and the day of Death was better</hi> to her (we truſt) <hi>than the day of her Birth.</hi> — May we all be found Followers of them who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</p>
