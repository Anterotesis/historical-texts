            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE Confederate States of North America TO PRAISE GOD. TWO SERMONS.

            <p>THE author ſhall ſay nothing of the dreſs in which theſe ſermons appear, or of the method of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſubject, only that they are ſuch as he judgeth to be moſt conducive to the benefit of his readers in common. Gentlemen of obſervation and ſtudies can ſelect arguments from the public prints, from diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or general harangues: But the bulk of mankind need to have theſe ſelected for them, ranged in ſome order, and particularly illuſtrated and enforced. He is ſenſible that ſeveral of his arguments are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, having been frequently treated by the politicians of the day, and treated to great advantage; which, in ſome reſpects, is no very favourable circumſtance for him as an author, eſpecially as the taſte of the times is chiefly for ſomething new, and but little for piety. However, the religious caſt he has attempted to give them, and the illuſtrations from ſcripture, by which they are enforced, are, in a great meaſure, new. For theſe reaſons he expects they will be the more reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſerious minds, that wiſh to ſee them more fully turned into a religious channel; and, by the bleſſing of God, may be the means of leading ſome others to think more ſeriouſly upon thoſe intereſting ſubjects. Theſe are his hopes, and his principal motives for this publication. It is certainly high time for us to awake out of ſleep, and pay a moſt pious attention to the very great and intereſting events of our day. That this eſſay may be bleſſed to thoſe ends, is the hearty deſire of a well-wiſher to his country, and a ſervant of the church for Chriſt's ſake.</p>

            <p>"PRAISE Ye the Lord: for it is good to ſing praiſes to our God: for it is pleaſant, and praiſe is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly." It is comely: for of all the exerciſes upon earth it bears the neareſt reſemblance to the worſhip of heaven, and highly becometh us as reaſonable creatures, but much more as chriſtians. Our obligations to the duty are founded as well on our own indigence, as on the glory of Jehovah, and his goodneſs to us. Every one daily receiveth innumerable mercies from his unwaſted fullneſs, which daily lay him under freſh obligations to praiſe the bountiful author of them. Communities, as collective bodies, are bound to praiſe him no leſs than individuals. By the common laws of ſociety, the good of the whole and of individuals mutually affect each other, which obligeth them to offer praiſe reſpectively, not only from ſelf-intereſt, but from the purer ſprings of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. This more evidently appears in ſome public ſcenes of providence, which are ſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he who runneth may read the peculiar favours of heaven to the whole and to the individuals: then more eſpecially let all the people praiſe God. And as all the people are bound to praiſe God on ſuch occaſions; ſo it is moſt harmonious, animating and many ways uſeful for the whole to unite in his praiſes at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>This day, my brethren, we and all the inhabitants of the United States are called to give thanks to the LORD of lords and KING of kings, for the many peculiar favours he hath of late vouchſafed to us, as a people appearing in defence of our invaluable privileges. At this important
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:017722_0004_0FA2629F80807AA0"/>
call let every individual, let every family, let every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, let every town, let every ſtate, let all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate ſtates unite in praiſing our God, as with one heart and one voice.</p>
            <p>To this noble exerciſe the royal pſalmiſt moſt pathetic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exciteth us in the pſalm where my text lies, which is moſt happily adapted to, and compoſed for, a day of public thankſgiving. It was ſung by the Jews, and with greater propriety may be ſung by Chriſtians, on ſuch occaſions; for to us it had an ultimate reference, and the moral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſong ſhine with brighter evidence in the new teſtament diſpenſation than in the old.</p>
            <p>The motives to praiſe expreſſed in the pſalm, are, <q>God's ſaving health,</q> or ſalvation by Chriſt, to be made known to all nations; and his moral government of the world, who ſhall <q>judge the people righteouſly, and govern the nations upon earth.</q> It is this laſt motive I ſhall chiefly inſiſt upon.</p>
            <p>The importance of the duty, and zeal with which it ſhould be performed, we learn firſt from the rhetorical and affecting repetition in the text of the very words expreſſed in the third verſe, in which the mind of the pſalmiſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been wrapt in his ſubject, like one moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon, and earneſt in the purſuit of his object. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from the beautiful and tranſporting climax by which the ſong aſcends: <q>Let the people praiſe thee, O God! let ALL the people praiſe thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To comply with the deſign of my text and of this day, I ſhall point out and illuſtrate ſome of the leading obligations upon all the inhabitants of the confederate ſtates of North America to unite in praiſe to God, for the ſignal interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his providence in their favour, during our conteſt with Great Britain; eſpecially thoſe of the laſt campaign, crowned by the capture of lord Cornwallis with his whole army.</p>
            <p>Thoſe obligations ariſe from the nature and importance of the cauſe conteſted—the fatal conſequences to us and to our poſterity had we loſt the cauſe—the ſtrong and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous obſtacles that ſtood in our way—our apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:017722_0004_0FA2629F80807AA0"/>
for the mighty conflict—ſome noticeable ſteps of providence towards us in giving us a few, though they might ſeem to be inadequate, preparatives for the war. The various and remarkable ſucceſſes God hath granted to our troops eſpecially thoſe of the laſt campaign—ſeveral inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents interſperſed through the ſcene, which were overruled by a wiſe and good providence in our favour, though at firſt ſundry of them might ſeem to ſtand much againſt us— and from the glorious proſpects to us and to our poſterity, opened by the ſeveral ſucceſſes of our arms, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they have been granted.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The nature and importance of the cauſe conteſted lay us under the ſtrongeſt obligations to praiſe God for pleading our cauſe. The great object in conteſt is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our eſſential and unalienable rights and privileges, as well civil as ſacred, ſhall be in our own power, or at the ſovereign will of tyrants. Take theſe from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and commit them to any abſolute lord, or lords, and no man has a ſecurity for the rights of conſcience, for life, or for property and the means of procuring it.</p>
            <p>It has long been the boaſt of the Britiſh conſtitution, that it ſecures thoſe privileges to the ſubjects, becauſe it is founded upon the two grand pillars of liberty, a right to diſpoſe of our own property, and a right to have our claim to life and property tried by a jury of fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. But theſe rights the Britiſh court and parliament have by every artifice endeavoured to undermine, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to lead us to own either directly or indirectly, the juſtneſs of their claim of right to tax us at pleaſure, to oblige ſome of our citizens to take their trial in Britain, and to alter and virtually deſtroy our forms of civil go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vernment. They long ſhrouded their real deſign by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretexts; but their artifice failing them, they own the extent of their claim, viz. an omnipotent power to make laws "to bind us in all caſes whatſoever." And in order to confiſcate all the ſtates to the crown, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare us to be in a ſtate of rebellion, and ariſe to execute their horrid plot by open violence, not doubting that they would make an eaſy conqueſt of us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:017722_0005_0FA262A214F29C20"/>To juſtify their violent meaſures, they employ their whole policy to confound law and conſtitution, and make the world believe, that our oppoſition to their iniquitous unconſtitutional acts was an oppoſition to the conſtitution itſelf, and a riſing againſt lawful authority. This is the idea of our conduct held up by them to their own nation, and to all Europe, to excite their deteſtation at us, as a rebellious and lawleſs mob. And with this lie they fill the mouths of their ignorant officers and ſoldiers, and inſpire their breaſts, as well with violence as with thirſt for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and blood.</p>
            <p>Nothing could be more cruel or more falſe! America betook herſelf to arms in oppoſition to the moſt unlawful exerciſe of power, and in defence of privileges which the unalienable rights of mankind abſolutely forbid her to yield! And this ſhe did not, till ſhe had tried every other means in vain, and till Britain had wantonly ſhed the blood of her ſons! In thoſe circumſtances it was not only our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible duty to oppoſe force to force; but it was the duty of all Britain to reſent ſo violent an infraction upon their own conſtitution; for they might expect the next ſtroke to fall upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>But the glorious Sovereign of the earth and heavens hath lifted up a banner for you, O ye highly favoured Americans! and hath ſaved you by his right hand. He hath raiſed up many friends for you, ſent you many aids, and made you to be pitied by many nations! He hath ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered your clouds, ſilenced your fears, encouraged your hopes, defended your perſons and property, and he will defend them, if ye wiſely improve the bleſſings of his merciful providence! Ye ſhall worſhip your God, and none ſhall make you afraid! Ye ſhall enjoy your poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions undiſturbed, for which ye have laboured and ſweat, and for which many of your braveſt ſons have riſqued their lives in the high places of the field, and many of them have ſpilt their deareſt blood! Grim tyranny hangs his head! Fair liberty hath erected her banner! Therefore ye ſhall ſit ſecure under the protection of laws founded upon this firm baſis! Nor may the bleſſings of your vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017722_0005_0FA262A214F29C20"/>
ſtruggles be confined to yourſelves; other nations beholding them may open their eyes upon their own duty and privilege. Your liberty ſecured, like the ſun burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the cloud, may ſhed its healing beams over the nations long ſhut up in darkneſs and bondage! For all theſe mercies let all our nation offer the acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe! And let the whole earth uniting in our ſong, praiſe him who judgeth the people righteouſly, and governeth the nations upon earth!</p>
            <p n="2">II. The fatal conſequences to us and our poſterity, had we loſt the cauſe, furniſh a moſt fruitful ſource of motives to praiſe our great deliverer. The greater the evils are from which a people are ſaved, the greater are their obligations to their ſaviour. But the evils which threatned us were many and moſt grievous. No people upon earth are in a condition more wretched than we ſhould have been reduced to, had the Britiſh arms prevailed. A government would have been eſtabliſhed over us, the form of which is no where exiſtent, and none ſo deſtructive of the liberties of the people. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy and abſolute monarchy are uſually eſteemed the two worſt kinds of government. But the ſtrongeſt efforts were made to unite both virtually in the government to be fixed upon us; or rather it would have been an ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſanctioned by monarchy, which is infinitely worſe than pure abſolute monarchy. If neither of theſe are its proper name, it is hard to ſay by what name it ſhould be called.</p>
            <p>So ſtrong was the Britiſh ſovereign's, thirſt to eſtabliſh deſpotiſm, that he created forty lords, from the beginning of his infamous reign to the commencement of the preſent war, who had not a claim to a foot of land in Britain; that being penſioners upon the crown, they might throw their weight into the ſcale, to deſtroy the liberties of the people. How many more he has created ſince that time I know not. How are theſe numerous unlanded lords to be ſupported? principally, no doubt, from the ſpoils of North America. To this inſtance of his folly he adds another, viz. favouring a ſcheme to render his parliament abſolute. Folly I call it, as well as wickedneſs. For

thoſe petty tyrants might, by virtue of their authority, make the royal tyrant himſelf feel the weight of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhould he at any time happen not to coincide with their views. But he had no other way to eſtabliſh ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and force from the people whatſoever his covetous heart luſted for, but by allowing to them the enormous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of making laws to bind the people in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And they, fond of ſo great an extent of power, favour the king's ambitious and tyrannical views, which otherwiſe they might perhaps have oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch a government who could live? It would he hard to be ſubjected to the will of one tyrant—harder ſtill to be ſubject to more than 500 tyrants, all plotting with their cruel maſter to fleece and diſtreſs the ſubjects— But hardeſt of all to be under the command of their viceroys, at the diſtance of 3000 miles from the ſeat of authority, all governing according to the arbitrary orders of ſo many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful deſpots, and making ſuch repreſentations to them, as their ambitious, covetous, or revengeful paſſions might dictate. Such motives and ſuch opportunities for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of tyranny could no where be found. Of this Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca has already had a taſte in their introductory ſteps to bring us under the yoke; and but a taſte, compared with what ſhe would feel, when their villainous ſcheme ſhould have been completed.</p>
            <p>Add to all this the tythes of your whole produce every year for the ſupport of the church, and the rapacity and cruelty of the harpies, officers and others, to whom diſtricts of the country would be parcelled out, for their ſervices in reducing us to a ſtate of bondage.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is no chimerical idea to ſuppoſe ſuch appointments and ſuch grants would be made to them. Whence is it that ſo many parts of Germany, Britain and Ireland groan under the yoke of oppreſſion, but from the dukedoms, counties, &amp;c. granted to the anceſtors of their petty tyrants, for their aid either in money or in the field. And it is more than a conjecture, that lands were promiſed to the Britiſh ſoldiers, and diſtricts of the country to their officers, as encouragements to them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the ſervice.</note> Who could bear the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017722_0006_0FA262A221809960"/>
inſolence and rapacity of a Cornwallis, a Knyphauſen, a Galloway, an Arnold, a Tarleton, or a Simcoe, either as a governor or a landlord?</p>
            <p>Now, Americans, what would be your diſtreſſes, when, beſides the ſupport of governors and other neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of government, you would be obliged to give the tenth of all your produce every year, for the ſupport of the clergy, and thoſe too not of your own chooſing;—to pay the whole demands of a greedy landlord, and the whole claim of a tyrannical prince, to aggrandiſe his numerous family, to maintain his penſioned lords, and to diſcharge a debt of more than ſeventy millions, contracted to enſlave you?</p>
            <p>Theſe things duly weighed, are ſufficient to ſet ſprings to the gratitude of all, for the preſervation of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and put a check to the murmurings of ſome, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it hard to give a moderate competency for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of the few honeſt miniſters amongſt us, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, for a time, the expences of a war ſo juſt and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Had Britain made a conqueſt of us, we and our poſterity would have multiplied taxes, of a much greater amount, to pay every year perpetually, with every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of aggravation and bitterneſs. Every ſpecies of cruelty has breathed from, and as far as was in their power, has been practiſed by the tyrants and their tools, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of what America had to expect. They have hired and prompted their barbarous allies to ſhed Chriſtian blood;—armed ſlaves againſt their maſters;—wantonly burned towns;—robbed, plundered and deſtroyed private property;—and treated with the greateſt barbarity perſons of every ſex and age. They may plead, as they have done, that theſe are caſualties incident to war. Some of them might be ſo; but many, perhaps moſt of them, were not ſo. Soldiers durſt not act ſo barbarouſly in common, did they not know it to be agreeable to their officers; nor officers, did they not know it to be agreeable to their cruel maſters. Every circumſtance in the conduct of the court and army clearly manifeſts, that their orders and deſign were to proceed againſt us upon the plan of cruelty and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017722_0007_0FA262A2DBD42540"/>
And they have carried on the war with a barbarity unknown in Europe or any civiliſed nation.</p>
            <p>The malice of the tyrants would have put an aggravation into all the other ſufferings of America, by robbing her of her moſt precious jewels. The leading members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and others who have appeared moſt eminent in the cauſe of their country, might have fallen the firſt ſacrifice to their wrath. Miniſters of the goſpel of a patriotic ſtamp would have ſhared no mercy. Many indubitable teſtimonies induce us to believe this.</p>
            <p>But I do not think it is in the power of deſcription fully to paint all the ſhocking conſequences to our country, had ſhe been ſubjugated to Britiſh tyranny. O! how great is our ſalvation, and how great the praiſes due for it! Praiſe ye the Lord, all ye brave ſtateſmen, who dared to ſtep forth in your country's cauſe.

            <p n="3">III. The ſtrong and numerous obſtacles which ſtood in our way, demand our warmeſt praiſes to HIM who enabled us to ſurmount them all. We had the moſt powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon earth to oppoſe, all things conſidered, and the moſt dangerous. A nation whoſe ſovereign is deſpotic, obſtinate and cruel; their ſtateſmen ſubtile, treacherous, inſidious, ſwollen with a ſenſe of their own importance, and long practiſed in the arts of government and deceit; their officers and troops generally eſteemed equal, if not ſuperior, to any in Europe; their fleet the moſt formidable of any in the world. With their ſhips of war they ſhut up our ports, covered their troops, and eaſily tranſported them from ſtate to ſtate. A nation whoſe treaſury was reſpectable, their credit great, and their reſources from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017722_0007_0FA262A2DBD42540"/>
their numerous manufactures, their extenſive trade, the fertility of their lands, and the riches of their ſettlements in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies, were great and numerous! We had the flower of their army to oppoſe, with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand foreign mercenaries, and a coaſt of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles to defend!</p>
            <p>Our ancient forms of government, the prejudices of cuſtom, and our doating affection for Britain, were ſtrong bars in our way. The governors of the colonies were creatures of the crown, their connexions together with the Britiſh merchants upon the continent generally in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the crown. To theſe I might add Tories and Refugees, a ſett of the moſt infamous ſycophants, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, plunderers, robbers and lyars, that ever polluted any land; ſundry of whom were perſons of fortune, and ſundry of them crafty, plauſible, and intrigueing, having been long employed in ſtate buſineſs. Theſe all united their efforts and policy to diſtreſs, to intimidate, to ſow diſcord, to ſpread falſe reports, and to blind the eyes of the people. Sometimes they repreſented the power of Britain to be ſo great, that nothing could ſtand before it; and therefore we would fall an eaſy prey to their arms, and none would have ſecurity for their perſons or property, but thoſe who would take an active part againſt their country, or remain in a ſtate of neutrality. At other times they tried to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the vulgar by aſſerting that the powers of Europe, accounting it their own intereſt to keep the colonies in ſubjection to Britain, would join with her in order to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due us. With theſe and ſeveral other fabulous ſtories they deceived ſome, whoſe ſimplicity, timidity, or religious principles favour their deſign. When the appearance of the French fleet and army detects the fallacy, they change their notes, inſinuating that the Congreſs are about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce popery amongſt us by their alliance with France, who has it only in view to ſeize the ſtates for themſelves, when Britain ſhall have been ſubdued. <note n="§" place="bottom">Nothing can more fully diſcover the deceit of thoſe filthy hypocrites than this; for their temper and practice plainly ſhow, that of all the religious principles profeſſed upon earth, pure proteſtantiſm would be their laſt choice. Were it worth while to reaſon with them, I would ſay, there is nothing in the treaty itſelf, nothing in the intereſt of the nation, and nothing in their apparent diſpoſition to favour the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That it is wholly againſt the concern of all Europe to maintain the balance of power, and that the imputation of favouring popery can no more juſtly be fixed upon us from our alliance with France, than it could upon any other proteſtant nation from their alliance with them, or with any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh power. Every one who will open his eyes upon the truth muſt ſee, that a civil league by no means implies a religious one. If Luther in promoting the reformation accepted the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of popiſh princes, why may not we in defence of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties civil and religious? We ſhould bleſs God for the help he ſends us, and truſt him for futurity. For my own part, I freely confeſs, that there is ſcarcely a popiſh prince in Europe, with whom I would not more freely entruſt my religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than with the debauched court and parliament of Britain. Eſpecially I would much ſooner entruſt them with our generous ally, who has reſcinded all the laws in his kingdom that ſtood againſt proteſtants, choſe a proteſtant financier, and allowed him a chapel to accommodate himſelf and his friends, and hath ſent to our aid a proteſtant regiment with a proteſtant chaplain to preach to them. But our enemies have been ſlily ſlipping round to the other ſide. Who formed the Quebec bill? Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious George and his generous parliament, with which lord Pitt ſeverely upbraided them, eſpecially the ſpiritual lords! Did the people aſk it? no! Was any religious profeſſion in America, except popery, ever eſtabliſhed by an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? no!

            <p n="4">IV. In the fourth place we take into view our apparent inability for the mighty conflict. So weak were we, that our enemies did not entertain the leaſt doubt of reducing us to their terms, by a few troops and ſhips of war; ſo weak, that all Europe were apprehenſive for the conſequences, and waited the event in deep ſuſpenſe. Our internal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, indeed, were large; a fruitful land to furniſh all kinds of proviſions; our men active, intelligent and brave: but our ſtrength was to be collected, and our powers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Cultivating only the common honeſt arts of peace, we were generally unſkilled in the depths of ſtate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and of war; without an army; without arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; without money and cloathing for our troops; nor had we a ſingle ſhip of war, nor one ally. In this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate, truſting heaven to provide for us, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared our reſolution to vindicate our liberties by arms, when the royal ear was cloſed againſt our righteous and humble ſupplications. We had at the ſame time to train and equip ourſelves for the field—to fight and cultivate our farms to procure food and cloathing for ourſelves and our army—to throw down ancient forms of government
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017722_0009_0FA262A9EC0800D0"/>
and erect new ones in their ſtead. Never did a people do as much, endure as much, and conquer ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the ſame ſpace of time. It is hard to ſay which is moſt aſtoniſhing, the bravery or ſucceſs of the enterpriſe. It is, indeed, next to a miracle that people ſo weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared ſhould have overcome ſo great a force as ſtood againſt us—confounded the councils, and baffled the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all Britain— done ſo great things by ſea and land, in council, in the field, and upon our farms.

It is the Lord's doing, and marvellous in our eyes. <q>Had not the Lord been on our ſide, when men roſe up to ſlay us: then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us. Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our ſoul is eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler: the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped.

            <p>By the ſtamp act, and other artful devices to invade our liberties, the minds of our inexperienced ſtateſmen were rouſed to attend as well to the intrigues of the Britiſh court, as to ſtudy the rights of freemen, and vindicate them againſt any encroachments.

            <p>Lexington and Bunker's Hill, Long Iſland and White Plains, the banks of Brandywine and ſtreets of German-town, Monmouth with Stoney Point, all proclaim to our enemies, with a voice of thunder, the watchful care of heaven over America, and their own folly in expecting to make an eaſy conqueſt of her.</p>
            <p>But above all other parts of the whole ſcene, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of providence for us in New Jerſey, the latter part of the year 1776 and beginning of 1777, deſerve the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar attention. In this time our illuſtrious general is a ſhining example of <q>true greatneſs never appearing ſo conſpicuous as in adverſity.</q> Above two thouſand of his brave troops fell and were taken at fort Waſhington, and the time of the militia and flying camp being expired together with the ſhort enliſtment of ſeveral of his regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar troops, moſt of them return home, and leave the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to retreat through the Jerſies with the remains of his weak and ſhattered army, before a ſtrong corps of the purſuing enemy. Yet he conducteth his few fatigued and naked troops ſafe, even in ſight of the enemy, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Delaware, and there makes a ſtand, till the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia are once more collected.</p>
            <p>Our affairs wear a moſt gloomy aſpect at this time, ſo gloomy, that the hearts of many begin to tremble for the fate of our little army and of North America!

Shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he keepeth the enemy in play at Trenton, until evening, and whilſt they imagined his troops were ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the country, he marches them to Princeton, under cover of night, and defeateth the wing of their army there, the next morning, before the other wing could a rive from Trenton to their relief Without loſs of time he marcheth for and takes poſſeſſion of the heights of Morris, whilſt the vanquiſhed and diſappointed Britons haſte, in great conſternation, for head quarters at Brunſwic, fired upon and galled by our militia in the way.

When the prudent and brave general Greene ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to take the command of the ſouthern army, his regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar troops were few, the army of the enemy ſtrong, and fluſhed with victory, the diſſaffected to the American cauſe numerous and violent, and the friends to it grievouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by many calamities. No place or time, ſince the commencement of the war, opened ſo great a ſcene of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction as this, or more fully manifeſted the true ſpirit of valour, of patriotiſm, and of piety. The intrepidity and reſolution of our troops to encounter dangers and bear their fatigues, the courage and perſeverance of patriots under their diſtreſſes, and the hopes of good people, can ſcarcely be equalled. A gracious God rewarded their virtue! When their night is at the darkeſt, ſome morning rays beam upon them with comfort and hope. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a large detachment of the enemy at King's Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain, and the complete defeat of another large party at Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, each much ſuperior in number to our troops who engaged them, open a wide door of relief to the diſtreſſed inhabitants, and pave the way to all the following ſucceſſes of our arms in the ſouth. The gallantry of thoſe actions cannot be fully deſcribed, and their ſalutary effects were as great as the actions themſelves were glorious The ſtroke was followed up at Guilford, where the loſs of the enemy was very conſiderable. Not to mention the gallantry and ſucceſs of ſmaller parties during this long campaign, I ſhall only obſerve, that the death and captivity of more than eleven hundred of the Britiſh forces at Eutaw Springs, added the greateſt laurels to the worthy general Greene, and the corps he commanded.</p>
            <p>This ſucceſsful campaign was gloriouſly crowned by the capture of lord Cornwallis, with his whole army, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of above ſix thouſand regular forces, and ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his black aids and Refugees, on the memorable 19th of laſt October. The wiſdom with which the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to York was planned by his excellency general

Waſhington, in concert with count de Rochambeau, and the diſpatch with which the plan was executed, as well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the generals to be poſſeſſed of the fineſt military ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, as the ſpecial care of providence for our ſalvation. It muſt appear obvious to all who will open their eyes to ſee, that all the circumſtances concurring to bring to paſs the great event, clearly diſplay the peculiar concern of heaven in it. A ſeries of the moſt delightful weather bleſſed our troops, from the beginning of their march until the concluſion of the important ſcene. The fleet and army appear before York in the ſame hour. And HE who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the winds, and the ſea, and they obey him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and they bring both the French fleets into the bay at the ſame time. Again he commands, and they fight againſt lord Cornwallis, throwing his troops back into their old priſon, when they vainly attempted to effect an eſcape. No avenue of eſcape remains for him. The fleet of count de Graſſe renders it impoſſible by ſea—the poſition of the allied army wholly prevents it by land. The only alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive left for him is, to fight or ſurrender. Fight his way he could not—ſurrender he muſt.</p>
            <p>Nor may it paſs unnoticed, how the furious general is ſuffered to drive on to his own ruin, and the ruin of the king's troops. Separating his army after the action of Guilford, he leaves part of them a prey to our brave ſouthern troops, and, by forced marches, penetrates far into the ſtate of Virginia, with the reſt, plundering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying private property as he went; until a check being put to his mad career by the brave marquis la Fayette and general Wayne, he puſheth for, and cloſeth himſelf in the ſpot, the fitteſt he could chooſe for his own trap. And what has this courſer obtained by all his violent deeds?— captivity, with the character of plunderer, robber, and murderer of mankind. That righteous judgment long ſince denounced againſt men of his character, hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken him; <q>Evil ſhall hunt the violent man to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him.<note n="§" place="bottom">

            <p n="7">VII. Several incidents interſperſed through the ſcene, which were overruled, by a wiſe providence, in our favour, though at firſt many of them might ſeem to ſtand much againſt us, equally ſtain the pride of man, and merit the moſt ſenſible returns of praiſe. Our own miſtakes and the miſtakes of the enemy were the cauſes of many preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; yet were greatly ſubſervient to our general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The wiſdom of God brought good out of evil to us, and turned our judgments into mercies. The pride and ſelf intereſt of their generals, united with the folly of the Britiſh councils, operated much in favour of the American cauſe. By ſeparating their army they obliged us to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ours; by which means our militia are, on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, much more ſerviceable to us than they could have been, had they been called to aſſiſt againſt the whole united force of the enemy. By bribes, and employing their ſpies, they parted with their money without obtaining their object, and with ſome of their beſt men for ſome of the moſt infamous wretches upon earth. The ſalvation of our beloved general and his army from Arnold's helliſh plot, and all the coincident providences relating thereto, deſerve to be wrote with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond. I might mention their folly and our advantage, ſeveral ways, in the capture of 'Statia, and attacking us on the ſtrongeſt ſide at firſt, and afterwards on the weakeſt, when the ſtates were alarmed and prepared for war. But
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017722_0013_0FA262ACA3328368"/>
paſſing over thoſe and ſundry other incidents, I ſhall only obſerve,</p>
            <p>That the plan of terror, upon which they proceeded againſt us, was a miſtake the moſt fatal to themſelves, and moſt ſubſervient to our cauſe. Their cruelties, inſolence and breach of promiſe were the ſprings of many preſent ſufferings to individuals; but nothing could have a greater tendency to overthow their own deſign. They rouſe the reſentment of the ſtates, conſolidate their confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and arm them with reſolution to defend themſelves to the laſt extremity. They fix an indelible ſtain upon the Britiſh court and officers—They draw forth the pity of other nations towards us, and excite their abhorrence of thoſe hypocrites, who with the mouth of the lamb talk of mercy, but tear the prey with the teeth of the lion.</p>
            <p>In this they have diſcovered the true ſpirit of tyranny, which is cruelty and blood when artifice fails. <note n="*" place="bottom">In cruelty their conduct is uniform, whenever they blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe it makes for their purpoſe. Lord Clive received the thanks of parliament for ſhooting down thouſands of the unhappy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

One of their own celebrated writers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids them for giving countenance to ſuch an act of barbarity, telling them, it has driven away more from their intereſt in the eaſt, than the whole inhabitants of North America. For this and many other inſtances of their cruelty and injuſtice, the Lord may now be taking vengeance of them by the deſtruction of their trade in India, and lopping off America from their empire.</note> And in this they have openly expoſed their ignorance as well of the word and providence of God, as of the cauſes of the riſe and fall of nations, and of the operations of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf. Had theſe infidels attended duly to thoſe means of inſtruction, as the rulers of a nation ought to do they would have known, that there is a cup of red wine in the hand of God for nations that perſiſt in luxury, inſolence, pride, tyranny and brutal luſts; eſpecially for thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in acts of cruelty againſt their brethren, or any in their

            <p>The lengthening out the war, as well as the cruelty of the enemy was grievous on many accounts; yet, on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accounts neceſſary for us. It was neceſſary to ſuppreſs the luxuriance of all the ſtates, and give them more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and humbling inſtructions. It was neceſſary to make more full diſcoveries of falſe hearted men, and purge our land of many traitors. And it was neceſſary to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our enemies more effectually, and make the Britiſh

court plunge themſelves into ſtill deeper ruins. Our troops, weak as they were, compared with the enemy, had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a fair proſpect of ſtriking them a fatal blow, and bringing the war to a ſpeedy criſis; but were as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented by ſome unforeſeen incidents.

            <p>Our own miſtakes, as well as thoſe of the enemy, added much to our affliction; yet were they overruled by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious providence for our good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the non importation agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not raiſing a ſufficient army to ſerve during the war, inſtead of producing the ſalutary effects expected from them, ſubjected our army to many difficulties, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the burdens of the people. Yet by the former a ſpirit of induſtry was promoted, and military ſkill by the latter, each of which are exceedingly uſeful for a young nation. Theſe united, are a ſtrong proof of our ſimple honeſty, and ſerve to convince the world that independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017722_0014_0FA262AD5C895410"/>
was not our aim, till we were forced into the meaſure.</p>
            <p>By far the moſt hurtful of all our miſtakes reſpected our bills of credit, the management of which, from firſt to laſt, together with the conſequences thereof, afford many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as well political as moral, and lay a ground for much humiliation. It is certain that it fell as a heavy ſtroke upon multitudes of the honeſt, and many of them the moſt helpleſs part of the community, ſuch as widows, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, annuitants, weakly and aged perſons, with others who lived on the intereſt of their money, &amp;c</p>
            <p>It gave the deepeſt ſtab to public credit, which ought ever to be preſerved inviolate for the peace and proſperity of a nation. It greatly affected our public funds and ſeminaries, to the no ſmall injury of the nation; and would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved our army, had it not been for their own inimitable virtue. It was the greateſt incitement to gaming and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and opened the wideſt door to fraud and injuſtice, which had a moſt pernicious influence on the morals of the people.</p>
            <p>For theſe, with other reaſons, I cannot but look upon our conduct, with regard to the currency, as involving much national guilt, which undoubtedly requireth much national humiliation.</p>
            <p>The facts are ſo notorious, that they cannot be hid, how willing ſo ever we might be to draw an external veil over them, if we could, and could do it conſiſtently with duty. Sorry am I to ſay any thing which might damp the joys of this day; but in our guilty world we muſt often mingle tears with our joys. This day, my brethren, we are called to rejoice; but let us "rejoice with trembling;"<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm <hi>2.11.</hi>

            <p>We ought to rejoice, that the idol to which many paid their devotion, is thrown down; for, in its operation upon their minds and practices, it afforded the fulleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the truth of that inſpired ſentence, <q>The love of money is the root of all evil.</q>

There is every reaſon to conclude, from the teſtimony of their own ableſt writers, and many undeniable facts, that their ſovereign, their court, and their nobility, are more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated and debauched than any in Europe, notwithſtanding their ſuperior advantages for knowledge and virtue. But God as is his uſual way with young nations, has treated, and he will treat us, as we do our children. We correct them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet nurſe and raiſe them up to maturity.

You know I have frequently told you it was my opinion, that Britain would proceed to the utmoſt ſtretch of her power, and that I ſhould not at all be diſappointed to hear of the enemy's poſſeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all our chief towns, and making the principal ports in all the ſtates feel, for a time, the effects of their barbarity. I ſaw a great revolution was about to take place; I therefore expected a great conflict: for no great things were ever done, or great events brought to paſs, without a great ſtruggle for them. It is uniformly the conduct of divine providence, as well to nations as to

individuals, to lay them low in order to raiſe them high, God chooſes his people's extremity as his opportunity to grant them relief, to teach them that his own arm works their ſalvation, and cut off all ground of boaſting from the creature. A notable inſtance of this we have at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Iſrael into the promiſed land. Jericho fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſtroke of a ſword; yet were they chaſed and ſmitten down by the men of the next city they approached. A moſt diſcouraging circumſtance to thoſe who had many ſtrong nations to encounter. When they had purged out the accurſed thing from among them, they eaſily obtain a complete victory in their next attack; and God gives them the troubled, but rich valley of Achor, as a ſure pledge of all their future victories, and quiet poſſeſſion of the promiſed reſt. In alluſion to this is that encouraging promiſe to his diſtreſſed people, when afflicted and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the nations: <q>I will allure her and bring her into the wilderneſs, and ſpeak comfortably unto her. And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. And ſhe ſhall ſing there as in the days of her youth, as in the days when ſhe came up out of the land Egypt.</q>

            <p>Thus did God deal with us: After we had been brought exceeding low, he granted ſucceſs to our arms, firſt in New Jerſey, and afterwards in the Carolinas, in a manner ſo remarkable, as to be a pledge of our ſucceeding victories, and of the glorious proſpects of years and ages to come!

            <p n="9">IX. From the preceding arguments, I hope, it will eaſily appear to every one who is willing to ſee, how ſtrong and numerous are the obligations upon all the ſtates to unite in praiſe to our God. His favours to the whole are great and marvellous; and our returns of gratitude ſhould be hearty and unanimous. It has been the practice of good people, in all ages, to aſſemble together for humiliation, or praiſe, as the providence of God might require. <note n="§" place="bottom">It ought to be one of our notes of praiſe this day, that God has put it into the hearts of our worthy Congreſs to take notice of the propriety of this, and recommend to the ſtates to obey the voice of providence by humiliation, or thankſgiving, as it might ſpeak to us in judgment, or mercy. Thus did the pious rulers of the Jews as well as the prophets; and we ought to follow the footſteps of the flock. They had ſundry public days of thankſgiving for public mercies, and of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation for public judgments. They obſerved four public faſts in the year, during their ſeventy years captivity, as appears from the ſeventh and eighth chapters of <hi>Zechariah.</hi> The ſpirit of the duty was indeed neglected by the body of that nation, who, by perſiſting in their ſins, made their hearts as an adamant ſtone, as I fear is the caſe with a great majority amongſt us. Yet were the duties of ſpecial uſe to them, as I hope they have been to us, as they aſſiſted good people, and done public honour to their God, unto whom their prayers and praiſes aſcended as precious odours, being perfumed with the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. The humiliation and faithful prayers of a ſelect few, rather than a general reformation, was the firſt means of the deliverance of the Jews, as I believe they have been and will be means of ours.</note> When

They deſerve not a name among chriſtians of any name, be their profeſſion what it may, nor even among rational creatures.

            <p>Our reaſons for praiſe are great and many, and ſorry I am, that there ſhould be any diſſonant chords to marr the harmony. But this muſt be expected, while ſin is ſin, and prevails in our guilty world. Thoſe will not unite in the exalted duties of this day, whoſe tempers are aſſimilated to the tyrants themſelves, and ſecretly wiſh for the ſucceſs of their arms. Nor thoſe who pour out imprecations on Congreſs, governors, aſſemblies, and councils, becauſe the hopes of their gains in ſeeking the vitals of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are over. And their notes are moſt unſuitable to the ſweet exerciſes of praiſe, who like the unbelieving Iſraelites in the wilderneſs, continually murmur at the ſtate of our affairs, and diſtruſt the ſalvation of God; inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting for their ſins, and impreſſing their hearts with the glory of the divine government, and the many undeſerved favours of heaven to us. As unſuitable to unite with the pure choir of ſingers are they, who only expreſs their joys in Bacchanalian routs, mingling their notes with the ſongs of drunkards. <q>Wo unto them—the harp and the viol, the tabret and the pipe, and wine are in their feaſts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the operation of his hands.</q>

            <p>But although the baſe tribe now mentioned, and thoſe of ſimilar characters, will not praiſe the Lord; yet a goodly number in all the ſtates will, and I rejoice that they have ſo glorious a call to the duty. Pious perſons will try to enter into the ſpirit of praiſe; for grace has implanted in their hearts the pureſt principles of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm and of gratitude. The virtuous, who have engaged in the cauſe of their country from principle, though they be not pious, will attempt the duty from the common ſentiments of gratitude; which, as well as common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, are very neceſſary and uſeful, as means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move outward judgments from a nation, and obtain for them the common favours of providence.</p>
            <p>My brethren, let me beſeech your moſt pious attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the things you have heard, and to frame your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct accordingly.

Our ſinning with an high hand under abounding judgments, and our ingratitude under abounding mercies, are very humbling conſiderations. But although we have many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and marvellous mercies to praiſe God for, and have the ſtrongeſt grounds of hope for a large addition to them; yet let us not be high minded, but fear. If we ſhall drop into a political ſleep, or political diſtractions, and not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improve the advantages granted to us; or if we ſhall perſiſt in our ſins, notwithſtanding all our calls to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, our calamities may be renewed and prolonged. Iſrael ſpent forty tedious years in the wilderneſs for their provocations, before they attained to the promiſed reſt, which was a journey but of a few days.
