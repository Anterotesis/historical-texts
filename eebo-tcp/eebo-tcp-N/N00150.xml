            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now this may be done by shewing, what was the judgement of the <hi>first Fathers</hi> of this Country, touching the questions in Controversy. And in this ensuing <hi>Collection of Testimonies</hi> we shall not mention any of those Reverend Elders that are yet surviving, nor all amongst our deceased worthies, only some of <hi>the Chief of the Fathers</hi> of this Country.</p>
            <p>And first, <hi>concerning Baptism,</hi> we shall begin with the Judgement of that man of God deservedly famous in both <hi>Englande,</hi> viz. Mr. <hi>Iohn Cotton,</hi> late Teacher of the first Church in <hi>Boston.</hi> And what the Apprehension of that <hi>Seer</hi> was, is manifest from a Letter which is to be seen written with his own hands in the name, and with the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Consent of the whole Church, which then was in this <hi>Boston</hi> to the Church in <hi>Dorchester.</hi> Because the Letter is of Ancient date, and so giveth a great light towards the clearing of the matter, which is before us, we shall therefore here insert it, word for word as it is written with Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> own hand, It is that which followeth.</p>

                  <p>The Case of Conscience which you propounded to our Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, [to wit, whether a Grand-Father being a member of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, might claim Baptism to his Grand-Child, whose next Parents be not received into Church Covenant] ha's been delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately treated of in our Church Assembled together publickly in the name of Christ. And <hi>upon due and serious discourse about the point, it seemed good unto us all with one accord,</hi> and agreeable (as we believe) to the word of the Lord, that the Grand-Father may lawfully claim that priviledge to his Grand-child in such a Case, yet with these two Cautions. First, that the Grand-child baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not thereby take oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>asion to neglect the due and seasonable prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themselves for entrance into Covenant with God and his Church: these Cautions premised and observed, the Baptisme of the Grand-child by right of his Grand-fathers Covenant, we believe to be warranted from the nature and tenour of the Covenant of Grace by this Reason, where there is a Stipulation of the Covenant on Gods part, and restipulation of the Covenant on mans part, there may be an obsignation of the Covenant on both parts, or in plainer words, where there is an offer of the Covenant on Gods part, and a receiving and undertaking of the Covenant on mans part, there may be a sealing of it on both parts? But here is an offer of the Covenant on Gods part, <hi>Gen. 17.7.</hi> where God says, that he will be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, to the Believer and his Seed, and by Seed is not there meant the next Seed only, but Seeds Seed also to many Generations, <hi>Isai. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>9.21.</hi> And here is likewise a receiving and undertaking of the Covenant on mans part, seeing the Grand-father receiveth the Covenant by his faith, and by the profession of his faith, and by his desire of the Seal of the Covenant to strengthen his faith, and he unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>keth also the keeping of the Covenant, in bringing up his Grand-child as much as in him lies to live and walk as himself does, as one of Gods people, according to the Tenour of the Covenant, from whence the Conclusion evidently followeth, that therefore Baptisme may there be Administred to Seal up the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, where the Grand-father receives the Covenant, &amp; undertakes to bring up his Grand-child in the faith and obedience of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Against this Argument it was objected by some what the Apostle writes, <hi>1 Cor. 7.14.</hi> where if both the husband and the wife, who are the next Parents of the Child be unbelieving, the Child is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unclean, and therefore uncapable of the holy Covenant, and of the holy Seal of it, whereto it was answered that the word in the Text translated <hi>unbelieving</hi> is in the Original <hi>Infidel.</hi> Now <hi>there is a difference between an Infidel and a Carnal Christian, as then was amongst the Iews a difference between an Heathen and a Carnal Israelite.</hi> Though the Child be unclean where both the Parents are Pagans and Infidels, yet <hi>we may not account such Parents for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Infidels, who are themselves baptized, and profess their belief of the Fundamental Articles of the Christian Faith, and live without notorious Scandalous Crime, though they give not clear evidence of their regenerate estate,</hi> nor are convinced of the necessity of Church Covenant. After this Answer given, there was no farther reply
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000208_0011_0FA3164785A95B28"/>
against the point in hand, but on the contrary, some of the Brethren expressing their Consents with Addition of other Reasons, and all of them by their silence, <hi>we do therefore profess it to be the judgement of our Church,</hi> and as we believ agreeable to the word of God (such Cautions being observed as hath been mentioned) <hi>that the Grand-Father a member of the Church, may claim the priviledge of Baptisme to his Grand-Child, though his next Seed the Parents of the Child be not received themselves into Church Covenant.</hi> Wherein nevertheless we desire, so to be understood, not as presuming to judge others, who happily may be of different opinion in this point, or to direct you, who are by the grace of God given to you, able to direct your selves and us also in the Lord, but as willing in meekness of wisdome to search out the truth of God with you, and in brotherly Love to satisfy your request and demand touching this Question.</p>
                  <p>Now the God of truth and peace Lead you into all truth, and go on to build up his holy Kingdome in the midst of you in the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Administration of all his holy Ordinances amongst you in the Lord Jesus, In whom we rest.</p>

               </gap>uitable to that practice many years before his decease, appears from a Letter of his written to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Mather of Dorchester,</hi> and bearing date <hi>Iune 6. 1650.</hi> In which Letter he thus expresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<q>I <hi>Conceive,</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Stone</hi>) that Children of <hi>Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> have right to <hi>Church membership</hi> by virtue of their <hi>Fathers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> it being granted that they are in <hi>Abrahams Covenant,</hi> they have <hi>Membership by Birth,</hi> Gal. 2.15.

Hence,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1. If they be presented to a Church, and Claim their Interest, they cannot be denyed, according to the Rules of the Gospel:</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. Hence there hath been a sinful neglect in <hi>New-England</hi> of such Children who have either not been presented, or not Received, when they have claimed their right. I spake with Mr. <hi>Warham,</hi> and we question not the right of Children, but we Conceive it would be Comfortable to have some Concurrence, which is that we have waited for a Long Time. And I think unless there may be some Conference of Elders this year in the <hi>Bay</hi> about it, that we may see some Reason to the Contrary, our Churches will Adventure to practice according to their Judgement, <hi>i. e.</hi> take in all such Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as members, <hi>I</hi> much desire that there may be some meeting of the Elders this year, that these things may be Considered and setled in the Churches, according to the mind of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
These things do sufficiently manifest what was the Judgement of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> who all three (as was Intimated) Came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>New-England</hi> in the same Vessel, <hi>Anno 1633.</hi> And they may justly be reckoned amongst <hi>the first three</hi> of <hi>New-Englands Worthies.</hi>

               <hi>Baptisme,</hi> in his last years only, but that he was of the same Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment four and twenty years and more, before his decease, is evident from some <hi>Manuscripts</hi> of his left written with his own hand. For that <hi>Roverend Author</hi> did in the year 1645, prepare for the Press an <hi>elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate discourse</hi> which he entituleth, <hi>A plea for the Churches of Christ in</hi> New-England, and in the second part of that discourse, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>positive grounds from Scripture and Reason for the Iustification of the way of the Churches of Christ in</hi> New-England, there is this Question propounded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Quest. When those that were baptized in Infancy by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of their Parents being come to Age, are not yet found fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the Lords Table, although they be married and have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whether are those their Children to be baptized or no. The Answer is in these words, I propound to Consideration this Reason for the <hi>Affirmative, viz.</hi> That the Children of such Parents ought to be baptized: the Reason is, the Parents as they were born in the Covenant, so they still continue therein, being neither cast out, nor deserving so to be, and if so, why should not their Children be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, for if the Parents be in Covenant, are not the Children so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is not the Text plain? <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>the promise is to you and to your Children.</hi> And if these Children be in the Covenant, why should they no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be admitted to the Seal of the Covenant, Sith they are partakers of that, which is one main ground, why other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are admitted thereto? doth it not seem unreasonable that these Infants being partakers of the ground of Baptisme as well as others, that nevertheless others should be admitted and these be refused? If other Infants were admitted to Baptisme upon some ground, whereof these were not partakers, then there might be Reason to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these Infants and others, but if the ground &amp; Reason of admitting others, be Common to these as well as to others, it seems then to be Reasonable, that these as well as others should share in the priviledge. If their Parents were cast out of the Church by Censures, or fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> away from the same by <hi>wilful Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Schisme,</hi> or deserving to be Cast out by reason of <hi>Scandal,</hi> then there were more Reason that their Infants should be excluded from the Seal: But sith no such thing can be said of the Parents of whom we speak, a good Reason should be given, why their Infants are debarred? for if it be said the Parents are not <hi>Confirmed members,</hi> nor have yet been found fit for the Lords Table, I conceive this needs not to hinder
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000208_0018_0FA3164D84F86A48"/>
their Infants from <hi>Baptisme</hi> so long as they, I mean the Parents do neither renounce the Covenant, nor doth the Church see just Cause to Cast them out from the same: for it is not the Parents fitness for the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> that is the ground of baptizing their Children, but the Parents and so their Children being in the Covenant, this is that which is the main ground thereof; and as long as this doth Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, not dissolved by any <hi>Church Censure</hi> against them, nor by any <hi>Scandalous Sin</hi> of theirs, so long the Children may be baptized.</q>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Because these Apprehensions are no way contrary to one another, nor at all Inconsistent</hi>: For if a man say, that the Children last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned may be baptized, this does not at all infer, that men of years converted to the <hi>Faith,</hi> and Joyned to the <hi>Church,</hi> may not be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, nor that such Infants may not be baptized, whose Parents, one, or both, are so Converted and joyned, Nor if a man Answer that such as the Catechisme speaks of may be baptized, does this infer, that those others may not, there is no Colour sure, no just ground for such Consequence, no more then if one should say, that such as are become Believers by hearing the Word preached are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, (which is a very Truth, <hi>Act. 2.41</hi> and <hi>8.12, 37.</hi> and <hi>18 8.</hi>) it could thence be proved, that no Infants are to be baptized, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become Believers, at least not by that means of hearing, preaching, this would in no sort follow from the other, as if one should say, that such as do the will of God upon Earth shall enter into Heaven, &amp; that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000208_0020_0FA3164F059E3798"/>
such as <hi>feed Christ when hungry, cloath him being naked</hi>; shall be saved in Heaven, which are very true, <hi>Matth. 7.21.</hi> and <hi>25 34,</hi> &amp;c. doth this prove that <hi>Little Infants,</hi> and the <hi>Thief</hi> upon the <hi>Cross</hi> must not be saved, because the one through <hi>Imbecillity</hi> of Age, and the other through want of opportunity, did not perform the things mentioned, it doth not prove it at all, but that Salvation in Heaven may be the Portion of these as well as of the others; even so though such as the Catechisme speaks of, are to be baptized, it doth not thence follow, but that the Ordinance may be dispensed, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of such members Children as are mentioned, and though it be dispensed to such, this is no denyal but that such as the late Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme speaks of, may be baptized, so that here is no Contradiction between the things Alledged, but that both may be true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist together.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> If the words in the Catechisme had any <hi>Exclusive parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> in them, there had been some more ground or Colour for the Inference; as if the words had been thus, <hi>only</hi> these, or <hi>none</hi> but these are to be baptized? but any such <hi>Exclusive</hi> or <hi>Negative par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> there is none, and therefore the Collection or Inference from them which is made is groundless.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> The Author of the aforesaid Catechisme which was printed in the year <hi>1650.</hi> had sundry Times before in the years <hi>1646. 1648. 1649.</hi> publickly delivered his Judgement, both by word of mouth, and by writing that such Children of Church members might have their Infants baptized, though themselves were not yet received to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> and so divers Times again in the years follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore it is not probable, that what is expressed in the said <hi>Catechisme</hi> should be intended by him to have such a meaning as is quite Contrary to what himself had publickly Delivered both before, and after, and that at sundry Times, and in several wayes.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>ly. Other Authors of much worth for holiness and Learning, who never meant to deny Baptisme to such Children of Church members as are spoken of,</hi> yet in Answer to that Question, who ought to be baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5 <hi>ly.</hi> If the Parents spoken of may notwithstanding their <hi>unfitness</hi> for that <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> yet be truly said to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith,</hi> and <hi>joyned to the Church,</hi> then the appearance of Contradiction is at an end. Now for the one of these <hi>Qualifications,</hi> viz. That they be <hi>Converted to the Faith,</hi> if <hi>Faith</hi> be taken as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is for the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> as <hi>Act. 6.7.

And does not this imply some <hi>beginning of Faith</hi>? Can persons have all these <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and yet for all this be <hi>utterly destitute</hi> of <hi>the grace of Faith</hi>? It seems not suitable to <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in as much as men have neither <hi>Faith,</hi> nor any thing that good is by Nature, therefore they that have it may be said to be <hi>converted to it,</hi> and so the <hi>Parents,</hi> the <hi>baptizing</hi> of whose Children is in Question, are not without the one of the <hi>Qualifications</hi> mentioned in the Catechisme, <hi>viz.</hi> of being <hi>Converted to the Faith.</hi> And for the other, <hi>viz.</hi> of being joyned to the Church, this cannot be denyed touching these Parents, for as much, as by means of the Covenant, which takes in Parents and Children, they have been either born in the Church, or taken in, in

their Infancy, and so they were joyned to the Church, If so, they continue still, being neither Cast out, nor deserving so to be, and therefore their Infants are the Children of Parents joyned to the Church. And lest it should be said, that though they were in the Church in their Infancy and <hi>minority,</hi> yet now being <hi>Adult,</hi> they fall out, or go out by their own <hi>default,</hi> in neglecting the duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the <hi>Adult,</hi> therefore for the preventing of this, it is here said, that they solemnly owned the Covenant before the Church, and therein give up themselves and their Children to the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that here is a personal and publick act of their own, in respect of the Covenant, and giving up themselves and their Children to the Lord, by their own act, with a Subjection of themselves to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ</hi> in his Church, whereby it appears that as these Parents were in the Church in their <hi>minority,</hi> and were never since Cast out, so neither are they fallen out by their own neglect; But do manifest their Continuance in the Church, and in the Covenant by their own personal act. And so the other <hi>Qualification</hi> of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whose Children are to be <hi>baptized,</hi> which the Catechisme mentioned, is found in the Parents spoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are persons joyned to the Church, and therefore he that affirms tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the Summe of what he hath now written, he then expressed and told me withal, that if a Case should be presented to the Church, in any other way by the Brethren he would refuse to act in it, unless the Church would first dispute the point which he would offer, but act against his Judgement he would not, It's true that the Rule requires to tell the Church in due order by the Officers, as he that Commands one to goe into his house, intends that he should go in by the door.</p>

            <p>Unto these might have been added the <hi>Testimony</hi> of that <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>faithful Servants</hi> of Christ Mr. <hi>Iohn Wilson,</hi> the first Pastor of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000208_0034_0FA3165987187B88"/>
first Church in <hi>Boston.</hi> But his Judgement touching the question in hand is known to all that knew him. And the Reader is referred to his <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Speeches,</hi> concerning this matter which are inserted in the Book called <hi>New Englands memorial. (pag. 183.184.)</hi> which because they were amongst <hi>the last words</hi> of so holy a man, cannot without great sin be <hi>despised</hi> or <hi>disregarded.</hi> Also we might have mentioned the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Reverend</hi> Mr. <hi>Norris</hi>; which that it did Concur with what hath been expressed, is to be seen from the <hi>Records</hi> of the Church in <hi>Salem,</hi> viz. in their <hi>Records</hi> of the 24<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>first Moneth</hi>: And of the <hi>9th.</hi> of the <hi>fifth Moneth</hi> and <hi>sixth Moneth, Anno 1654.</hi> Likewise we might have produced the Judgement of Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> sometimes the <hi>faithful Pastor</hi> of the Church in <hi>Watertown,</hi> but the Reader is for that referred to the Preface in the <hi>Synod Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also that some <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>Iudicious</hi> of the <hi>Congregational way</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> are for a <hi>greater Latitude</hi> in the point of Baptisme, then our <hi>dissenting Antisynodalian Brethren</hi> do acknowledge, is manifest from what <hi>sundry Learned men</hi> of that <hi>way</hi> have long since published. For Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> in his review of <hi>Schisme, pag 134</hi> thus expresses himself,
<q>I am so far from confining Baptisme <hi>subjectively</hi> to a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation,</hi> that I do not believe that any m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Likewise Doctor <hi>Nathaniel Homes</hi> in his defence of <hi>Infant Baptisme</hi> against Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> ha's these words, <hi>(pag. 193.)</hi>
               <q>for baptizing of Believers Infants, several Churches of us do hold, that we may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, though neither of their Parents be of our <hi>particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> Baptisme as we conceive being an <hi>Admission</hi> into the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal visible Church,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
And again, (<hi>pag. 217.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> having made this Objection,
<q>that the baptizing of Infants ha's occasioned an unnecessary dispute about baptizing the Infants of believing Parents, that are not members of <hi>gathered Churches.</hi> I never (saith Doctor <hi>Homes</hi>) perceived the world troubled with this dispute, divers Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches without dispute can practice the baptizing of such, &amp;c.</q>
Thus he. See also in the same Book, <hi>207, 208, 215.</hi> with his Epistle to the Reader. And the Collector of these Testimonies hath lately received Letters from <hi>su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

according to what hath been now expressed. By these things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which have been thus far expressed, it is very manifest that the doctrine of the late Synod concerning the Subject of Baptisme is no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy from the <hi>first Principles of</hi> New-England, <hi>nor yet any declension from the Congregational way.</hi> It remaineth that we proceed to the other Question about <hi>Communion and Consocia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> heart was much upon this thing, in his latter time; foreseeing that without it, these Churches and the <hi>Congregational way</hi> could not stand; He did therefore not long before his decease, draw up some <hi>Propositions</hi> which are expressive of the way and manner of this <hi>Consociation</hi> pleaded for, which because they are (as being written by his hand, they cannot but be) of great weight and worth, we shall therefore here insert and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them.</p>

<q>Churches being <hi>gathered</hi> and <hi>setled</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mind of Christ, ought to preserve a <hi>mutual holy Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> amongst themselves, and to exercise it in the discharge of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby their <hi>mutual good</hi> and <hi>Edification</hi> may be <hi>promoted.</hi> In desiring or making use of the Counsel and advice of one another in such Cases of doubt and difficulty, whether <hi>Doctrinal</hi> or <hi>practical,</hi> as may arise in any of them, <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 15.2, 6.</hi> And from hence it follows, that in Case any Church either by error in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>praecipitation,</hi> or mistake in other <hi>Administrations,</hi> do give offence unto other Churches, those other Churches may require an account from them, admonish them of their faults, and withhold <hi>Communion</hi> from them, in Case they persist in the error of their way, and that because in their difficulties, and before their <hi>miscarriages,</hi> they were bound to have desired the advice, Counsel, and Assistance of those other Churches, which being neglected by them; the other are to recover the end of it unto their <hi>utmost ability, Gal. 2.6, 11.</hi> And hence also it follows, that those that are rightly and <hi>justly Censured</hi> in any Church ought to be rejected by all Churches what ever, both because of their <hi>mutual Communion,</hi> and because it is, and ought to be presumed, until the contrary be made to appear, that in Case there had been any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or doubt in the proceedure of the Church, they would have taken the advice of those Churches, with whom they were obliged to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult.</q>
