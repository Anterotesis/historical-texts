            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>WHEN I reflect on the reciprocal benefits of civil ſociety, I conſider myſelf as one of a ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who are embarked together, and have to ſtruggle with the difficulties and dangers of a boiſterous element, where individual ſafety is abſorbed in that of the whole, and each one, by contributing to the ſecurity of the whole, is ſerving himſelf; and tho' all cannot have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the helm, yet, being ſo nearly intereſted, every one has a right to keep a look-out, and, if he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends danger, give the alarm, which to neglect might be a criminal omiſſion; and ſhould his fears appear not equally important to others, his motive being good, ought to ſecure him from cenſure. This may apologize for my ſolicitude for the common ſafety, when I behold the ſupineneſs and inattention of thoſe appointed to the watch.</p>
            <p>Phyſicians, in judging of the health of a human body, examine ſymptoms, ſome they deem mortal, others dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, &amp;c. If we take the ſame method to judge of the vigor and health of government, I know of no ſymptom more juſtly alarming, than a general ſlight and diſregard to good and wholeſome laws. That this is too much the caſe at preſent in New-Jerſey admits of no diſpute. Laws calculated to guard the manners and morals of the people; to check vice, and encourage and promote induſtry and frugality, the ſtrongeſt ſinews of independence, and trueſt riches of a ſtate or nation; when ſuch laws are treated as objects of trivial moment, and not worthy the ſerious notice of the Executive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it certainly denotes a great depravity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. To ſhew that this is really our preſent ſituation is the intention of the enſuing pages, wherein I ſhall make
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018458_0004_0FA76E2EAB6FE750"/>extracts from ſome of our laws, with remarks thereon, for the inſpection of ſuch of my fellow-citizens who may not ſo fully have conſidered the power which every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man has of lending a hand to ſuppreſs vice. In doing of this, if any thing I ſay ſhould appear harſh or ſevere, I may declare once for all, that I deſire to give no juſt offence to any, my motive is upright and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, at which virtue and worth can never be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as for thoſe of a contrary caſt, their obloquy is praiſe.

               </note> I am enough acquainted with the world, to know that honeſt truths too often offend ears accuſtomed to adulation; neither is phyſic grateful to the diſordered ſtomach; but this was never thought a ſufficient reaſon for ſuppreſſing the one, or neglecting to adminiſter the other, for the real advancement of health and happineſs.</p>
            <p>There are two laws in this ſtate for the regulating of taverns, &amp;c. The firſt was paſſed in 1738, the other in 1768. The preamble to one ſays, <hi>The vices ſo much practiſed in them were to the great ſcandal of religion, the diſhonor of</hi> GOD, <hi>and impoveriſhing of the commonwealth.</hi> That to the other gives the reaſon for paſſing it, i. e. <hi>More effectually to prevent taverns from being perverted to places of gaming, tippling, drunkenneſs, revelling, extortion, and other vices.</hi> Here we diſcover the ſenſe the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had of the conduct common in taverns when theſe laws were paſſed, and the neceſſity they ſaw of providing a remedy. In doing of this, they give the Juſtices in their ſeſſions as full and ample a power as words can well expreſs—Licences muſt be renewed every year, and are in the diſcretion of the Juſtices either to grant or refuſe, with this reſtriction, that they ſhall not grant a licence to any perſon but what comes to them well recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being of good repute for honeſty and temperance. Nevertheleſs it is a conſtant complaint throughout the ſtate, that hardly any one ever applies, however bad their character, but they obtain a licence. It may be ſaid, they come recommended, and that is the guide to the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018458_0005_0FA76E3072793808"/>Court. Will that excuſe for ſinning againſt knowledge? But the truth is, hardly any good law was ever ſo trifled with, or tortured, to evade the true intent and meaning of it, as this. It requires a recommendation, ſigned by at leaſt ſix freeholders of the neighbourhood where the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern is to be kept; inſtead of this, tavernkeepers will ſign each others recommendation, be each others ſecurity, &amp;c. and ſuch who cannot get a reputable neighbour to ſign, will pick up any they can, and ſometimes from the remoteſt parts of the county. Thus is the ſecurity the law provides againſt perſons of bad fame rendered a mere farce and mockery, and this in open Court, in the face of the county, thereby teaching the common people to evade and trifle with the ſolemnity of laws, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring on all occaſions to inculcate a reverence for, and religious obedience to them. To enable my readers to judge for themſelves, here follows extracts from thoſe laws, whereby they may compare the preſent mode of executing them with their true intent and meaning, and then ſeriouſly reflect where ſuch a perverſion of law muſt lead.</p>

And whereas it has been too often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, to the great grief and concern of all ſober and well diſpoſed perſons, that many of the inhabitants of this province, of mean and low fortunes, do make it their conſtant practice to frequent taverns, and there ſpend much of their time and ſubſtance in gaming, tippling, and often drinking to exceſs, to the great damage, affliction and diſtreſs of their poor families, and deſtruction of themſelves: Therefore be it enacted by the authority aforeſaid, That, after this act ſhall take place, if any tavernkeeper ſhall ſuffer any perſon or perſons to ſpend his or their time in an idle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at his or their houſe, or ſupply them with more ſtrong liquor than is abſolutely neceſſary for his or her refreſhment, upon proof made by a Conſtable or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder

            <p>In making the foregoing extracts, I have not copied whole ſections, but ſo much only as appeared ſufficient to give my reader a true idea of what the law is, whereby he may know when it is tranſgreſſed; and what his duty, as a lover of rectitude, requires. He may read them at large in Allinſon's edition, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The law ſays—<hi>No licence ſhall be granted to any perſon but ſuch who come well recommended, by at leaſt ſix free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of the neighbourhood, as being in good repute for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and temperance, and well accommodated, &amp;c. That if any Juſtices ſhall grant a licence to any perſon contrary to the true intent and meaning of that act, each of them ſhall forfeit</hi> ten pounds <hi>for every ſuch offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are all tavernkeepers in good repute for temperance, or rather are not many of them well known to the Juſtices who grant them licences to be very intemperate, and ſuch who are likely to encourage it in others? But they come recommended; the Court cannot be ſuppoſed to know all who apply. Be it ſo. But many of them are well known to the Court, as alſo the ſcandalous orders they have heretofore kept, and that they are not accommodated as the law requires, and often ſituate in private corners, or where there is not any juſt pretence of neceſſity to anſwer the end of that inſtitution, which is in fact eſtabliſhing tippling-houſes by authority, to debauch the morals of the people, there being at the writing of this five taverns on the road from Coopers Ferries to Salem, in the diſtance of five miles and an half. Did the Juſtices make it their buſineſs to examine into the ſituation of propoſed taverns,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018458_0010_0FA76E3495C86698"/>whether neceſſary, if the ſigners were of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and of good repute, and not tipplers in taverns, they might eaſily diſcover if the perſon recommended was within the deſcription of the law, and if not (which I believe is oftener the caſe than otherwiſe) careful to fine thoſe who dare offend the law by ſo impoſing upon them, they would ſhew themſelves real friends to their country, and worthy the dignity of their ſtations. The good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſuch a conduct would ſoon appear; and will any one pretend to ſay their duty and office qualification doth not enjoin this care in a matter wherein the good of the commonwealth is ſo highly intereſted? For, unleſs ſome method can be fallen upon to check the licentious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo much practiſed in theſe houſes, parents may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſit down and ſorrow, and inſtead of being careful to ſave ſomething for their children, may conclude the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt kindneſs will be, not to afford them the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching themſelves with the fruits of their care in thoſe ſeminaries of corruption, a practice ſo common with young heirs of the preſent day.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of checking a licence of conduct among a free people is made an excuſe for it by ſome, which is juſt in other words ſaying—We are willing to do as we pleaſe, and to give others the ſame liberty. Here, if I am not miſtaken, is the root of the miſchief. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is really not ſo very great, were the executive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but men who joined example with their power, paid a ſtrict obedience to laws themſelves, and with a becoming firmneſs exacted it from others, always careful to puniſh the wilful violators. The taſk, I believe, would then be eaſy. I myſelf a few years paſt travelled in three of the New-England ſtates, and ſuppoſing taverns to be the ſame there as in my own country, was very unwilling to lodge in them, and endeavoured ſeveral evenings to get private lodgings, offering to pay full price for what I had, but could not ſucceed, and ſoon found I could lodge and be entertained as quietly in their taverns, as in private houſes; and for ſeveral weeks that I was in thoſe parts, ſaw no tippling or diſorderly conduct in any
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018458_0011_0FA76E368B876698"/>of them, nor one perſon diſguiſed with liquor. If ſuch order and decorum can be preſerved in New-England, why not in New-Jerſey? And further, a kinſman who was in France a conſiderable time during the late war gave me the like account of that country, and aſſured me that from what he ſaw, a perſon might travel over the kingdom, and not ſee a drunken man. This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oeconomy appears to have been brought about by not ſuffering their hotels, or houſes for public entertainment, to keep any ſpirituous liquors to ſell. O America! were thy rulers virtuous enough to eſtabliſh a like regulation, how many millions would it ſave, that is now ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy luſts, and perhaps numberleſs ſouls from perdition. Reader, reflect a moment. Can a ſingle reaſon of weight be given againſt ſuch a reform here? at leaſt that no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſimple or mixed, nor foreign liquor of any kind, ſhould be kept to ſell in taverns. Their true uſe is to accommodate travellers and paſſengers with lodging and neceſſary entertainment; a dram, bowl of punch, or glaſs of wine, cuſtom only renders neceſſary. Were taverns upon ſuch an eſtabliſhment, people of the beſt characters would keep them, and uſe them when occaſion required. Whereas, in their preſent ſtate, it is rather a diſreputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a ſober perſon to be ſeen in ſome of our taverns, nor will they lodge in one if they can make any other ſhift, which occaſions private houſes in ſome places to be much burdened. The public would alſo be much better ſupplied with what is neceſſary and uſeful, their profits and attention being now chiefly on tipplers; and indeed, if no other reaſon were ſufficient, the public debt we are likely ſo long to groan under ought to induce our rulers to give every diſcouragement to the introduction of foreign liquors, that are equally unneceſſary and miſchievous.</p>
            <p>Every tavernkeeper enters into a recognizance of <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds, not to game, nor ſuffer others to game in his houſe for money, or the value of money, and in all things, as a public houſekeeper, to maintain good order and rules;</hi> and yet—how aſtoniſhing—that perſons who have entered into ſuch a recognizance in the face of the county ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018458_0012_0FA76E36C46536B0"/>dare to ſuffer a conduct, and that the moſt public and notorious, whereby they forfeit that recognizance almoſt every day they live; but ſtill more aſtoniſhing, that all this ſhould paſs unnoticed, and hardly an inſtance ever known where it hath been called in queſtion. If this is not a mockery of the ſolemnity of laws, I know not any thing which deſerves the term. But the ſcene exhibited in the caſe of Conſtables is ſtill more extraordinary; the ſacredneſs of laws, and ſolemnity of oaths are treated as objects deſtitute of the leaſt binding force, and affords a ſorrowful ſpecimen of the manners of a people, when the ſtrongeſt bands human wiſdom can provide, to make man faithful to man, are treated with ſo little ceremony, which hath a direct tendency to diſſolve, or render nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, every civil compact. This ought indeed to alarm the community; for like a hole through a water bank, if not ſtopped, the breach will grow wider until the whoſe encloſure is deluged. If one good law may be tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon with impunity, it is a kind of licence to treat all laws in the like manner. Let us ſee if the portrait hath wronged the original. Conſtables are <hi>ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to make diligent ſearch within their reſpective diſtricts, for perſons who ſell ſtrong liquor without licence, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect taverns at leaſt four times in the year, and report to the ſeſſions all evil practices they diſcover, ſuch as gaming, tippling, ſelling more liquor than is neceſſary for refreſhment, tippling on the Lord's day; if rates are up in their houſes as the law requires; if they demand, or receive more than ſaid rates allow; ſell liquer to any apprentice, ſervant or ſlave; or ſuffer any diſorders contrary to their recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</hi> And that they may have no excuſe from ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Clerk of the Court is enjoined to give each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable a liſt of tavernkeepers names, and the Court to acquaint them with their duty, and command them to perform it, which they <hi>ſolemnly qualify they will do;</hi> and there the farce ends, and little or no further notice taken either by Court, Clerk or Conſtable. Yea, ſome Juſtices and Conſtables are themſelves perhaps as ready as any to trample upon theſe judicious regulations, and thereby
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018458_0013_0FA76E37828C8EB0"/>encourage others to do it without hazard. What name this deſerves, let every ſerious Chriſtian judge. The conſequences which naturally flow from ſuch a contempt of theſe laws is indeed felt by all, and every one appears ſenſible of, but is become ſo familiar, that, generally ſpeaking, it operates like laudanum, lulls into a ſtate of eaſe and content, without ſeeking a remedy.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018458_0015_0FA76E3907BF75A0"/>common practice again, and no marvel, when civil officers of the foremoſt rank will countonance it by receiving drams from the cryer, which he is furniſhed with to entice people to bid, as a reward to the higheſt bidder, thereby to inflame his ambition, that he may diſdain to be outdone.

I am acquainted with an inſtance of this kind, in a village where ſeldom a week paſſed without ſeveral horſe-races, when a neighbour who lived ſeveral miles off, being grieved at the conſequences, exerted himſelf in the above manner, and ſo effectually ſtopped it, that for ten years paſt there has not been an attempt to renew the practice.</p>

The confuſion of the late times were in a great degree ſuch, wherein every man did what was right in his own eyes, vice and profanity, with brazen front, ſtalked about in open day, bidding defiance to reſtraint or controul. The Magiſtrate who was deſirous to diſcharge his duty by enforcing the laws, found himſelf unſupported, and too feeble for the mighty taſk. Hence a licence of conduct, and perverſion of manners enſued; numberleſs abuſes for want of the curb of law were ſuffered, overlooked, (and ſorrowful to ſay) too often countenanced by ſome who held the ſword of Juſtice.—That this is a true ſtate of the caſe, hardly any one will deny.—The ſtorm is now paſt, the raging billows are become calm, the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of juſtice is now undiſturbed by the bloody ſword and roaring cannon.—Now, fellow-citizens, the <hi>calls</hi> of our common <hi>intereſt,</hi> our <hi>country,</hi> our <hi>religion,</hi> and our <hi>God,</hi> is to each individual in their ſeveral ſtations, to exert themſelves in promoting the general good of our infant States, and ſtrengthen the bleſſings of ſociety.—May we with thankful hearts improve the opportunity, and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica become as conſpicuous in the annals of time, for the rectitude of her manners, and love of virtue, as ſhe is for the love of liberty, the continued enjoyment of which ſhe can only thus ſecure.</p>
            <p>In all the departments of civil government, there are none who have it ſo much in their power to check and ſuppreſs vice, as the magiſtracy. They may indeed be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed the <hi>guardians</hi> of the <hi>laws,</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> of the <hi>people.</hi> But alas! how few whoſe conduct manifeſts a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious care faithfully to diſcharge the duties of that ſtation in this reſpect, which ought to be a ſerious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all intruſted with authority, if the opinion of an eminent author is believed—<q>That each one muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for their own offences, and rulers for the ſins of others, which they could have prevented and did not.</q> Eli's care ſeems to confirm this doctrine. He appears to have been a worthy man. Nevertheleſs how ſevere the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him for not reſtraining his ſon's vices.—I moſt ſincerely wiſh the reflection might make an impreſſion on
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018458_0017_0FA76E3A8AC5EB58"/>every mind equal to its importance. It would occaſion thoſe in the foremoſt ſtations to be very guarded in the appointing of others under them, like Moſes, to chooſe men <hi>fearing God</hi> and <hi>hating covetuouſneſs.</hi> Such Magiſtrates are a bleſſing to a people, ever mindful to diſcharge the duties of their ſtations, not ſo much to pleaſe men, as him, at whoſe awful Tribunal they ſoon expect to appear, to account for the uſe of that ſhare of power he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to them.</p>
            <p>It would alſo lead Grand Juries to aſſert the antient dignity of their office, in a ſerious diſcharge of the very extenſive and important power with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, of impeaching mal-adminiſtration and dignified crimes, dragging vice out of its dark lurking holes, and teaching a reverence to the laws.—Their power is indeed very great, as their title—<hi>The Grand Inqueſt for the County,</hi> and their qualification, point out; which were they religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to diſcharge, the effects would reach beyond what is generally ſuppoſed. I may not be a competent judge, but muſt believe moſt of the abuſes pointed out in the foregoing extracts are objects of their enquiry and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and though a Judge is not puniſhable for an <hi>error</hi> in his judgment, where he uprightly endeavours to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty, yet it may juſtly be queſtioned whether Juſtices are not liable to be called to an account by Grand Juries for granting licences againſt their own knowledge, and a manifeſt evidence of want of proper qualification in the perſon licenſed, contrary to the true intent and meaning of the laws.—However, the legiſlative body might be addreſſed on ſuch a conduct to good effect, and is an object highly worthy attention. In general, I expect the following are doubtleſs ſo—Clerks and Conſtables who ſhew a contemptuous diſregard to the duties requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—diſorderly taverns—ſuch who demand more than their rates allow—ſuch who dare to impoſe on a Court by ſigning an untrue recommendation—Under Sheriff or Goaler, who ſhall ſell liquor to the priſoners—ſhopkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who encourage frolicking, tippling, &amp;c. in their houſes —and thoſe little peſts, who, under pretence of ſelling
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018458_0018_0FA76E3B47B1FC68"/>cakes, are many of them real tippling houſes, where children and the refuſe of mankind reſort, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> breed, as in ſome places to be in ſight of each other, an increaſing evil, which calls for the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of Grand Juries to extirpate.—Whether all theſe miſchiefs are within their cognizance and influence or not, the Council aſſigned them by the conſtitution can point out; and ſurely the languiſhing calls of virtue, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and their country's good, are forcible incentives to every ſuitable exertion.</p>
            <p>And now a few words to Magiſtrates—You, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are raiſed above your brethren by commiſſions. This is a gift from others, but to riſe above them by virtue and good works, depends on yourſelves, will add digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ſtation, give a weight and influence, and make you loved and revered. Without this, your elevations will only expoſe your flaws the more to the notice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of thoſe below you. Eſteem begets a chearful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but to obey thoſe we deſpiſe, is like a ſtony piece of bread that almoſt choaks in ſwallowing—Reflect, I beſeech you, on the importance of the truſt repoſed—how much the ſcale of virtue and vice is poiſed by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and your power.—If you fear God, and love your country, demonſtrate it by uſing the ſword of juſtice as <hi>a terror to evil doers, and praiſe of them who do well.</hi> This is the true uſe of power, which every human ſanction ought to corroborate, and will promote at the ſame time the two greateſt events man can be employed about— your country's good, and your own preſent and eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh every intelligent perſon would often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the foundation of government, detached from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Its original object was, to preſerve order, reſtrain corrupt nature, curb and puniſh the vices of the people for the good of the whole, agreeable to rules and ſanctions agreed upon by the whole. In delegating this power, the ſociety do not reſign all further care about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, but reſerves in itſelf a power by its Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, Grand Juries, &amp;c. of enquiring into and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018458_0019_0FA76E3EEA38B358"/>peaching mal-adminiſtration. In this ſenſe each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual is, or ought to be, a watch upon the conduct of thoſe himſelf has agreed to inveſt with authority for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral benefit, and if any of them betray their truſt, neglect their duty, or pervert the end of their appointment, the common good demands it of him to diſcover, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to have the miſchief remedied; this the very nature of things confirm. Government is a creature of ſociety, which inveſts it with all the power it can legally have. The term Majeſty (among human diſtinctions) ought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be aſcribed to ſociety.—Society is the creator, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the creature; government is created for ſociety, and not ſociety for government. But alas, how liable are human inſtitutions to be perverted, and none was ever more than government. The firſt ſervant of the ſtate is ſtiled Majeſty, and his conſtituents generally treated as a ſtock of creatures on a farm, the property of every new maſter. From this fountain a degree of the ſame inſolence but too much runs through every department of power, from the King to the Conſtable, who think themſelves ill uſed if their conduct is inſpected, or in the leaſt called in queſtion by thoſe from whom their authority is derived; and indeed, as matters ſtand, it is pretty tickliſh to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and would lead one to ſuppoſe the above reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be all wrong—that a King was firſt created and a country given him, and then a race formed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior mold to people it,—or, as a humurous author has it—<hi>That mankind are born with ſaddles on their backs, and the buſineſs of government is to ride them.</hi> What a humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating and degrading picture of the common herd of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings—and is it not a true one?—</p>
            <p>But what does all this rant mean? What end is it to anſwer? Government is an arduous buſineſs, and thoſe who rule well are worthy of double honor. All this I fully admit. No man can give honor and obedience to good rulers more chearfully than myſelf. Such neither neglect nor abuſe their power, nor graſp after more than is given them. They act in it as a duty the good of the community demands, and when that requires, will more
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018458_0020_0FA76E4016CFA538"/>freely reſign their dignity than they received it: An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this kind we have ſeen in the firſt and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed man in America. To worth of this ſort the people are never ungrateful—But at ſtrutting importance without merit, they cannot but laugh (a ſight not unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual in our time.) Theſe, inſtead of being attentive to the duties of their ſtation, uniting their authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence for the public good, ſpend their zeal in purſuing power, promoting parties, abuſing, calumniating, and worrying thoſe who diſapprove their conduct. Such ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are entitled only to contempt; they have no claim to honor.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations on government were ſuggeſted from an earneſt deſire, that all perſons united in civil ſociety would aſſert the dignity of humanity, and of freemen, in giving their aſſiſtance to enforce obedience to laws which themſelves have agreed to be governed by, and is the doctrine I wiſh to inculcate—<hi>That the good of each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual being inſeparably connected with the good of the whole, the good of the whole ought to be every one's care</hi>— That laws and ſanctions agreed upon by the whole, to promote their joint intereſts, ought to be held ſacred, and every wilful tranſgreſſor, ſo far lays waſte the enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of law, the only protection we have to our lives, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, religion, &amp;c. is ſo far an enemy to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ought to be puniſhed. The law makes it crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to conceal great crimes, or ſuffer the offender that is in our power to eſcape. The ſame reaſon holds good in degree in every ſpecies of offences againſt law; nor can any one demonſtrate a greater love for his country, or yield her more eſſential ſervice, than by exerting his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in promoting a due reverence for and obedience to her good and wholeſome laws, more eſpecially ſuch of them whoſe object is to encourage virtue, and ſuppreſs vice, the baſis on which government is founded; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this ſentiment is my motive for writing. A large part of my life I have at times been pained on reflecting upon the miſchievous effects, and flood of corruption, ſpread abroad from houſes for public entertainment, which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018458_0021_0FA76E4220BF2208"/>indeed admits a queſtion, whether all the labour and pains beſtowed by miniſters of the goſpel promotes virtue, equal to what they promote vice; a portentous miſchief, which it appears very clear to me might be entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by a virtuous execution of the laws now in force. To endeavour to ſtimulate my fellow-citizens to an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their power to effect this, drew me ſome time back to caſt a few hints together for the news-paper, but found myſelf too much cramped in that way, and threw it by. But the ſubject continuing often to preſent itſelf to my reflection, as a debt due to the community, of which I am myſelf a part, I have now diſcharged it in as brief a manner as I well could, omitting however much I intended to have ſaid; and ſhould it anſwer no other purpoſe than to engage ſome abler hand to take it up, and do the ſubject greater juſtice, I ſhall not think my labour wholly loſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude with part of a ſpeech delivered to a renowned, and then a free people, but who did not long continue ſo, which this ſpeech ſeemed to predict. The obſervations it contains are worthy the notice and practice of every government, and particularly thoſe of America in the preſent day.</p>
            <q>
               <p>When a nation is puffed up with an opinion of her own ſtrength and ſafety, it is then that her councils are likely to be raſh and imprudent, and their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences fatal, that I cannot help being alarmed at the ſecurity in which I ſee my country at preſent ſunk. Proſperity generally produces arrogance, raſhneſs and folly; want and diſtreſs naturally ſuggeſt prudent and moderate reſolutions: Therefore it is not ſo eaſy, as at firſt it may ſeem, to determine which condition is for the purpoſe of real happineſs, the moſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired for individuals, or for national proſperity—a ſtate of perfect ſuperiority to danger and fear—or of circumſtances requiring-caution, frugality and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For perfect proſperity generally brings with it the cauſes of misfortune; when narrower circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances often lead to care, prudence and ſafety.</p>

Government ought to promote to high ſtations men eminent for virtue, as a means to excite a general emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation among all ranks, as the people are conſtantly obſerved to form their manners upon the model of their ſuperiors.</p>
               <p>What chiefly tends to the eſtabliſhment of a ſtate is, a police founded in habitual modeſty, temperance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, valour and patriotiſm. The general preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe diſpeſitions is not brought about by laws or ſanctions, but by education, example, and a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious exerciſe of power, whereby vice is diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, without directly puniſhing it, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects drawn into that voluntary rectitude of behaviour, which force will never produce. Laws heaped upon laws, rendered neceſſary, ſhew an unruly and perverſe diſpoſition in the people. The ſagacity of governors appears in planting their laws in the hearts of an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient people. The buſineſs therefore is, not ſo much to find ways of puniſhing offenders, as to form the minds of the people ſo, that they ſhall have no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to offend.</p>
