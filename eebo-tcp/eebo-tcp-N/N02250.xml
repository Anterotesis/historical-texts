            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>T<hi>HE following</hi> Sermon <hi>met with no lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Approbation from the judicious Auditory, to which it was deliver'd: And I hope will be as acceptable, from the Preſs, as from the Pulpit; and more extenſively profitable. To which end I wiſh a Divine</hi> Bleſſing <hi>may accompany it into the World! It appears abroad, at the Requeſt of</hi> Many. <hi>'Twas preach'd at my deſire, and in my Desk, I mean, where I was to have ſtood. For which Reaſon, the Reverend</hi> Author <hi>demands of me this in Return, That I uſher it upon the Stage with ſome</hi> Prefatory <hi>Lines: And it ſeems but a juſt piece of</hi> Gratitude <hi>in me to comply; however they that know</hi> his Age <hi>and</hi> Worth, <hi>may vote it a Treſpaſs on Modeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I'm ſenſible 'twould be an unbecoming Attempt in me, to enter here into an</hi> Encomium <hi>on the Author and his Performance, as is the manner of thoſe that do the like office of Reſpect for Others: Nor cou'd any Character from me illustrate his Perſonal Merits, or be of any Advantage to his Diſcourſe; which will commend</hi> it ſelf <hi>to every ſerious judicious Reader. I ſhall therefore only beg Leave to expreſs</hi> my Thanks, <hi>to</hi> Him, <hi>for affording me his ſo ſeaſonable and kind Aſſiſtence: And to the Divine</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>who led him to bring us ſuch a Sermon, ſo calculated for general uſe; as to the</hi> Subject, <hi>of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; and as to the</hi> Manner, <hi>Scriptural, rational, and pertinent; perſpicuous, and moving.—I muſt be allow'd alſo to expreſs my Joy in the</hi> ſignal uſe <hi>God is making of this his Servant, to ſpread</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>among the Aboriginal Natives, or</hi> Indians; <hi>to which Service he has for theſe many years devoted himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> We are bound to thank God always on
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002677_0003_0FE6070BF0B1F528"/>
their behalf, for the Grace of God which is given them by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Hereby</hi> of a truth we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that God is no Reſpecter of Perſons. But all in all nations <hi>ſtand on one common Level before God, both in the Duty and the Privilege of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, Scythian, Bond nor Free.—<hi>It muſt yield a very ſenſible Pleaſure to every Chriſtian Soul, to hear of the</hi> Grace <hi>of God beſtow'd on the</hi> Indians, <hi>thoſe (once) forlorn and wretched Heathen, the very</hi> Ruins <hi>of humane Nature! It is a refreſhing</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>that this Servant of God bears unto</hi> IT, <hi>in the enſuing Sermon: And we hope it will be abundantly confirm'd in that</hi> Narrative <hi>of the Lives and Deaths of ſome ſcores of our Chriſtianized</hi> Indians, <hi>which he deſigns ere long to give the Public.—In the mean time, they who want Satisfaction, are refer'd to the accounts that have already ſeen the Light. For the State of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among them, as it was</hi> formerly <hi>you have it in the Life of Memorable Mr.</hi> ELIOT, <hi>the Apoſtle of the American Indians. And for later times, you may ſee the account given by the Rev. Meſſieurs</hi> Rawſon <hi>and</hi> Danforth; <hi>annexed to Mr.</hi> Noyes's <hi>Election Sermon. Alſo the appendix to Dr.</hi> Mather's <hi>Funeral Sermon for Mr.</hi> Rawſon, <hi>and others, entitl'd</hi> Juſt Commemorations. <hi>Alſo our Author Mr.</hi> Mayhew's <hi>appendix to his Sermon</hi> on Iſa. 1. 18. <hi>publiſhed in the year 1720. Conſult theſe Prints, and you'l find that one of</hi> our Forefathers <hi>pious Errands into this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, has not been altogether neglected, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceeded.

            <head>Mankind, by Nature, Equally under Sin.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ROMANS, III. 9.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>What then? are we better then they! No in no wiſe: for we have before proved both</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that they are all under Sin.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE <hi>Pride,</hi> which Mankind have by Nature in their Hearts, does very much diſpoſe them to think too highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and too meanly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It is a caſe wherein People comparing themſelves with others, are not equal Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; but are too apt to paſs Sentence in their own Favour.</p>
            <p>IT would doubtleſs be well, if we were herein more Cautious than we are, conſidering how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be miſtaken we be, and what inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do or may attend our being ſo. Hence that caution given by our Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 12. 3. For I ſay through the Grace given unto me, to every Man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002677_0005_0FE6070E19E7CE30"/>
than he ought to think; but to think ſoberly according as God hath dealt to every Man the meaſure of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is therefore very Neceſſary that People Labour after <hi>Humility,</hi> and take care that their Hearts be not lifted up with Pride and Vain-glory, but that they be kept in a humble frame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. And we ought at all times to <hi>Meditate</hi> on ſuch things as have a Tendency to <hi>hide Pride</hi> from us, and cauſe us to ſee that we have nothing to boaſt of; Nothing on the account whereof we have any reaſon to exalt our ſelves.</p>
            <p>AND here one thing, the conſideration whereof may be very Serviceable to us is, <hi>That we are no better by Nature, than</hi> thoſe of our Neighbours are, whom we Prefer our ſelves before; for tho' it will not from hence follow, that we have not <hi>now</hi> the Advantage of them; yet we may hence infer, that if we are any better then they, we may not thank our ſelves for it, <hi>not having made our ſelves to differ from them,</hi> and <hi>having nothing which we have not Received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Propoſition from whence this Concluſion is drawn, is very evidently contained in the words now before us, as will appear when we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their Connection with thoſe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, and the true ſense and meaning of them.</p>
            <p>HERE then we may briefly obſerve, that the Apoſtle having in the Beginning of this <hi>Third</hi> Chapter of his Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. Declared, what great Advantages the <hi>Jews</hi> above others did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and Vindicated the kindneſs of God therein Manifeſted unto them; as alſo His Juſtice in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their Diſobedience, in what follows unto the end of the <hi>Eighth verſe,</hi> He in my <hi>Text,</hi> Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002677_0006_0FE5F205EB803330"/>
a Queſtion, which he propoſeth on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and this, as I Suppoſe, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the <hi>Jews,</hi> from drawing ſuch a Conſequence from what he had been ſaying, as was neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, nor implied therein; Namely, that they were better than other People, unto whom God had not granted ſuch Privileges as he had done unto them. <hi>What then?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>i. e.</hi> What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence may their be drawn from what I have ſaid? <hi>Are we better than they? i e.</hi> Are we <hi>Jews,</hi> who are ſo highly privileg'd, as I have declared, any better than others, who enjoy not ſuch Advantages as we do, and whoſe Wicked Lives expoſe them to God's juſt Diſpleaſure? Does it follow that becauſe we have better Privileges, we muſt needs be a better People! <hi>No, in no wiſe. i. e.</hi> Such a Conſequence will by no means follow from what I have delivered: I intend no ſuch thing, nor can ſuch a Concluſion be fairly drawn from what I have ſaid. And that ſuch a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is neither true, nor according to his mind, he further manifeſts in what follows unto the end of the <hi>verse. For we have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before Proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin. i. e.</hi> If both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are ſuch Sinners as I have before proved they are, or charged them with being, in my foregoing Diſcourſe about them, it is neither true, nor can you ſuppoſe me to intend, that we who are <hi>Jews,</hi> are any better than the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but on the contrary, we are all equally Sinfull.</p>
            <p>NOT that the Apoſtle here intends, that the <hi>Jews</hi> were Generally as bad in their Lives as the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations were; and that all People and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002677_0007_0FE6071650803E40"/>
Nations are actually alike Wicked; for as bad as the <hi>Jews</hi> were, they were not Univerſally ſo bad as the Nations that <hi>knew not GOD,</hi> and did not call upon his Name. And <hi>we know</hi> well, that all Mankind are not equally Wicked; for there are ſome Righteous Perſons, who are <hi>more Excellent than their Neighbours,</hi> Prov. 12. 26. and there are ſome Nations, whom <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> doth exalt, while <hi>Sin</hi> is a Reproach unto others.—</p>
            <p>BUT what the Apoſtle here intends, is that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and all Mankind are, <hi>by Nature,</hi> equally under Sin. They are <hi>ſo</hi> conſidered as in their <hi>Natural Eſtate;</hi> tho' otherwiſe, Grace may have made ſome difference betwixt them.</p>
            <p>THE Words then will afford us this <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>DOCT. THAT, Mankind are all by Nature Equally under Sin; none better than others.</q>
            <p>FOR the Clearing up of this Truth, there are three things to be Conſidered; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> (1) What is here intended and implyed in Mens being <hi>under Sin.</hi> (2) What is me'nt by Mens being <hi>by Nature E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi> ſo. (3) How it appears that this is the Condition of <hi>all Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. LET us Conſider what is intended and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in Mens being <hi>under Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW this implies Several things, As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. MENS <hi>committing Sin,</hi> or being Guilty of it. By their being <hi>Guilty,</hi> I here intend their being <hi>Sinners,</hi> or that Relation, which thoſe that have Sinned, do ſtand in unto the Sins that have been Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, on the Account whereof they are ſaid to be <hi>theirs,</hi> and by which the charge of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002677_0008_0FE607197B12DD20"/>
is juſtly faſtened on them. Mens being thus <hi>under Sin</hi> does imply that they have Sinned, either by <hi>omitting</hi> ſomething which they ſhould have done, or <hi>doing</hi> ſomthing which they ſhould not. Without this, Perſons cannot be truly ſaid to be <hi>under Sin.</hi> In this ſense Perſons may be ſaid to be <hi>under Sin,</hi> or <hi>Guilty</hi> of it, whether the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Puniſhment of their Offences be inflicted on them or not. Thus thoſe unto whom the Lord does <hi>not impute Sin,</hi> may be ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, when they have done that which they ſhould not. Again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. MEN are ſaid to be <hi>under Sin,</hi> as it <hi>dwells</hi> or abides in them, after they have Committed it. Thoſe Actions wherein Men Sin againſt God, are tranſient and paſs away as ſoon as they are done; as <hi>Adam</hi> did not continue Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Forbidden Fruit; but having ſo done, his Act therein was gone and paſt: But Mens Actions being thus finiſhed, <hi>Sin</hi> remains in the Perſons performing them. There is <hi>after them</hi> a vicious <hi>Habit</hi> or <hi>Inclination</hi> left in the Souls of the Perſons Sinning, which is in it ſelf truly and properly Sin; being the want of a Conformity unto the Holy Law of God, in Mens Minds or Hearts, and ſo a Tranſgreſſion of it.</p>
            <p>WHEN Sin is committed, the Soul is as it were Poiſoned with it, ſo as to Remain diſpoſed to Vice and Wickedneſs, being depraved and Sinful. So it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had Sinned againſt God; and all his <hi>Poſterity</hi> have been Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally full of Sin <hi>ever ſince;</hi> as will by and by more fully appear. Hence that in Rom. 7. 20. <hi>Sin that dwelleth in me.</hi>

3. PERSONS may be alſo ſaid to be <hi>under Sin,</hi> on the account of that <hi>Stain</hi> and <hi>Blot</hi> which it leaves on the Perſons committing it, I mean the <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> which it brings upon them. For tho' this be properly rather an <hi>Effect</hi> of Sin than Sin it ſelf; yet the effects of Sin, or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, being ſometimes in Scripture called Sin, Perſons may not unfitly be ſaid to be <hi>under Sin,</hi> when under them. Hence it is ſaid of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon committing Sin, <hi>Prov. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 33. A wound and diſhonour ſhall he get, and his reproch ſhall not be wiped away.</hi> Agreeable hereunto is that in Prov. 14. 34. <hi>Sin is a Reproach unto any People.</hi> Such as bear the Reproach, which Sin has brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, may on that account be ſaid to be <hi>under Sin;</hi> and this ſeems evidently included in <hi>that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> as uſed in the Text.</p>
            <p n="4">4. MENS being <hi>under Sin</hi> evidently intends their being under the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it. By Guilt here I intend that <hi>Obligation</hi> unto <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> under which Men are brought, when they Sin againſt God, by the Sentence denounced in that Holy Law of His, which is trangreſſed by them; and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Relation</hi> only, in which they ſtand unto the Sins which they have Committed; of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And Guilt is very frequently taken in the Sense, in which I here underſtand it. So in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, verſe the 19<hi>th. Now we know that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are under the Law: that every Mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World may become Guilty before God.</hi> Or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is in the Margin, Subject to the Judgment of God. In this Sense, the word <hi>Guilt</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>Pſal. 51. 14. Deliver me from bloud-guiltineſs, O

God.</hi> In this Sense, Perſons <hi>Iniquity</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>upon them,</hi> when they are bound over to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. MEN are ſaid to be <hi>under Sin,</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Reigning Power</hi> of it in and over them. This is ſomething more than Simply their having Sin <hi>in them,</hi> of which I have before ſpoken, for thus God's own <hi>Children</hi> may be the Subjects of Sin, but Sin does not <hi>Reign</hi> in them, it has no <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> over them, nor are they the <hi>Servants</hi> of it, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap 6. But on the Contrary, ſuch as are in a State of <hi>Nature,</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reigning Power and Dominion of Sin. <hi>Sin reigns in their mortal bodies,</hi> and they do <hi>obey</hi> it in the Luſts thereof, having their Converſation in the Luſts of the Fleſh, and fulfilling the deſires of the Fleſh, and of the Mind, being Fooliſh and Diſobedient, and ſerving divers Luſts &amp; Pleaſures, as is declared in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>For we our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</hi> Of Perſons who are in this Sense under Sin, that is to be underſtood <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>When ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were free from Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may conſider,</p>
            <p>II. WHAT is here intended by Mens being <hi>Equally</hi> under Sin (none better then others) <hi>by Nature.</hi> Now that this does not intend that all Mankind are equally bad in their <hi>Lives,</hi> has been already declared. And when it is ſaid that Men are <hi>by Nature</hi> alike it ſeems plainly implyed, that <hi>by Grace</hi> they are or may be far otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>AND very true it is that ſince Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002677_0011_0FE6069D4283C4B0"/>
have been brought to Light by the Goſpel, God has put a very great Difference betwixt one and another of the Children of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> making ſome of them much better than others. Nor has He only made a difference betwixt thoſe that are <hi>Born again,</hi> and ſuch as are not, but alſo betwixt one and another of theſe; for as all the <hi>Godly</hi> are not equally <hi>Holy,</hi> ſo neither are all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Perſons ſuffered to run into the <hi>ſame exceſs of Riot,</hi> or equally and alike to give up themſelves unto a Courſe of Sinning againſt God; but many of them are by common Grace reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Committing Sin, with ſuch Greedineſs as others do; and alſo inabled to do many things that are Materially Good, and Beneficial both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves and others; tho' not ſuch as are ſaid to <hi>accompany Salvation.</hi> Heb. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>IT is readily granted, that there is ſuch a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Children of Men as that now declared; but then it muſt be affirmed that <hi>Grace</hi> and not <hi>Nature</hi> has made it. By <hi>Nature</hi> they are all alike, in Reſpect of their Moral Eſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, none either better or worſe than others: Nor do I by <hi>Nature</hi> here underſtand that of Man, in the <hi>State wherein he was Created,</hi> but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man conſidered as in that <hi>Eſtate</hi> which his <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Fall</hi> brought him into, and as a Subject of thoſe Sinful <hi>Inclinations</hi> which by his Apoſtacy from God he has Contracted, and of which he Remains a Miſerable Subject till the Grace of God makes ſome change in him, or work ſome good Effects on him.</p>
            <p>I may now Proceed to Conſider,</p>
            <p>

III. <hi>HOW it appears</hi> that this is the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>all Mankind.</hi> Or, that by Nature all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are equally under Sin; none better than others.</p>
            <p>AND this will be evident, if we ſeriouſly weigh a few things now to be propoſed unto Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here then I ſay,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>THAT the Sin and Fall of the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>involved</hi> all <hi>Mankind in it.</hi> There was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made here; one as well as another of <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity Sinned in him, and fell with him in his firſt Tranſgreſſion. <hi>Eve</hi> ſinned Perſonally as <hi>Adam</hi> did, and was alſo a <hi>Partaker</hi> with him in <hi>His</hi> Sin, as Acceſſary to it, by enticeing him to commit it and ſo at leaſt equally Guilty with him.</p>
            <p>BUT all <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity, being in him, as Branches in the Root, or Stock, out of which they proceed, or as Fruit is firſt in the Tree that bears it, before it is brought forth, they moſt certainly Sinned in him when he ſinned. They may on this account be as well ſaid to have done what <hi>he</hi> did when he eat the forbidden fruit, as the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> are ſaid to have paid tithes in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Heb. 7. 9. But if their being <hi>Naturally</hi> in him, in the manner now expreſſed, did not <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily</hi> intitle them to the Guilt and Defilement of his <hi>Sin</hi> (as I do not affirm that it did) <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that rendered it moſt <hi>juſt</hi> and equal that he ſhould be made a <hi>Publick Perſon,</hi> and moral <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> them, in whom (as such) they ſhould <hi>be</hi> and do and ſo ſtand or fall as he ſhould do. Nor could their being thus <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>repreſented</hi> by him, be any diſadvantage unto them; for <hi>as</hi> they acted
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002677_0013_0FE606A5DC4749D0"/>
               <hi>in him,</hi> ſo they would have acted <hi>out of him.</hi> Their <hi>Nature</hi> being the very <hi>ſame</hi> with his, they would have done juſt as he did, if put upon the <hi>ſame trial</hi> as he was; and therefore could receive no <hi>wrong</hi> by his repreſenting of them, and acting for them as their Publick Head. It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as well for them in this way, as it could have been if they had Perſonally acted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and made their own choice.</p>
            <p>NAY, it ſeems that they were in <hi>leſs</hi> danger of a Miſcarriage in the <hi>way</hi> fixed on, than they would have been in the <hi>other:</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> had a far <hi>greater charge</hi> lying on him, than any Perſon in a ſingle capacity could have had: it is certain that <hi>his own</hi> happineſs was as much concerned in the affair as any Perſons could have been, who might have been left to a Perſonal Trial in a caſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their eternal ſafety did depend upon their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they ought. And beſides this, the welfare or Happineſs of all his <hi>Poſterity</hi> depended on his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto God, in the Inſtance wherein he was tryed; which we cannot ſuppoſe him to have been Ignorant of; for it is not <hi>reaſonable</hi> to think that he could be ſuch a <hi>Publick Perſon,</hi> and yet not be acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>NOW the conſideration of this laid a moral obligation on him, to take great heed what he did, and not at once to deſtroy all his Poſterity, together with himſelf.</p>
            <p>THAT the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did as a Publick Perſon thus repreſent, and act for all thoſe who in the way of ordinary Generation do proceed from him, and that they fell with him in his firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, the Scriptures do abundantly teſtifie.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002677_0014_0FE606A6EA6A5278"/>
The <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> fully aſſerts and clears up <hi>this</hi> in the <hi>fifth</hi> chapter of his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> In the 12 <hi>verſe,</hi> he tells us, That <hi>by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and ſo Death paſſed on all Men, for that all have ſinned</hi> in him. And in the following context, he declares that <hi>through the offence of one, many are dead;</hi> and that <hi>Judgment was by one, unto condemnation.</hi> And he further tells that <hi>by one Man's offence, death reigned by one.</hi> (verſe 15, 16, 17.) That <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>one Man</hi> here ſpoken of, is declared in <hi>verſe</hi> the 14<hi>th.</hi> where we are alſo told that he <hi>was the figure</hi> of him that <hi>was to come,</hi> even JESUS CHRIST, who is the head and repreſentative of his Seed, as the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was of his. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle accordingly tells us, that as in one of <hi>theſe</hi> many were made <hi>Sinners;</hi> ſo in the <hi>other</hi> alſo many are made <hi>Righteous,</hi> in verſe the 18, 19, and 21: Agreeable unto this is that alſo of the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in 1 Cor. 15, 21, 22. <hi>As by man came Death, ſo by man came the Reſurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. AS all Mankind fell in and with <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo they were <hi>all Equally</hi> involved in the Guilt and Defilement of his Sin. As they <hi>all fell</hi> in him, ſo they all fell <hi>Equally</hi> in him. This muſt needs be granted; for all <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity were <hi>equally related</hi> to him both as their <hi>natural and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed head.</hi> the covenant of works was <hi>one and the ſame,</hi> to which they <hi>all</hi> in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> conſented, and according to their <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>diſobedience</hi> unto which they were either to <hi>live</hi> or <hi>die;</hi> and they were all <hi>Equally</hi> capable of the Reward promiſed,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002677_0015_0FE606A7FB195560"/>
and of the Puniſhment threatned in that covenant, and ſo of all the <hi>Effects</hi> or conſequents of <hi>Adams</hi> obedience or diſobedience unto God, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or kind ſoever they were. And hence they were all <hi>equally</hi> involved in Sin and Miſery.</p>
            <p>Here I may more particularly affirm.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> did by the fall partake <hi>equally</hi> in the Guilt of his Sin. I mean now that <hi>his Sin</hi> was equally <hi>imputed</hi> unto or charged on all of them. Whatever Intereſt <hi>any</hi> of them had in it, they <hi>all</hi> had. They being all in one condition, all Shipped on one and the ſame bottom, having all one and the ſame <hi>Surety,</hi> or Publick Perſon to repreſent them, and all fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by one <hi>Offence</hi> of the ſame Man, at the very ſame time, and under the very ſame circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; How can it be but that they muſt be <hi>equally Guilty?</hi> The Sin committed muſt needs equally belong to them all. There is no room to ſuppoſe that there could be any difference as to this, nor is there the leaſt intimation in Scripture, that there was any: but the contrary is therein fully declared, as ſhall be preſently made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>And from hence it follows,</p>
            <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> THAT all Mankind are by Nature <hi>equally</hi> liable unto the Judgments, threatned in caſe of diſobedience. If <hi>all</hi> had the charge of Sin <hi>Equally</hi> lying on them, were equally chargeable with ſuch Crimes as do expoſe Men unto puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then all muſt needs be equally liable to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Puniſhments due on the account of them.</p>
            <p>THE Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> did accordingly expoſe all that were Guilty of it unto Death. Gen. 2. 17.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002677_0016_0FE606A90E19D530"/>
               <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> And Death is agreeably hereunto ſaid to have <hi>reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adams <hi>Tranſgreſſion, i. e.</hi> not actually in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as he did, Rom. 5. 13. Hence we are aſſured that even God's own People <hi>were by nature Children of wrath even as others,</hi> Eph. 2. 3.</p>
            <p>I go on and ſay,</p>
            <p>3<hi>ly.</hi> THAT Mankind are <hi>all equally</hi> Defiled <hi>by original ſin.</hi> Or that the Depravation of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man by the fall, has equally affected all the Children of <hi>Adam;</hi> the Holy child Jeſus only excepted. The reſt of <hi>Adam's</hi> Poſterity are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infected with it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) IF we conſider the Depravation of the Humane Nature, which followed on the fall of Man, as a <hi>Penal</hi> Effect of his firſt and great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, this was certainly a Puniſhment <hi>equally due</hi> unto all his offspring.</p>
            <p>IT is not to be doubted, but that the moral diſtempers of Mens Souls, unto which they have ever ſince the fall been ſubject, are a juſt <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Man's Sin in <hi>Eating the Forbidden Fruit.</hi> They are included in the <hi>Death</hi> threatned, when God ſaid unto Man, that <hi>in the day he eat thereof, he ſhould ſurely die:</hi> The Children of <hi>Adam</hi> have therefore been <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> ever ſince <hi>his</hi> Sin and fall: And that Children are diſpoſed unto Sin from their very Infancy, <hi>going astray as ſoon as they are born, ſpeaking lies,</hi> as in Pſal 58. 3. is an invincible argument of their being Guilty of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin; their own actual Sin, not going before, but following after, this Propenſity in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Sin againſt God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002677_0017_0FE606B182314B68"/>
BUT now all the Poſterity of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>equally</hi> Guilty of that Sin, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in him, as has been ſhewed, it plainly follows that ſo far as the corruption of Man's Nature is to be looked upon as a puniſhment of that Sin, it was equally due unto all thoſe, who <hi>equally</hi> Partook in the Guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt <hi>Offence.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">(2) IF we conſider the corruption of Mans Nature, as <hi>Naturally</hi> Propagated (in the way of <hi>ordinary generation</hi>) from Parents unto Children, all the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt needs in this way partake equally of it. The depravation of our Nature as a natural reſult, or effect of our Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy from God, muſt needs equally affect all thoſe who were in and with <hi>Adam,</hi> plunged into the ſame mire and dirt of Sin into which he fell. Thoſe who were alike dipt in the ſame corrupt Fountain, muſt needs be equally defiled by it.</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>Original Sin</hi> is <hi>naturally</hi> propagated from Parents unto their Children, is a truth whereof we have no reaſon to doubt. When <hi>Adam</hi> did eat of the forbidden fruit, he took a doſe of <hi>Poiſon,</hi> if I may ſo ſpeak: Not that I aſſert that the <hi>Fruit</hi> of which he partook was properly and naturally ſo; but the <hi>Sin</hi> which he then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was poiſon unto his <hi>Soul,</hi> and did moſt wofully infect it, producing many grievous Diſtempers in it: Yea his very Body was alſo affected with it. The Poiſon which he thus took, did immediatly infect his whole <hi>Spirit, Soul and Body:</hi> So that his nature was preſently moſt grievouſly depraved, his underſtanding darkned, his heart hardned, his affections diſordered, and all the members of his Body became the ready Inſtruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002677_0018_0FE606B43974ADE0"/>
And all his Poſterity partook equally of the Diſeaſes which he thus contracted: For he being infected and defiled, they could not be clean, but as proceeding from him were <hi>altogether Filthy:</hi> For the Diſtempers by Man thus contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed became <hi>hereditary,</hi> and were neceſſarily propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to his off ſpring. His Children were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly begotten in his own Sinful Likeneſs. <hi>Cain</hi> was evidently ſo, and <hi>Abel</hi> was a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and needed a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And of <hi>Seth</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>Adam begat him in his own likeneſs, after his Image;</hi> and this, after he had loſt <hi>God's Image,</hi> wherein he was created, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>NOR where they only <hi>Adam's</hi> immediate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who were thus infected, but the Diſtemper has kept ſpreading in the world, thro' all the Generations of the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> no one of them being free from it. Hence that in Job 14. 4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</hi> And Chap. 25 4. <hi>How can he be clean that is born of a woman?</hi> There is not therefore a Man, Woman or Child upon the Earth, but what may truly ſay with <hi>David,</hi> in Pſal. 51. 5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity; and in Sin did my mother conceive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS the Sin is the ſame, by which all Mankind are defiled; ſo the <hi>way</hi> of its conveyance to them all, is but one. It paſſeth to them in one and the ſame Channel of natural Generation: And ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually infects all unto whom it does deſcend, even all that come into the World in that way.</p>
            <p>III. AS Mankind do appear, from what has been already ſaid, to be equally under Sin; ſo <hi>God in his word ſpeaks of all men, as</hi> equally Sinful
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002677_0019_0FE606B5D864B870"/>
by nature. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> having in our <hi>Text</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us, that none of Mankind are by nature any better than others, but all equally under Sin; does in the following context (from <hi>verſe</hi> the 10<hi>th.</hi> to the 18<hi>th.</hi>) prove the Truth of what he ſaies; <hi>As it is written,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>There is none Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, no not one: There is none that under ſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, there is none that doeth good, no not one. Their throat is an open ſepulchre; with their tongues they have uſed deceit; the poiſon of aſp, is under their lips: Whoſe mouth is full of curſing and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood. Deſtruction and miſery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</hi> Theſe words the <hi>Apostle</hi> quotes out of the <hi>Pſalms, Proverbs</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to prove that all Men are by nature <hi>equally</hi> Sinful, and ſo <hi>very</hi> Sinful as is expreſſed in them: and then adds in verſe the 19<hi>th. Now what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith unto them, who are under the Law: that every mouth may be ſtopt, and all the world may become Guilty before God.</hi> The ſame truth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many other <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> As <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>And God ſaid that the wickedneſs of man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</hi> Jer. 17. 9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked; who can know it?</hi> Pſal. 58. 3, 4, 5. <hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they goe aſtray, as ſoon as they are born ſpeaking lies. Their Poiſon is like the Poiſon of a Serpent, they are like the deaf Adder that ſtoppeth her ear, which will

not hearken to the voice of Charmers, charming never ſo wiſely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE and many other ſuch like Texts of Scripture muſt needs be underſtood as ſpoken of Mankind conſider'd as in their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> eſtate, and as left unto themſelves, (for unto any others the deſcription given will not agree) and conſequently what is unto this effect ſaid of them, will hold reſpecting <hi>all</hi> ſuch as they are.</p>
            <p>BUT thus much for the Doctrinal Handling of the Point.</p>
            <p>THE APPLICATION or <hi>Improvement</hi> of the Truth inſiſted on, ſhall be briefly offered in a few Inferences. And,</p>
            <p>USE, 1. IF, as we have now heard, none of Mankind are, by Nature, any better than others, but all equally under Sin; we may from hence very naturally infer, That they are all <hi>exceeding wicked,</hi> and their <hi>condition very miſerable.</hi> If we conſider what the very <hi>worſt</hi> of Men on Earth <hi>actually</hi> be, we may in them ſee what all Men, and ſo even the beſt, <hi>by nature</hi> are. When we ſee or hear of any Perſons that are extreamly wicked, we are apt to cry out againſt them as very <hi>Miniſters</hi> of Impiety, and ſuch as are hated of God, and juſtly to be abhorred of Men; (and indeed ſo they are) but do we duly conſider, that <hi>we our ſelves,</hi> and even the <hi>beſt</hi> Men in the world, are as had by <hi>nature</hi> as <hi>they.</hi> Our <hi>hearts</hi> are by nature as <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked</hi> as theirs; and we ſhould have run into the <hi>ſame exceſſes</hi> in our Lives, as they have done, had not the Grace of God reſtrained us from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002677_0021_0FE6071D670FB5C8"/>
it. If we ſee, hear or read of, Covetous Perſons, Liars, Thieves, Adulteres, Murderers, or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereupon ask this queſtion, <hi>Are we better then they?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, <hi>No, in no wiſe;</hi> for it plainly appears, that we are all by nature, equally <hi>under Sin.</hi> If one of the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Catalogues of Sinners that could poſſibly be thought of (ſuppoſe that <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21,—32.) were ſet before us, we muſt own that we are by nature altogether as bad <hi>as they:</hi> Nay, we are naturally as bad as the very <hi>Devils</hi> are: Even worſe than we are able to Imagin. (<hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 9.) And our <hi>Miſery,</hi> while we are in our natural Eſtate, is proportionable to our Wickedneſs. While unconverted, we are in eſtate of <hi>condemnation,</hi> and the <hi>wrath of God abideth on us.</hi> We are, by nature <hi>children of wrath even as others;</hi> are under God's wrath and curſe, and ſo liable to all the Miſeries of this Life, to death it ſelf, and the pains of Hell for ever. We may ſee how this our forlorn and wretched Eſtate by Nature is ſet forth in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 2,—4.</p>
            <p>USE 2. WE may from the Truth before us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <hi>That Sinners cannot be Justified, and ſaved by any</hi> Legal <hi>Righteouſneſs of their own,</hi> but muſt be made Righteous, by the Righteouſneſs of another, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Righteous, if ever they obtain Life Eternal. This concluſion the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf has already drawn to our hands from the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we have had under our conſideration. His inference from it we have in our context, (<hi>v.</hi> 20, to the 28.) which I chuſe to expreſs in his own words. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>by the deeds of the Law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in God's
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002677_0022_0FE607272EB6C550"/>
ſight: for by the Law is the knowlege of Sin. But now the righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Even the righteouſneſs of God, which is by faith of Jeſus Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference: For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God; Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Christ: Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through ſaith in his blood, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God; To declare I ſay, his righteouſneſs: that he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus. Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude, that a man is juſtified by faith without the deeds of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſum of the matter is, that Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen into ſuch a Sinful and Miſerable Eſtate, as their Apoſtacy from God has brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, they can never be juſtified by any Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own, nor by any other than that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> provided by God, and revealed in the Goſpel. And this truth is alſo confirmed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2, to 8, and 11. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11. 12. and <hi>phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>IT is evident from <hi>Scripture,</hi> (1.) That unto Man's Juſtification before God, it is required, That he have a <hi>Perfect Righteouſneſs;</hi> ſuch a Righteouſneſs as the perfect Law of God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: And conſequently that ſuch as wou'd be Juſtified by a Righteouſneſs of their own perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, muſt perfectly fulfill the <hi>whole</hi> Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002677_0023_0FE606BC36E1E570"/>
out being guilty of any failure. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 12. (2.) That Mankind having once <hi>broken</hi> God's holy Law, they can never in their <hi>own Perſons</hi> fulfill it; for however exact they might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in their obedience, after their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance yet they muſt needs ſtill remain Sinners, in reſpect of their <hi>paſt offences:</hi> And therefore ſuch a Righteouſneſs cannot Juſtifie them in God's ſight, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. (3.) That therefore the <hi>only</hi> Righteouſneſs, by which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be Juſtified, is that wrought out by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and revealed in the Goſpel. As the Apoſtle plainly and fully ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, to the 26. and <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 18, 19. And hence it followeth (4) That that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are ſaid to be Juſtified, (whatever it may be ſuppoſed to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or include in it) cannot be our <hi>juſtifying Righteouſneſs;</hi> nor is it's being ſo, intended, when it is ſaid to be <hi>accounted for righteouſneſs unto ſuch as have it,</hi> Rom. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>FOR it is certain, <hi>that faith,</hi> by which we are ſaid to be juſtified, is in Scripture plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from <hi>that Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is received by it, and ſaid to be <hi>unto</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and which is ſaid to be <hi>without works</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> works of Men's own doing) <hi>imputed to them,</hi> Rom 3. 22. and 4. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>USE 3. WE may from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> juſtly infer, That if there be <hi>now any difference</hi> betwixt one and another of the ſinful race of Mankind, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Divine Grace has made it,</hi> and <hi>not they themſelves.</hi> It is not denied, but that there is now a great difference betwixt people, in reſpect of their Qualifications and Actions: and it is well if
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002677_0024_0FE6072A86B4B878"/>
the difference that is betwixt them, be duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and acknowledged. There are ſome <hi>Righteous Perſons</hi> that are <hi>more excellent than their Neighbours;</hi> Thoſe <hi>Saints</hi> in the Earth, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ones, in whom all our <hi>delight</hi> ſhould be. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 3.) There ſhould certainly be a <hi>reſpect</hi> ſhown unto ſuch, proportionable to the virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appearing in them. It is ſaid concerning a <hi>Godly Man,</hi> That <hi>in his eyes a vile perſon is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT now from <hi>whence ariſeth</hi> this difference, which we ſee betwixt one Perſon, or People, and another? If ſome are <hi>now</hi> better than others, is it owing to <hi>themſelves,</hi> that they are ſo? No ſurely, this cannot be: For <hi>being by nature no better</hi> than others, they can by nature <hi>do</hi> no better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do. If Perſons Hearts be juſt alike, their Tempers or Inclinations the very ſame, and have none of them any means and helps from <hi>without them,</hi> more than the other have, they will <hi>ſtill</hi> be and act both alike. But if <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe, who are alike by nature, do become better than others, we may conclude that ſome Influence upon them from <hi>without,</hi> has made that odds: and this can be aſcribed unto no other cauſe than the Soveraign and Diſtinguiſhing Grace of the Bleſſed God. Hence that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>What maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didst not receive?</hi> And that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. So then it is not of <hi>him that willeth,</hi> nor of <hi>him that runneth,</hi> but <hi>of God</hi> that ſheweth <hi>Mercy.</hi> If then there be any that are better than others, <hi>that</hi> God has made them ſo, who hath told us, <hi>He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and will have compaſſion on
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002677_0025_0FE6072C19F86830"/>
whom he will have compaſſion:</hi> And it becomes us to ſay as in <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE 4. WE may learn from the Truth inſiſted on, <hi>That Humility and Self Abaſement does very well become all the Children of the firſt Adam:</hi> and that even the <hi>beſt</hi> had need to take heed of Spiritual <hi>Pride,</hi> and be careful leſt in comparing themſelves with others, they be puffed up with Vain-Glory, while they reckon themſelves better than they.</p>
            <p>IT is certain that Mankind have generally a great <hi>propenſity</hi> this way. Such as enjoy extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary <hi>advantages,</hi> are apt to value themſelves too highly on the account of them, and to think that they have good <hi>qualifications</hi> anſwerable to the Privileges, with which they are favoured; when perhaps it is far otherwiſe. And then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puffed up in their own mind, they are apt to <hi>contemn</hi> and diſdain <hi>others,</hi> as tho' they were <hi>vile,</hi> compared with <hi>them.</hi> This was too much the temper and guiſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> while they were lifted up to Heaven in Privileges. They reckoned themſelves a moſt <hi>holy</hi> People, and Eſteemed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as <hi>unclean.</hi> In our <hi>Saviour's</hi> time and after it, they ſeemed to think they had gotten the <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of Religion, ſo that others had ſcarce any the leaſt Share of it. Nay, they could ſcarce endure that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould have the <hi>means</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered unto them. It is certain that ſuch a temper as this is very offenſive unto God: He obſerved it with diſpleaſure in ſome of his own viſible People of Old, who ſaid unto others. <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, come not near me; for I am holier than thou.</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002677_0026_0FE606BF13E97150"/>
               <hi>Theſe are a ſmoke in my noſe, a fire that burneth all the day.</hi> There be ſome that live very Vicious Lives, and by their Sins expoſe themſelves unto God's Judgments; But <hi>what then,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>are we,</hi> who are now reformed, <hi>any better than they? i.e.</hi> are we by nature ſo? <hi>No, in no wiſe: We are all</hi> equally <hi>under Sin.</hi> Thoſe who would keep Spiritual Pride out of their Hearts, ſhould ſeriouſly <hi>conſider this:</hi> and not forget, that if they do now at all <hi>differ</hi> from thoſe with whom they compare themſelves, it is GOD that has made them ſo to do. Such thoughts have a natural tendency to keep Men humble and low in their own Eyes; which it's our duty and intereſt to be. We ſhould <hi>not be High minded but fear,</hi> (Rom. 11. 20.) and take heed that we do not <hi>think ourſelves ſomething, when we are nothing, deceiving our own Souls.</hi> (Gal. 6 3.) But if we are indeed in any reſpect become better than others, let us not be proud of it, but ſay unto GOD, as in (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 1.) <hi>Not unto us</hi> O <hi>Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory.</hi> And we ſhould take the caution given us in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. partly before recited, <hi>what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doeſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>USE 5. WE may from the Doctrine diſcourſed on, draw this concluſion, <hi>That the Sinfulneſs of any People ought not to be looked upon, as a ſufficient ground of diſcouragment unto the People of God, from ſetting upon, and diligently proſecuting proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, for their Converſion and Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CHRISTIANS ſhould conſider, That being themſelves by nature as bad as the worſt, if this
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002677_0027_0FE606C024B19DA0"/>
had been ſufficient to diſcourage others from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting their Converſion, they might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſtill remained ſuch as by nature they were, and not have been made ſuch as through the Grace of God, they are now become. But we bleſs God, we have not been thus dealt withal.</p>
            <p>WHY then ſhould we be diſcouraged from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the Salvation of others; tho' they at preſent appear to us to be as bad, as all Men by nature are, according to the account in the Word of God given of them.</p>
            <p>MANY ſuch have been Converted and Saved. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> The Sovereign Grace of an Omnipotent God can cure the Blindneſs, and overcome the obſtinacy of any People, and make them willing in the day of his Power. If he has done this for us, why ſhould we be diſcouraged from uſing the proper means with others; that ſo we may ſee what free and rich Grace will in this way do for them? And tho' we ſhould not preſently diſcern ſuch good effects of our Endeavours as we deſire, we ſhould not preſently give over our Eſſays to ſave our periſhing Neighbours from Eternal ruin.</p>
            <p>HERE I cannot but think it proper to make a more <hi>particular Application</hi> of what I am ſaying under this Head unto the caſe of a miſerable People dwelling among us, and bordering upon us: I mean the Aboriginal <hi>Natives</hi> of this Land.</p>
            <p>THE Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> unto many of theſe, and the Succeſs which it has had among
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002677_0028_0FE6072F235F05F0"/>
them, has been formerly looked upon as none of the leaſt of the <hi>Glories</hi> of this Country, and GOD Himself has been Glorified on the account of it.</p>
            <p>NOW, tho' this work was formerly carried on with much of Life and Vigour, yet it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that there ſeems not of Later Years ſuch a Spirit among us to promote the good of the Indians: But on the Contrary, the work now goes on <hi>heavily,</hi> and many ſeem to labour under diſcouragements with reſpect to it; yea ſome will ſpeak as if there was ſcarce <hi>any good</hi> to be hoped for concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People here intended.</p>
            <p>BUT why ſhould we be ſo diſcouraged about them! They are no worſe <hi>by nature</hi> than others, or than we our ſelves. They are as <hi>capable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of good impreſſions, as the People of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation; And when it pleaſeth God to bleſs means for their good, there are the <hi>ſame effects</hi> produced thereby, as the ſame means do produce on others.</p>
            <p>I do not deny but that the number of ſuch as are <hi>vicious</hi> among them is very great; but then I ſhould not give God the Glory of his <hi>Grace</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in, and towards many of them, if I did not on this occaſion ſay, That there are (to the Eye of Chriſtian Charity,) a <hi>conſiderable number</hi> of <hi>Godly</hi> People among them, And I do now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I do not doubt but that there have been <hi>many hundreds</hi> (if I may not ſay ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands) of them ſaved, ſince the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel to them in this Land. There is ſcarce a Year paſſeth, wherein there are not ſome, more or leſs, who as far as can be Judged, <hi>die</hi> in the Lord. I am confident it is ſo with thoſe, with whom I am concerned; and I hope many are Saved in other Places alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:002677_0029_0FE606C1B27DC418"/>
I bear witneſs for God, that I do not perceive but that he as readily concurreth, by the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Spirit, with the means uſed for the good of the <hi>Indians,</hi> as with thoſe enjoyed by any other People. Tho' it be true, that as he delights to work by means, ſo the more <hi>ſutable</hi> the means are, the more grounds we have to expect his bleſſing to accompany them.</p>
            <p>IN a word, I think we have no reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from proſecuting with utmoſt diligence, the good deſign of Propagating the Goſpel among the <hi>Natives</hi> of this Land: And I take this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity (which is a more <hi>Public</hi> one than I could juſtly have expected,<note n="†" place="bottom">Being a the Audience of the <hi>General Court.</hi>
               </note>) to intreat all ſuch as are in any capacity for it, to endeavour a <hi>revival</hi> of this work, and a removal of the things that do impede the ſucceſsful carrying of it on; yea and diligently to conſider what further way and means may be uſed for the moſt ſucceſsful management of it.</p>
            <p>THE Honourable COMMISSIONERS for the Propagation of the Goſpel among the <hi>Indians,</hi> will doubtleſs think themſelves very deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein. And I here crave leave humbly, and with the greateſt Submiſſion to ſay, That I believe this to be an Affair worthy of the ſerious conſideration of the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>General COURT, or Aſſembly</hi> of this <hi>Province,</hi> and I am perſwaded that ſome things might yet be done by the <hi>Government</hi> here, which would have a very favourable aſpect on this work.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:002677_0030_0FE606CCAE9D9030"/>
I conclude this head, with asking the <hi>Prayers</hi> of my Hearers, That the Bleſſing of God may accompany all the means that are uſed for the good of the <hi>Indians;</hi> and that <hi>He</hi> would pleaſe to direct all thoſe that are more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with and for them, unto ſuch meaſures as may be moſt conducive to that end. I have frequently heard our Chriſtian <hi>Indians</hi> praying fervently for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches and Miniſters here, and elſe where: And I hope we ſhall not neglect to pray for them alſo. Let us intreat the Lord on their behalf, that his Spirit may be poured upon them from on high whereby of a <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> they may be made a <hi>Fruitful Field;</hi> and that they may yet be a People formed for him to ſhew forth his praiſe, and that he would pleaſe to ſay concerning them, that he will <hi>ſet his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the midst of them,</hi>—and that his <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle ſhall be with them,</hi> yea that he will be <hi>their God,</hi> and that they ſhall be <hi>his People!</hi>

We have all of us reaſon to cry out, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>O wretched men that we are! Who ſhall deliver us from the body of this Death.</hi> And we ſhould give our ſelves no reſt, till we have attained unto ſome comfortable aſſurance, that we are delivered from the Guilt and Dominion of Sin, and are able to rejoyce as <hi>not being under the Law but under Grace.</hi>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:002677_0031_0FE6073B27309F90"/>
WE ſhould look upon <hi>Sin,</hi> unto which we are naturally ſubject, as the <hi>worſt</hi> of all <hi>Evils;</hi> that <hi>abominable thing which God hateth;</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of all the penal or afflictive evils that do or can befall us: And we ſhould bleſs God for ſending his SON, the Lord from Heaven, to redeem us from our Sins; and bleſs <hi>Him</hi> for <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking</hi> the admirable work of our Redemption. We ſhould alſo be very thankful that the way of Salvation by a Redeemer is <hi>revealed</hi> unto us in the Goſpel, and ſhould all of us be deeply concerned, that we <hi>receive not the Grace of God in vain.</hi> As all Mankind are by nature equally under Sin, ſo they ſhould be all equally concerned to get deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from it.
