            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOU may eaſily apprehend, that the many interruptions to which perſonal viſits are liable, make it difficult for miniſters to find a convenient time, in which they may apply themſelves ſuitably and largely to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itted to their care, or at leaſt, if they reſolve to do it, will neceſſarily make their progreſs through large congregations very ſlow. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take this method of viſiting you <hi>while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> and of addreſſing you on the very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject of <hi>Family-Religion.</hi> For your own ſake, and the ſake of thoſe deareſt to you, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to give a calm attentive hearing. And I would particularly deſire, that if it be by any means practicable (as with a little contrivance and reſolution I hope it may) you would ſecure one hour on the morning of the Lord's day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you receive it, not merely to run over this letter in a curſory manner, but deliberately to weigh and conſider it, and to come to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, as in the ſight of God, that <hi>you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>heir dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and zeal in the duties I am recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to many, whom their own experience hath inſtructed in the pleaſures and advantages which flow from them; an experience which will enforce them more effectually than any thing which it is poſſible for me to ſay. Such will I hope, by what they read be confirmed in purſuing the good reſolution they have taken, and the good cuſtoms they have formed; and will alſo be excited more earneſtly to endeavor to contribute towards introducing the like, into other families over which they have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and eſpecially into thoſe which may branch out from their own, by the ſettlement of children or ſervants. In this view, as well as to awaken their thankfulneſs to divine grace, which hath inclined them to the diſcharges of their duty in ſo great, yet ſo frequently neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, an article of it, I hope the heads of praying families will not peruſe this letter in vain. But it is intended as an addreſs to thoſe, who have hitherto lived in the omiſſion of it: And if there were <hi>but one</hi> ſuch maſter of a family under my care, I would gladly ſubmit to the labor in which I am now engaging <hi>for his ſake alone.</hi> To ſuch therefore I now turn myſelf; and Oh that divine grace might engage every one of ſuch a character to hear me with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037329_0004_100CB937679C32A0"/>attention, and might inforce upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the weight of reaſons, the evidence of which the loweſt may receive, and to which it is impoſſible that the higheſt ſhould find any thing ſolid to object!</p>
            <p>Oh my dear friend, whoever you are (for I know not one under my care to whom I may not addreſs that appellation) give me leave to tell you plainly, that while I write this I have that awakening ſcripture in my view: <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon THE FAMILIES THAT CALL NOT ON THY NAME.</hi> I appeal to you as a man of ordinary ſenſe and underſtanding (as it needs no more) to judge whether this do not ſtrongly imply that it may be taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>every Family</hi> which is not a <hi>heathen family,</hi> which is not quite ignorant of the living and true God, <hi>will call upon his name.</hi> Well may it then pain my heart, to think that there ſhould be a profeſſed <hi>Chriſtian Family,</hi> whom this dreadful character ſuits. Well may it pain my heart, to think of the <hi>divine fury,</hi> which may be <hi>poured out</hi> on the heads and on the members of it: And well may it make me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, to do my utmoſt to ſecure you and yours, from every appearance, from every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, of ſuch danger. Excuſe the earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which I may addreſs you. I really fear, leſt <hi>while you delay,</hi> the <hi>fire</hi> of the divine diſpleaſure ſhould <hi>fall upon you:</hi> And as I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the patience of God in having thus long
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037329_0005_100CB938EC362168"/>ſuſpended the ſtorm, I am anxious about eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour's delay, leſt it ſhould fall the heavier.</p>
            <p>I will therefore, as plainly and ſeriouſly as I can, endeavour to convince you of your duty, if peradventure you are not already ſecretly convinced of it; as truly I believe, moſt who neglect it, under the regular adminiſtration of goſpel ordinances, are.</p>
            <p>I will then touch on a few of the objections, which have been pleaded to excuſe in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſo ſhameful an omiſſion. And this will naturally lead me to conclude with a few hints, which may ſerve by way of direction, for the proper introduction and diſcharge of the ſervic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to which I am endeavouring to engage you.</p>
            <p>I mean not to handle the ſubject at large, which would afford abundant matter for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable volume; as indeed ſeveral volumes have been written upon it by divines of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent denominations, who, however various in other opinions, agree here; as what intelligent chriſtian can diſagree? But I mean to ſuggeſt a few plain things, which it is evident you have not ſufficiently conſidered, and which if duly weighed, may be the bleſſing of God anſwer my preſent purpoſe. Now the arguments I ſhall propoſe will be ſuch, that if you will not regard them, little is to be hoped from any other: For ſurely the mind of man can diſcover none of greater and more univerſal importance; though I readily acknowledge, that many others might inforce them with greater energy and addreſs.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037329_0006_100CB93A71239318"/>Yet if the moſt earneſt deſires of ſucceeding can add any of the proper arts of perſuaſion, they will not be wanting here. And I would fain ſpeak, as one who conſiders, how much of the glory of God, how much of your own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and that of your dear children, for time and eternity, depend on the ſucceſs of what I am now to lay before you.</p>
            <p>What I deſire and intreat of you is, that you will honour and acknowledge God in your fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies, by calling them together every day to hear ſome parts of his word read to them, and to offer for a few minutes at leaſt, your united confeſſions, prayers and praiſes to him. And is this a cauſe, that ſhould need to be pleaded at large by a great variety of united motives? Truly the petition ſeems ſo reaſonable, and a compliance with it from one who has not quite renounced religion might ſeem ſo natural, that one would think the bare propoſing it might ſuffice. Yet experience tells us, it is much otherwiſe. Ths letter will come into the hands of ſome, who, though they maintain a public profeſſion of religion, have been again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain exhorted to it in vain, and that perhaps for ſucceeding years. I might ſay a great deal to <hi>upbraid</hi> ſuch eſpecially, on account of this neglect; but I rather chuſe to <hi>intreat</hi> to the future performance of the duty; humbly hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, criminal as former negligence has been, a gracious God will mercifully forgive it, to thoſe who repent and deſire to reform.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037329_0007_100CB93CB19F6268"/>
And oh that I could engage you to this, by repreſenting in the plaineſt, kindeſt, and moſt affectionate manner, the <hi>reaſonableneſs,</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> of this duty! for if it be reaſonable, if it be evidently advantageous, there are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs <hi>general precepts of Scripture,</hi> which muſt comprehend and enforce it, if it were leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſupported than it is by <hi>particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages;</hi> which yet, as I ſhall preſently ſhew, do many of them ſtrongly recommend it to us.</p>
            <p>Conſider, ſir, for I addreſs myſelf to every particular perſon, ſeriouſly conſider <hi>the appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſonableneſs of family religion.</hi> Muſt not your conſciences preſently tell you, it is ſit that perſons who receive ſo many mercies together, ſhould acknowledge them together? can you in your own mind be ſatisfied, that you and your neareſt relatives ſhould pay no joint hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to that God, who hath ſet you in your family, and who hath given to you, and to the ſeveral members of it, ſo many domeſtic en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments? your Creator and theirs, your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver and theirs, your daily Benefactor and theirs? can it be right, if you have any ſenſe of theſe things each of you in your own hearts, that the ſenſe of them ſhould be concealed and ſmothered there, and that you ſhould never join in your grateful acknowledgment to him? can you imagine it reaſonable, that when you have a conſtant dependence upon him for ſo many mercies, without the concurrence of which your family would be a ſcene of miſery,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037329_0008_100CB940247DA8D8"/>you ſhould never preſent yourſelves together in his preſence, to aſk them at his hand? up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what principles, is public worſhip to be recommended and urged, if not by ſuch as have their proportionable weight here?</p>
            <p>Indeed the force of theſe conſiderations hath not only been known and acknowledged by the People of God in all ages; we have not only <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham, Joſhua</hi> and <hi>David, Job</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> each under a much darker diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation than ours, examples of it: but we may venture to ſay, that wherever there has been a profeſſion of any kind of religion, it has been brought into private houſes as well as public temples. The poor <hi>heathens,</hi> as we certainly know from the remaining monuments of them, had their <hi>Lares</hi> and their <hi>Penates,</hi> which were houſhold images, ſome of them in private chapels, and others about the common hearth, where the family uſed to worſhip them by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayers and ſacrifices. And the <hi>braſs,</hi> and <hi>wood,</hi> and <hi>ſtone,</hi> of which they conſiſted, ſhall (as it were) <hi>cry out againſt you,</hi> ſhall riſe up againſt you and condemn you, if while you call yourſelves the worſhippers of the one liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Eternal God, and boaſt in the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you have received by his prophets and by his Son, you preſume to omit an homage, which the ſtupid worſhippers of ſuch vanities as theſe failed not to preſent to them, while they called them their Gods. Be perſuaded then I beſeech you, be conſiſtent in your
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037329_0009_100CB94249ACFD60"/>conduct. Either give up all pretences to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or maintain a ſteady and uniform regard to it, at home as well as abroad, in the family as well as in the cloſet, or at Church. But the reaſonableneſs of this duty, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations which bind you in conſcience to the practice of it, will farther appear, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>The many advantages, which will, by the divine bleſſing, attend a proper diſcharge of it. And here, I would more particularly repreſent the good influence, which family devotions are likely to have, upon the young perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care, upon your own hearts, and upon the advancement of a general refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the propagation of religion to thoſe that are yet unborn.</p>
            <p>Conſider in the firſt place, what is moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, the happy influence which the duty I am r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ught to conſider your <hi>ſervants,</hi> in this view, with a tender regard. They are proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the flower of life, for that is the age which is commonly ſpent in ſervice; and you
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037329_0010_100CB9446E690EC8"/>ſhould recollect how poſſible it is, that may be if rightly improved, the beſt opportunity their whole life may afford them for learning relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and being brought under the power of it. If your ſervants are already inſtructed in it, by being brought up in families where theſe duties have been maintained; let them not, if they ſhould finally miſcarry, have cauſe to impute it to you, and to teſtify before God in the day of their condemnation, "that it was under your roof that they learnt the neglect and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God, and of all that their pious parents, perhaps in a much infecrior ſtation of life to you, had in earlier days been attempting to teach them; to teach them, in moments ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from labour, or from repoſe almoſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their ſubſiſtence. On the other hand if they came to you quite ignorant of religion (as if they came from prayerleſs families, it is probable that they do) have compaſſion upon them, I entreat you, and endeavour to give them thoſe advantages which they never yet had; and which it is too probable, as things are generally managed, they never will have, if you will not afford them.</p>
            <p>But I would eſpecially, if I might be allowed to borrow the pathetic words of <hi>Job, intreat you by the children of your own body.</hi> I would now as it were preſent them all before you, and beſeech you by all the bowels of parental affection (which I have myſelf ſo ſtrongly felt) that to all the other tokens of tenderneſs and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037329_0011_100CB94696C160E0"/>love you would not refuſe to add this, without which many of the reſt may be worſe than in vain.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to plead with you, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of introducing them into being. O remember, it is indeed a debaſed and corrupted nature you have conveyed to them. Conſider that the world, into which you have been the means of bringing them, is a place in which they are ſurrounded with many temptations, and in which, as they advance in life, they muſt expect many more, ſo that in plain terms, it is on the whole much to be feared, that they will periſh in the ignorance and forgetfulneſs of God, if they do not learn from you to love and ſerve him. For how can it be expected they ſhould learn this at all, if you give them no advantages for receiving and practiſing the leſſon at home?</p>
            <p>And let me further urge and intreat you to remember, that theſe dear children, whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age, and perhaps amiable forms and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, might attract the affection and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſtrangers, are committed to your eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial and immediate care by God their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. And he has made them thus dependent upon you, and others that have in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and childhood the care of them, that there might be hereafter a better opportunity of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their minds, and of influencing them to a right temper and conduct. And can this by any means be effectually done, if you do not
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037329_0012_100CB948B9D56F68"/>at proper times call them together, to attend to the inſtructions of the word of God, and to join in ſolemn prayers and ſupplication to him? at leaſt is it poſſible it ſhould be done any other way with equal advantage, if this be not added to the reſt?</p>
            <p>Family worſhip is a moſt proper way of teaching children religion, as you teach them language, by inſenſible degrees; a little one day and a little another; for to them <hi>line muſt he upon line, and precept upon precept.</hi> They may learn to conceive aright of the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which they hear you daily acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edging and adoring them: Their hearts may be early touched with pious remorſe for ſin, when they hear your confeſſions out before God: They will know what mercies they are to aſk for themſelves, by obſerving what turn your petitions take; your interceſſions may diffuſe into their minds a ſpirit of love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, a concern for the intereſt of the church, and of their country; and what is not, I think, by any means to be neglected, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of loyalty towards thoſe in authority over us, when they hear you daily invoking the divine bleſſings upon them: And your ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn thankſgivings for the bounties of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and for benefits of a ſpiritual nature, may affect their hearts with thoſe gracious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions towards the gracious author of all, which may excite in their little breaſts love to him, the moſt noble and genuine principle of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037329_0013_100CB94ADF9261D8"/>all true and acceptable religion. Thus they may become chriſtians by inſenſible degrees, and grow in the knowledge and love of the truth, as they do in ſtature.</p>
            <p>By obſerving your reverent and ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment (as reverent and ſolemn I hope it will always at ſuch ſeaſons be) they may get ſome notion of an inviſible Being, before they are of age to underſtand the definition of the term God; and may feel their minds ſecretly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with an humble awe and veneration, before they can explain to you their ſenſe of it. And whatever inſtructions you give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his nature and his will, and the way of obtaining his favor by Jeſus Chriſt, all your admonitions relating to the importance of that inviſible world we are going to, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary preparation for it will be greatly illuſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tenor of your daily devotions, as well as by thoſe excellent leſſons which the word of God, when ſolemnly read to them morning and evening, will afford. Nor is it by any means to be forgotten, that while they hear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own concerns, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in prayer, while they hear you earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly pleading for the divine bleſſings upon them (eſpecially if it be in expreſſions wiſely varied, as ſome particular occurrences in their lives and in yours may require) it may very probably be a means of moving their impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts; as it may powerfully convince them of your deep and tender concern for their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037329_0014_100CB94D09B9AF60"/>good, and may add great weight to the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you may addreſs to them: So that it may appear, even <hi>while you are praying for them,</hi> that God <hi>hears.</hi> And indeed I have known ſome inſtances of excellent perſons, who have dated their converſion to God, even after they had begun viſibly to degenerate, from the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, from the ſerious and pathetic prayers, which they have heard their pious fathers, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might add their pious mothers, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God on their account.</p>
            <p>Indeed were this duty properly attended to, it might be expected, that all chriſtian families would, according to their reſpective ſizes and circumſtances, become nurſeries of piety; and you would ſee in the moſt convinſing view, the wiſdom of providence, in making human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſo much more dependent on their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and ſo much more incapable to ſhift for themſelves, than the offspring of inferior crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are.</p>
            <p>Let me then intreat you, my dear friend, to look on your children the very next time you ſee them, and aſk your own heart, how you can anſwer it to God, and to them, that you deprive them of ſuch advantages as theſe? ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, without which it is to be feared, your care of them in other reſpects will turn to but little account, ſhould they be ever ſo proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in life. For what is proſperity in life without the knowledge, and fear, and love of God? what, but the poiſon of the ſoul, which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037329_0015_100CB94FD06937B8"/>ſwells and kills it? what but the means of making it more certainly, more intolerably miſerable; when all its tranſient and empty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements are paſſed away, <hi>like a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ally, from what I was ſaying of the concern and intereſt of thoſe under your care, to your own, ſo far as it may be diſtinguiſhed from theirs.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore preſs you to conſider, how much <hi>your own intereſt</hi> is concerned in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the whole of your intereſt, both ſpiritual and temporal. Your <hi>ſpiritual intereſt</hi> is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037329_0016_100CB95153A09CC8"/>the greateſt, and therefore will begin with that. And here let me ſeriouſly aſk you, do you not need thoſe advantages for religion, which the performance of family duty will give you, added to thoſe of a more ſecret and a more public nature, if peradventure they are regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you? theſe inſtructions, theſe adorations, theſe confeſſions, theſe ſupplications, theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions, theſe thankſgivings, which may be ſo uſeful to your children and ſervants, may they not be uſeful to yourſelves? may not your own hearts have ſome peculiar advantage for being impreſſed, when you are the mouth of others in theſe domeſtic devotions, beyond what in a private ſtation of life it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe poſſible you ſhould have? Oh theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of religion to your own ſouls, every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, might be (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion,) either the ſeed, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte, of ſalvation to you. Nay, the remoter influence they may have on your conduct, in other reſpects, and at other times, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered merely in the general as religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes performed by you in your family, is to be recollected as an argument of vaſt importance.</p>
            <p>A ſenſe of common decency would engage you, if you pray with your family, to <hi>avoid a great many evils,</hi> which would appear <hi>doubly evil</hi> in a father or a maſter, who kept up ſuch religious exerciſes in his houſe. I will not now, ſir, ſpeak of yourſelf, for I would not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend by ſuppoſing any thing groſsly bad of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037329_0017_100CB953B263C3D8"/>you. But do you imagine, that if reading the ſcripture and family prayer were introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſes of ſome of your neighbours, drunkenneſs and lewdneſs, and curſing and ſwearing, and profaning the Lord's day, would not, like ſo many <hi>evil demons,</hi> be quickly driven out? the maſter of the family would not for ſhame indulge them, if he had nothng more than the form of duty kept up; and <hi>his</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation though only external, and at firſt on a kind of conſtraint, would carry with it the reformation of many more, who have ſuch a dependence on his favour as they would not ſacrifice, though by a madneſs very prevalent among the children of men they can venture to ſacrifice their ſouls to every trifle.</p>
            <p>And may it not perhaps be your more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate concern, to recollect, that if you pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your family, you would <hi>yourſelf</hi> be more careful to <hi>abſtain from all appearance of evil?</hi> you would find out a way to ſuppreſs that turbulency of paſſion, which may now be ready to break out before you are aware, and other imprudences, in which your own heart would check you by ſaying, "does this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one, that is by and by to kneel down with his domeſtics, his children and ſervants, and adore God with them, and pray againſt every thing which diſpleaſes God, and makes us unfit for the heavenly world? I will not ſay this will cure every thing that is wrong; but I believe you are already perſuaded, it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037329_0018_100CB95537B05900"/>would often have a very good influence. And I fear, it is the ſecret deſire of indulging ſome irregularities without ſuch a reſtraint, that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous as ſuch a victory is, hath driven out family prayer from ſeveral houſes where it was once maintained, and hath excluded it from others. But if you have any ſecret diſinclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart riſing againſt it in this view, it becomes you ſeriouſly to take the alarm; for, to ſpeak plainly, I have hardly known a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſymptom of damnation, than a fear of being reſtrained in the commiſſion of ſin.</p>
            <p>After this it may ſeem a matter of ſmaller importance, to urge the good influence which a proper diſcharge of family duty may have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own temporal affairs; both by reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>training you from many evils and engaging you to a proper conduct yourſelf, and alſo by impreſſing your children and ſervants, with a ſenſe of religion. And it is certain, the more careful they are of their duty to God, the more likely they will be to perform their duty to you. Nor can any thing ſtrengthen your nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural authority among them more than your preſiding in ſuch ſolemnities, if ſupported by a ſuitable conduct. But I would hope nobler motives will have a ſuperior weight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore waving this topic, I intreat you as the laſt argument to conſider,</p>
            <p>The influence it may have on a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and on the propagation of religion to thoſe who are yet unborn. You ought to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037329_0019_100CB958A5C28CB8"/>conſider every child and ſervant in your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as one who may be a ſource, not only of life, but (in ſome degree) of character and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to thoſe who are hereafter to ariſe into being: yea, whoſe conduct may in part affect thoſe that are to deſcend from them in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing generation. If they grow up while un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your eye, ignorant of religion, they will certainly be much leſs capable of teaching it to others; for theſe are the years of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and if they be neglected now, there is little probability of their receiving after-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Nor is this all the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for it is highly probable that they will think themſelves authoriſed by your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a like negligence, and ſo you may entail heatheniſm under diſregarded chriſtian forms, on your deſcendants and theirs in ages to come. Whereas your diligence and zeal might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered and imitated by them, perhaps when you are in your grave; and the ſtock which they firſt received from you, might with rich improvements be communicated to great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſo that one generation after another might learn to fear and ſerve the Lord. On the whole, God only knows what a church may ariſe from one godly family, what a harveſt may ſpring up from a ſingle ſeed; and on the other hand, it is impoſſible to ſay, how many ſouls may at length periſh by the treacherous neglect of a ſingle perſon, and to ſpeak plainly, by your own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037329_0020_100CB95A29FAFA90"/>
Theſe, ſir, are the arguments I had to plead with you, and which I have ſelected out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more: And now give me leave ſeriouſly to aſk you, as in the preſence of God, whether there be not on the whole an unanſwerable force in them? And if there be, what follows, but that you immediately yield to that force, and ſet up family-worſhip <hi>this very day.</hi> For methinks, I would hardly thank you for a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution to do it <hi>to-morrow,</hi> ſo little do I expect from that reſolution. How can you excuſe yourſelf in the continued omiſſion? Bring the matter before God. He will be the final judge of it: and if you cannot debate the queſtion as in his preſence, it is a ſign of a bad cauſe, and of a bad heart too; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the badneſs of the cauſe, and yet will not give it up, nor comply with a duty, of your obligations to which you are ſecretly convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet in effect ſay, "I will go on in this ſin, and venture, the conſequence." Oh it is a dreadful venture, and will be found in effect <hi>provoking the Lord to jealouſy, as if you were ſtronger than he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps there may ariſe in your mind ſome objections, which may in ſome degree break the force of this conviction, and which in that view it may be expedient for me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs a little, before I diſmiſs the ſubject, and cloſe my addreſs to you. You may perhaps be ready to object,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:037329_0021_100CB95C4EFB1158"/>
1. "That <hi>family-prayer is not</hi> in ſo many words <hi>commanded in ſcripture;</hi> and therefore however expedient in ſome caſes, it cannot be ſo univerſal and ſo important a duty, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it."</p>
            <p>I anſwer plainly, that it is ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in ſcripture, and conſequentially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; as there are precepts, which plainly include, though they do not particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it. And I appeal to yourſelf in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When God is repreſented as giving this reaſon to his angels for a particular favor to be beſtowed on <hi>Abraham</hi> becauſe <hi>be knew, that be would command his children and houſhold to keep the way of the Lord, that he might obtain the bleſſing promiſed;</hi> did he not intend to declare his approbation of the care he took to ſupport religion in his family? And can it be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a total neglect of prayer? Again, do you not in your conſcience think, that the ſpirit of God meant, that we ſhould take <hi>Joſhua</hi> for an example, when he tells us that he reſolved and publicly declared the reſolution, <hi>that he and his houſe would ſerve the Lord;</hi> which muſt expreſs a religious care of his family too? Do you not believe, that this bleſſed ſpirit meant it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Job</hi> that he <hi>offered-ſacrifices for all his children;</hi> ſacrifices, undoubtedly attended with prayers; when he feared leſt the gaity of their hearts in their ſucceſſive feaſting might have betrayed them into ſome moral evil? And was it not to do an honor to <hi>David,</hi> that the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037329_0022_100CB95F1C8CEA08"/>Scripture informs us, that he <hi>we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> home to bleſs his houſhold;</hi> that is, to perform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> me ſolemn act of domeſtic worſhip when he had been ſpending the whole day in public devotions; What think you of the example of <hi>Daniel</hi> who prayed in his houſe, with his windows open towards Jeruſalem, and would rather run the riſque of being caſt into the den of Lions, and being torn in pieces by thoſe cruel beaſts, than he would either omit or conceal it? And do you think, that when our bleſſed Lord, whoſe whole life was employed in religious ſervices, ſo frequently <hi>took his diſciples apart to pray with them,</hi> that he did not intend this as an example to us, of praying with thoſe under our ſpecial care or in other words, with the members of our own family, who are moſt immediately ſo? Or can you by any imaginable artifice delude yourſelf ſo far as to think, that when we are ſolemnly charged and commanded to pray <hi>with all prayer and ſupplication,</hi> this kind of prayer is not included in that apoſtolical injunction.</p>
            <p>On the whole, the queſtion lies in a very little room.—Have I proved by what I have ſaid before, that <hi>family-prayer</hi> is a reaſonable thing? That it has a tendency to promote the honor of God, and the intereſt of religion, and your own ſalvation, with that of thoſe who are committed to your care? If you are really convinced of this, then all the general precepts which require the love of God and your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, all that recommend a regard to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037329_0023_100CB9614A6AFE00"/>of Chriſt, and a concern for our own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs, bind it in this connection as certainly upon us, as if it had been command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in words as expreſs as thoſe, in which we are required <hi>to enter into our cloſets, and there to pray to our father which is in ſecret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I will farther add, that if the care of <hi>family religion</hi> be (as I ſuppoſe every man's conſcience will ſecretly teſtify that it is) a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of <hi>religious education,</hi> then all thoſe many paſſages of ſcripture which recommend this, muſt in all reaſon be underſtood as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that. But perhaps you may be ready to plead,</p>
            <p n="2">2. "That it is <hi>generally neglected.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Yet ſcarce can you have made or thought of this objection, but you will ſee at the firſt glance, that this muſt turn upon yourſelf, rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than on the whole appeal favourable to your cauſe. It is the reproach of our age, if it be indeed <hi>generally neglected.</hi> And if it be generally excluded from the families of the rich and the great (who too frequently ſet the faſhion, where they are moſt apt to ſet it wrong) let it rather awaken a generous indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in our breaſt, to think that it is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. At leaſt, let it awaken a holy zeal to exert ourſelves ſo much the more, as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that no aſſociation in vice can ſecure thoſe that join in it: for it is expreſsly ſaid, <hi>though hand join in hand, the wicked ſhall not be unpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed.</hi> So will your obedience be the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037329_0024_100CB962CEE0F5C0"/>in proportion to the degree in which it is ſingular. Were there not one praying family in the whole nation, in the whole world, methinks it ſhould inſtigate you to the practice rather than tempt you to the neglect, and you ſhould preſs on as ambitious of the glory of <hi>leading the way,</hi> for what could be a nobler object of ambition, than to be pointed out by the bleſſed God himſelf, as <hi>Job</hi> was; of whom he ſaid, with a kind of triumph, <hi>haſt thou conſidered my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the land,</hi> or even <hi>on the earth?</hi> But bleſſed by God, this ſuppoſed <hi>univerſal neglect</hi> is far from being the caſe. Let it however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice us, if God may ſay, "There are ſuch and ſuch families, diſtinguiſhable from thoſe in the neighborhood on this account; as prevalent as the neglect of <hi>family prayer</hi> is, they have the reſolution to practiſe it, and like my ſervant <hi>Daniel</hi> fear not the reproach and contempt which profane and ungodly men may caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, if they may but honor me and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my favor, <hi>I know them; I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I might cut the objection ſhort at once, by applying to your conſcience, whether you have not time for many other things which you know to be of leſs importance. How many hours
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037329_0025_100CB96454897DF8"/>in a week do you find for amuſement, while you have none for devotion in your family? And do you indeed hold the bleſſing of God ſo very cheap, and think it a matter of ſo little importance, that you conclude your buſineſs muſt ſucceed the worſe, if a few minutes were daily taken ſolemnly to ſeek it together? Let me rather admoniſh you, that the greater your buſineſs is, the more need you have to pray earneſtly, that your hearts may not be engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. And I would beg leave further to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, that if your hurry of buſineſs were indeed ſo great as the objection ſuppoſes (which I believe is ſeldom the caſe) prudence alone might ſuggeſt, that you ſhould endeavor to contract it. For there are certain boundaries, beyond which a wiſe and faithful care cannot extend; and as an attempt to go beyond theſe boundaries has generally its foundation in av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arice, it often has its ends in poverty and ruin. But if you were ever ſo ſecure of ſucceeding for this world, how dear might you and your children pay for that ſucceſs, if all the bleſſed conſequences of <hi>family religion,</hi> for time and for eternity, were to be given up as the price of that very ſmall part of your gains, which is owing to the minutes you take from theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, that you may give them to the world? For you plainly perceive the queſtion is only about <hi>them,</hi> and by no means about a ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous application to the proper duties of your ſecular calling through the day. And if you
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037329_0026_100CB965EEBB0340"/>
               <hi>will be rich</hi> upon ſuch <hi>profane terms,</hi> as are here ſuppoſed (for truly I can call them no better than profane) you will probably <hi>plunge yourſelf into</hi> final <hi>perdition,</hi> and may in the mean time <hi>pierce yourſelf through with many ſorrows;</hi> while religious families learn by bleſſed experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>the bleſſing of the Lord,</hi> which they are ſo often imploring together <hi>maketh rich, and addeth no ſorrow with it;</hi> or that <hi>a little with the fear of the Lord is better than great treaſure, with</hi> that intermingled <hi>trouble,</hi> which in the neglect of God muſt neceſſarily be expected. But I conclude that yet more will be objecting,</p>
            <p n="4">4. "That they <hi>want ability</hi> for a work of this kind."</p>
            <p>To this I muſt in the firſt place reply, that where the hearts is rightly diſpoſed, it does not require any <hi>uncommon abilities,</hi> to diſcharge <hi>family worſhip</hi> in a decent and edifying ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>The heart of a wiſe man</hi> and good <hi>man</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this reſpect <hi>teacheth his mouth, and addeth knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge to his lips;</hi> and <hi>out of the fulneſs of it,</hi> when it is indeed full of pious affections, <hi>the mouth will</hi> naturally <hi>ſpeak.</hi> And if it ſpeak natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the man properly, it is enough.— There is no need at all of ſpeaking elegantly. The plaineſt and ſimpleſt language, in addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the Majeſty of heaven, appears to me far preferable to labored, pompous and artificial expreſſions. Plain ſhort ſentences, uttered juſt as they riſe in the mind, will be beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them that join with you. And it
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037329_0027_100CB968D21F1190"/>ſhould on ſuch occaſions be our endeavor, to <hi>let ourſelves down,</hi> as much as poſſible, to the underſtanding of the leaſt and meaneſt of them. And this will in itſelf be more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, than any thing which ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from oſtentation and parade.</p>
            <p>I muſt alſo deſire you to conſider, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Helps</hi> you may eaſily procure. The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is a large and noble magazine of the moſt proper ſentiments, and moſt expreſſive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; which, if your will attend to with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming regard, will ſoon <hi>furniſh you for every good word and work,</hi> and moſt apparently for this. And beſides this, we have in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage a great variety of excellent <hi>forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> for families as well as for private perſons; which you may uſe, at leaſt at firſt, with great profit. And if it be too laborious to you to learn them by heart, or if having learnt them you dare not truſt your memory, what ſhould forbid your <hi>reading them</hi> reverently and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly? I hope I ſhall give no offence to any good chriſtian by ſaying, but on this occaſion I ſhould offend my conſcience by not ſaying, that I have long thought an irreconcilable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to <hi>forms of prayer,</hi> even of human com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as vain a ſuperſtition, as a paſſionate attachment to them. And if any had rather, that a family ſhould be prayerleſs, than that a well choſen form ſhould be gravely and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnly read in it, I think he judges as abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he would rather ſee them ſtarving to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037329_0028_100CB96B04D27388"/>death, than fed out of a diſh whoſe materials or ſhape are diſagreeable to him. The main thing is, that God be reverently and ſincerely adored, that ſuitable bleſſings, temporal and ſpiritual, be ſought from him for ourſelves and others, and cordial thankſgivings returned to him for the various gifts of his continual boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And if this be done, the circumſtances of doing it, though I cannot think them quite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, are comparatively of ſmall import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I know by ſure experience, in a great variety of inſtances, that it is very poſſible for chriſtians of no extraordinary genius, and with a very low education, to acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves honorably in prayer without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>forms:</hi> And they who at firſt need them may, and probably, if they ſeriouſly ſet about it would ſoon outgrow that need. But if they did not, God might be glorified, and families edified, by the continued uſe of ſuch helps. And on the whole, if it be indeed come to this, that you would rather ſacrifice all the benefits of <hi>family-prayer,</hi> than ſubmit to the trouble of reading, or appointing another to read, a well compoſed addreſs, which perhaps, with a ſmall portion of ſcripture before it might not take up one quarter of an hour's time, indeed, you muſt be condemned by God, and your own conſcience. In ſuch a view both muſt teſtify, that it is neither want of leiſure, nor want of ability, that prevents your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging your duty, but a ſtupid indifference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037329_0029_100CB96D2EF54938"/>it, or rather a wretched averſion to it; the natural conſequence of which might, if a little reflected upon, be ſufficient to throw the moſt careleſs and arrogant ſinner into an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alarm, if not a trembling conſternation.</p>
            <p>I apprehend, that the moſt plauſible objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have now been canvaſſed; for I ſuppoſe, few will be ſo weak and cowardly as to plead,</p>
            <p n="5">5. "That their domeſtics <hi>will not ſubmit,</hi> to the introduction of ſuch orders as theſe."</p>
            <p>But as it may be ſecretly thought of, where it would not be pleaded, eſpecially where theſe duties have unhappily been omitted when fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies were firſt formed, and in their moſt flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pliant ſtate, I will beſtow a few words on this head.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt deſire, that you would not raſhly conclude this to be the caſe, with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to your own. Do you think ſo unkindly of your domeſtics, if they be not extremely wicked indeed, as to imagine they would be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly diſcontented with ſpending a little time daily in hearing the word of God, and being preſent at your domeſtic devotion; much leſs ſhould you allow yourſelf to think, till it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in fact, that they will have the arrogance openly to diſpute ſo reaſonable a determination as this. Perhaps on the contrary, they are even now ſecretly wiſhing that God would put it into your heart to make the attempt; and thinking with a kind of tender regret, "Why are we denied ſuch a bleſſing, when
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037329_0030_100CB96F67152080"/>the members of this and that family in the neighborhood are favored with it?"</p>
            <p>But if it be indeed as you ſuppoſe, that they would think of it with a ſecret averſion and come into it with apparent reluctance, if they can be induced to come into it at all; you would do well to reflect, whether this profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perverſeneſs may not in a great meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, be owing to that very neglect which I am now preſſing you to reform? Which if it be, it ought certainly to convince you in the moſt powerful and effectual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, of the neceſſity of endeavoring to repair as ſoon as poſſible the miſchief already done. And if there be really an <hi>oppoſition,</hi> you ought to let any in whom you diſcover it, know, that your meaſures are fixed, and that you <hi>cannot</hi> and <hi>will not</hi> reſign that juſt authority, which the laws of God and man give you in your own houſe, to the petulancy of their humor, or the impiety of their unhappy temper.— Make the trial whether they will dare to break with you, rather than ſubmit to ſo eaſy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as that of being preſent at your hours of family worſhip. If it be a <hi>ſervant</hi> that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes it, you will no doubt think it a great bleſſing to your family to rid it of ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a member, in that relation. And if it be a <hi>child,</hi> grown up to years that ſhould be years of diſcretion, that ſets himſelf againſt this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (and it is not poſſible that any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould oppoſe you) though it is certain, that
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037329_0031_100CB9724B6E4500"/>ſuch a <hi>ſon of Belial</hi> be, he muſt be a great grief to your heart, you will be delivered from a great deal of diſtreſs which the ſight of his wickedneſs muſt daily give you, by refuſing him a place in your own family, which he would only diſgrace and corrupt, and leaving him to practiſe thoſe irregularities and ſcandals which always go along with ſuch a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contempt of religion, any where elſe than under your own roof.</p>
            <p>I can think of but one objection more, and that is,</p>
            <p n="6">6. "That you may not know <hi>how to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> a practice which you have ſo long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected."</p>
            <p>But this is an objection ſo very ſoon remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I hope if nothing elſe lie in the way, your family will not continue another week in the unhappy circumſtances in which your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence has hitherto kept it. I were unworthy the name of a miniſter of the goſpel, if, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my other engagements are, I were not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give you my utmoſt aſſiſtance, as ſoon as poſſible, in ſo good a work as the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great and lamentable evil. Far from thinking it a trouble to viſit you and ſpend an hour with you on ſuch an occaſion; who would not eſteem it a refreſhment, and a bleſſing, to come and inform your domeſtics, when gathered together for this purpoſe, how wiſe and happy a reſolution you had taken, to repreſent the reaſon they have to rejoice in it,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037329_0032_100CB97475036170"/>and to bleſs God who had inſpired you with it? And how ſweet a work would it be to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, as for the firſt time imploring the bleſſings of Providence and grace on you and yours, and intreating thoſe aſſiſtances of his holy Spirit, which may qualify you more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for diſcharging your peculiar part in it, and may render it the ſucceſsful means of planting, or of ſupporting and animating a principle of true religion in every ſoul under your care? Nor would the joy and delight be confined, to the minutes ſpent with you at ſuch a ſeaſon: It would be carried home to the ſtudy, and to the houſe of God: And the very remembrance of it would for years to come, encourage to other attempts of uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrengthen our hands in the work of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And oh my dear friend, whoever you are, be not aſhamed, that a miniſter ſhould on this occaſion tell your children and ſervants, that you are ſenſible of your former neglect, and are determined in the ſtrength of God to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe a duty, which it has indeed been criminal hitherto to omit. This is a mean and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſhame, and would prevent our reforming evils which are indeed ſhameful. It will be a glory to you, to be willing and ſolicitous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive languiſhing religion; a glory to give to other families an example which, if they have the wiſdom and courage to follow it, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bring them down a rich variety of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037329_0033_100CB975F900ED10"/>bleſſings on themſelves, and if followed by conſiderable numbers, on the public. At leaſt, it will be an honor to you in the ſight of men, and what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
