            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS CONCERNING THE GOSPEL, &amp;C.</head>
            <p>IN attending to a ſermon, ſome things occurred which brought a paſſage in the Epiſtle to the Colloſians, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, 'ſay to Archippus, take heed to the miniſtry that thou haſt received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it;' which produced an inquiry, who Archippus was; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Epiſtle to the Colloſians, with that to Philemon, it appeared probable, that Philemon, Epaphras and Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus were miniſters of the church of Chriſt, gathered from among the Colloſians, which then met in Philemon's houſe; both Epiſtles appear to be wrote and ſent at the ſame time; however, Archippus was a miniſter of the church of Chriſt, who received his miniſtry in the Lord, and yet was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this exhortation: Hence it was concluded that no miniſter of Chriſt is above receiving a ſimilar exhortation from the brethren.</p>
            <p>The next inquiry was, what was the miniſtry he received in the Lord, or which the miniſters of Chriſt receive in the Lord; ſuppoſing they receive the ſame now, as the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the firſt Churches did?</p>
            <p>In anſwer, it may be ſaid, that their commiſſion was, 'to go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature.' It is agreed that the word goſpel, ſignifies good news, glad tidings: The Prophet and Apoſtles agree herein. The Prophet Iſaiah ſaith, 'O Zion that bringeth good tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jeruſalem, that bringeſt good tidings, lift up thy voice with ſtrength, lift up, be not affraid: Say to the cities of Judah, behold you God. How beautiful are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of good; that publiſheth ſalvation; that ſaith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.' And ſimilar is the word which God ſent to the children of Iſrael; with which Peter was ſent to the Gentiles, 'preaching peace, by Jeſus Chriſt, he is Lord of all.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024860_0005_0FCD6BE6CCE894A8"/>The ſcriptures do not leave us at a loſs, reſpecting theſe glad tidings, 'for the ſcriptures foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen<note n="*" place="bottom">The heathen that had no claim as being of the ſtock of Iſrael that had no worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nothing to recommend them.</note> through faith, preached before the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto Abraham, ſaying in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed;' the ſame goſpel is repeated to Iſaac, and confirmed to Jacob, and is proclaimed from the top of Jacob's ladder, where the Lord ſtood above it, and ſaid, 'I am the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Iſaac;' this was alſo ſhown to Moſes at the buſh, and when he was ſent to the children of Iſrael, he was directed to ſay unto them, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; this is my name forever, and my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial unto all generations. It is my unchangable name, the unchangable name; of the unchangable God; inſuring bleſſedneſs in Chriſt Jeſus, to all the nations, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and families of the earth. And a believer of this goſpel preached to Abraham, enters into reſt; although he is in himſelf a poor, loſt, wretched, miſerable ſinner, and underſtanding himſelf bleſſed in Chriſt Jeſus, can rejoice in him, though he hath 'no confidence in the fleſh.'</p>
            <p>The prophet Iſaiah ſpeaking of the Gentiles, in his 54th chapter, ſays to them, 'fear not for thou ſhall not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither be thou confounded, for thou ſhall not be put to ſhame, for thou ſhall forget the ſhame of thy youth, and ſhall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more: FOR thy Maker is thy huſband, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called.' The Prophet Jeremiah, in his 3d chapter, ſpeaking of Judah and Iſrael, ſaith 'turn O backſliding children, ſaith the Lord, for I am married unto you.' And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah, appears to be ſpeaking both of Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, when he ſays 'as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoice over thee.'</p>
            <p>If the nations, kindreds and families of the earth are bleſſed in Chriſt Jeſus, and both Jews and Gentiles acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as married unto him, then he is 'the God of the whole earth.'</p>
            <p>Again, the whole earth are repeatedly called to ſing a new ſong unto the Lord, as we ſee in Pſalm, 96 1, 98 1,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024860_0006_0FCD6BE84A590088"/>
Iſaiah, 42, 10, 11. This new ſong is deſcribed, Rev. 5, 9, 'thou art worthy for thou waſt ſlain and haſt redeemed us to God, by thy blood, out of every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people:' If all the earth are called to ſing this new ſong, ſurely all the earth are intereſted in the ſubject matter of it.</p>
            <p>Again, the moſt oppoſed to the ſalvation of the goſpel, and the preaching of it, are the ſubjects of prayer. The Pſalmiſt, ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſt, in the 42d Pſalm, where he complains of his reproachers, ſaying 'my tears have been my meat, day and night, while they continually ſay unto me, where is thy God?' And adds, 'when I remember theſe, I pour out my ſoul in me.' This we ſee verified when they ſaid 'he truſted in God, let him deliver him if he will have him;' and hear Jeſus Chriſt pour out his ſoul in him, in that prayer 'father forgive them for they know not what they do;' he alſo directs his Diſciples 'to love their enemies, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe them.' Did he direct them to love thoſe whom he did not; did he not die that his enemies might be reconciled by his death; was not he always heard, and did he bid his diſciples pray for what ſhould not be granted?</p>
            <p>Then ſurely the goſpel alſo is to be preached to them, and this good news is to be publiſhed as a truth among ſuch characters, 'that God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them;' agreeable to the prophet Iſaiah, 'I have blotted out thy tranſgreſſions as a cloud, and thine iniquities as a thick cloud, return unto me for I have redeemed thee.'</p>
            <p>Deſigned brevity, forbids the taking notice of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations that offer themſelves, to prove and illuſtrate this truth, that Chriſt's miniſters, commiſſion is, 'to preach the goſpel to every creature.' Two or three things offer themſelves as inquiries or objections, as</p>
            <p>1ſt. If the nations are bleſſed in Chriſt Jeſus, both <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Gentiles, ſo that they are married unto him, and he is the God of the whole earth, whence is it ſuch a place of ſin and miſery?</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid, if the woman intereſted in the eſtate and honours of her huſband, treacherouſly depart from him,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024860_0007_0FCD6BEA5AFE04D8"/>
every ſtep of her way, muſt be going further into the ſink of ſin and miſery.</p>
            <p>That this was the caſe with antient Iſrael, is plain from Jeremiah 3, 20, 'ſurely as a wife treacherouſly departs from her huſband, ſo have you dealt treacherouſly with me O houſe of Iſrael,' which will be evident to any one that reads the beginning of the chapter, to the 12 verſe, and Ezekiel, 16, 32, 45; and as this was the cauſe of the diſtreſs and miſery, that befel antient Iſrael, ſo it is the cauſe of all the calamities that befal us all, in copying after their wretched example. Certainly there is no want of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Chriſt Jeſus; no want of power, riches, loving kindneſs and mercy, in our Maker, our Huſband, the God of the whole earth; but all our unhappineſs ariſes from our alienation from him, and the further we purſue that path, the greater our miſery and calamity, whether we know the cauſe or not.</p>
            <p>Now if the huſband of the treacherouſly departing wife, own her to be his wife, call after her to return, is willing and ready to receive her on her return, without upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, ſhe is certainly bleſſed in a huſband <note n="*" place="bottom">The goſpel, the Apoſtles preached was, 'that God was <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, 1 Corinthians, v, 19. Agreeable to the goſpel preached to Abraham, that' <hi>in</hi> thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed, Galatians, iii, 8, 16. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, 'men ſhall be bleſſed <hi>in</hi> him, Pſalm, lxxii, 17. The prophet ſaith, 'the nations ſhall bleſs themſelves <hi>in</hi> him, and <hi>in</hi> him ſhall they glory,' Jeremiah, iv, 2. By the Apoſtle we are ſaid to be 'choſen <hi>in</hi> him,' Epheſians, i, 4. 'To be juſtified <hi>in</hi> him, 1 Corinthians, vi, 11. 'To be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together <hi>in</hi> him.' Epheſians, i, 10. 'To be rooted and built up <hi>in</hi> him,' Colloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, ii, 7. 'To be ſanctified <hi>in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus,' 1 Corinthians, i, 2. 'To be bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings <hi>in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, Epheſians, i, 3. 'To be made to ſit togethed in heavenly places, <hi>in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus,' Epheſians, ii, 6. 'All the promiſes of God are <hi>in</hi> him, yea and <hi>in</hi> him amen.' 2 Corinthians, i, 20. 'And yea are compleat <hi>in</hi> him,' Colloſians. ii. 10. 'And we are <hi>in</hi> him, that is true <hi>in</hi> his ſon Jeſus Chriſt,' 1 John, v, 20. Being bleſſed <hi>in</hi> him, denotes union as members to their head 'all men being drawn to him when he was lifted up; and ſo one dying for all, all died; he taſting death for every man.' Therefore this goſpel preached to Abraham, and preached by the Apoſtles is to he preached to thoſe that are the moſt remote from bleſſedneſs in themſelves and when it is believed they are led to rejoice <hi>in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, though altogether deſtitute in themſelves, unbelief and alienation, being the ſource of all our miſery, believing the truth as it is <hi>in</hi> Jeſus, we ſee our bleſſedneſs <hi>in</hi> him.</note> though ſhe forſakes her own mercies for lying vanities, and is moſt forlorne and miſerable in herſelf, while perſiſting in her alienation,</p>
            <p>I need only repeat two paſſages of ſcripture, to lead our minds from the ſimilitude juſt mentioned up to divine mercy. Jeremiah, iii, 1, 'but thou haſt played the harlot
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024860_0008_0FCD6BECC33D8F30"/>
with many lovers, yet return unto me ſaith the Lord', verſe 12, 'return thou backſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, <note n="*" place="bottom">It is not return <hi>and</hi> I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you as a condition; the <hi>and</hi> is ſupplied by the tranſlators, it is return I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you.</note> I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon you. Iſaiah xlii, 22, 'I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins; return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.' Thus goſpel miniſters have the teſtimony of God, by his Prophets, as well as the commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, 'to preach the goſpel to every creature.'</p>
            <p>2dly. It may be inquired, are not miniſters to preach the law? Anſwer, 'by the law is the knowledge of ſin, for what things the law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be ſtopped and all the world may become guilty before God, having no hope but in the righteouſneſs of God, by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, revealed in the goſpel.' The direction therefore, is 'to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every creature.'</p>
            <p>There were ſome in the Apoſtles' day, that deſired to be teachers of the law, underſtanding neither what they ſay nor whereof they affirm. The Apoſtle ſays, 'the law was our ſchool-maſter unto, or until Chriſt,' (to bring us, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the tranſlators) 'that we might be juſtified by faith; but when faith is come, we are no longer under a ſchool-maſter.' When faith is come, that is when Chriſt is come, who is the object of faith, and hath ſent forth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to preach the goſpel, which is called the hearing of faith: 'Received ye the ſpirit by the works of the law,' or by the hearing of faith? That is by the hearing of the goſpel preached.</p>
            <p>Objection. But doth not the ſcripture ſay, 'curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them?</p>
            <p>Anſwer. Yes, this is the language of the law, but the language of the goſpel is, 'Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us,' and Chriſt's miniſters are to preach the goſpel; perhaps ſome one will ſay, they are to preach it to the prepared ſubjects that are awakened by the terrors of the law, to ſeek ſalvation by Chriſt Jeſus; they are to preach it to every creature, to tell every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 'Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the law,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024860_0009_0FCD6BED82D34058"/>
being made a curſe for us.' To tell it as a truth; what! to unbelievers? Yes, to unbelievers; what conſtitutes a man an unbeliever, but not believing the report of the goſpel. He that believeth this truth is ſaved from the tormenting fear of the curſe of the law, believing the report of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; while he that doth not believe this truth, remains under ſelf condemnation or damnation, being in his own apprehenſion under the law, and under the curſe: Man is denominated an unbeliever as not believing the truth.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt's miniſters wiſh to help unbelievers, let them keep cloſe to their direction, tell the truth that is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: Let them preach the 'miniſtry of reconciliation, that God was <hi>in</hi> Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing unto them their treſpaſſes: That he hath made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God <hi>in</hi> him,' and ſet forth the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it in the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, from the dead, that if God pleaſe to accompany the evidence to their minds, they may believe.</p>
            <p>Earneſt repeated exhortations to believe, are loſt, only tending to confuſe the mind that underſtands not what is to be believed, but when the truth to be believed, is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and the evidences appear undeniable, it gains credit in the mind, and what we give full credit to is believed; therefore let the goſpel be preached to every creature, tell the good news even to unbelievers, for 'it is glad tidings of great joy to all people, tidings of a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.'</p>
            <p>3dly. Doth not the doctrine of election, militate with the goſpel's being preached to every creature? If the elect are only to obtain ſalvation to the rejection or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of all others, how is it poſſible to preach the goſpel to every creature?</p>
            <p>For anſwer, it may be ſaid, that this connecting of final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or reprobation with the doctrine of election, has no foundation in the ſcriptures. Election among men, chooſes men to certain offices for the benefit of thoſe that are not elected; and if we conſider election in the ſenſe of the ſcriptures, it will appear that it is deſigned for the benefit of others. If we turn our attention, firſt to Jeſus Chriſt, it will lead our minds to Iſaiah, xlii, 1, uſhered in with a note of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024860_0010_0FCD6BF463C86680"/>
attention 'behold! behold my ſervant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my ſoul delighteth,' why is Jeſus Chriſt called God's elect, ſee verſes, 6, 7, 'I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs and will hold thine hard, and will keep thee and give the for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners from the priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the priſon-houſe.'</p>
            <p>Queſtion. But is it not ſaid in the ſame propheſy, that he ſhall be a 'ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence to both houſes of Iſreal;' and Peter 'ſpeaks of him as a ſtone of ſtumbling and rock of offence, to them that ſtumble at the word, being diſobedient, whereunto they were appointed.' Surely, Peter doth not intend to militate with the doctrine of 'the reſtitution of all things, ſpoken of by the mouth of all God's holy Prophets ſince the world began,' their thus ſtumbling, is to fulfil the purpoſe of God, 'who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them all in unbelief that he may have mercy on all, and thus open the blind eyes, and bring the priſoners from the priſon and thoſe that ſit in darkneſs, out of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.' Agreeable to the propheſy of Simeon, in his addreſs to Mary, 'behold this child is ſet for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael, and for a ſign that ſhall be ſpoken againſt.' The Apoſtles were choſen witneſſes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſent to the Jews; the 70 Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were choſen after, and ſent to the Gentiles, to every place whether he himſelf ſhould come. 'The Apoſtles were choſen to be Chriſt's witneſſes,' choſen to this end, 'to go into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature;' Jeſus Chriſt tells them, 'ye are the lights of the world;' lights are to guide travellers in the way; for this end, the 70 were choſen and ſent forth. 'Tis expreſsly ſaid of Paul, 'he is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before Gentiles and Kings; and the children of Iſrael;' and this choſen veſſel was 'ſent unto the Gentiles, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God.'</p>
            <p>Which evidences that their election was for the benefit of others. Even in the xi of Romans, where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Iſraelites ſays, 'the election hath obtained, and the reſt were blinded,' and ſpeaking of the ſtumbling
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024860_0011_0FCD6BF5C68FE6B0"/>
of the blinded, ſaith, 'have they ſtumbled, that they might fall; God forbid! and ſhews it was to bring about the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God, reſpecting the Gentiles, which being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, 'all Irael ſhall be ſaved as it is written;' and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe ſtumbling Jews, he ſaith 'as concerning the goſpel, they are enemies for your ſakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers ſake, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;' ſhews them, 'concluded in unbelief, that God may have mercy on all.'</p>
            <p>So when the Apoſtle, to the Epheſians ſpeaks of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing predeſtinated to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of his glory, he ſhews the divine deſign herein, that in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, he might gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven and on earth in him.<note n="*" place="bottom">The view that has been taken of election, being for the benefit of others, and not for their deſtruction, might be illuſtrated from the old teſtament ſcriptures. When it pleaſed God to ſelect Abraham from among thoſe that ſerved other gods, and bleſs him, others were not excluded, for his bleſſing ſhines moſt illuſtriouſly in that part of it thus expreſſed, in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed. The choice of Moſes and Aaron, the Levites the 70 Elders and the 12 princes, were all for the benefit of all Iſrael, and the bleſſing they enjoyed were conveyed to them, through the faithful attention of thoſe various characters and officers, to their appointments, by whom they were led forward to the typical reſt or land of Canaan. So are Gods elect under the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation choſen as inſtruments, in their places, to bring to view from the ſcriptures, the glad tidings of the goſpel, the wing Jeſus as the way to the heavenly Canaan, the reſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to the people of God, where the leaves of the tree of life ſhall heal the nations, and there ſhall be no more curſe but the throne of God and the Lamb, ſhall be in it, and his ſervants ſhall ſerve him and they ſhall ſee his face agreeable to the prayer of Jeſus Chriſt, John, xvii, 24, 'father, I will, that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory.'</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid by the Apoſtle James, 'of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth that we might be a kind of firſt fruits of his creatures;' now the firſt fruits are not the whole harveſt, only an earneſt of it, as we ſee by 'the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty and four thouſand, that are ſealed in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ſtand with the Lamb on the mount Zion, with the harps of God,' theſe firſt fruits are the 'elect redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from among men, that follow the lamb, whetherſoever he goeth.</p>
            <p>Now it is obſervable both in the 7th and 14th chapters, that the ſealed, the first fruits, or the elect, were not the whole of the ſaved; for the hundred forty-four thouſand ſealed, being mentioned, we read in the 9th verſe, 'after this I beheld, and lo a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024860_0012_0FCD6BF7452686F8"/>
great multitude which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds, and people, and tongues, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands, and cried ſalvation to our God, and to the Lamb.'</p>
            <p>This was ſo wonderful, to ſee this innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, beſide the ſealed, the elect, the firſt fruits, that the inquiry is, what are theſe and whence come they? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, 'theſe are they that come out of great tribulation, and have waſhed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the throne, &amp;c. Theſe are they that came out of great tribulation: What greater tribulation can we ſuppoſe, can beſal the children of men, than what ariſes from an apprehenſion of a poſſibility of being reprobated to eternal damnation? And being on this account, all their lifetime ſubject to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage through fear of death; for ſuch to find themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne, in virtue of the blood of the Lamb, no wonder they cry with a loud voice, ſalvation, &amp;c. no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they feel their obligations to ſerve him day and night in his temple, 'having him that ſitteth on the throne, to dwell among them, delivered from hungering or thirſting any more, and having God to wipe away all tears from their eyes.' If we look into the 14th chapter, after the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hundred forty-four thouſand, ſtanding with the Lamb, on the mount Zion, with the harps of God, and ſinging the new ſong, we find verſe 6, another angel 'fly in the midſt of Heaven, having the everlaſting goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth; even to every nation tongue, and people:' Thus I think if the doctrine of election were rightly underſtood, it can be no objection to preaching the goſpel to every creature.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Paul gives the ſum of the goſpel which he preached in the beginning of the 15th chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, contained in the death and reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt with the evidences of it, and ſpeaking of the other Apoſtles, he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

propheſy, (in that we have the free uſe of the ſcriptures of truth) recorded in Iſaiah, xxx, 20, 'yet ſhall not thy teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be driven into a corner any more, but thine eyes ſhall ſee thy teachers, and thine ear ſhall hear a word behind thee, ſaying this is the way;' the goſpel always finds us with our backs to it, purſuing another way, and points out the way into which we are to return, is not this turning, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance unto life. Is not the preaching the goſpel, included in Paul's exhortation to Timothy, 'my ſon be ſtrong in the grace, that is in Chriſt Jeſus;' the ſame Apoſtle tells us what this grace is, 'ye know the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who though he was rich for our ſakes, became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich;' this is the grace made manifeſt in the goſpel, the tidings of it are to be told to every creature; this is the grace whereby we ſerve God acceptably, which our Apoſtle exhorts to hold faſt, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a kingdom which cannot be moved; we read it, let us have grace, but the margin reads it agreeable to the original, 'let us hold faſt the grace whereby we may ſerve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear,' for our God is a conſuming fire; every thing in the ſervice of God, that hath not reſpect to the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, is wood, hay, ſtubble, and muſt be burnt up.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Peter drawing to a cloſe in his firſt Epiſtle, ſpeaking of what he had been writing, ſays, 'I have written briefly, exhorting and teſtifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye ſtand;' if we look back into the Epiſtle, we find him writing of the grace, that is in Chriſt Jeſus, who his ownſelf bear our ſins in his own body on the tree, for Chriſt hath once ſuffered the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed. Much hath been ſaid about marks and evidences of true grace, in the hearts of men; but the voice behind us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us of the true grace of God, and the evidences of it manifeſted in Chriſt Jeſus, this is the grace, the Apoſtle exhorts the Hebrews to look dilligently leaſt they fall from, we read it 'looking dilligently leaſt any man fail of the grace of God,' but according to the margin, agreeable to the original, it is, leaſt any man fall from the grace of God, to the grace of man; from the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus, by which alone, we are accepted to grace, in our own
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024860_0014_0FCD6BDD2BF2CB20"/>
hearts, which cannot procure our acceptance with God: Can any one in the exerciſe of reverence and godly fear, approach the divine preſence, in his own name, making mention of the grace, that is in his own heart, as that whereby he may ſerve God acceptably, it brings to mind, Iſaiah, xxvii, 4, 'who would ſet the briers and thorns againſt me in battle, I would go through them, I would burn them together, or let him take hold of my ſtrength, <hi>he</hi> may make peace with me, <hi>he</hi> ſhall make peace with me; peace is preached by Jeſus Chriſt.'</p>
            <p>The ſcriptures teſtify of Chriſt, both in the law of Moſes, the Prophets, and the Plalms: The great error of many preachers, has centred in their apprehenſion, that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teſtified of good men, and in proportion as this error has prevailed, we have heard of the virtue and piety of Abraham, David, the Prophets, and other pious men, whom we have been excited to follow, in hope of the divine favor, if we could come to their attainments; but the light diſcovers this to be a ſpecies of idolatry, putting the Creature in the place of Jeſus Chriſt, or at leaſt between us and him, while the goſpel calls us 'to behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſin of the world.' The light diſcovering this error, in the place of it, their has crept in, perhaps a more undiſcernable one, when preachers have been led to ſpeak excellently of the character and finiſhed work of Chriſt, they have known ſomething elſe beſides Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, having a great part of their diſcourſes, taken up about the excellency of believers, their experiences, attainments, devotions in their cloſets and families, and at public worſhip, and in their conduct in moral civil life, to the flattering of their pride and importance, cauſing them to conceive themſelves the chief of ſaints, to the abaſement of thoſe that have not theſe attainments. But let it be conſidered whether it would not be more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to the believers of the goſpel, as well as nearer their pattern, if they were put in mind of the various apoſtolic exhortations to them, and put upon inquiring how much cauſe they have for ſhame and humiliation, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations have ſo little influence on their minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which if attended to with ſobriety of mind, would tend to excite them, to take rank with the chief of ſinners,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024860_0015_0FCD6BFC88163890"/>
and to glorify God for mercy, upon a level with the vileſt. Such preachers as are above deſcribed, draw the minds of their hearers from the one object, having two to preſent before them; whereas the Prophet Iſaiah, propoſes one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, 'the glory of the Lord ſhall be revealed, and all fleſh ſhall ſee together. Look unto me and be ſaved, all the ends of the earth.' John ſays, 'behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world;' and Paul deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to know nothing among them, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him crucifyed. Let Peter cloſe with his teſtimony of Chriſt, as recorded in his 1ſt Epiſtle, 2d chapter, 24 verſe, 'who his ownſelf, bear our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, might live to righteouſneſs, by whoſe ſtripes ye were healed.'</p>
            <p>Should the mind of any, ſuggeſt the old objection, to preaching the goſpel to every creature, that was brought in the Apoſtle's days and is kept up, down to our day, that it endangers morality, and will excite to continue in ſin, that grace may abound.</p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, that the morality of the goſpel is founded on divine love, both by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; when Jeſus Chriſt gave the golden rule as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly called, it was founded on the love of God, ſet forth in a moſt ſtriking figure, 'what man is there of you, who if his ſon aſk bread will he give him a ſtone?' Is there ſuch a man <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you that are evil, prone to covetouſneſs, anger and various other evils? Is there one among you who if his ſon aſk bread will he give him a ſtone, and thus mock his hunger? What heart, among you that are evil, can do this? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more ſhall your father who is in Heaven, give good things to them that aſk him? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all things whatſoever ye would, that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; you never need defraud or over-reach one another, to obtain any good you may think you want, becauſe your heavenly father is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give good things to them that aſk him, than the beſt of you are to give bread to your children; let his love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain you in all things, to do one to another, as ye would they ſhould do to you; when Jeſus bid his Diſciples love their enemies, he gave the example in his love to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024860_0016_0FCD6C00317CFDB8"/>When he bid them pray for them that ſaid all manner of evil of them falſly for his name ſake, he gave his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the croſs, 'father forgive them, for they know not what they do.'</p>
            <p>He ſaith to his Diſciples, a new commandment I give unto you, 'that ye love one another, as I have loved you,' mark that, and conſider, how did he love his Diſciples? let one of them anſwer, 'herein is love, not that we loved God, but he loved us, and ſent his ſon, the—propitiation for our ſin', (he adds) 'beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought to love one another,' the love of God and our neighbour, contains all morality, and we love him becauſe he firſt lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and when we believe the love of God to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as well as to ourſelves, we ſhall ſee the only founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loving our neighbour as ourſelves.</p>
            <p>The morality of the goſpel is founded on divine love by the Apoſtles; they preached the goſpel to every creature, thoſe who were gathered to the faith of the goſpel, they collected into churches, and taught them to obſerve all things whatſoever Jeſus Chriſt commanded; they exhorted, comforted, and charged every one of them, as a father doth his children, that they would walk worthy of God, who hath called them to his kingdom and glory. Let any one, whoſe mind is concerned about the preaching of the goſpel to every creature, endangering morality, look over the Epiſtles, wrote to the churches, collected by preaching the goſpel, and they will ſee in the former parts of theſe Epiſtles, the riches of divine grace, contained in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, then, the obligations the Diſciples are under to adorn this doctrine, in their lives and converſations in the various places and relations that they ſuſtain; that they which have believed in God, be careful to maintain good works, not merely to talk of them, with approbation, but be at the coſt of maintaining them. If theſe things be ſoberly attended to, it will appear to any impartial inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the intereſt of morality is not endangered by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel to every creature.</p>
            <p>Having inquired who Archipus was, and what was the miniſtry he received in the Lord; the next inquiry is, in what manner is this miniſtry thus received of the Lord, to be delivered to the people. The anſwer to this inquiry is
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024860_0017_0FCD6C025B4406B8"/>
given by the Apoſtle. 'Not with wiſdom of words leaſt the croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect,' 1ſt of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, xvii, to the end. 'And I brethren when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech or of wiſdom, declaring unto you the teſtimony of God, for I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified,' 1ſt of Corinthians, ii, 1 to 5, 'And my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power, now we have received not the ſpirit of the world, but the ſpirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God, which things we ſpeak, not in the words which man's wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual.' Verſes 12, 13. That is, I conceive comparing the types and propheſyes of the old teſtament, with their fulfilment in the antitype, as recorded in the new.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be inquired, why were the Apoſtles of Chriſt thus cautious to ſhun the enticing words of man's wiſdom? the two reaſons the Apoſtle gives, may be brought as an anſwer; the firſt, the corruption of the doctrine of Chriſt, in theſe words, 'not with wiſdom of words, leaſt the croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect, the preaching of the croſs, or of Chriſt crucifyed, is to the Jew a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greek fooliſhneſs,' now there have not been wanting thoſe who ſought by wiſdom of words, to make the offence of the croſs ceaſe from the Apoſtles days down to our own. The falſe teachers in the Apoſtles days, laboured to reconcile the ſtumbling Jew to the goſpel, by adding the ceremonies of the law, teaching the Gentile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, 'except they be circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, they cannot be ſaved, making by their wiſdom, the croſs of Chriſt, of none effect,' for ſaith the Apoſtle, 'who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is circumciſed, he is a debtor to do the whole law, Chriſt is become of none effect,' ſeeking thus to be juſtified by the law, they fall from the grace of the goſpel. The falſe teachers from the Apoſtles days to our own, have in like manner ſtudied by wiſdom of words, to reconcile the doctrine of Chriſt, to the wiſe Greek, who held it fooliſh to build the hope of ſalvation on Chriſt crucifyed, as the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024860_0018_0FCD6C0342B6F628"/>
only excluſive foundation; ſaying it is fooliſh for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſinner, to look for justification by the work of Chriſt, unleſs he have repentance, faith, obedience, &amp;c. which are brought in as props to the work of Chriſt, as though it were not alone all ſufficient; faith, as it is thus conſidered, is not the belief of the goſpel, which reports our bleſſedneſs in Chriſt Jeſus, but is ſomething we muſt have wrought in us, or exerciſed by us, in order to our being intereſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Repentance as it is thus conſidered, is not a turning from ourſelves, and all creature dependence, where we have been ſeeking life, to Chriſt who is our life; but is a certain ſorrow, for our open heinous, and even ſecret ſins, to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us for obtaining forgiveneſs by Chriſt Jeſus. Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is likewiſe conſidered a neceſſary qualification for our acceptance; not as a teſtimony of our gratitude, that he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</p>
            <p>And in this miſtaken view, faith, repentance and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being added to the work of Chriſt, are calculated to bring the doctrine to the wiſdom of the Greek, who always ſuppoſe God will be propitious to the believing penitent and obedient. Every ſpecies of falſe religion, of what ever name or denomination, will agree here, while every true chriſtian will agree with the Apoſtle, that it is<note n="*" place="bottom">And will break out with the Prophet Micah, who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity.</note> a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief; but that Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt, died for the ungodly, came to ſave ſinners, even the chief, will not do to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone, it is too weak and fooliſh.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſay they, that Chriſt came to ſave that which was loſt, and no ſinner will miſcarry, who ſeek him ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, earneſtly and perſeveringly; but the text ſays, 'he came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,' 'tis true ſay they, 'Chriſt died for the ungodly,' and all of that diſcription ſhall be benefited thereby, that will come to him; but they will not come that they may have life; but read the text, 'my people ſhall be willing in the day of my power.'</p>
            <p>Yes ſay they, but who are his people, who are given to him? Let the ſcriptures anſwer, 'the father loveth the ſon, and hath given all things into his hands, he hath given
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024860_0019_0FCD6C05ACB0EB00"/>
the heathen his inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth, his poſſeſſion, and all that the father giveth, ſhall come.'</p>
            <p>Thus we have contemplated how the wiſdom of words, is employed, to endeavor to take away the ſtumbling block from the Jew, and the imputation of fooliſhneſs from the Greek; and that every attempt of this kind, is making the croſs of Chriſt of none effect. The ſecond reaſon, the Apoſtle draws from the effects on the hearers; where the doctrine of Chriſt is maintained, there ſhould be a conſtant care to uſe great plaineſs of ſpeech, becauſe the poor have the goſpel preached to them, and if it is preached in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage above their capacity, although it may be very good, and eaſy to be underſtood by the learned, yet if there come in one that is unlearned, how ſhall he ſay Amen, at thy giving thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; except (ſays the Apoſtle) ye utter by the tongue, words eaſy to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, for ye ſhall ſpeak unto the air; and he ſays I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that I might teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</p>
            <p>Although tongues have ceaſed, yet theſe expreſſions of the Apoſtle, may at this day be improved as a guard againſt language above common capacities and when ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is familiar by uſe, to any of the preachers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſuch would do well to attend the exhortation of the Apoſtle, let him that ſpeaks in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret; let him pray that he may be able to come to the capacity of the moſt unlearned of his hearers, when preaching the goſpel of Chriſt; it ſeems as if this was what the Apoſtle meant, by ſaying, 'brethren be not children in underſtanding, in underſtanding be men,' as it immediately follows his ſaying, he had rather ſpeak five words with his underſtanding that he might teach others, than ten thouſand that could not be underſtood; for ſaith he, if I know not the meaning of the voice, I ſhall be to him that ſpeaketh a barbarian, and he that ſpeaketh, a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian unto me.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the Apoſtle appears to aim at inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the delivering of the goſpel with plainneſs of ſpeech
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024860_0020_0FCD6C070B649870"/>
for the above reaſons, which appear weighty and worthy of attention; and ſays, 'ſeeing then we have ſuch hope we uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech, and not as Moſes, who put a veil over his face;' and in another place neither of men ſought we glory, neither of you nor of others.</p>
            <p>Let goſpel miniſters imitate the Apoſtle herein, let them attend the expreſs declaration of ſcripture, both of the old and new teſtament, that unite to publiſh ſalvation, to the end of the earth, and to the evidences of the truth of theſe glad tidings, of great joy to all people; that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of this good news, they may tell it as a truth to their hearers, even to unbelievers, in as plain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible a manner as may be, that if it pleaſe God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the truth with divine evidence, they may believe, and believing have life through his name.</p>
            <p>Let the hearers, whoſe minds are at a loſs about the truth of the goſpel, bend their attention to the ſearch of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures after the example of the Bereans, to ſee if theſe things are ſo.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that are ſatisfied of the truth, from ſcripture evidence, abound in thankſgiving for the manifeſtation of the exceeding riches of the grace appearing therein, and make it their conſtant ſtudy to live as the grace of God, which hath appeared, which bringeth ſalvation to all men, teacheth, viz. 'denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world, looking for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.'</p>
            <p>Let the words of the Apoſtle Peter cloſe, 'if any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of God, if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability, that God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be praiſe and dominion forever,</p>
