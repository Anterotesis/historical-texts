            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE GOLDEN AGE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN one of our American States, lives the retired and devout Celadon. A man ſtrictly honeſt, and a real lover of his country. That ſuch is his true character, appears by the whole tenor of his conduct for ſeveral years paſt.</p>
            <p>During our late noble conteſt with Britiſh fury, he ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized himſelf above many of his equals in age and fortune. Not contented to plead the glorious cauſe of liberty in private only, he bravely entered the bloody field, and actually ſerved ſeveral campaigns, in vindication of our common rights. Nor did he once diſcover the leaſt timidity in the day of battle.</p>
            <p>Since the reſtoration of peace, and eſtabliſhment of our independency, he, like another Daniel, has been anxious to know the future condition of his people—and what may be the conſequences of a revolution ſo extraordinary in itſelf —which is the wonder of the preſent, and will probably be the joy of many ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>Often muſing on this delightful ſubject, he was at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged with an agreeable viſion, which gave him the greateſt ſatisfaction. This, as related by himſelf, is faithfully recorded in the following pages.</p>
            <p>Having walked out on a ſummer's evening, and grown weary, I ſat down on the verdant bank of a neighbouring ſtream, leaning againſt a tree, whoſe ſpreading branches ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered me from the ſolar blaze. In this eaſy poſture, I was awhile delighted with the muſic of the groves. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring waters below, and chirping birds,—together with the ſighing gales above, ſoothed my imagination, and by degrees, lulled every ungrateful care to reſt; 'till, in ſhort, I fell into a kind of drowſy trance.</p>
            <p>Whilſt thus diſſolved in ſlumberous indolence, lo, to my apprehenſion, a wondrous form darting from the ſky ſwift as
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:044690_0005_10213E8747D59D80"/>
the lightning's flaſh, ſtood before me.—His countenance ſparkled like the morning-ſtar: And his robes outſhone the glowing brilliancy of the rainbow. All nature ſeemed to ſmile at his approach.—The hills and vales rejoiced together; and the trees of the wood clapped their hands.—I indeed, was at firſt ſmitten with a trembling awe, as in the preſence of ſo ſuperior a being. But perceiving an ineffable ſweetneſs in his looks, and nothing vindictive in his aſpect; this at length recovered my dejected ſpirit—ſo that I ventured to accoſt him with words to this effect; and was kindly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered as in the ſequel.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Celadon.</speaker>
               <p>Good Angel! For ſuch I am convinced you are, may I know your errand? What ſtrange cauſe could induce you to leave the manſions of light, and condeſcend to viſit this wretched, fallen, and offending world?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
               <p>My preſent buſineſs is, to reſolve certain doubts with which you have been lately puzzled, and to give you intelligence reſpecting ſeveral as yet unknown events, whereby, you and others may be comforted, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to ſtand faſt in a reſolute attachment to the glorious cauſe of truth, and the inviolable intereſt of American free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and independency.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Celadon.</speaker>
               <p>Dare a poor mortal aſk, by what name to honor your dignity? And what rank you bear among the Empyreal Hierachies?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
               <p>Inquire not after my name, for it is ſecret—but, as to my preſent ſtation, I belong to a bright ſquadron of Seraphic warriors, who are appointed as guardians of theſe confederated States.—We inſpired your ſtateſmen with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and your heroes with courage, in all their late gallant ſtruggles for freedom.—We baffled the counſels of your enemies, and ſtruck terror into their hearts; inſomuch, that they often fled without any viſible purſuer—Yet were we but generous inſtruments at moſt. God himſelf was the ſupreme agent.—He it was, that ſucceeded your enterpriſes: and at laſt, crowned your combined forces with victory.—Without his bleſſing, neither men nor angels could have ſaved America, from the rapacious jaws of tyranny and oppreſſion. To him therefore, let all the glory be aſcribed for ever.</p>

               <p>What you have now ſaid, might be ſufficient was it diſputable before, to convince the whole world, that America was very right in caſting off the Britiſh yoke.</p>

               <p>Her ſo doing was in every view, a moſt equitable tranſaction.—That once flouriſhing kingdom, having reached the zenith of temporal grandeur, has been ſeveral years on the decline.—Britain was once indeed, a land of patriots and heroes. But now alas! The majority of her ſons are lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably degenerated. In days of old, what zealous advocates for freedom were they!—The very name of bondage made the whole nation ſtart, as at the ſight of an infernal ghoſt!— But of late they ſeem determined as by ſome ſtrange fatality, to introduce an arbitrary and deſpotic government—a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to which, is the reproach of reaſon, and a ſcandal to humanity. It was therefore, the indiſpenſable duty of theſe States to reſolve on an entire ſeparation; as from a family deeply infected with the plague. Even the law of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation required it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Celadon.</speaker>
               <p>And may not our legiſlators alſo, follow their example? Allured by the ſplendid baits of lucre and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will they not hereafter aſpire to abſolute ſovereignty themſelves? Should that be the caſe, we have no great reaſon to triumph. It would only be changing one imperious lord for another. A doleful recompence that, for the rivers of blood we have ſpilt, and the millions of gold we have ſpent.</p>
               <p>Tyranny will always prove the ſame inſatiable, ſanguinary, cruel monſter, in whatever ſhape ſhe appears; and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever part of the globe ſhe reigns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>All ſublunary things are ſubject to mutation. The greateſt empires have had their birth, their growth, their maturity, and their fall. Nor can America, ſhould the world ſtand long enough, expect an exemption from the uſual viciſſitudes of fortune.—Yet, ſuch a change is not likely to happen very ſoon.—A republic being compoſed of many parts, is not ſo liable to enſlaving meaſures, as monarchies in general are.—The States will doubtleſs watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſtricteſt vigilance. So that no groſs innovation can long lie concealed, but muſt ſoon be diſcovered and detected, by that matchleſs ſagacity with which this country is diſtinguiſhed—and is indeed, one of your peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics as a nation. May you never forfeit it, by wilfully ſhutting your eyes againſt the truth, as too many others have done!</p>

we repel the encroachment? Should they invade our territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in their infancy, and before our conſtitution is well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, might we not be reduced to the baſeſt vaſſalage after all?—A burnt child dreads even the moſt diſtant thought of fire!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
               <p>If you live in amity and concord, there can be no danger of that calamity; eſpecially if you join to ſuppreſs vice, and encourage virtue.—Whilſt you labour to worſhip God in ſincerity, and promote the intereſt of religion and morality, you need fear no external enemy; nor dread any hoſtile invaſion.—Your country is ſo ſituated, that it would prove very difficult, if not morally ſpeaking, impoſſible, to ſubdue it by outward force.—It needs no artificial bulwark, or ſumptuous fortification.—Nature itſelf, has made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable.—And which is much more: As long as you retain your integrity, the Lord of Hoſts will be with you; the God of Jacob will be your refuge.—Nothing can ruin America, but the degeneracy of her own offspring.—Beware of that, and you may be eaſy on all other accounts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Celadon.</speaker>
               <p>Good news! But, may not the now United States differ among themſelves! Should they hereafter quarrel with one another, it would certainly be to their mutual injury. Yea, perhaps, prove deſtructive to the whole empire.—Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, and overthrow them, is Satan's maxim—the ancient logic of that malignant ſpirit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
               <p>Should they do ſo, they muſt blame themſelves for their own perdition. And like ſelf-murderers, die contemned; and be buried in the horrid vaults of infamy.—But, this is not likely to happen, without ſome great, and general depravity of manners.—Seeing each State is of itſelf independent, as to its own internal juriſdiction; and enjoys all the immunities it can deſire as a diſtinct ſubſtantive commonwealth; what ground can there be for jealouſy or emulation, for envy or bickerment between them?—Theſe atrocious fiends will, 'tis hoped, never prevail in this new and flouriſhing continent. On the contrary, the inhabitants daily taſting the delicious ſweets of equal freedom, will, you may truſt my word, be more and more united, and join as one mighty champion to maintain the tranquility of the whole community.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Celadon.</speaker>
               <p>Should this be our propitious lot, we ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably increaſe in number very faſt. Which will by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, augment our warlike force<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be a continual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

            <sp>
               <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
               <p>Multiply you doubtleſs will; and that to a prodigy. To this, not only your own fruitfulneſs, but continual emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration from ſeveral parts of the world will annually contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.—The poor, the oppreſſed, and the perſecuted will fly to America as doves to their windows.—This Weſtern-World will be the dernier reſort, the laſt refuge, and aſylum for afflicted merit.—Nor will room be wanting. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent is the largeſt, and will be the moſt populous empire upon earth: Provided, the pride and luxury of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, do not prove an obſtacle to its growth.—Of all ſuch enormities therefore, they will do well timely to beware: which, as hiſtory informs you, have in paſt ages, ſapped the foundations of, and laid the moſt opulent and powerful ſtates in ruins.</p>

               <p>That impediment is not likely to laſt very long. Their ammunition will ſoon be ſpent. Nor can their game laſt many years.—The deer, buffalo, &amp;c. will gradually grow ſcarce; and at laſt fail of courſe.—So that in concluſion, they will find themſelves under a neceſſity of working, or ſtarving. —Hunger will compel them to ſue for peace. They will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Congreſs for an aſſured ſettlement of their own, which being granted, they will betake themſelves to honeſt labour; and by induſtry in due time become a polite, wealthy, and pious nation.</p>

               <p>You may be aſſured of it.—Why this paroxiſm of admiration? Your progenitors, the now refined Britons, were formerly as wild Pagans, as rank Idolaters, and as averſe to embracing the goſpel as the Indians now are.— Remember, it is God's work to convert men. Divine power

               <p>And what is to be done with the poor Negroes? Nothing! There are vaſt crouds of them in ſome States.— And is not their rigorous ſervitude an odious blot in our ſcutcheon of honor?—Wretched creatures! Muſt they alone remain in irrevocable bondage? I hope not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Angel.</speaker>
               <p>No, they too, ſhall in the proper ſeaſon be ſet at liberty.—A tract of land will be allowed them.—They ſhall be furniſhed with implements of huſbandry, and every thing neceſſary to begin the world with.—They will by degrees form a State of their own.—And at length alſo, prove a rich, a religious, and uſeful people. But there muſt be time for their manumiſſion. It cannot be done at once.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Thus ſaying the Angel as I thought, took me up in his arms, and in an inſtant ſet me down again on the top of an exceeding high mountain.—This mountain ſtands in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of North-America; and for altitude ſurmounts all others. —It is in figure like a broken globe. And for circumference about thirteen geographical miles.—This ſtately ridge ſeems to claim the monarchy of the atlantic hills: Being crowned with an ever glowing verdure.—The trees which adorn its towering ſummit, are clad with unfading green.—Cedar, pine, laurel, &amp;c. are the principal product of the irriguous ſoil. It put me in mind of the famous Helicon, ſo often celebrated by the poets, as the native reſidence of the muſes.—Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I perceived ſeveral limpid ſprings burſting from its ſides, and flowing in fertilizing meanders through the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent plains, and refreſhing the vales below.—I ſtood on a large rock, placed about the middle of the mountain; and ſomewhat higher than any other part of it. This ſtone too is of a circular form, and makes a beautiful appearance; for it looks like poliſhed marble.</p>
            <p>Then the Angel waſhed my eyes with a cryſtaline elixir, which he carried in a pearly phial. Whereupon I found my viſive faculty amazingly ſtrengthened: So that I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly view the whole continent from ſhore to ſhore.</p>
            <p>This done, he bid me turn to the eaſt. I did ſo. And looking from north to ſouth, what a grand and majeſtic proſpect was preſented to my ſight!</p>
            <p>Several ſpacious cities, and a great many thriving towns already founded.—What a thick conjunction of farms,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044690_0010_10213E8D7B950958"/>
plantations, gardens, orchards, vineyards, &amp;c. laden with every kind of fruit!—How charmingly diverſified with lofty hills, and flowery dales! Extenſive foreſts, and ſhady groves! How plentifully watered with living fountains, purling rills, and navigable rivers throughout the whole; for fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in length, and near a thouſand in breadth!—And what elegant buildings adapted to all the purpoſes of life, both civil and religious!—I ſtood, and gazed with pleaſing aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, till the Angel ordered me to turn my face weſtward. I obeyed, and was equally ſurpriſed at the wide extended landſcape.</p>
            <p>This weſtern part of America, is as yet but an uncultivated deſart; the haunt of ſavages; and range of wild beaſts.—But the ſoil in general is much richer than that of the eaſtern divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The rivers too, are larger, and flow in greater numbers. The mountains indeed are numerous, and very high: Yet between them lie exceeding wide and level vallies; and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance fertile as the plains of Shinar, which they ſay, uſed to yield an hundred fold. I alſo perceived, that the ſettled part of our continent, is really but a little ſpot in compariſon of the vaſt regions to whitemen as yet unknown.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, loſt in wonder I could not avoid falling into this agreeable reflection, whilſt ſurveying a beauteous world riſing out of a dreary wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is as yet, ſcarce three hundred years ſince this quarter of the globe was firſt diſcovered by the European nations. Nor is above one hundred years elapſed, ſince any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able improvements have been made in this northern conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Yet at this day it contains by computation, at leaſt three millions of Chriſtain inhabitants; beſide the heatheniſh tribes. Of whom there is perhaps, a much greater number than are yet regiſtered in our accounts of thoſe formidable warriors.—How rapid muſt have been the growth of my native country! When in that ſhort ſpace of time, it has ariſen to ſuch a degree of wealth and grandeur, as to be able not only to cope with, but to bid defiance to Great-Britain itſelf. A power, which for ages paſt, was renowned for military proweſs; and famous for victory and triumph.— Bleſſed art thou O America! Thou ſhalt both do great things, and ſhalt ſtill prevail!</q>
            </p>
            <p>How long I might have remained in this contemplative rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I cannot tell, had not the Angel recalled my attention by
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044690_0011_10213E91802742C8"/>
a gentle touch on my ſide, and pointing his finger a little to the ſouth-weſt, Celadon, ſays he, do you ſee yonder long valley.—How full of the choiceſt timber! What fine ſprings it contains! And how many perennial rivers glide through it, at ſuitable diſtances!—That whole region you may call Savagenia: It being deſigned for the future habitation of your now troubleſome Indians.—And that other valley; it is you may notice, as well wooded, and watered, and every way furniſhed with all the preparative accommodations for human life, as the firſt I ſhewed you. It lies toward the north-weſt; and enjoys of the two, the cleareſt air; and by conſequence, will prove the healthieſt climate.—This you may call Nigrania: It being allotted for the Negroes to dwell there, when the term of their vaſſalage is come to a period.—And in all thoſe vaſt ſpaces weſtward to the great ocean, there may be ſeats here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after for ſundry foreign nations.—There may be a French, a Spaniſh, a Dutch, an Iriſh, an Engliſh, &amp;c. yea, a Jewiſh State here in proceſs of time.—And all of them united in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection, will at laſt form the moſt potent empire on the face of the earth.</p>

               <p>Since their total expulſion from Paleſtine, they have been ſcattered as with a whirlwind, and diſperſed into all lands.—They are every where hated and deſpiſed.—They are, as was foretold by their prophets, become a proverb, a taunt, an aſtoniſhment, an hiſſing, and execration in every part of the habitable world.—But, at laſt, hearing the unbounded bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of the generous Americans toward all nations; and the unlimited toleration by them granted to every ſect, and form of religion; they will hereafter, gather in crouds, and fly to this continent as ſwarming bees to their choſen reſting place; and they will be received without oppoſition.—A ſettlement will be granted them in that pleaſant ſpot, which you ſee reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a long chain of mountains weſtward to the ſea.— There they will join in civil ſociety, according to their own notions of policy. Their ſtate will be called New-Canaan. And on the banks of that copious, and gently flowing river, they will in time build a magnificent city, which may be fitly named the New-Jeruſalem.</p>

               <p>Yes. When the full era of their derelicton is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, they ſhall do ſo.—Grown weary of waiting for their Meſſiah, and convinced at length that he is already come, they will humbly acknowlege their once crucified King, heartily bow to his ſceptre; and ſerve him with a fervency, that will excite even Pagans to emulation; and be a ſhame to you Chriſtains: Who though in general you are very zealous for the ſeveral forms, are many of you, utter ſtrangers, and ſome of you open enemies to the power of Godlineſs.—In one word, they will tranſcend you in all the beauties of holineſs, far as the ſtar of evening outſhines the languid conſtellations of the milky-way. Inſomuch, that the real children of God in thoſe days, will be ſurpriſed at their own former lukewarmneſs in the awful concerns of another world.</p>

That occurrence will probably have a bleſſed influence toward the reſuſcitation of primitive piety, which was the ſplendid orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of chriſtianity in the apoſtolic age.

               <p>You are not miſtaken. The converſion of the Jews, will be as life from the dead to the Gentile church.—It will greatly animate and revive true believers themſelves.—It will awaken many formal profeſſors to righteouſneſs.—And will alſo, ſtartle and alarm multitudes of ſtupid wretches, who had long ſlumbered in carnal ſecurity, even under the ſound of the goſpel.—In ſhort; it will be nothing leſs than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of that ſtupendous work, which your divines juſtly denominate, the glory of the latter days.—This is that moſt illuſtrious operation of ſovereign mercy, for which you have heard ſeveral pious miniſters ſo often pray: And of which they ſpeak in ſuch high and lofty ſtrains.—In America God has determined to begin his laſt and greateſt wonders among mankind.—And in the weſt ſhall that propitious cloud ariſe, whoſe ſalutary ſhower will in the end refreſh, and in an evangelical ſenſe fructify the whole continent.—It will water the Jewiſh ſtate firſt; and in progreſſion, borne as on the wings of the wind, viſit all the reſt, until the whole wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs is gladdened by the nectareous drops, and the deſert is made to rejoice, and bloſſom as the roſe.—It ſhall bloſſom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and ſinging.</p>

And our beſt expoſitors greatly differ in opinion concerning them. For which reaſon, it is impoſſible to draw any certain and determinate concluſion from their diſquiſitions.
