            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE Of the Author.</head>
            <p>THE firſt thirty years of my life were ſpent in the <hi>literary way,</hi> and generally employed in a courſe of hard ſtudy, and cloſe attention to ſome ſubject or other; after which, by a turn in my private affairs, I went into a courſe of <hi>mercantile buſineſs,</hi> which was indeed more a matter of neceſſity than inclination. My old habits of reading and thinking could not eaſily be ſhaken off, and I was ſcarce ever without either a book or ſome ſubject of diſcuſſion ready prepared, to which I could reſort, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I found myſelf at leiſure from other buſineſs.</p>
            <p>My uſual method of diſcuſſing any ſubjects which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to examine, was, as far as poſſible, to find out and define the <hi>original, natural principles</hi> of them, and to ſuffer my mind to be drawn on without <hi>bias or any incidental pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,</hi> to ſuch concluſions as thoſe original principles would naturally <hi>lead to</hi> and <hi>demonſtrate, i. e.</hi> I endeavoured, as far as I could, to make myſelf <hi>my own original,</hi> and draw all my knowledge from the <hi>original and natural ſources</hi> or <hi>firſt principles</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The powerful preſſures of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> force during the war, and the obſtinate and determined defence of the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans,</hi> ſoon threw every thing into diſorder, and produced every day <hi>new occurrences</hi> and <hi>new problems,</hi> which <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> had never ſeen before, and, of courſe, knew not how either to obviate or ſolve them.</p>
            <p>The firſt operations of the war affected my connexions in trade ſo much, that it threw me out of my uſual courſe of buſineſs, and left me at leiſure to contemplate <hi>thoſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences;</hi> and I thought I might render an eſſential ſervice to my country by examining them, reducing them to <hi>their original principles,</hi> explaining their <hi>nature,</hi> and pointing out their <hi>natural operation and probable effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conceived that the moſt important and alarming of theſe events and queſtions were thoſe which reſpected <hi>our reſources,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>ſtate of the Continental money,</hi> which was the <hi>ſole ſupply</hi> of the public treaſury at that
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023972_0003_0FC2BB9F91078EE0"/>
time. This induced me to turn my attention very ſeriouſly to the <hi>nature and operation of MONEY and finance;</hi> a ſubject which I had never before examined, further than daily practice and private economy made neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>reaſonings and concluſions</hi> on this ſubject were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the ſignature of <hi>A Financier</hi> in 1776, and make the firſt of the following Eſſays; all the reſt were publiſhed ſucceſſively (as dated) under the ſignature of <hi>A Citizen of Philadelphia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt I reaſoned on the great ſubjects of the <hi>natural operation of money</hi> and of <hi>national finances,</hi> and drew ſuch theorems and concluſions as appeared to me to reſult from their natural, original <hi>principles,</hi> I had an opportunity to compare thoſe <hi>concluſions</hi> with real <hi>fact,</hi> and to judge of their truth by <hi>experiment of their actual effects;</hi> and in this I was rarely miſtaken. The effects or conſequences which I inferred from the principles on which I reaſoned, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one inſtance <hi>failed to follow</hi> in the <hi>kind,</hi> tho' not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the <hi>degree,</hi> which I expected, <hi>e. g.</hi> the ſtrength of the States, and the patriotiſm, the patience, the firmneſs, and ſteady virtue of our people, were <hi>greater</hi> than I could expect, whilſt I reaſoned on human nature and human paſſions, as exhibited in the example of other nations, <hi>eſpecially in the inſtance of unpaid armies.</hi> From theſe ſprang reſources for continuing the war, beyond my ſanguine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, whilſt <hi>national ruin</hi> appeared to me more near and certain than it really was.</p>
            <p>Again, the obſtinate perſeverance of the <hi>Britiſh nation</hi> in continuing the <hi>American</hi> war was <hi>leſs</hi> than I computed on. I believe, the <hi>American independence</hi> was the only point which that nation ever yielded, after exerting every nerve of their ſtrength to carry their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Further, I had no idea that the <hi>Continental money</hi> could be made to paſs at all <hi>as a medium of trade</hi> at a depreciation even of 50 or 100, much leſs of 500, for 1.</p>
            <p>It may be worth notice here, that theſe Eſſays exhibit not only a diſcuſſion of the <hi>principles and nature of money</hi> and <hi>national finances,</hi> but contain alſo a kind of <hi>hiſtory</hi> of theſe principles <hi>compared</hi> with <hi>facts</hi> or their <hi>real operation,</hi> during the convulſions of <hi>America</hi> thro' a ſeven years' war, when the dangers, the diſtreſſes, the firmneſs, the terrors, the wiſdom, the folly, the expedients, the exertions, the reſources, the ſtrength and the weakneſs, the ſucceſſes and the diſappointments, which appeared under all modes and forms, put every <hi>principle</hi> into <hi>operation,</hi> and every <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:023972_0004_0FC2BBA103B37E98"/>
and <hi>theorem to the teſt,</hi> and left no room for <hi>falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings</hi> or <hi>idle projections,</hi> becauſe their <hi>fallacy</hi> was ſure to be <hi>detected very ſoon</hi> by a <hi>failure</hi> or <hi>deficiency</hi> of their <hi>effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Eſſays were all written at the times in which the ſeveral ſubjects of them were <hi>freſh,</hi> and <hi>ſtrongly impreſſed</hi> on every <hi>American</hi> mind, and the <hi>feelings</hi> of every body were <hi>alive</hi> and <hi>wound up</hi> to the higheſt pitch of anxiety, and an aſylum of even ſafety was eagerly ſought. It may, therefore, be agreeable to my <hi>fellow-citizens</hi> to <hi>reviſe theſe diſtreſſing ſcenes,</hi> as people ſometimes have pleaſure in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>places</hi> in which they have paſſed thro' <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> that are now over and paſt.</p>
            <p>A review of arguments and reaſonings on the abſtruſe ſubject of money and finance, <hi>cennected with fact, i. e.</hi> with the <hi>actual effects and conſequences</hi> of them, may afford ſome <hi>gratification</hi> and <hi>amuſement</hi> to <hi>ſpeculative</hi> people, who are diſpoſed to examine and explore thoſe <hi>difficult,</hi> but very <hi>intereſting matters,</hi> errors and miſtakes in which have tript up the heels of, and brought by the board, very many ſtateſmen in every nation.</p>
            <p>For this reaſon it is probable that <hi>politicians</hi> and <hi>ſtateſmen</hi> who may happen to be involved in theſe inquiries, may find <hi>benefit</hi> in an attention to <hi>American experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a connexion of <hi>principles, theorems,</hi> and <hi>facts,</hi> in the great ſubject of <hi>money</hi> and <hi>finance,</hi> is a <hi>phenomenon</hi> rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in any nation ſo clearly exhibited, as in the hiſtory of money and finances in our States during the war and its conſequences.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, in the hiſtory of <hi>American</hi> diſtreſſes, <hi>perfect wiſdom</hi> is not to be expected; but we have an opportunity of <hi>learning wiſdom</hi> from it. Many <hi>projects, plans, ſchemes,</hi> and <hi>manoeuvres,</hi> ſome of them <hi>hurtful,</hi> and others <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> enough, were ſet on foot, and ſome of them puſhed into execution with great ſeverity, which either <hi>died ſoon</hi> without effect, or were <hi>marked with calamity</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their continuance.</p>
            <p>Many others more <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> were alſo propoſed, and <hi>ſooner or later</hi> adopted with <hi>ſucceſs and great benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have now an opportunity of <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> the <hi>wiſe</hi> from the <hi>fooliſh,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> from the <hi>bad,</hi> by their effects, which may help us much to wiſdom in our future counſels.</p>
            <p>We are now <hi>at leiſure for conſideration,</hi> and cannot plead <hi>preſſures</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> in excuſe for any miſtakes; and we have the effects of former errors, like beacons of caution ſet up before our eyes to guard us againſt repeating them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023972_0005_0FC2BBAF4D167E90"/>
Some Eſſays on different ſubjects are introduced here, which I leave; with all the reſt, to make their way in the world, <hi>according to their merits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe Eſſays Continental money is often conſidered; to underſtand the arguments it may often be neceſſary to recur to the value of that money at the date of each Eſſay: I have, for this purpoſe, added at the end of this book four <hi>ſcales of depreciation,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ſcale of <hi>Congreſs,</hi> that of the State of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> eſtabliſhed by law, <hi>April</hi> 3, 1781, and two others, one for <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> the other for <hi>Virginia,</hi> taken from the <hi>merchants' books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two firſt, for political reaſons, vary from the <hi>true exchange</hi> part of the time; the other two, taken from the merchants' books, are as <hi>near the true and actual exchange,</hi> as a thing of ſuch a fluctuating and variable nature can be expected to be.</p>
            <p>I have alſo added a chronology of remarkable events, as people generally connect the occurrences of theſe times with ſome or other of thoſe events.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſay I had all the ſucceſs in theſe publications which I wiſhed.</p>
            <p>In ſome caſes, they croſſed the favorite <hi>plans</hi> propoſed by influential men, which, like their children, they could not bear to ſee <hi>killed,</hi> or even <hi>corrected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome caſes they oppoſed ſome great and ſtrong <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,</hi> which bore them down.</p>
            <p>In ſome caſes, they ſtood oppoſed to <hi>general opinion</hi> in point of real propriety. The ſubjects were new, and the public mind had not time to fix itſelf on the ground of <hi>experience;</hi> many errors prevailed at that time.</p>
            <p>In fine, moſt people at the time were wrought up to ſuch a <hi>paſſionate attachment</hi> to the <hi>American cauſe,</hi> that they had not patience to examine and conſider <hi>coolly</hi> the <hi>means neceſſary</hi> to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>But all men have now an opportunity to compare the various <hi>plans and projects</hi> of thoſe times with the <hi>facts</hi> which followed, and doubtleſs will have pleaſure in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the <hi>wiſe and prudent</hi> from the <hi>wild and idle,</hi> by their <hi>actual effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this view, I here preſent my Eſſays all together to the reader's peruſal and cenſure.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY On the Danger of too much circulating Caſh in a State, the ill Conſequences thence ariſing, and the Neceſſary Remedies.</head>
            <head type="sub">[Publiſhed in the Pennſylvania Evening Poſt of Oct. 5, 1776, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſignature of A Financier.]</head>
            <p>THE computations of the value of the Free States of America by <hi>Conti</hi>—and <hi>Doria,</hi> in the Evening Poſt of Sept. 21, rather prove that value to be immenſe than reduce it to a certainty. Perhaps another method of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation might be admitted, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the quantity of land within the preſent inhabited part of thoſe ſtates, which is at leaſt two hundred millions of acres, and worth a dollar per acre I ſhould think at leaſt, ſome ſay two or three dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and perhaps the perſonal eſtate may be computed at as much more, which I do not think is reckoning high, and will make the amount four hundred millions of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. All theſe computations prove with certainty enough that the funds, on which the Continental money depends, are ſufficiently great to ſupport a very much larger quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity than is already emitted.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">The firſt emiſſion of Continental money was dated May 10, 1775, but was not really iſſued into actual circulation till ſome months afterwards, but the quantity multiplied ſo faſt that it became ſomewhat alarming at the time when this eſſay was written.</note> I would farther obſerve that the American States owe nothing to any body but themſelves, and employ no ſhips, ſoldiers, &amp;c. but their own, ſo that they contract no foreign debt; and I take it
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:023972_0009_0FC2BBBD7418CEA8"/>
to be a clear maxim, that no ſtate can be ruined, bankrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or indeed much endangered, by any debt due to itſelf only; nor can it ever be much impoveriſhed by any war, if the war and other caſualties do not deſtroy mankind faſter than the women produce them, and the people that are left at home can furniſh the proviſions, clothing, &amp;c. ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for themſelves and the ſoldiery, together with all other neceſſary ſtores and implements of the war.</p>
            <p>There requires no more to preſerve ſuch a ſtate in a war of any length of time than good economy in bringing the burden equally on all, in proportion to their abilities; but then I think it very neceſſary that they ſhould <hi>pay as they go,</hi> as near as may be. The <hi>ſoldier</hi> renders his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſervices down on the ſpot, the <hi>farmer</hi> his proviſions, the <hi>tradeſman</hi> his fabrics, and why ſhould not the <hi>monied man</hi> pay his money down too? Why ſhould the ſoldier, tradeſman, farmer, &amp;c. be paid in promiſes, which are not ſo good as money, if the fulfilment is at a diſtance?</p>
            <p>Payment in promiſes or bills of credit is a temporary expedient, and will always be dangerous, where the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity increaſes too much, at leaſt it will always have the conſequences of a medium increaſed beyond the neceſſities of trade; and whenever that happens, a ſpeedy remedy is neceſſary, or the ill effects will ſoon be alarming, and, if long neglected, will not be eaſily remedied. The remedy or rather prevention of this evil I take to be very eaſy at preſent.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>quantity of Continental currency is greater than is neceſſary for a medium of trade,</hi> it will appear by a number of very perceptible effects, each of which point out and facilitate the remedy. <hi>One effect</hi> will be, that people will chooſe to have their eſtates veſted in any goods of intrinſic value rather than in money, and of courſe there will be a quick demand for every kind of goods, and conſequently a high price for them; <hi>another effect</hi> will be diſcouragement of induſtry, for people will not work hard to procure goods for ſale, while the medium for which they muſt ſell them is ſuppoſed to be worſe than the goods; and of courſe, <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other effect</hi> will be a diſcouragement of trade, for nobody
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:023972_0010_0FC2BBC6B85A77C8"/>
will import goods, and ſell them, when imported, for a medium that is worſe than the goods themſelves; for in that caſe, though the profits may be <hi>nominal,</hi> the loſs will be <hi>real.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe effects all point out their only remedy, <abbr>viz.</abbr> leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the quantity of the circulating medium, and this can be done by but three ways that I know of: Firſt, the <hi>deſtruction of it</hi> by ſome caſualty, as fire, ſhipwreck, &amp;c. or ſecondly, <hi>exportation</hi> of it, which cannot happen in our caſe, becauſe our medium has no currency abroad, and I think it very well for us that it has not; for in that caſe our debt would ſoon become due to people without ourſelves, and of courſe leſs ſenſible, more difficult to be paid, and more dangerous; the third, and, in my opinion, the only practicable way of leſſening the quantity is <hi>by a tan,</hi> which never can be paid ſo eaſy as when money is more plenty, than goods, and of courſe, the very cauſe which makes a tax neceſſary, facilitates the payment of it.</p>
            <p>The tax ought to be <hi>equal to the exceſs of the currency,</hi> ſo as to leſſen the currency down to that quantity which is neceſſary for a medium of trade, and this, in my opinion, ought to be done by every ſtate, whether money is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately wanted in the public treaſury or not, for it is better for any ſtate to have their exceſs of money, tho' it were all gold and ſilver, <hi>hoarded</hi> in a public treaſury or bank, than <hi>circulated</hi> among the people, for nothing can have worſe effects on any ſtate than an exceſs of money. The pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtates of Holland, where nobody can have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney who does not firſt earn it, has produced induſtry, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, economy, good habits of body and mind, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and well-eſtabliſhed riches, whilſt the exceſs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has produced the contrary in Spain, i. e. has ruined their induſtry and economy, and filled them with pride and poverty.</p>
            <p>But there is, beſides this general principle, a ſpecial reaſon in our caſe, why we ſhould pay a large part of our Continental debt by a preſent tax; the great conſumption of our armies, and ſtoppage of our imports, make a great demand for the produce of our lands, the fabrics of our
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023972_0011_0FC2BBC7EFDE41D8"/>
tradeſmen, and the labor of our people, and of courſe raiſes the prices of all theſe much higher than uſual, ſo that the huſbandman, tradeſman, and laborer get money much faſter and eaſier than they uſed to do, and it is a plain maxim, that people ſhould always pay their debts when they have a good run of buſineſs, and have money plenty; many a man has been <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> for a debt when bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and money were ſcarce, which he had <hi>neglected</hi> to pay when he could have done it with great eaſe to himſelf, had he attended to it in its proper ſeaſon; this applies to a community or ſtate as well as to a private perſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt obſervations will apply with great exactneſs to thoſe parts of the Continent which lie neareſt to the great ſcenes of the war, and have ſuffered moſt by it; and if they can bear the tax, I think thoſe who lie at a diſtance from thoſe horrors, and have felt little more than a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the diſtreſs of their brethren, can have no reaſon to complain, if they are called on for their ſhare of the expenſe.</p>
            <p>The Continental money is to be conſidered as a debt faſtened on the perſon and eſtate of every member of the United States, a debt of great honor and juſtice, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honor and juſtice, not barely <hi>empty honor,</hi> but that <hi>eſſential honor and credit</hi> in which the ſafety of the ſtate is compriſed, and therefore by confeſſion of every body muſt be punctually and honorably paid in due time; otherwiſe all ſecurity ariſing from public credit muſt be loſt, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of individuals in our public councils muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and great injuſtice muſt be done to every poſſeſſor of our public currency, to the <hi>detriment</hi> of all, and ruin of many who have placed moſt confidence in our public ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: and nothing but ſhame, ſcandal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt can enſue, for which nothing but moſt inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity can be any reaſonable excuſe.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">The citizen, at the time of writing this, had no conception that the continental money could continue to be a quick currency at 500 for 1, and finally run itſelf out to nothing, and die, not only without <hi>any tumult, but</hi> with the general <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of the people.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And in this great argument is every individual of our United States ſo deeply intereſted, that I cannot conceive
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023972_0012_0FC2BBD1C4969750"/>
one ſenſible perſon can be perſuaded to riſk theſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences for the ſake of a little delay of payment of that which muſt one day be paid, or we muſt all be ruined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Continental debt is already a heavy one, and there is no way of ſinking it but by paying it while we can; it is ſtill increaſing faſt; and without a ſpeedy tax, and a very ſufficient one, it will grow upon us beyond any poſſibility of payment. If a man only ſuffers his rents, butcher's and tradeſman's bills, &amp;c. to be unpaid a number of years, it will endanger his whole fortune. An expenſe account ought always to be paid up as ſoon as it becomes due; theſe are accumulating ſums, and it is dangerous to neglect them.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſome people ſay, it is no matter for the preſent payment of the Continental debt, we are a country of rapid increaſe, and what is contracted by three millions of people, will ſoon be paid by ſix. But how unfatherly and ungenerous is it to load poſterity with an immenſe debt, which we have an advantage in ſinking a good part of ourſelves; beſides, it will be a great diſcouragement to foreign emigrants to ſettle in this country, to be told that the country is loaded with an immenſe debt, and their firſt title to an enfranchiſement will be by beginning to pay it.</p>
            <p>We are engaged in a cauſe which, in all annals of time, has ever been deemed moſt honorable and glorious, and moſt characteriſtic of noble and generous minds, <abbr>viz.</abbr> ſpurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off ſlavery, and aſſerting our liberty. As things now ſtand, the moſt hardened, impudent Tory does not pretend that if we fail of ſupporting our cauſe, we have any other chance but that of abſolute ſubmiſſion and pardon, and even that pardon, doubtleſs, with numerous exceptions. Good GOD! Who can bear the thought of abſolute <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and pardon? Pardon!</hi> for the greateſt virtue of a civil nature that the human mind is capable of! Who can think, without diſtraction, of coming under the domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tories, and ſuing to them for favors and interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? Tories! with ſtanding armies at their heels, and ſoldiers with bayonets ready to enforce all the reſpect and ſubmiſſion they may claim.</p>

This dreadful apprehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſion introduces, with great force on my mind, another reaſon why we ought to ſink, by a ſufficient tax, as much as we can of the continental debt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That without this it is not poſſible to continue the war, and avoid abſolute ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>I conceive the <hi>value of the currency</hi> of any ſtate has <hi>a limit,</hi> a <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> beyond which it cannot go, and if the <hi>nominal ſum</hi> is extended beyond that <hi>limit,</hi> the <hi>value</hi> will not follow. No human wiſdom, or authority, can be able to ſtretch the nominal currency beyond ſuch real va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. The conſequence of any attempt to extend ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal addition, muſt depreciate the value of the whole, till it is reduced within ſaid limit.</p>
            <p>I will explain my meaning thus:<note n="(c)" place="bottom">No eſtimate of the current caſh of the Thirteen States had been made on any ſure data when this eſſay was publiſhed, but it was generally computed at about 30,000,000 of dollars, which is ſomewhat leſs than one third of the current caſh of Great Britain; but on a more critical examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject, this computation appeared much too high: perhaps, about 12,000,000 of dollars may be near the truth.</note> Suppoſe that thirty millions of dollars was the utmoſt limit of currency to which the United States of America could give real, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual value, and they ſhould emit thirty millions more; I ſay the laſt thirty millions would add nothing to the value of the whole, but would ſink the value of the whole ſixty millions down to its limit, <abbr>viz.</abbr> thirty millions; i. e. the whole ſixty millions in that caſe would not purchaſe more real, ſubſtantial goods, than the thirty millions would have done, before the other thirty millions were added to it.</p>
            <p>It follows from this, that any attempt to continue the war, by increaſing the currency beyond the aboveſaid limit, is vain, and muſt fail of the effect intended, and ruin all thoſe who poſſeſs the currency already emitted. Whether the currency already emitted riſes to the ſaid limit, is a queſtion of fact that may admit ſome doubt, but that it is not greatly within it, I think can be no doubt with people well acquainted with the nature and circumſtances of this great ſubject; and be that as it may, I think every incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience ariſing from it is eaſily remedied by a ſufficient tax. I do not apprehend we have yet ſuffered by a depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023972_0014_0FC2BBE7C903D0C8"/>
of the currency, becauſe I cannot obſerve that the general prices of goods are more raiſed than the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the war would make neceſſary, were our money all gold and ſilver, and farther extremities may produce farther effects of the ſame kind, without depreciating the currency at all.</p>
            <p>No kind of neceſſaries have riſen to the exceſs of price given laſt winter in Boſton for freſh proviſions, tho' their currency was all gold and ſilver, increaſe of riſk muſt raiſe the price of all imported goods, ſcarcity of laborers muſt raiſe the price of labor, and of conſequence the price of every thing produced by labor, ſcarcity of tradeſmen (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of whom are gone into the war) and demand for tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's fabrics, muſt raiſe the price of them; beſides, many raw materials uſed by the tradeſmen, muſt be imported at great riſk, and I do not ſee that the prices of moſt or all theſe are greater than they would be, if every Continental dollar was a ſilver one.</p>
            <p>But ſhould we admit that we are on the verge of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation, or that our currency hath ſuffered ſome little already in its value, two conſequences will follow, which deſerve great and immediate conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That a <hi>ſpeedy remedy</hi> is immediately neceſſary, which ſhall operate effectually, and prevent the ruin of our currency; and the ſecond is, that the remedy by this very means becomes more <hi>eaſy and practicable</hi> than otherwiſe it could be, becauſe a tax will be paid much more eaſily in this caſe than it could be, if money was in credit enough to be avariciouſly hoarded, and this holds, let the tax be of any nature, ſuch as general aſſeſſment of polls and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, exciſes, impoſts, or duties on goods, lotteries, &amp;c. &amp;c. in any or all theſe ways, our currency may be leſſened much eaſier, when its credit is a little doubted, than when it is at its higheſt.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">However plain the neceſſity of a tax at that time to prevent the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive increaſe of the continental money, may appear to us <hi>now,</hi> it was <hi>then</hi> not ſo clear; for after many debates in Congreſs, that meaſure was not adopted for a long time. I am told, one member of Congreſs roſe during thoſe debates with this exclamation, <q>Do you think, Gentlemen, that I will conſent to load my conſtituents with taxes, when we can ſend to our printer, and get a waggon-lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:023972_0015_0FC2BBE9B87BBF50"/>
What contributes not a little to this facility is, that it may be done by general conſent, without public uneaſineſs and diſturbance, for a depreciation of currency can be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for by nobody, but thoſe who are deeply in debt, the weight or numbers of whom I have reaſon to believe is not great at preſent in theſe States; it is the mighty intereſt of all the reſt of the inhabitants to prevent a depreciation, and I conceive every man of eſtate who has caſh in hand, or due to him, would be willing to contribute his ſhare to the leſſening our currency, and ſo preſerving its credit.

               </gap>, would eagerly chooſe this, rather than riſk his own loſs by a depreciation of the caſh he has in hand, and in debts due.</p>
            <p>In this time of diſtreſs the public has a right to every man's beſt thoughts. I have not the vanity to think I can exhauſt the ſubject, but I have ſaid ſo much on it, as I hope will ſet abler heads and pens on a thorough diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, for I think all will agree, that the ſubject is a very important one, and deſerves moſt immediate and moſt ſerious attention.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON FREE TRADE AND FINANCE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, July 1779, and dedicated to CONGRESS.</head>
            <p>FREEDOM of trade, or unreſtrained liberty of the ſubject to <hi>hold or diſpoſe of</hi> his property as he pleaſes, is abſolutely neceſſary to the proſperity of every community, and to the happineſs of all individuals who compoſe it: this liberty will produce the following effects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every induſtrious man will procure <hi>all the goods</hi> he can for ſale; this is the way to get moſt money; and gain is the ſoul of induſtry, the hope of reward ſweetens labor, and the moſt righteous have reſpect to the recompence of reward.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every man will make his goods for market of the <hi>beſt quality</hi> he can, becauſe they will bring more money and quicker ſale than goods of mean quality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every man will endeavour to carry to market the moſt <hi>ſcarce goods</hi> becauſe there is the greateſt demand and beſt price for them. All experience ſhews, that the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way to turn a ſcarcity into a plenty, is to raiſe the price of the articles wanted: witneſs, among other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the moſt alarming ſcarcity of ſaltpetre and gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, in the beginning of the preſent war, ſucceeded by the moſt abundant plenty in leſs than one year, effected altogether by the high price and premiums ſet on them.</p>

Every man will go to market and return in <hi>good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> and full ſatisfaction, even though he may be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the high price he expected, becauſe he has had the full chance of the market, and can blame nobody; and ſhould he indulge fretting on the occaſion, he would be the more ridiculed, and leſs pitied by his neighbours: and good humor and ſatisfaction contribute not a little to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſperity of communities, as well as individuals; and therefore this is an article by no means to be left out or overlooked in the adminiſtration of either public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate oeconomy.</p>

In times of danger, diſtreſs, and difficulty, every man will uſe <hi>ſtrong endeavours</hi> to get his goods to market, in proportion to the neceſſity and great demand for them; becauſe they will then bring the beſt price, and every man is fond of embracing golden opportunities and favorable chances.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When things grow ſcarce and dear, every man will uſe them with the <hi>beſt oeconomy,</hi> and make the ſtock on hand go as far and laſt as long as poſſible; or if he is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, will buy as little as will juſt ſerve his neceſſity. This naturally preſerves the ſtock on hand from needleſs profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and waſte, and converts it to the beſt and moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent uſe for the benefit of the community, and naturally tends to ward off high diſtreſs or total want, till the high price and great demand, by their natural operation, will bring further ſupplies to market.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In times of ſcarcity, every man will have ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to bring <hi>all he can ſpare</hi> to market, becauſe it will then bring the higheſt price he can ever expect, and conſequently the community will have the benefit of all that exiſts among them, in a much ſurer manner than any degree of force could extort it, and all to the entire ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of buyer and ſeller; by which the numberleſs feuds, riots, reſentments, and miſchiefs which uſually attend forced markets, would be entirely avoided; and the market be ſupplied with all there is to be had. For no principle can draw into market, all the ſupplies which are attainable,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023972_0018_0FC2BBF7B969D0A0"/>
ſo effectually, as the cheerful good-will and intereſt of the owners.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In times of ſcarcity, when all the goods that are to be had, are expoſed to ſale, it is not poſſible the prices ſhould <hi>exceed the degree of ſcarcity,</hi> for when the prices riſe very high, they will ſoon determine whether the ſcarcity is real or not; for <hi>if not real</hi> the high price will bring ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to market as will ſoon lower the price; but <hi>if real,</hi> it is neceſſary for the above reaſons, that the prices ſhould continue high till ſupplies are produced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſtraint</hi> of property or<note n="*" place="bottom">The preſſures of the war, together with the vaſt increaſe of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental money had for a conſiderable time before this Eſſay was wrote, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nominal price of all goods, to a moſt alarming degree; to remedy which the moſt unhappy expedient had been adopted in moſt of the ſtates, of <hi>regulating</hi> or <hi>limiting the prices</hi> at which goods ſhould be ſold, with high penalties on thoſe who ſhould ſell at higher prices than thoſe limited; and thoſe ordinances were carried into ſuch rigid execution, that many ſtores were forced open, and the goods ſold at the limited prices, by committees, &amp;c. when the owners refuſed to ſell them at thoſe prices; and much pains was taken to load the merchants with ſcandal and obloquy for combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to raiſe the price of goods, depreciate the currency, &amp;c. they were called Tories, Speculators, and many other hard names, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>limitation of prices</hi> will hurt any community, and will probably produce the following effects, contrary to the above.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every man will have as <hi>little to do</hi> with the market, and bring as few goods there as he can; for the leſs goods he has for ſale, the leſs mortification and loſs he ſuſtains.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every man will make his goods for market of a <hi>bad quality,</hi> or at leaſt not the beſt; for they muſt all go at the limited price, and he therefore gets nothing for any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al care or ſkill he may beſtow on his goods to meliorate or perfect their quality: for the ſame reaſon, every man will expoſe his worſt goods to market, and keep the beſt out of ſight; for example, muſty tea, ſtale flour, black heavy bread, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every man is induced to keep ſuch goods as are <hi>moſt ſcarce</hi> from market; for if he carries them there, he can get no more than the limited price, and ſtands a chance of a bad huſtling in the crowd into the bargain. Whereas, if he can keep his goods from market, the ſcarcity will ſoon force a great price, and he has a chance of great profits.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:023972_0019_0FC2BBF8A6E93268"/>
4. If prices are limited, and the owner is compelled to ſell at the prices limited, he conſiders himſelf <hi>injured</hi> by every ſale he makes for leſs than he ſuppoſes he could have obtained in a free market; that his liberty is taken from him, and he can no longer call his property his own. Theſe are hard feelings to one born to freedom almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and raiſed to the expectations of enjoying it in future time, in its higheſt perfection. Theſe feelings fill the mind with anxiety and reſentment, and when inſtances of this become numerous among the merchants, tradeſmen, and farmers, ſmall accidents may blow up the concealed coal, and moſt fatal effects may eaſily be ſuppoſed to enſue. This is a danger of no ſmall magnitude, for the real ſtrength and eſtabliſhment of every government conſiſts in the hearty union and ſatisfaction of the individuals that compoſe it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In times of danger, diſtreſs, and difficulty, no man will be induced to any <hi>great efforts</hi> to ſupply the market; for an additional danger makes an additional expenſe upon the goods; but he muſt take the limited price and no more; he will not conſequently combat or riſk an increaſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and expenſe without any chance of compenſation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When things grow ſcarce, every man will endeavour to lay in <hi>great ſtores</hi> if he can do it without an increaſe of price, and will not think it neceſſary to retrench his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, whilſt he thinks his ſtock will laſt through the ſcarcity; the conſequence of which is, that all the ſcarce articles at market will be ſcrambled up by a few hands, who will have no inducement to parſimony in the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them, by which the ſcarcity and diſtreſs are increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many muſt be wholly deſtitute; and as far as this reſpects the neceſſaries of life, the conſequences muſt be dreadful.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Add to the above, that in times of ſcarcity and great demand, every man who can poſſibly <hi>conceal</hi> his goods will be tempted to do it, in expectation that the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand will ſoon break through the unnatural reſtraint of the limitation, and he ſhall be able to obtain a great profit in the future ſale; and in ſpite of all the vigilance and force that can be uſed, many will be able to do this; which I
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023972_0020_0FC2BBFF5F655698"/>
take to be one of the natural effects of any unnatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of trade, which cannot be avoided.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In addition to all theſe, the <hi>difficulties</hi> which muſt attend the execution of ſuch an act of limitation, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps furniſh not the leaſt objection to it. Muſt the owner be obliged to ſell to every perſon who applies to purchaſe, without knowing whether he wants for uſe or ſale? Muſt he forego previous engagements of his goods in favor of the preſent demandant? Muſt he be obliged to ſell to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knave and litigious fellow, with whom he would not chuſe to be at all concerned in any dealing? Who ſhall judge how much he may reſerve for his own uſe, and whether he may give corn to his cattle and hogs, and how much, and how many of each he may keep, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Muſt he have his houſe ſearched from top to bottom for concealments? Even the lodging-rooms of his wife and daughters! I muſt beg to be excuſed from any further deſcription of theſe horrors, which too many know are not mere creatures of the imagination.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is not poſſible to form a limitation of prices which ſhall <hi>be juſt,</hi> and therefore the whole ſcheme neceſſarily implies injuſtice. The principles on which the juſt prices of goods are fixed, are in a conſtant ſtate of fluctuation, and therefore the prices muſt riſe and fall with their cauſes; all experience proves this, and it holds true in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive degree, in times of ſuch public diſtreſs and convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as we now experience. And as it is much ſafer to bind a man in health than a man in convulſions, ſo it will be ſafer to limit trade in peaceable than convulſed times. It is not more abſurd to limit the preciſe height to which a ſhip ſhall be fixed at a wharf, where the tide is conſtantly ebb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and flowing. A great force will be requiſite to keep the ſhip from riſing or falling with the tide, and a mighty little uſe to pay for the trouble; beſides the probability of very eſſential damage which the ſhip muſt incur by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the neceſſary force: but indiſcreet as this would be judged, it is leſs dangerous in a calm than in a ſtormy ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:023972_0021_0FC2BC00ED693E80"/>
10. Another miſchievous conſequence of this fatal mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not the leaſt, I conceive to be its unhappy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to <hi>corrupt the morals and integrity</hi> of the people. To eſcape the ruinous conſequences of looſing in their ſales, they are in a manner compelled, but to ſay the leaſt, they have very ſtrong temptation, either by downright lying, or uſing little arts, ſhifts, and cheats, to avoid the ſale of their goods to diſadvantage. <hi>This</hi> naturally brings them into the habit, and gives them a facility of inventing and practiſing <hi>low methods</hi> of ſhamming Abraham, which they never would otherwiſe have thought of, and which it is infinitely detrimental to the public, they ever ſhould learn; inſtances of this ſort might be enumerated without end. But it is needleſs to give examples, it were better they and their cauſes ſhould be removed, than that they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. But after all, it is ſaid that a limitation of prices is neceſſary to <hi>appreciate the currency,</hi> and <hi>ſupply the army.</hi> Two very great objects indeed: I will attend to both.</p>
            <p>I. I do not conceive that a limitation of prices can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>appreciate the currency</hi> or prevent a further depreciation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The value of money is nothing in itſelf, it is a <hi>mere relation,</hi> it is the proportion between the medium of trade and the objects of trade; theſe two will always be in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance: Therefore, if the medium of trade be increaſed, whilſt the objects of trade continue the ſame, the money muſt depreciate; if the medium of trade increaſes, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of trade decreaſe, the proportion will alter faſt, and the depreciation will increaſe in a double proportion, which I take to be the caſe at preſent. Money will therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe its value according to the increaſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of its quantity, and the increaſe or decreaſe of the quantity of goods, or the objects of trade. This principle is grounded on the nature of the thing, and can never be altered, and conſequently any attempt to oppoſe it muſt be equally vain, as oppoſing any other law of nature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. It follows from this, that nothing can ever appreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the money, but leſſening its quantity, or increaſing the quantity of goods or objects of trade, and all attempts to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023972_0022_0FC2BC0263C9D998"/>
do this in any other method, will prove vain and fruitleſs in the end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It follows, that the price that any article of trade will bring in a free, open market, is the only <hi>meaſure of the value</hi> of that article at that time, and if this is warped from the truth, by any artifices of the merchant, or force of power, it cannot hold; but the error will ſoon diſcover it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the correction of it will be compelled by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force of natural principles, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is not poſſible for merchants to raiſe goods too high, or the force of power to depreſs them too low, and make them keep ſo. Both theſe may be done for a ſhort time, but neither can laſt long.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It follows that any limitation of prices, however ſtrongly enforced, if below the rates required by this great natural proportion, is but <hi>temporary injuſtice,</hi> cannot be of long continuance, will tend daily to leſſen the quantity of goods in market, and ſo will increaſe the miſchief it was deſigned to prevent, and bring with it a large train of evils beſides, which will require much time and wiſdom to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and many that will be utterly remedileſs, examples of which are obvious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Money is made only for a medium of trade, and muſt be kept in <hi>circulation and uſe,</hi> or it periſhes; for to ſtop the circulation of money and to kill it is the ſame thing, ſtop its courſe and it dies, give it circulation again and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives, or comes to life again; therefore, the price of goods for ſale, or objects of trade (<hi>i.e.</hi> every thing for which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is paid) muſt always be ſo high, as to require all the money there is to purchaſe them, otherwiſe the ſum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining cannot circulate, <hi>i. e.</hi> there will be nothing to lay it out upon, and ſo the owner muſt keep it by him, dead and uſeleſs: ſo that let what ſums of money ſoever be in circulation, the objects of trade muſt either increaſe in quantity, or riſe in price ſo high as to take all the money there is in circulation to purchaſe them, and as this natural law cannot be reſtrained, ſo neither can it be exceeded by any degree of artifice or force for any long time, for if the objects of trade riſe ſo high that all the money in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023972_0023_0FC2BC0946BFF760"/>
will not purchaſe them, the overplus muſt remain dead and unſaleable in the hands of the owner, which will ſoon reduce the price; for goods which cannot be ſold, are as uſeleſs in the hands of the merchant, as money which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be circulated.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Every limitation of prices below their due proportion, <hi>checks the circulation</hi> of money, than which nothing can be more dangerous, when money is over plenty; this has been the conſtant effect of every limitation of prices which has been tried in America. Buſineſs immediately ſtagnates, goods cannot be had, people cannot purchaſe with their money the neceſſaries they want, they begin of courſe to think that their money is good for nothing, and refuſe to take any more of it, and grow willing to part with what they have on hand at a depreciated value; ſo that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain operation of a limitation of prices is a further depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the money inſtead of the contrary. Inſtead of this, it is of the laſt neceſſity in a plenty of money, that a free circulation be kept up, people will readily and even greedily take any money which they can readily paſs again. And as long as this laſts, there can be no danger of the money's ſtopping; whereas, the contrary chills it at once, and in a ſhort time muſt chill it into a torpor, incapable of cure. Much in this caſe depends on opinion, which is ſoon formed by people in general, when they find they cannot buy neceſſaries with their money. Specious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, warm harrangues, declarations of Congreſs, or even the force of power operate little againſt this; it is a gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing intuitive proof of the badneſs of money, when it will not purchaſe neceſſaries, and as glaring and ſtrong a proof that it is good, when it will buy any thing in market. Hence appears the neceſſity of keeping up a high and briſk circulation of money, and the folly and danger of limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any other meaſures which prevent a circulation and obſtruct trade. Theſe are arguments grounded on plain fact, they have their foundation in the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and no artifice or force of man can prevent, elude, or avoid their effects; their operation is uncontrolable, and therefore I conceive all oppoſition to them is the height of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023972_0024_0FC2BC0CDC1C2EA8"/>
abſurdity, and dangerous in the higheſt degree.—For ten months before the late limitations, we had a trade perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free, on which two obſervations are obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That any goods at market might be bought for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental money, the Speculators eſpecially (as they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) were fond of receiving it, and no perſon could be at any loſs for any thing at market, if he had that money to purchaſe the goods he needed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That imported goods on an average (which were the only articles Speculators dealt in) were 50 per cent. cheaper on the 25th of May laſt, than on the 25th of July preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>i. e.</hi> any given quantity of imported goods would buy 50 per cent. more articles of country produce, or hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, on the 25th of July, than on the 25th of May laſt; and for the truth of this, I refer to the merchants' books; from which it follows that the Speculators (however nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and however cenſured) have not raiſed the price of the goods they have principally dealt it:—Indeed all experience teaches, that the more hands the goods in market are held by, the cheaper they will be, and the more difficult to raiſe the price; and therefore, if the merchants ever think of raiſing the price of any article, they never fail to ſay, We muſt wait till theſe goods are drained out of the ſmall ſtores and get them into few hands. In July 25, 1778, price current of imported goods, at Philadelphia, was as follows, Weſt-India rum 3l. 15s. Muſcovado ſugars 30l. molaſſes 40s. pepper 17s. 6d. coffee 9s. cotton 15s. bohea tea 60s. Madeira wine 400l. dry goods about 8 to 1 old prices, and hard money 4 to 1, and price current of country produce, was as follows, for Indian corn 15s. oats 12s. flour 60s. bar iron 200l. conſequently on July 25, 1778, one gallon of Weſt-India rum would bring 5 buſhels of Indian corn, 6 buſhels of oats, 1¼ hundred of flour, and 2/5 of a <hi>hundred of iron,</hi> or 18s. 9d. hard money; any body may eaſily compare the reſt, and they will find enough to prove my aſſertion with large allowance. Price current 25th May laſt was, rum 7l. ſugars 130l. iron 800l. tea 6l. 10s. &amp;c. Indian corn 7l. 10s. oats 90s. flour 30l. (hard money 20 to 1) and conſequently one gallon of rum would buy no
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023972_0025_0FC2BC10BAEB2CF8"/>
more than one buſhel of Indian corn, 1½ buſhel of oats, ¼ hundred flour, and 2/5 hundred iron or 7s. hard money, &amp;c. Theſe computations are made in the face of the world, and grounded on facts which any body may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove if they are not true, or correct the reaſoning if it is not juſt. Now I have only to add; let any body who is diſpoſed to ſee, open their eyes, and ſee who it is that has raiſed our prices, or <hi>which is the ſame thing,</hi> depreciated our money. Is it the Speculators who deal only in import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed articles? Or the farmers, among whom no kind of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſpeculation does or can exiſt? Perhaps it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here, that the articles of country produce are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcarce, which raiſes their price beyond the due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other things: if you ſay this, you ſay every thing and yield every thing, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the plenty and ſcarcity of goods will govern the price. You muſt admit too, that the plenty and ſcarcity of money will determine the value of that alſo. Why then will any one pretend to limit either, againſt the operation of this great principle? It is eaſy, in addition to all this, to prove that the price of imported articles in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral does not exceed the value of them, if computed on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of acquirement: but this I mean only to hint, and wave it for the preſent; and only wiſh ſome merchants of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reputation would take it up, and publiſh the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eſſay on it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think that the ſcheme of loans can give eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the currency, or prevent its depreciation.—For</p>
            <p n="1">1. All loans increaſe the public debt, and the immenſity of the ſum is one cauſe of the depreciation, as it induces people to think it never will be paid, or the payment will neceſſarily be delayed to ſuch a diſtant period, as in point of uſe to the preſent poſſeſſor <hi>is nearly</hi> equal to total failure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the credit of the Loan-Office is well ſupported (as it muſt be to give it any good effect) the Loan-Office certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates themſelves will paſs in payment, and ſo become an addition to the currency which they are deſigned to leſſen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If foreign loans are negotiated, and bills ſold here, drawn on the loaned bank in Europe, thoſe very bills will become a currency here, and ſo add to the miſchief.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:023972_0026_0FC2BC19769EAA80"/>
4. The diſcount on all European bills, is not leſs than 50 per cent. which loſs muſt immediately be ſuſtained by the Continent on the firſt ſale of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If hard money, borrowed in Europe, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſold here, the inſurance, which is more than 50 per cent. muſt be loſt, nor can any man tell the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which would attend any attempt to import hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and open offices for the ſale of it for continental bills: but a large group of theſe preſent themſelves too plainly to need enumeration.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nor do I think the<note n="*" place="bottom">This was a propoſal for a ſubſcription and immediate advance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to be diſcounted on the future taxes, of the ſubſcribers.</note> ſcheme adopted by <hi>our Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee</hi> promiſes better ſucceſs; for that propoſes Loaning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inducement; and if it ſhould ſucceed to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, it would drain the beſt friends to our cauſe of their money, whilſt our internal enemies would pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for no compulſion is propoſed, and after all, it will be at beſt but an anticipation of the revenue, very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the end; for the very <hi>worſt</hi> thing that can be done reſpecting a revenue, is to <hi>deſtroy it all,</hi> principal and uſe, and the <hi>next worſt</hi> thing is to <hi>anticipate it, i. e.</hi> to ſpend this year the rent and proceeds which will become due and payable next year, and theſe two are ſo connected, that the latter generally brings on the former ſooner or later.</p>
            <p>After all theſe objections to the various methods that have been propoſed, it may be expected that I ſhould propoſe ſome method that will be practicable and effectual to fix the value of our currency; and this I cannot think very difficult, either in theory or practice, though I have not one new thought to offer the public on the ſubject. We are now on the brink of ruin, and the worſt diſgrace, in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of loſs of liberty hitherto nobly aſſerted, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſhameful ſlavery to enemies moſt cruel and inſulting in themſelves, and all that heightened in them to madneſs by the determined oppoſition we have given to their ſcheme of tyranny over us. All this danger ariſes not from our <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty or want,</hi> for we have officers and ſoldiers enough, ſtores
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023972_0027_0FC2BC1AC61BB880"/>
of every kind enough, and zeal, union, and virtue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to inſure ſucceſs; our difficulties ariſe only from our having <hi>too much money,</hi> and the leſſening that quantity would relieve us at once from every difficulty, and diſſipate the thickeſt clouds that hang over us.</p>
            <p>In matters of difficulty and importance, all wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors compare well the <hi>end</hi> and the <hi>means,</hi> on which two very weighty matters always preſent themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether the means are ſufficient to ſecure and effect the end propoſed.—And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the end is worth the means neceſſary to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. When theſe two points are ſettled, there remains no more room for conſultation or debate, the reſt is all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous action, ſtrenuous exertion to put the means into ſuch effectual execution as to obtain the end. This is a wiſe method of planning, which no man will have any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to. We will then adopt it in the conſideration of the weighty ſubject now in view.</p>

Let people ſee the money collecting through the Continent, and the ſources of revenue actually opened, and the whole matter in train, there can remain no doubt but the whole of the Continental money will be redeemed, and every one will venture to truſt the credit of it; and in this confidence it will be ſoon ſought after and graſped with greedineſs, and hugged and hoarded with avidity.</p>

1. It is rare that the people refuſe burdens or even grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under them, when, by general conviction, they are neceſſary for the public good. And I dare ſay, that the abſolute neceſſity of fixing and eſtabliſhing our currency is become obvious to almoſt every individual on this Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and the real neceſſity of taxes for this purpoſe clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen by all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As far as my acquaintance with people of middling rank extends, they have been generally in favor of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for three years paſt; they ſay this money muſt be paid firſt or laſt, and we can better pay it now whilſt we have little uſe for our money, whilſt it is plenty and eaſy to be got, than in future time, when we can perhaps not ſo well ſpare it, and when the getting it will be much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>enormity of the ſum</hi> required for this purpoſe conſiſts much more in <hi>ſound</hi> than <hi>ſubſtance;</hi> a quarterly tax of one buſhel of wheat, or two buſhels of Indian corn per head, on all perſons in the Thirteen States, would be amply ſufficient. The number of ſouls are computed at 3,000,000, in all the States, and of courſe this would produce 12,000,000 buſhels of wheat, which at 20 dollars per bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel (the loweſt preſent price) will be 240,000,000 millions of dollars, a ſum greatly exceeding any annual exigence of theſe States; each State might apportion this as they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo as to relieve the poor, and increaſe the ſhare of the rich, but the middling farmer, who has ten in family, would have 40 buſhels of wheat or its value, to pay in a year.</p>
            <p>I admit this would be a high tax; but is there any thing impoſſible or ruinous in this. In the beſt of times, it would have been 40 dollars or 15l. and the ſame ſum of hard money will probably now pay it, it is to be obſerved this is not the tax of a poor man or a new beginner, but of a middling farmer, with ten in family; ſuch are ſpread over the face of this fertile country, and few of them ſo poor, that ſuch a ſum would diſtreſs them to any great degree.—It is to be obſerved further this is not a tax to <hi>laſt always,</hi> but to be paid only for a <hi>ſhort time,</hi> during our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023972_0030_0FC2BC2C864A6D88"/>
ſtrong exertions for the liberty of ourſelves and our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;—again, this ſum is not all to be paid <hi>at once,</hi> but at <hi>four quarterly payments;</hi>—again this is not a tax which demands <hi>wheat</hi> in kind, <hi>hard money,</hi> or any thing elſe that is <hi>ſcarce</hi> and <hi>hard to be obtained,</hi> but for <hi>Continental money,</hi> which is ſo <hi>plenty</hi> as to become the great burden of the country, and the <hi>ſource</hi> of moſt of our public calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and which any valuable commodity will procure in plenty, and with little trouble; and for which any man may fell any thing he can beſt ſpare without difficulty;—again, this is a <hi>ſure method</hi> to overcome our capital diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and fix the currency, whereas all others are <hi>preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and uncertain</hi> in their effect. This is a <hi>durable, a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed</hi> remedy; all others that have been propoſed are at beſt but <hi>temporary,</hi> and ſhould they ſucceed, would involve us and our poſterity in great difficulties, involve us in a vaſt debt, which would lie ſo heavy on the country as would greatly check our future proſperity, and diſcourage foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from coming to ſettle with us. For nobody likes to move into a country where taxes are very high and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>

               </gap> ſubmit it to every man, whether it will not be much eaſier for us by a ſpirited exertion, for a ſhort time, to collect large ſums of our preſent currency, and pay our expenſes as faſt as they ariſe, than if a foreign loan could be obtained, to pay a <hi>vaſt debt</hi> of hard money with intereſt to <hi>foreigners</hi> in future time, when every dollar we pay, muſt <hi>go out of the country</hi> never to return again. Every man ought to conſider that his proportion of the public debt is as much a debt <hi>faſtened on his eſtate,</hi> and becomes to all intents and purpoſes as much a <hi>burden</hi> and <hi>charge on it,</hi> as any of his private debts of the ſame amount, and muſt as ſurely one day be paid; is it not better then to pay it now than to have it lie a burden on him, to be paid in in future time, which may be called for when he may not be in condition to pay it ſo eaſy as now. Every prudent man does this with reſpect to his private debts, and what reaſon can be given why the ſame prudence ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the debt which he owes the public? Can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be aſſigned why the States ſhould not imitate the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023972_0031_0FC2BC2E0950D788"/>
and economy of a private man, who happens to be involved for a time in great expenditures, which is, to pay up and diſcharge as much as poſſible as he goes, and leave as little as poſſible to be ſettled in future time.</p>
            <p>To facilitate this, I humbly propoſe one thing more, <abbr>viz.</abbr> To take off every reſtraint and limitation from our commerce. Let <hi>trade be as free as air.</hi> Let every man make the moſt of his goods and in his own way, and then he will be ſatisfied. Let every man taſte and enjoy the ſweets of that liberty of perſon and property, which was highly expected under an independent government. It is a ſad omen to find among the firſt effects of independence, greater reſtraints and abridgments of natural liberty, than ever we felt under the government we have lately renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſhaken off. Let the laws point out the <hi>duty,</hi> and be the bulwark of <hi>ſecurity</hi> of every man.</p>
            <p>Nothing gives the people ſuch high ſatisfaction with any ſyſtem of government they live under, as the actual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ineſtimable bleſſings of perfect liberty and full ſecurity under it; this will moſt effectually induce them cheerfully to ſupport it. No burdens will be thought hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, or difficulties diſcouraging, which the exigencies of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may require, when every man finds his own <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> involved in the <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of the State.</p>
            <p>If, on the freedom of trade, any articles ſhould riſe in their price, the miſchief facilitates this remedy, it makes the payment of the taxes more eaſy and tolerable. Whereas, if the taxes were collected during the limitation of the market and ſtagnation of buſineſs, the payment would be extremely difficult, and the murmurs high and reaſonable; it would be almoſt like the Egyptians demanding brick without ſtraw. But when the circulation of money is briſk, and the price and demand for goods high, every one knows that money may be raiſed and taxes may be paid much more eaſily than in dull times of ſtagnated buſineſs. And this ought to be noticed on another account.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary our <hi>firſt taxes</hi> ſhould be rendered as <hi>eaſy</hi> as poſſible to the people; for tho' high in nominal ſum, if they find them eaſily paid, the terror and uneaſineſs which
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023972_0032_0FC2BC3AD2CA3228"/>
high taxes generally raiſe, will moſtly vaniſh, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be made without endangering the peace of the State, and theſe things all conſidered together naturally lead us to the true anſwer to the ſecond great queſtion to be ſolved, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>How is the army to be ſupplied?</hi> The method I propoſe, if it can be adopted, will undoubtedly fix the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and create a great demand for money, and a quick circulation of it; this will of courſe open all the ſtores in the State to any purchaſers that may offer, and a <hi>little pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> uſed in purchaſing, may ſupply the army to the full, at reaſonable prices. Indeed I am rather afraid of <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing</hi> the thing in this way, ſo far as to cauſe an <hi>apprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the money, which I do not think ought ever to be done, for I ſee no reaſon why the States ſhould be taxed to raiſe the money in my pocket to twenty times the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent value of it; but this is a great argument, and may be the ſubject of future diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>I muſt add here, that this method will not only fix our currency and ſupport our army, but will afford another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of no ſmall moment: it will take away the <hi>capital hope</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of our enemies of conquering us; for they depend more on the <hi>failure</hi> of our funds than on their <hi>own force,</hi> for this purpoſe; they count high on the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, contention, oppreſſions, and miſchiefs that will ariſe from the low, ſinking credit of our money; and by this are encouraged to continue the war, which they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh as deſperate without it.</p>
            <p>I will juſt note here, that however intolerable the means I propoſe may appear at firſt ſight, I cannot think them impracticable; the tax I propoſe is not more than two thirds of the annual taxes in Great Britain; the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue raiſed every year there is about 12,500,000l. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which is ſomewhat more than 55,000,000 dollars, reckoning them at 4s. 6d. a-piece; divide this by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſouls in Great Britain, which are computed at 9,000,000, and we have the ſum of ſomewhat more than 6 dollars per head on each of the inhabitants or living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there; but, be this as it may, to balance the argument
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023972_0033_0FC2BC3C1EE3E5E0"/>
fairly, I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtands thus: on the one ſide <hi>certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and on the other a <hi>tax</hi> ſo heavy, that a middling farmer's ſhare annually, will be 40 buſhels of wheat, 40 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars hard money, or the value of it in any thing he chooſes to ſell, to be paid in four quarterly payments. This, if it can be done, will undoubtedly ſave us, reſtore our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thoroughly, fix our currency, and ſupply our army; without this, I do not ſee how theſe great objects can be effected. If any other method can be deviſed, it is more than all the united wiſdom of America has yet been able to find and accompliſh, nor do I conceive we have any long time to heſitate; ſomething ſpeedy and deciſive muſt avert our fate.</p>
            <p>Thus I have offered my beſt thoughts freely to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and with moſt upright intentions; I hope they may be received with candour. The facts and reaſonings are all open to the examination of every one; if they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, I hope at leaſt they may induce ſome abler perſon to ſketch out ſomething more perfect and adequate to the great ſubject.</p>

            <head>A SECOND ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, Auguſt 1779, and dedicated to the ſeveral Legiſlatures of the American Union.</head>
            <p>IN my laſt ESSAY I obſerved, that the value of money was nothing in itſelf, it was a mere relation, it was the proportion between the medium of trade and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of trade, which two will be for ever in balance, or equal the one to the other; therefore, if the money or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of trade be increaſed, whilſt the objects of trade or occaſions of money continue the ſame, the value of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney muſt depreciate or leſſen; and this depreciation muſt and will be <hi>(coeteris paribus)</hi> according to the increaſe of the quantity.</p>
            <p>It follows hence, <hi>that the value of the current money in any country, cannot be increaſed by any additions made to its quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> I do not pretend that theſe propoſitions are abſolutely univerſal—I know that money may be ſo leſſened in its quantity, as to be inadequate to the purpoſes of trade; in which caſe, an addition to its quantity would doubtleſs add to its value and uſe. It is equally true, that the quantity of money may be increaſed to ſuch an immenſity of exceſs, that the very bulk or enormous maſs would render it incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for a medium of trade. I do not mean, nor does my argument require, that my propoſitions ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023972_0035_0FC2BC4C2C841E40"/>
to either of theſe extremes; it is ſufficient for my purpoſe, that they hold true in any country where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or medium of trade is ſo duly adapted and proportioned to the objects of trade, that the one is found adequate and ſufficient for the other; in which caſe, any departure from the ſaid due proportion, either by increaſing or decreaſing the medium, muſt verge either towards one or the other of theſe extremes, and partake more or leſs of their diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>It follows from the above, that <hi>our national debt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental money has not increaſed in value for three years paſt, notwithſtanding the vaſt increaſe of the bulk or nominal ſum;</hi> and this propoſition is proved from fact (which is the beſt poſſible proof of any principle advanced in theory) for it is evident that it would not require one farthing more <hi>real va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,</hi> ſay country produce or hard money, to buy up every Continental dollar <hi>now</hi> in circulation, than would have been neceſſary <hi>three years ago,</hi> to purchaſe all that was then in circulation; <hi>i. e.</hi> the depreciation has kept full pace with its increaſe of quantity. Indeed, I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it rather <hi>exceeds</hi> this proportion, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the money has depreciated faſter than the increaſe of its quantity would require, and that it would of courſe require a leſs real value to purchaſe it all now, than would have bought it all three years ago. I think the enormity of the ſum has carried it within the ſenſible influence of that <hi>fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme</hi> which muſt finally deſtroy its whole value and uſe, if the quantity continues to increaſe.</p>
            <p>It appears then that we do not owe a ſhilling more of <hi>real value</hi> than we owed three years ago, except the debt abroad and the loans at home which have been contracted ſince; ſo that our finances are not in ſo deplorable a ſtate as they ſeem to be, and a remedy is much more in our power than would be imagined on the firſt view of the matter, and may be adopted for three years to come, if the war ſhould continue ſo long, with leſs <hi>burden, hardſhip, oppreſſion, danger, damage,</hi> and <hi>loſs</hi> than we have, to our ſorrow, experienced for three years paſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:023972_0036_0FC2BC4D8D287C08"/>
It follows then, that <hi>all the expenditures of the war for three years paſt except the foreign debts and internal loans</hi> (in which laſt I include the monies due for lottery prizes) <hi>have been actually paid in depreciation of our currency,</hi> which is perhaps the moſt inconvenient method of levying pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic taxes that could be invented.</p>
            <p>As this propoſition may be new to ſome people, I only beg they would not be ſtartled too much at it, but have patience to read a few lines further, in which I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider both parts of it.</p>
            <p>Without going into minute calculations of the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, or determining with preciſion the preſent exchange, I imagine it will not be diſputed that the depreciation for three years paſt has been at leaſt <hi>fifty per cent.</hi> per ann. <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>one hundred pounds</hi> at the end of the year, would not buy more goods than <hi>fifty pounds</hi> would have purchaſed at the beginning of the year. Try it for the year paſt: in Auguſt 1778, fifty pounds would have purchaſed ſixteen hundred of flour, fifty buſhels of Indian corn, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of bar iron, one and an half hundred of ſugar, twelve pounds of hard money, &amp;c. See if one hundred pounds will buy as much now.</p>
            <p>This is arguing on fact, which is ſtubborn and yields to the prejudice of no man. It appears then that a man who has kept one hundred pounds by him for the ſpace of one year, is to all intents in the ſame condition he would have been in, if the hundred pounds had kept its value un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depreciated, and he had paid one half of it in a tax, <hi>i. e.</hi> in both caſes he would have had fifty pounds and no more left. He has then, to all intents and purpoſes, paid a tax of fifty pounds for the year towards the depreciation, and has now fifty pounds leſs money than he would have had if no depreciation had taken place, as much in every reſpect as his caſh would have leſſened fifty pounds by paying a tax of that ſum.</p>
            <p>I have heard that this plea was made uſe of by the Agents of the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies, when the matter of reimburſements to thoſe colonies, for their great expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the two laſt wars, was debated and granted in the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023972_0037_0FC2BC4F09A1F140"/>
               <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and the argument allowed to be a good one. The queſtion was, what ſums thoſe colonies had emitted for the ſervice of the wars, and what was the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the bills to be redeemed? the Agents pleaded, that the value was to be eſtimated at the <hi>time of emiſſion,</hi> not at the <hi>time of redemption</hi> of thoſe bills; for when bills of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit depreciate in any country, <hi>the depreciation is as much a tax on the inhabitants as the depreciated ſum would be, if levied in the uſual way of aſſeſſment on polls and eſtates.</hi> The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is indeed a demonſtrable one, and ſupported and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by plain fact in every view; yet there is ſuch a <hi>ſubtle and ſtrong deluſion</hi> in the depreciation as obſcures the ſubject, and will almoſt cheat a man who views it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der full conviction, and feels the effects of it; and this tends to render the <hi>miſchief more ruinous</hi> than otherwiſe it would be, becauſe people who feel it, often <hi>miſtake the cauſe,</hi> and adopt from thence remedies altogether <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,</hi> and ſometimes very <hi>hurtful,</hi> and which often tend rather to <hi>increaſe</hi> than <hi>cure</hi> the evil.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort, I take to be the whole torrent of <hi>cenſure and abuſe</hi> which has been thrown out and kept up againſt the merchants, farmers, and tradeſmen, for raiſing the prices of their ſeveral fabrics and goods. Of this ſort like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I conſider the abſurd ſcheme of <hi>limitation of prices,</hi> which never fails to limit goods out of the market, at leaſt out of ſight; prevents importations and manufactures, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the adventures of the moſt patriotic merchants, who keep their money in trade through all riſks, in order to produce foreign goods, without which, neither the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could be ſupplied, nor the war be ſupported; checks the induſtry of the farmers and tradeſmen, without which all internal ſupplies muſt fail; fills the minds of all with ill humor, and raiſes the country into factions and heated parties, zealous to devour one another, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are only a few of the evils which ariſe from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken cauſes of the depreciation of our currency, and the conſequent improper methods adopted for its remedy, all which prove the abſurdity as well as the reality of defraying the expenditures of the war in that way, which naturally
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023972_0038_0FC2BC5081684290"/>
brings on the conſideration of the ſecond part of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <abbr>viz.</abbr> this method of paying the expenſes of the war is very inconvenient.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this method brings the burden beyond due proportion, on the moſt <hi>virtuous and uſeful</hi> of our people, ſuch as by prudence and economy have made money and got a good command of caſh, lying in debts due on mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, bonds, book-debts, &amp;c. and at the ſame time ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in favor of the moſt <hi>worthleſs men</hi> amongſt us, the <hi>diſſipating, ſlack, lazy,</hi> and <hi>dilatory</hi> ſort, who commonly keep themſelves in debt, and live on the fortunes of others. Theſe contemptible, uſeleſs characters are enabled hereby, after keeping a creditor years out of his juſt due, to pay him off with one <hi>fourth,</hi> yea, one <hi>eighth,</hi> yea, one <hi>ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,</hi> yea, one <hi>twentieth</hi> part of the value of the debt when it was contracted, by which the frugal and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are compelled to pay a very heavy tax to thoſe uſeleſs, idle men, by which many of them have acquired great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and of courſe great weight among us, to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt damage of the public; for the weight and influence of this ſort of men, ought never to be increaſed in any community, for wherever we ſee one of them taking the lead among the people, we have reaſon to believe that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is a brewing, and that the public peace and ſecurity is more or leſs in danger. For the truth of this, I appeal to the experience and obſervation of all wiſe and good men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this way the burden comes very heavy on the moſt <hi>helpleſs part of our people,</hi> who are moſt entitled to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the ſtate, and ought not to have their burdens increaſed; ſuch as widows, orphans, and old men, whoſe principal dependence is on legacies, money at intereſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It oppreſſes the <hi>ſalary-men</hi> and <hi>all public officers,</hi> both in church and ſtate, whoſe fees and ſalaries are reduced to almoſt nothing, and any applications for relief are apt to raiſe an unreaſonable clamor againſt them, as if avarice and greedineſs of money was their principal paſſion. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices the public ſervice, in which they are employed, and diſcourages men of abilities from ſeeking or accepting ſuch
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023972_0039_0FC2BC5F64381C28"/>
public offices, and leſſens the weight and influence of thoſe who hold them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This diſcourages <hi>induſtry and trade;</hi> for if the profits obtained by theſe waſte in the deſk, there is little induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to increaſe the ſtock.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This defrauds the <hi>army of their pay</hi> and appointments, and <hi>diſcourages inliſtments,</hi> and promotes deſertions, &amp;c. Many would like the army very well, if they could live by the profeſſion; but few are ſo attached to it as to be willing to be ruined there.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It makes <hi>ſupplies for the army difficult</hi> to be obtained; becauſe few men are fond of carrying the fruits of their year's labor to the army, to be ſold for a periſhing medium, which every day grows worſe and worſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The whole ſyſtem is grounded <hi>in injuſtice, is contrary to the firſt maxims of upright dealing, and corrupts the whole courſe of trade and commutative juſtice,</hi> and of courſe will ſoon <hi>deſtroy</hi> all principles of <hi>morality</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> in trade, among the people; for here it is to be conſidered, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is not only the <hi>inſtrument or means</hi> by which trade is carried on, but becomes a ſort of <hi>common meaſure of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of all articles of trade;</hi> and therefore I ſhould conceive it would be as dangerous to adopt any meaſures which would alter its value and render it fluctuating, as to alter the <hi>ſtandard weights</hi> and <hi>meaſures,</hi> by which the quantity of goods ſold in market is uſually aſcertained:—as for example, to ſhorten the ſtandard <hi>yard,</hi> leſſen the ſtandard <hi>buſhel,</hi> or diminiſh the ſtandard <hi>pound</hi> weight, or adopt any meaſures that tend to this, and will probably effect it. We eaſily ſee the dangerous conſequences, nor can there be any neceſſity to expoſe here the abſurdities and miſchiefs which muſt follow.</p>
            <p>Enough has been ſaid on this dreary ſubject; the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs are too glaring to need further proof; a remedy is the great thing now to be ſought: ought we then to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a remedy of the miſchiefs of <hi>depreciation,</hi> by any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>appreciate</hi> our currency? I think not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſum depreciated has been <hi>paid by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try once already,</hi> by the depreciation itſelf in their hands,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023972_0040_0FC2BC60EB013760"/>
and there is no reaſon why the ſame country ſhould be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay it over again: <hi>i. e.</hi> every man who has had a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds in his pocket a month, has paid four per cent. <hi>i. e.</hi> four pounds of tax for it at leaſt; but this is not the worſt of it, for he has likewiſe paid four per cent. per month on all the monies that were due to him during the whole time (by which the public were not benefited.) But exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable as this method of ſupplying the public exigencies may be, it has had its <hi>full effect,</hi> and therefore there can be no reaſon that payment ſhould be made over again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The evil ariſes from the fluctuation and changeable ſtate of the currency.</hi> It matters little to the community whether it <hi>riſes</hi> or <hi>falls,</hi> the fall of it has hurt the rich, the riſe of it will ruin the poor; but to continue the fluctuation by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating it, is to continue the whole evil in all its deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force and ruinous effects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The miſchief <hi>is done,</hi> and ought by no means <hi>to be repeated,</hi> the widows and orphans are already ruined, and I think it needs no proof that almoſt all the money is now poſſeſſed by people who have bought it at the preſent value, and ſhall the widows and orphans, with the reſt of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, be taxed to raiſe or appreciate the money in the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the rich, up to <hi>twenty times</hi> the preſent value of it? Verily I trow not.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Any</hi> PROBABLE <hi>attempt to raiſe or appreciate the value of the money, would hoard it immediately,</hi> and</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Deſtroy our trade;</hi> for the riſe of money in the deſk would be better than the profits of any trade it can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in.—And</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſcarcity would ſoon make <hi>the payment of taxes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.</hi>—And</p>
            <p n="7">7. Every <hi>poor man would lie perfectly at the mercy of the rich,</hi> who alone would be benefited by his diſtreſs; for if the poor ſhould run in debt to the rich in the beginning of the year, the debt would be much increaſed by the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation at the end of the year, and ſo from year to year, till the ſum would riſe beyond the utmoſt abilities of the poor man to pay it, and he muſt of courſe be perfectly at the mercy of his rich creditor.—Hence</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:023972_0041_0FC2BC62602631B0"/>
8. <hi>Popular diſcontents,</hi> and perhaps <hi>inſurrections</hi> would probaby be the conſequence, and after all</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>This plan of appreciation would not be any remedy to the principal ſufferers by the depreciation;</hi> for not one tenth part of the appreciated currency would probably be found in the ſame hands that ſuffered by the depreciation; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of tax would be more to the greateſt part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than all the profits they would gain by the apprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is not ſuppoſable that <hi>thirteen General Aſſemblies would concur in voting and levying</hi> ſuch a uſeleſs, burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and pernicious tax:—nor if they would, is it likely that the people either <hi>could</hi> or <hi>would</hi> pay it.—Therefore,</p>
            <p n="11">11. It appears that theſe reaſons, which prove that this <hi>ought not</hi> to be done, all tend to prove that it <hi>cannot</hi> be done, and this is a good reaſon why it ought not to be <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.</hi> But to ſum up the whole argument in one word,</p>
            <p n="12">12. All the miſchiefs ariſing from a <hi>depreciation,</hi> would equally ariſe from an <hi>appreciation;</hi> but in an <hi>inverſed order,</hi> and I think it will appear plain to any perſon of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who duly and attentively conſiders it, that inverſing the order, will infer many miſchiefs <hi>more ruinous</hi> to the community, than thoſe we have already felt from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation: but in any view, the very idea that we are to live under the curſe of a fluctuating currency eighteen years longer is intolerable.</p>
            <p>Therefore I humbly propoſe, that the fooliſh method of <hi>denying</hi> the depreciation or <hi>lowering</hi> it below what it really is, may be wholly diſcontinued, and that as ſoon as the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the currency is fixed, there may be a<note n="*" place="bottom">This idea of forming a ſcale of depreciation, I believe was the firſt ever propoſed in <hi>America,</hi> and was much cenſured and even reprobated at firſt, but ſoon afterwards was adopted by Congreſs and all the States.</note> 
               <hi>ſcale</hi> or <hi>table</hi> of exchange eſtabliſhed as near as may be to its then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent true value, and that hard money be received and paid in the Continental Treaſury according to it: this will effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prevent its appreciation, and if means can be found to collect monies ſufficient for future expenditures, which
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023972_0042_0FC2BC63DECAC060"/>
I do not think difficult, no further depreciation need be apprehended, the currency will become fixed, which is all that the ſafety of the ſtate requires, and all that we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably hope for, or even wiſh to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to inſert here one propoſition more, which I think deducible from the foregoing ones, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that if any country which had a medium of trade properly balanced and adapted to the purpoſes of trade, ſhould by any means receive a large <hi>addition of money</hi> without an <hi>increaſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of money, it would be more the intereſt of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to <hi>call in,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> that additional quantity by taxes (if it could not be drained off ſpeedily ſome other way) than <hi>to let it circulate</hi> among them; for example, if by opening mines, by large treaſure trove, by large ſucceſs and captures in war, or by too many preſſes the money ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed beyond the due quantity neceſſary for the purpoſes of a medium of trade: in ſuch caſe, I give my opinion, that it would be more for the benefit of ſuch country, to call in and deſtroy <hi>ſuch ſurpluſage</hi> of caſh, by taxes equally levied on all, than to <hi>permit it to circulate</hi> among them.—For</p>
            <p n="1">1. This <hi>increaſed</hi> quantity of money, if ſuffered to circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, would <hi>depreciate</hi> till it had duly diffuſed itſelf over the country, when it would acquire a <hi>certain rate</hi> of exchange, and its value would become fixed in ſuch a manner, that <hi>the value of the whole</hi> would be juſt equal to the <hi>value of the money which was in circulation before the increaſe happened,</hi> and conſequently the country would gain nothing by it, but an increaſed <hi>nominal ſum;</hi> juſt as if the <hi>ſtandard yard</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſhortened</hi> one half, and thereby increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yards of cloth in the country to double the former number, but would not add <hi>one inch of new cloth,</hi> or enable the owners of all the cloth to make <hi>one garment more</hi> than before. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. While this was doing, <hi>vaſt miſchief</hi> would ariſe from the depreciation; the <hi>legacies</hi> of the widow and orphans, the <hi>ſalaries</hi> and <hi>fees</hi> of public officers of church and ſtate, the <hi>pay of the army,</hi> the value of all <hi>debts due,</hi> the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of all contracts for money, &amp;c. would be <hi>leſſened</hi> to the moſt manifeſt injury of the creditors. Examples of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023972_0043_0FC2BC7138EBEA28"/>
which dreadful effects we ſee daily before our eyes—this muſt ſurely force the moſt ſtriking conviction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I conceive theſe miſchiefs would prove a much <hi>heavier burden</hi> on the country, and would have <hi>much worſe effects,</hi> than could ariſe from <hi>a tax to amount of the increaſed quantity</hi> of money levied on the inhabitants.—For</p>
            <p n="4">4. The inhabitants could <hi>not be impoveriſhed by ſuch a tax,</hi> as there would be as much value of money, and as much goods and other eſtate in the country after the tax was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied as before, and all the loſs to the country would be the time and charges ſpent in collecting it; for all the goods ſold for the payment of this tax, would ſtill remain in the country, and continue as valuable as they were before they were ſold.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>contentions, reſentments, and ill-humor,</hi> which a depreciation naturally generates, would by this method <hi>be prevented,</hi> which alone, in my opinion would, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, impoveriſh the country <hi>more than the whole tax,</hi> even if the money was all borrowed from abroad to pay it. Only obſerve two neighbours inflamed with rage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt each other, and ſee what time, money, and labor they will ſpend, and how much they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their ſeveral friends in their quarrel, and how all kind offices of friendſhip and mutual aſſiſtance are totally loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them during their anger. By this we may form ſome gueſs at the degree of impoveriſhment which a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt ſuffer by general diſcontents, and numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of perſonal injuries and conſequent reſentments.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows clearly, in my opinion, that it would be more for the intereſt of the Thirteen United States to <hi>call in and ſink</hi> their Continental bills as faſt as they iſſue, than to receive <hi>a ſum of gold</hi> every year equal to the money iſſued, from ſome foreign power, as a perfect gift never to be repaid, <hi>i. e.</hi> we had better pay every year, by taxes, the whole expenditures of the year, than to receive the amount of thoſe expenditures in caſh from <hi>Spain</hi> as a free gift. Tho' I introduce this propoſition as a corollary, yet as it is of ſome conſequence, we will, if you pleaſe, view it awhile, and conſider the operation and effects of its two
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023972_0044_0FC2BC7287E846D8"/>
parts, and we ſhall be better able to judge which of the two would contribute moſt to the real welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the country.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The tax would <hi>fix the currency,</hi> and thereby give eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment to every branch and department of <hi>buſineſs, trade, war, civil police, and religion,</hi> which has any connexion with money; but the gift would make ſuch an increaſe of the circulating caſh as would depreciate it (for hard money can and will depreciate as well as paper bills, if increaſed too much) and thereby every department of <hi>buſineſs, trade, war, civil police, and religion</hi> which has any connexion with money, muſt languiſh and be enervated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The tax will <hi>promote the induſtry, prudence, and econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> of the people, but the <hi>gift</hi> would naturally introduce and encourage <hi>idleneſs</hi> and <hi>diſſipation.</hi> Few men will riſe early and eat the bread of carefulneſs, when money flows in upon them without their own anxious care. A man, preſſed with a demand for money for a tax or any other debt, does not yield to his own appetite, or the requeſt of his wife or child for a luxury, ſo eaſily as the ſame man would do, with plenty of money, and no preſſing demand: for the truth of this I appeal to the feelings of every man.</p>
            <p>No virtue is ſo fixed in the human mind as to continue long undiminiſhed without its uſual motives and inducements, and it requires no great experience in the world to ſhow us the danger of leſſening any of theſe; the very beginning of remiſſneſs of virtuous habits ought to be as alarming as the ſwallowing of a ſlow poiſon; and this, as applied to my ſubject, is demonſtrated by a very common obſervation, that fortunes ſuddenly acquired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>induſtry</hi> of the poſſeſſor, rarely ever increaſe his happineſs and welfare, help his virtuous habits, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long with him; they moſt commonly ruin him. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in a ſtate is like ſalt in cookery; ſome of it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but too much of it ſpoils every diſh, and renders the whole dinner unſavory to the taſte, and hurtful to the health.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The tax will operate in <hi>a way of juſtice</hi> to all, and therefore will give <hi>general peace and ſatisfaction to all good
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023972_0045_0FC2BC73A96F3938"/>
men,</hi> to all genuine Whigs and well-diſpoſed people, and will ſilence the clamors and diſappoint the hopes of the Tories, which are grounded principally on the uneaſineſs and jealouſies, injuries and reſentments which wrong ſteps will raiſe among the people. The operation of the tax would be juſt this; it would compel the man who ſtays at home and renders no actual ſervice, and furniſhes no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the war, to pay as much as thoſe do, who render the actual ſervice and furniſh the ſupplies: thoſe who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perſonal ſervice and furniſh ſupplies, contribute thoſe great aids in ſolid ſubſtance within the year; and therefore thoſe who ſtay at home ought to pay their quotas of ſolid ſubſtance alſo within the year. There can be no reaſon given why thoſe that go into the war ſhould render their ſervice within the year, and thoſe who ſtay at home ſhould pay nothing, or be truſted to ſome future day.</p>
            <p>This method is grounded on ſuch manifeſt juſtice, that no Tory, however litigious, can with any good face object to it; and therefore, however chagrined at heart he may be, he muſt keep his mouth ſhut, or look out for ſome other ſubject of complaint to make a noiſe about; but the natural operation of the gift would be very contrary to this; there would be ſo many ſchemes and pretences ſet on foot to draw for the money before it could leave <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hungry favorites crowding round every office of diſtribution in every department, and in ſhort, ſuch a ſcramble for the biggeſt ſhare of it; and ſo much chagrin, diſappointment, and mortification occaſioned; and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny jealouſies, quarrels, and reſentments excited by it, as would, in my opinion, injure and impoveriſh the States much more than the tax would do. But all this I ſubmit to thoſe who have been beſt acquainted with public boards and offices.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The moſt of the above arguments have been <hi>confirmed by facts</hi> in many notorious inſtances, which are the beſt proofs in matters of this ſort which can be advanced: the ſpoils and luxuries of <hi>Capua</hi> ruined <hi>Hannibal'</hi>s army; the ſack of <hi>Carthage</hi> and plunder of the rich, eaſtern, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered provinces corrupted the morals of the <hi>Romans,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023972_0046_0FC2BC753B5A59E8"/>
their economy, brought in luxurious exceſſes, bred the moſt mortal quarrels, overturned the commonwealth, introduced tyranny, and ended in the moſt tragical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> (who were once moſt untainted in morals and moſt intrepid in war) it is ſaid, were ruined by the mines of the <hi>Braſils,</hi> and are now an enervated people, without manufactures and internal ſupplies, a nation of Lords, poor in the midſt of money, and proud in the midſt of want, and are ſcarce a ſhadow of their anceſtors.</p>
            <p>And to come nearer home, the ſucceſſes and ſpoils of the laſt war ruined the <hi>Engliſh nation;</hi> they are no longer that wiſe, that faithful, that benevolent, humane nation which we were ever taught to eſteem them, but rude, faithleſs, cruel, ſavage, avaricious, ſordid, &amp;c. with ſcarce a ſingle virtue left in their character; the principal remains of our anceſtors is their proweſs in war; but even this is perverted: this, which was heroiſm in them, is inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the preſent generation; the ſword, which was the terror of their <hi>enemies,</hi> is by the preſent race ſheathed in the bowels of their <hi>brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It follows hence, I conceive, very clearly, that the riches of a nation do not conſiſt in the abundance of money, but in number of people, in ſupplies and reſources, in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries and conveniencies of life, in good laws, good pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic officers, in virtuous citizens, in ſtrength and concord, in wiſdom, in juſtice, in wiſe counſels, and manly force.</p>
            <p>From all theſe conſiderations, it appears plain to me, that ſudden acquiſitions of money are dangerous to any country, and have in many inſtances proved very ruinous and fatal to ſtates and kingdoms as well as individuals; from hence I think we may fairly and ſtrongly conclude, that it is not the wiſdom of <hi>America</hi> to attempt by any means of gift or loan, an acquiſition of money from any foreign powers, but by ſtrong exertions of our own to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our own ſupplies. We have money enough for our own purpoſes, and as good as any in the world, if we can be wiſe and firm enough, by proper meaſures to fix its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and preſerve it from future fluctuation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:023972_0047_0FC2BC769D120FF8"/>
But if theſe arguments ſhould not be convincing, I will venture to add one more, which with me has great weight.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By a tax we ſhall furniſh <hi>our own ſupplies</hi> in a <hi>ſure</hi> way, not liable to <hi>diſappointment</hi> by any caprices of <hi>others,</hi> nor ſubjecting us to any ſort of <hi>dependence on foreigners;</hi> we ſhall work out our own ſalvation without dependence on any power but Divine Providence, which we may ever acknowledge without danger of inſult; but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> receive aids from foreign ſtates by loan or gift, the obligation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us will be ever great in their opinion, and ſhould we ever have occaſion in future time to adopt any meaſures not perfectly conſiſtent with their views and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, we muſt be inſulted with large exhibitions of the preſent favors, and as large and plentiful accuſations of ingratitude, and it may be long before we hear the laſt of it.</p>
            <p>As it is more reputable for a man to acquire a fortune by his own induſtry, than by heirſhip, favor of friends, or ſudden accidents, ſo I think our own deliverance and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, wrought out by our own ſtrong exertions and virtuous efforts, will be more honorable and ſafe for us, than to receive theſe great bleſſings from the gift of a neighbour, were he willing to beſtow them. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> never will have done holding up to the view of the <hi>Dutch</hi> the ſupplies and aids they received from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth'</hi>s time, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> are obliged to hear a great deal of the ſame ſort of language, on the ſcore of aſſiſtances received by them from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the late wars.</p>
            <p>Indeed I know not how we can call ourſelves independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if we are to lie under ſuch ſort of debts to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, eſpecially if to the obligations of gratitude, we are to be loaded with the additional one of large ſums of hard money, with a corroding, annual intereſt to devour the proceeds of our labors and trade for ages to come.</p>
            <p>I would ſooner conſent to bear any preſent burden, not abſolutely intolerable, than find myſelf and poſterity load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a heavy, galling debt, to laſt, as other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal debts moſt commonly do, <hi>for ever,</hi> and the States ſo

oppreſſed and drained by it, as to have ſcarce ſpirits or ſtrength left to reſent any inſults or injuries that may be offered in future time, or repel any invaſions that may be attempted.</p>
            <p>Indeed the alliance we have formed with <hi>France,</hi> is grounded on ſuch generous principles of <hi>juſtice, mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and <hi>independence,</hi> as plainly demonſtrate that it is not the wiſh of <hi>France</hi> that our minds ever ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by any of theſe painful feelings; and I think it would be very mean in us to abuſe their generoſity, and we might <hi>be aſhamed to worry them</hi> for ſupplies, which we could <hi>better furniſh</hi> ourſelves than receive from them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſolicit <hi>France</hi> for money to pay the <hi>intereſt of loans</hi> from our own people, certainly has a bad look. If a ſon ſhould demand ſecurity of a ſtranger for monies lent to his father, people would certainly ſay ſomething.—</p>
            <p>We hope to form an alliance with <hi>Spain</hi> on principles of equal juſtice and mutual benefit, but we ſhall ſoon leſſen our character in their eyes, if we improve our firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in begging aids, which, with proper application and induſtry, we could well do without. But whenever real neceſſity does preſs us beyond our own powers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, we may then, without humiliation, apply for help to our friends, and I do not doubt but they would give with pleaſure to our real neceſſity, what they would either deny or grudgingly ſpare to our lazineſs or needleſs ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>I preſume it is needleſs to add any more arguments to prove the neceſſity or expediency of taxing equal to our expenditures, but the great groan ſtill is, that <hi>this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,</hi> it cannot be done. To all I have ſaid before, I beg leave here to add ſome further arguments to prove the <hi>practicability</hi> of this method; three years ago, it was ſaid, <hi>there is no danger yet,</hi> it will be time enough to tax ſome time hence; it is now ſaid, <hi>it is too late,</hi> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved ſo much that a tax adequate to our preſent occaſions for money is impoſſible; had we begun ſooner, it might have been done, but now it is too late. I take it that all this talk ariſes from an improper view of the ſubject.</p>

1. We are under as good <hi>advantages</hi> to relieve ourſelves by taxes <hi>now</hi> as we were <hi>three years ago,</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, and in ſome reſpects better; we are involved in no more debt, except the foreign and home loans, than we were then; the circulating caſh is no more in value now than it was then, the increaſe of nominal ſum makes no difference; and therefore, if it was neceſſary to call it all in (which, I conceive, is by no means the caſe) it might be done at the ſame expenſe now as then, <hi>i. e.</hi> it would not require <hi>any more hard money</hi> or <hi>country produce</hi> to purchaſe it all in <hi>now,</hi> than it would have required <hi>three years ago;</hi> and we have ſundry advantages in favor of taxing now, which we had not then, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 1ſt. A general conviction of the <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of taxing. 2d. <hi>Eſtabliſhed legiſlatures</hi> to levy the tax; both which were wanting three years ago. 3d. The money to be collected by the tax is more <hi>equably diffuſed</hi> or ſpread thro' the Thirteen States than it was three years ago, and therefore the people in the remoteſt parts, as well as thoſe who live near the ſeat of war, are enabled to pay their tax. 4th. People are <hi>more ſettled in buſineſs</hi> than they were three years ago; the violent ſhock of the war threw very many people <hi>out of their common courſe of buſineſs,</hi> or at leaſt much incommoded them; but they are now <hi>more ſettled,</hi> either in new branches of buſineſs, in public employments, or find the profits of their former buſineſs in ſome meaſure reſtored. 5th. The farmer and moſt tradeſmen can pay their taxes much eaſier than they could three years ago, becauſe there is much <hi>greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and price</hi> for the <hi>fabrics</hi> of the one and the <hi>produce</hi> of the other, than there was three years ago. To theſe many other reaſons might be added, all grounded on facts of public notoriety, and therefore are freely ſubmitted to every perſon who has reſided three years among us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All the ſervices and ſupplies for which the tax is wanted, <hi>are actually furniſhed every year</hi> by the Thirteen States, and have been for four years paſt; now is it more poſſible, more reaſonable, or more eaſy <hi>to compel a few</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals to furniſh theſe ſervices and ſupplies <hi>without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than <hi>to lay the burden</hi> in proper proportion on
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023972_0050_0FC2BC8741FC02C8"/>
all, and <hi>to compel every individual</hi> to furniſh his part? <hi>i. e.</hi> I do contend it is more eaſy, more reaſonable, and therefore more practicable, and of courſe very poſſible to compel <hi>thoſe that ſtay at home</hi> and render neither perſonal ſervices nor ſupplies to the war, to pay <hi>as much real value or ſubſtance</hi> in money as thoſe do who <hi>render the ſervices</hi> or furniſh the ſupplies; and if any of theſe ſtayers at home think this comes too hard on them, let them change places awhile with thoſe that do render the ſervices or furniſh the ſupplies, <hi>i. e.</hi> let them go into the army in perſon, or ſend their corn, their beef, or other ſupplies, and when they have tried both, they will know which is eaſieſt, and will always have their option to take the one or the other, and will be convinced that both are poſſible and practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Can any man make any reaſonable and weighty objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this? Yet this is all that is required; for when the ſervices are rendered, and the ſupplies are furniſhed, and both are paid for, the whole buſineſs is done, and the tax has had its full effect.</p>
            <p>I will venture to add my opinion, that this reaſoning will be verified in fact to very good purpoſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that when it is obſerved that the man who <hi>renders the actual ſervice</hi> is paid fully for it, and the man who <hi>ſtays at home</hi> muſt pay his full quota towards it, many who now ſtay at home, will be induced to go and render the actual ſervice, and thereby avoid making the payment at home, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come entitled to receive it in the army, which will greatly facilitate the recruiting ſervice. An object of no ſmall magnitude.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The tax which I propoſe, collected in quarterly or monthly payments, will occaſion ſuch <hi>a quick circulation of money,</hi> that every bill will probably pay its value <hi>many times over</hi> in a year, as it muſt do every time it paſſes from hand to hand; it will fly from the Commiſſary to the farmer, from him to the Collector, from him to the Treaſurer, from him to the Commiſſary, from him to the farmer again, &amp;c. in a circle often repeated in a year; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it would be poſſible to levy a Sum in a year by
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023972_0051_0FC2BC94AF44BD10"/>
taxes, much exceeding the whole ſum of current caſh; it would render the whole Thirteen States like a full market, where all perſons are eager to ſell all they have for ſale, and as eager to buy all which they have need of, and if this circle of buſineſs was permitted to run without any reſtraints, it would render the procurement and payment of money as eaſy as the nature of the thing admits, would vaſtly lighten the burden of taxes, and would give ſuch great advantages, both to the farmer, mechanic, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as would in good meaſure reimburſe the tax it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some peculiar circumſtances of this country much contribute to make the payment of taxes practicable and eaſy. Thoſe places which have <hi>ſuffered</hi> moſt by the war, lie <hi>neareſt</hi> to the ſeat of it, and of courſe have the <hi>greateſt plenty</hi> of money, and have the benefit of the <hi>quickeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> and <hi>higheſt price</hi> for every thing they have for ſale, whilſt it happily falls out, that thoſe towns and counties that lie moſt remote from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat of the war, and have the greateſt ſcarcity of money, yet have been <hi>leaſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed</hi> by the war, and are almoſt every one of them fine, grazing, fruitful countries, which produce great quantities of beef, mutton, and pork, which may be eaſily conveyed to the army on foot, and thereby facilitate the payment of taxes and ſupply of the army at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Another favorable circumſtance is this, the enemy cannot ſupply themſelves, eſpecially with thoſe articles we moſt want, otherwiſe than by importing them; and as their veſſels cannot always go under convoy, they often become a prey to our ſhips of war and privateers, by which we gain a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of foreign neceſſaries, without contracting a foreign debt; thoſe concerned are enriched, the objects of trade are increaſed, and the payment of taxes and ſupply of the army greatly facilita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>The benefits of this we have often experienced, and perhaps might increaſe them, if our cruiſing buſineſs was <hi>more properly conducted,</hi> and <hi>more liberally encouraged.</hi> Upon the whole matter, I beg leave to cloſe this Eſſay with a ſhort view of the preſent ſtate of our finances, then
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023972_0052_0FC2BC962BDA6120"/>
to offer my propoſitions of trade and finance, and laſtly, point out the effects and operations which I conceive theſe will have on our trade, currency, and army.</p>
            <p>I. Our preſent debt is <hi>what we o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> abroad, all our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic loans,</hi> and all the <hi>paper currency</hi> now in circulation, with enough more (if more is neceſſary) to balance our public accounts.</p>
            <p>II. The currency I rate at its preſent value; and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nominal ſum to be about 160,000,000 of dollars, the real value may be 8 or 9,000,000 of dollars, and which I conceive is not a larger ſum than is at all times neceſſary for a medium of trade in the Thirteen States.</p>
            <p>III. The great intereſt of theſe States, I take to be, <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the value of the currency, and preventing the <hi>further fluctuation</hi> of it, either by <hi>depreciation</hi> or <hi>appreciation;</hi> for I conceive theſe to be equally deſtructive, or if there is any difference, the latter is the worſt of the two.—For this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>IV. I think the <hi>further increaſe</hi> of the currency ſhould be <hi>prevented,</hi> and the <hi>preſſes ſtopped</hi> as ſoon as may be, and this I think may take place on <hi>January</hi> next, nor do I ſee how it can be done ſooner. What the further fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the currency will be in the mean time, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but the two moſt powerful means I know of, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the future depreciation, are, the <hi>heavy tax</hi> to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in this time, and <hi>taking off all reſtraints from trade;</hi> if this laſt is not done, the ſcarcity of goods will be ſo great, and the objects of trade ſo few, that no wiſdom can prevent, or force ſuppreſs, the exorbitant riſe of goods before that time, eſpecially of ſalt, rum, coffee, tea, and other articles of great conſumption, that have been <hi>limited much below</hi> the coſt and charges of importation.</p>
            <p>V. I propoſe that a <hi>courſe of taxes</hi> be inſtituted, to be paid monthly or quarterly, <hi>equal to the public expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. When the preſſes are ſtopped, and an effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſupplying the Treaſury by taxes is well ſecured, the <hi>Continental money</hi> will in a ſhort time make <hi>for itſelf an exchange,</hi> or gain a fixed value; it is impoſſible now to ſay
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023972_0053_0FC2BC97ACB16418"/>
what that value will be, but however it fixes, it will be right, and then I propoſe.</p>
            <p>VII. To fix the exchange according to that value, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting that <hi>hard money</hi> ſhall be paid and received in the Treaſury <hi>at that exchange,</hi> which will effectually prevent its appreciation; and if an adequate tax is well paid, the depreciation alſo will be effectually ſtopped: <hi>e. g.</hi> if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſhould be fixed at 20 for 1, and any perſon is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to pay his tax in hard money, let 1 dollar be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in full for 20 paper ones, and let all payments be made from the Treaſury by the ſame exchange.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, what is to <hi>become of the public faith?</hi> and I ſay, what <hi>is become of it already?</hi> I <hi>leave</hi> it where I <hi>found</hi> it, I do not make it any <hi>worſe,</hi> but endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from <hi>further decays.</hi> If <hi>nineteen parts</hi> out of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are dead already, I am for preſerving the <hi>twentieth part</hi> which remains alive; perhaps by good management and proper nurſing, it may grow into full magnitude; but to effect this, it appears to me very neceſſary to purge it of all thoſe deadly mixtures and bad adherents which have already brought it within an ace of total deſtruction.</p>
            <p>However this may be, I think it appears very plain, from what has been before advanced in this Eſſay, that continuing the dreadful miſchiefs and injuries of a fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating currency for <hi>eighteen years</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Congreſs, about this time, publiſhed a ſort of funding ſyſtem, in which, they propoſed <hi>(and plighted the public faith with ſolemnity enough too, for)</hi> the payment of the public debt in <hi>eighteen years.</hi>
               </note> to come, will no how atone for the wrongs, or compenſate the damages, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that deſtructive deluſion in four years paſt, and I cannot conceive on what principles any man could wiſh to purchaſe ſuch a deadly evil for many years to come, at the expenſe of heavy, galling taxes, almoſt as uſeleſs, difficult, and deſperate, as the rolling of <hi>Siſyphus'</hi>s ſtone.</p>
            <p>VIII. And for the ſame reaſon, <hi>all debts</hi> due from or to the Treaſury, ought to be paid <hi>at the exchange</hi> which exiſted at the <hi>time they were contracted;</hi> and therefore, I think it neceſſary to form a <hi>table</hi> or <hi>rate</hi> of exchange, to be continued from the firſt depreciation of Continental bills
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023972_0054_0FC2BC992C3EB4B8"/>
up to the aforeſaid period, when they ſhall become of fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed value; and that all <hi>Loan-Office certificates</hi> be paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>exchange which exiſted</hi> at the time in which the certificates were dated, and that all other debts be paid at <hi>the exchange</hi> which exiſted when <hi>they were contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and all <hi>intereſt</hi> due ought to be paid at the <hi>ſame exchange</hi> as the <hi>debt</hi> out of which it grows.</p>
            <p>This appears to me ſo manifeſtly juſt and reaſonable, that I cannot think any objection can be made to it, and therefore to offer any arguments in ſupport of it, would ſeem to call into doubt the juſtice of my country; I have only to obſerve, that great judgment and accuracy will be required in forming thoſe rates of exchange, as any error in theſe would introduce an error into the adjuſtment of all contracts for money, which yet remain unſettled.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The currency fixed as above, will be <hi>juſt ſufficient</hi> for a medium of trade and <hi>no more,</hi> and if we can by firm and proper, ſteady conduct, keep it fixed, it will anſwer all the ends of a medium of trade, without any inconveniency, for no one can ſuppoſe it is of any conſequence, whether we eſtimate a dollar at three pence, or ſix pence, or nine pence, or ninety pence, if it continues the ſame at all times, with no more variation than is ever incident to the nature of money.—Therefore</p>
            <p n="10">10. There will be no immediate occaſion for <hi>further taxes</hi> for ſinking any part of the bills, which are or ſhall be in circulation on the 1ſt of <hi>January</hi> next, for no reaſon can be aſſigned why the country ſhould be taxed to leſſen the quantity of money in circulation, when there is no more in being than is neceſſary for a medium of trade.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The method I propoſe will, by its natural operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, keep the <hi>army full of men</hi> and <hi>well ſupplied,</hi> and we may be in good condition to carry on the war any length of time that may be neceſſary, till it can be cloſed by a ſafe and honorable peace.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And this method will alſo, by its natural operation, <hi>ſix our finances</hi> on the beſt and ſureſt footing that can be wiſhed, our currency will be <hi>as good as any on earth,</hi> and all the reſources of a moſt plentiful country will be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023972_0055_0FC2BC9A9DBEC6D0"/>
and effectually opened for the uſe of the public, at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever time and to whatever amount the public exigence and neceſſity may require.</p>
            <p n="13">13. When the war ſhall ceaſe, it will leave us in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>free of debt and little impoveriſhed;</hi> we may eaſily, when the war is over, pay our foreign and domeſtic loans, and whenever we find it neceſſary, ſink the whole current bills, all which may be done in a ſhort time, and without any burdens ſo heavy as to endanger the peace or proſperity of the States. Every other ſcheme which I have heard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, leaves us ſubject to two dreadful calamities: 1ſt. The <hi>danger of ſinking under the weight of the war.</hi> 2d. If we get through that, yet we ſhall be left <hi>under ſuch a load of debt,</hi> which muſt be ſunk by ſuch long and galling taxes, as will almoſt make our <hi>lives a burden</hi> and our <hi>liberty a dear purchaſe,</hi> yea, the weight of the debt will <hi>abridge</hi> our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty itſelf, for I know not how any perſons or ſtates can be called entirely free, who are deeply involved in debt beyond their preſent powers of payment.</p>
            <p n="14">14. This method will be a good criterion by which we may <hi>diſtinguiſh the Whigs from the Tories,</hi> this ſcheme touches the preſent caſh, it compels the preſent and actual contributions of every one to the great cauſe of <hi>American</hi> liberty, this will rouſe the feelings of every Tory, partly becauſe his preſent caſh is called for, and partly becauſe it eſtabliſhes the ſyſtem of liberty which he wiſhes to ſee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And as we have reaſon to ſuppoſe that much <hi>Engliſh</hi> gold is ſpread among us, for the purpoſe of bribing our moſt popular and able men, it will be of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to diſcover who they are that may be thus engaged to deſtroy us, and as they probably will aſſume the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of zealous Whigs, they cannot be better diſtinguiſhed than by the temper in which they receive ſuch propoſitions, as promiſe an effectual remedy of the miſchiefs and dangers which moſt threaten our deſtruction, and at the ſame time blaſt the ſureſt hopes and confidence of our enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus I have a ſecond time given my thoughts, with the greateſt freedom, on the great ſubject of free trade and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a ſubject perhaps as difficult and intricate as any
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023972_0056_0FC2BCAB47CE0430"/>
whatever. A good <hi>financier</hi> is as rare as a <hi>phoenix,</hi> there is but here and there one appears in an age, yet in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances, a good financier is as neceſſary as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for the one cannot be ſupported without the other. I do not pretend to be equal to this great ſubject, I know I am not, but in theſe times of diſtreſs, every one ought to contribute what he can, and my fortunes are ſo impaired by the depredations of the enemy, and my health and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſo broken by their inſult and cruelty, that I have little left but ſentiments and kind wiſhes to beſtow, and as the widow's mite was of great account in heaven, I hope my mite may be candidly received, as it is moſt uprightly intended.</p>
            <p>I know the <hi>limitation</hi> of trade, the doctrine of <hi>loans,</hi> and <hi>appreciation</hi> of our currency are ideas much favored by very many zealous people; my Eſſays are directly oppoſed to them all, and I have only to ſay in excuſe, that I ſhould not venture to face the cenſure of ſuch characters, if I were not really convinced of the high impropriety of all the three mentioned doctrines, and the abſolute neceſſity of adopting ſentiments and meaſures the moſt <hi>oppoſed</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>It is with great pain I differ in ſentiments from many gentlemen of ſhining abilities, great experience, and moſt undoubted integrity; and was the importance of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at the preſent criſis leſs, I ſhould not obtrude my thoughts on the public, nor have I the vanity to imagine that the feeble Eſſays of an obſcure individual can correct the errors of a Continent; I only hope my publications may be ſo far regarded, as to bring on a moſt ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and thorough diſcuſſion of the weighty ſubject, by men of genius and abilities, equal to the mighty taſk, that ſo the real ſource of our calamities and their proper reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be diſcovered, and the wiſeſt meaſures may be adopted and purſued with diligence, ſpirit, and deciſion.</p>
            <p>For however weak or ridiculous my Eſſays may be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſubject of them will be acknowledged of ſufficient weight to engage the attention of the moſt able and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table characters among us.—<hi>Si nôſti rectúis iſtis, candidus imperti, ſi non, his utere mecum.</hi>

            <head type="sub">[Publiſhed in Philadelphia, January 8th, 1780.]</head>
            <p>CREDIT, either public or private, may always be kept good, where there is a ſufficient eſtate to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. Therefore, if private perſons, a company of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, or a State, ſuffer their credit to decay, when they have a ſufficient ſtock to ſupport it, their management muſt be <hi>bad,</hi> but their affairs can never be <hi>deſperate</hi> ſo long as their ſtock or eſtate continues ſufficient to diſcharge all demands on them; their <hi>bad management</hi> only need be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and <hi>a good one</hi> adopted, and their affairs may be retrieved, and their credit reſtored. Therefore, the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen United States are not bankrupt, nor are their affairs deſperate, tho' their credit runs very low, and their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are in the worſt condition. We have men enough for every purpoſe—We have proviſions and ſtores enough. Our houſes, lands, and ſtock on the lands, are little dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and in many places increaſed, ſince the war began; yet our credit runs ſo low, that it is with great difficulty ſufficient ſupplies can be obtained.</p>
            <p>The error lies in our <hi>finances,</hi> or <hi>management of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſtock,</hi> and muſt be mended, or we are ruined. In the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023972_0058_0FC2BCAE26B42460"/>
midſt of full plenty we already ſuffer the want of all things.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing neceſſary to correcting an error, is to <hi>diſcover</hi> it, the next is to <hi>confeſs</hi> it, and the laſt to <hi>avoid</hi> it. Perhaps neither, of theſe three things are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in the preſent caſe. An error in finances, like a leak in a ſhip, may be obvious in the <hi>fact,</hi> alarming in its <hi>effects,</hi> but difficult <hi>to find.</hi> The fact in view affords per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the ſtrongeſt proof of this. Our finances have, for five years paſt, been under the management of fifty men, of the beſt abilities and moſt ſpotleſs integrity, that could be elected out of the Thirteen States; yet they are in a ruined condition. We have ſuffered <hi>more</hi> from this than from <hi>every other</hi> cauſe of calamity: it has killed <hi>more</hi> men, pervaded and corrupted the choiceſt intereſts of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>more,</hi> and done <hi>more</hi> injuſtice, than even the arms and artifices of our enemies; ſtill the fatal error continues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and perhaps unexplored.</p>
            <p>Our admiration and cenſure will be greatly diminiſhed here, when we conſider that the doctrine of finance, or the <hi>nature, effects,</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> of money may be placed among the moſt <hi>abſtruſe and intricate ſubjects,</hi> which we ever have occaſion to examine. Not one in ten thouſand is capable of underſtanding it, and perhaps not one man in the world was ever complete maſter of it.</p>
            <p>As a full proof of this, I adduce the many fruitleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſtop the depreciation of our currency, which have been adopted both in and out of Congreſs; all of which have failed of the expected ſucceſs, and many of them have greatly <hi>increaſed</hi> the miſchief they were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>remedy.</hi> The <hi>various ſchemes</hi> and plans for the ſame purpoſe, which have been formed and propoſed by many men of moſt acknowledged abilities, warmly <hi>adopted</hi> by ſome, and as warmly <hi>oppoſed</hi> by others, are a further proof of the great difficulty and abſtruſe nature of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>The univerſal <hi>diſtreſs</hi> of the country, ariſing from this <hi>error</hi> in our finances, makes it a ſubject of the moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting importance, and the moſt univerſal inquiry, yet the intellectual powers of the Continent, tho' wound up to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023972_0059_0FC2BCAFE6F8E9D8"/>
the higheſt pitch of attention, have not yet been able to find a remedy. The evil ſtill continues as unchecked as ever. It ſeems impoſſible to control or compute its force; it ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>les all calculation. Yet ſo are we ſituated, and ſo critical is the preſent moment, that a remedy muſt be found, or we periſh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>morality</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> of our people are declining faſt. <hi>Our laws</hi> become iniquitous, and the worſt of all ſin is that iniquity which <hi>is framed by a law,</hi> for it fixes the <hi>miſchief</hi> in the very place where a <hi>remedy</hi> ought always to be ſought and found. The confidence of our people in the <hi>government</hi> is leſſened, our <hi>army ſuffers,</hi> and our <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>character abroad</hi> is in danger of contempt. All theſe, and no man can tell how many more, evils, hang like a thick cloud over us, the burſting of which will overwhelm us. But this is no time or place for declamation; a <hi>remedy</hi> is the thing to be ſought; a <hi>remedy</hi> or <hi>ruin</hi> are the only two alternatives before us.</p>
            <p>I have twice eſſayed to throw ſome light on this dark ſubject, with very little effect; my ſyſtem, however ſome of its parts were approved, has not been adopted. My argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perhaps, were not thought concluſive, or were not ſufficiently clear, and therefore were little attended to; I will, nevertheleſs, once more attempt to lay before the public, ſome principles and propoſitions which appear to me to have great weight, and which I ſhall ground on fact as much as I can; for in this, as in natural philoſophy, <hi>one experiment</hi> I conceive to be better, and ſtronger proof than an <hi>hundred theorems.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. In every State where the occaſions of money conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue unvaried, the <hi>incomes</hi> and <hi>expenditures</hi> ought to be kept equal, otherwiſe the <hi>value</hi> of money will <hi>fluctuate, i. e.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe; by which every money-contract, as well as all legacies, ſalaries, fees of public offices, rents, &amp;c. will be altered, and the money, when paid, will be either more or leſs than was intended in the contract, in the law, &amp;c. In this caſe, it matters little whether the increaſe of money proceeds from foreign loans or gifts, from opening mines, or preſſes; an increaſe of money in any of theſe
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023972_0060_0FC2BCC214D88858"/>
or any other way, will, with great injuſtice, alter the value of the payment, to the manifeſt wrong and injury of the receiver; by which the law itſelf, as well as the contract or donation, becomes perverted and corrupted, and is made to enure contrary to the original intention of all the parties concerned; this is proved by very ſad experiment among ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Hence it appears from plain experiment, that any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that tends to increaſe or decreaſe the quantity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating caſh, will not prove a remedy, but will increaſe the evil, or run us into the contrary extreme, equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and miſchievous, or perhaps more fatal. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that our true remedy, muſt, in the nature of the thing, lie, not <hi>in appreciating,</hi> more than <hi>in depreciating,</hi> the currency, but <hi>in fixing</hi> the value of it where it is, and keeping it ſo fixed, that any man who makes a money-contract, may find, when the day of payment comes, that the money paid is juſt the ſame as it was at the time of contract, that ſo the money paid may exactly correſpond with the intention of the contract, and be of courſe a juſt fulfilment of it without increaſe or decreaſe; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly happen where there is any fluctuation of its value between the times of contract and payment.</p>
            <p>Hence, when the value of money is fixed and can be kept ſo, it is in the <hi>moſt perfect ſtate</hi> its nature is capable of, and does, in the <hi>moſt perfect manner,</hi> anſwer all the purpoſes and uſes which are deſired or expected from it; for it is impoſſible that money ſhould exiſt in higher perfection, than when it is of ſuch fixed and certain value that all other articles may be compared with it, and their value ſafely eſtimated from that compariſon.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows clearly, that as far as money deviates from a fixed value, and becomes fluctuating, it loſes its uſe, and becomes dangerous to the poſſeſſor, and this will of courſe, without any regard to its quantity, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen its value, or increaſe its depreciation; and this may be aſſigned as one great cauſe of the preſent deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our currency beyond what its quantity would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:023972_0061_0FC2BCC3EEA9CD00"/>
Hence it follows, that if money can obtain a fixed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, it is of no manner of conſequence what the quantity is, for its value will ever fix at that rate or proportion to the occaſions for money, which will make the one equal to the other, and of courſe our Continental money will have juſt the ſame uſe, if the value of it fixes at two pence the dollar, as at any other ſum that can be named; but if that value of two pence is variable and like to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a penny, every man would prefer two pence of fixed money to it; but if that value of two pence is fixed, it will be conſidered by every man juſt as good, and no better than two pence of any other ſort of fixed money.</p>
            <p>II. As the uſe and deſign of money is to be a medium of all trade, it is neceſſary that the <hi>demand for money</hi> ſhould be at leaſt equal to the <hi>demand for every thing elſe</hi> which is to be bought or ſold, for if there is one thing to be ſold, which money will not purchaſe, the uſe of money is not ſo great as it would be if it would buy every thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its value is ſo far depreciated. Trade is carried on by the medium of money eaſier than in any other way, and for that reaſon it was introduced. An over plenty or ſcarcity of money introduces barter, which takes away the uſe of money ſo far as it extends, and conſequently depreciates it, and perhaps the great practice of <hi>bartering one ſcarce article for another,</hi> which has been introduced by the great plenty of money among us, may be aſſigned as one great cauſe of the depreciation of our currency beyond what the quantity would require.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows that the only poſſible way to reſtore our money to its true value and uſe, is to <hi>increaſe the demand</hi> for it; but this cannot be done by opening <hi>mines</hi> or <hi>preſſes,</hi> by <hi>foreign loans</hi> or <hi>importations of money,</hi> but may be done by <hi>taxes,</hi> which make a demand for money all over the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen States, and from every taxable in it. In this every one is agreed. The only queſtion is, How far this demand is to be increaſed? The anſwer is eaſy, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Till all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies which we need can be purchaſed for money, which will certainly be the caſe, when the demand for money is ſufficiently great.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:023972_0062_0FC2BCC58D902B00"/>
This demand may be raiſed at any time, and to any pitch we pleaſe, by taxes; ſo that the true and only poſſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the great miſchief lies conſtantly <hi>in our power,</hi> and may be put in practice whenever <hi>we pleaſe.</hi> But it muſt be put into <hi>actual practice; talking</hi> about it, <hi>voting</hi> about it, making <hi>aſſeſſments</hi> and <hi>tax bills,</hi> will not do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonable collection and payment</hi> into the treaſury.</p>
            <p>That this may be done, ſo as to give a fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed permanancy to our currency; and thereby ſave the States, and at the ſame time relieve every individual from the danger, damage, and anxiety he now ſuffers from the deficiency of our currency; and avoid oppreſſion of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and thereby put an end to all uneaſineſſes in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: that this may be done, I ſay, the ſeveral things following muſt be ſtrictly attended to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the taxation be <hi>fair and equitable,</hi> ſo as to bring the burden equally or in due proportion on each State, and on the <hi>individuals</hi> of each State. The firſt is the buſineſs of Congreſs, the ſecond of every particular State. As to the firſt, it is abſolutely neceſſary that there be an eſtimate made of the abilities of each State, on which the quotas are to be grounded; and this I think cannot be done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than by making the <hi>number of ſouls</hi> in each State the rule of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It is to be obſerved here that it was not the practice of Congreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old confederation, to inſtitute taxes by any direct acts of their own, but they calculated the ſums wanted, and made requiſitions of them from the ſeveral States, in ſuch proportions or quotas as were made <hi>pro re nata,</hi> as no eſtabliſhed quotas, or rules of forming them, were ſettled. There was much converſation about this time and many debates in Congreſs, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rule or principle on which the eſtimates of the quotas of each State ſhould be fixed; and ſundry modes of this eſtimation were adopted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with various alterations and amendments, till at laſt the long debated matter was ſettled by the new Conſtitution (article I.) on the principle here propoſed, with a ſmall variation reſpecting Negroes and Indians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>N. B.</hi> This matter was taken up again, and the principle or rule of eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation here propoſed, diſcuſſed and proved more fully in a future Diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </note> This can eaſily be obtained with exactneſs and certainty, and will be as juſt and true a meaſure of the abilities of each State as can be obtained. If more need to be ſaid on this, it may be deferred to another time.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:023972_0063_0FC2BCD2463825D8"/>
2. It is further abſolutely neceſſary, that the <hi>quotas</hi> of each State be eſtimated <hi>in hard money,</hi> payable in Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental money <hi>at the exchange</hi> which exiſts in each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar State at the time they pay their tax into the Continental Treaſury: hard money is a fixed ſtandard of value, and can never vary much here from its value in <hi>Europe,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fixing the quotas by this ſtandard, will prevent any ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities which will ariſe from depreciation of our cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency between the time of the <hi>demand</hi> of the quotas, and the time of <hi>payment</hi> by each State; without this the depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation might afford an inducement, tho' a <hi>very wicked one,</hi> to ſome States, to make their <hi>collections and payments dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> for there would be an advantage in delaying payment of taxes, as well as of every other debt, if the ſum ſhould <hi>leſſen</hi> every day, and it has been found in fact, tho' little to the honor of the tardy States, that <hi>ſome States</hi> have paid their quotas, when the exchange was <hi>four to one,</hi> whilſt <hi>others</hi> have paid their quotas of the ſame tax at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of <hi>twenty for one, i. e.</hi> juſt one fifth part of the juſt debt.</p>
            <p>I ſaid that the payments ought to be made at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change that ſubſiſts in the State that pays the money, at the time of payment, for all ſupplies which are purchaſed for the uſe of the public in that State, are purchaſed at that exchange, and therefore it is reaſonable that their quotas of taxes ſhould be paid at the ſame exchange, whether it be higher or lower than that which exiſts in the other States at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if the quotas demanded of each State be not made in fixed money, it is not at all certain they will be ſufficient when paid; for if the eſtimates of expenditures were made in money at twenty for one, and the tax de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be made out accordingly, it is very certain if it ſhould be paid at forty for one, it would not ſatisfy more than half the eſtimate, and therefore muſt be deficient by one half, and the work is all to do over again to get the other half collected and paid, beſides all the dangers and damages which may ariſe from the delay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:023972_0064_0FC2BCDB37149DD0"/>
Nor do I ſee that any reaſonable objection could be made to the juſtice of <hi>crediting</hi> the States for their paſt payments <hi>by the ſame rule;</hi> for it is ſurely wrong that a dilatory State that has really paid but one fifth part of the value of her quota, ſhould have credit for the whole: but whatever may be thought proper with reſpect to the time <hi>paſt,</hi> I think there can be no doubt that ſuch ſcandalous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſchiefs ſhould be well guarded againſt in <hi>time to come.</hi> To all this it ought to be further added, that when any State delays to collect their taxes, the money will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate, and conſequently depreciate faſter in it than in other States where the tax is quickly collected; and no reaſon can be given, why any State ſhould take advantage of that depreciation which their own iniquitous delay has occaſioned.</p>
            <p>It is further neceſſary that each delinquent State ſhould be charged with <hi>the intereſt</hi> of all ſuch parts of their ſeveral quotas which ſhall be unpaid at the time preſcribed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, till payment be made; and for the ſame reaſon they ſhould be allowed intereſt on all ſuch ſums as may be paid before the ſaid time of payment, till ſuch time of payment comes; and if all this, together with the honor and zeal of the ſeveral States, ſhould be inſufficient to prevent <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies,</hi> further methods ſhould be adopted and effectually executed, till ſuch deficiencies ſhall be prevented; for the very idea of ſupporting the union, dignity, public faith, and even ſafety of the Thirteen States, without <hi>good punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality</hi> in each State, is moſt manifeſtly chimerical, vain, and ridiculous; for there can never be any <hi>confidence</hi> placed in our adminiſtration, if their <hi>counſels, covenants, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> muſt be ever liable to be rendered fruitleſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable by the deficiencies of one or two of thoſe States.</p>
            <p n="3">3. On the part of the particular States, it is neceſſary that each of them at the beginning of each year ſhould have a liſt or aſſeſſment of all taxables completed, and all appeals adjuſted, and good collectors appointed, that as ſoon as any tax is granted by their Legiſlature, it may be put im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into the collectors' hands, and the collection be finiſhed and the money paid into the Continental Treaſury,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023972_0065_0FC2BCDCB7797E08"/>
without loſs of time. If matters were once put into this train, any neceſſary ſum demanded by Congreſs might be collected, and ready for uſe in a very ſhort time; and this will fully obviate the great objection, that taxes, tho' ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be the only ſure and final remedy, are yet too ſlow in their operation to be depended on.</p>
            <p>It appears from this view, that taxes are a much more <hi>certain and ſpeedy</hi> ſupply, and may be depended on with much greater ſafety than any other method which has been pointed out to me, and they are a final, <hi>a finiſhed remedy;</hi> whereas loans, lotteries, annuities, and every other method which I have heard of, are no more than temporary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, are but plauſible anticipations of our revenue, and all look forward to a burden to be impoſed in future time, which had better be borne now, and be finally done with.</p>
            <p>And as I propoſe that all the eſtimates of Congreſs, and all the quotas demanded of the States, ſhould be made out in hard money, ſo I alſo propoſe that the taxes may be made out in the ſame money, payable either in hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or Continental, at the option of the perſon who pays the tax. Sundry material advantages I conceive will ariſe from this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many perſons out of trade have no money but hard, and when called on for the tax, may be compelled to part with their hard money, at an unreaſonable exchange, which will be avoided if hard money itſelf will pay the tax.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This will preſerve the tax from any poſſibility of fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, by the depreciation or appreciation of the curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for if any perſon thinks the exchange demanded unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, he may pay it in hard money, and then he is ſure not to pay either too much or too little.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will gradually bring ſums of hard money, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not inconſiderable, into the Continental Treaſury, which may be ſo uſed as to prevent drawing on <hi>Europe,</hi> and thereby increaſing our foreign debt, which I conceive an object greatly worth attention.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will exhibit the tax to view in its real value, and prevent the terrors which may ariſe from the enormous found in Continental money.</p>
            <p n="5">

Nor do I think that this would at all prejudice the real uſe of the Continental money, for it would ſtill paſs at its exchange or value.</p>
            <p>Indeed I do not ſee that the depreciation of the money would have been in itſelf a calamity half ſo ruinous as it has proved, if it had <hi>operated only on the caſh in being;</hi> it would have been a tax upon every poſſeſſor of it, and would have leſſened the public debt, for it is manifeſt that the public debt at the exchange of forty for one, is but half what it was when the exchange was twenty for one; and as that money was perhaps as equally diffuſed over the Thirteen States, as any other property, the tax might have operated with a tolerable degree of juſtice; but the caſe was altered when the depreciation was not confined to the Continental money only, but drew every thing elſe after it: when it came to operate on <hi>every debt and money-contract,</hi> on every <hi>legacy, ſalary, public fee</hi> and <hi>fine,</hi> yea, on the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> of the States, ſo as to deſtroy all <hi>calculation of both ſupplies and expenditures,</hi> the miſchief became infinite: we were both in our private affairs and public councils, thrown into confuſion inextricable.</p>
            <p>New objects, new effects, ſtarted up to view in every quarter, which no <hi>diſcernment</hi> could foreſee, nor <hi>wiſdom</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate, and like an inchantment of fairy viſions, bewildered us all in ſuch a maze of errors, interwoven with ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty into every branch of our movements, that no one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment was free of them; and we all ſtand trembling this moment before this monſter of depreciation, like bewilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed travellers in a giant's caſtle, where the <hi>bones</hi> of broken fortunes are every where in ſight, with the <hi>ſpectres of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and fatherleſs,</hi> and a thouſand others, which the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter has devoured, and <hi>is ſtill</hi> devouring as greedy as ever.</p>

               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:023972_0067_0FC2BCDFD4FA77D8"/>
This miſchief will be greatly leſſened, if, by reducing all our debts and demands, public and private, to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of hard money, we can confine the depreciation of the money to itſelf, and prevent its operation on all other money-contracts and ſecurities, and this will, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, greatly tend to cure the depreciation itſelf, becauſe in that caſe no man can gain any thing by the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but every man who has any caſh muſt loſe by it; and when private intereſt is brought into a coincidence with the public good, they will greatly help each other.</p>
            <p>But be all this as it may, let us not loſe ſight of the principal argument, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that no project or ſcheme to ſtop the depreciation can have the deſired effect, if it does not <hi>increaſe the demand</hi> for our currency; and on the contrary, any ſcheme whatever that will increaſe the demand for our currency, will <hi>leſſen or check the depreciation.</hi> Hence we ſee how vain all propoſitions muſt be, which, by their natural operation, will increaſe caſh among us, and thereby leſſen the demand for it, or increaſe the national debt beyond all probability of payment, and thereby leſſen the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and of courſe leſſen alſo the demand for the currency which depends on it. Of this ſort are all <hi>loans, foreign and domeſtic;</hi> for as long as people can get money without <hi>earning it,</hi> without actually raiſing and paying it, it will not appear ſo precious, nor can the demand be ſo great, as when theſe great and neceſſary conditions are the <hi>only terms</hi> of acquiring it. Hence alſo, every project which leſſens the uſe of our currency, leſſens alſo the demand for it, and cannot poſſibly help, but will hurt, it; ſuch as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in trade or levying taxes <hi>in kind</hi>

            <p>My great propoſition is, that <hi>by taxes</hi> we have it always in our power to <hi>fix our currency at any value we pleaſe;</hi> becauſe, by this way, we may raiſe the demand for money juſt <hi>as high</hi> as we pleaſe, and, if we have not great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>much higher</hi> than the public good requires; and if the method and train propoſed, be adopted, the operation
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:023972_0068_0FC2BCF072A96028"/>
of taxes may be made more quick and more ſure, than in any other I know of. This is dealing in <hi>realities.</hi> We have dealt in <hi>ſhadows and deluſions</hi> too long already for our <hi>honor,</hi> too long for our <hi>ſafety.</hi> It is not only wicked, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable, and dangerous, but it is weak and abſurd, to ſuppoſe that we can any longer produce our public ſupplies out of ſhadows and viſionary projects; the baſeleſs fabric will vaniſh; our reſources conſiſt in <hi>real ſubſtance</hi> only, and from thence alone can our ſupplies be produced, and let them be collected by an equable tax, and the burden on the public will not be any thing near ſo heavy and ruinous, as the numberleſs miſchiefs of the depreciation have proved for four years paſt.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked, What is to be done in the preſent diſtreſs? How are our preſent, immediate wants to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?

To ſet the <hi>preſſes</hi> a going again, which will not only increaſe the miſchief, but deſtroy the operation of any remedy. Or, 3. do without ſupplies awhile. If the crows cannot be killed, nor the carcaſs be removed out of their reach, the ſure way is to let them eat it all up to the very bones, and then they will go away of their own accord; and this is better than to have <hi>Tityus'</hi>s vulture for ever gnawing on our liver, and our liver grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame time as faſt as he eats it. Here is indeed a notable difficulty which would vaniſh into nothing, if there was a proper connexion formed between the <hi>great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources</hi> of the Thirteen States, the real ſubſtance, the mighty wealth which they contain, and <hi>the credit of the States,</hi> neceſſary to collect them, and bring them to public uſe, when the public ſafety or convenience requires them. The credit of our currrency is too lax, too enervated, and feeble for this; people have more of it already than they have uſe for, and the depreciation makes it a dangerous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to keep on hand: it is like periſhable goods, which are loſt in the keeping. In the nature of the thing there is nor can be no remedy for this, but increaſing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:023972_0069_0FC2BCF1B482E2E8"/>
for the currency, and this can be done in no other way than by an univerſal tax, which alone can create an univerſal demand, and this demand muſt operate on thoſe perſons who have the neceſſary ſupplies, ſo as to make their neceſſity for money equal to the neceſſity of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of the ſupplies.</p>
            <p>This will put the contracting parties on a par of equal neceſſity on each ſide, which alone can ever produce an equal bargain, and is the real, natural ſource of all trade. Filling the Treaſury never ſo full of money by Loans or any other way, will not effect the purpoſe, unleſs demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the very perſons who have the ſupplies in their hands, for in any other way, their neceſſity for money will not be increaſed, and of courſe they will withhold the ſupplies, or demand an unreaſonable price, when they ſee a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity on the purchaſer, and none on themſelves.</p>
            <p>I appeal to every perſon who deals, whether this is not the true fact. Let a perſon who is under neceſſity of an article, apply to one who has it, but is under no neceſſity to ſell it, he muſt give any price that is aſked. Let a man who is under neceſſity of ſelling an article, apply to one to purchaſe, who is under no neceſſity of buying, he muſt take what is offered. This may be thought a refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of argument, but I appeal to every man, the leaſt or the moſt verſed in trade, if this is not the univerſal principle of all trade, and if it is not the univerſal practice of all wiſe traders, if they are under a neceſſity of buying or ſelling, to conceal that neceſſity as far as they can, leſt it ſhould put them under diſadvantage in making their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>It is further to be obſerved, that an increaſed demand for money is the only thing which will naturally excite great diligence and pains in procuring ſuch articles as will bring it; therefore, it appears that this is the only true means of reſtoring the <hi>decayed induſtry</hi> of our people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we ſhall ſoon have no ſupplies raiſed, and then we muſt be deſtitute indeed, for no demand for money can produce ſupplies which are not in exiſtence, which to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023972_0070_0FC2BCF348210E00"/>
me appears to be a matter worthy of very great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Every idea of a <hi>loan</hi> either at home or abroad, operates directly againſt theſe great principles, and directly tends to increaſe our diſtreſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſmall loan had been negotiated a little before this time in <hi>France,</hi> and further loans in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> were propoſed, and urged in and out of Congreſs with great earneſtneſs and zeal. This ſeems to have been a period of diſtreſs and madneſs.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>abhor</hi> and <hi>execrate</hi> every idea of a <hi>foreign loan</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe neceſſaries produced among ourſelves; it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to borrow in <hi>Europe</hi> money ſufficient to purchaſe what we muſt export from thence, and enough to make former contracts punctually and honeſtly good; but to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row money in <hi>Europe</hi> to pay for ſupplies produced here among ourſelves, appears to me the height of abſurdity: this expoſes our weakneſs to all the world; not our <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in point of <hi>ſupplies;</hi> not the exhauſted ſtate of our country, for that is full of every thing we want, clothing and military ſtores excepted; but the weakneſs of our <hi>counſels</hi> and <hi>adminiſtration,</hi> that our <hi>domeſtic economy</hi> ſhould be ſo bad, that we ſhould not be able to call into public uſe the very ſupplies in which the country abounds, is <hi>ſhameful:</hi> ſuch an imbecility of counſels, I imagine, will hold us up in ſo very contemptible a light in <hi>Europe</hi> as will effectually deſtroy all our <hi>credit there,</hi> and thereby put it out of our power to <hi>deſtroy ourſelves;</hi> but if this ſhould not be the caſe, I do not ſee but our independence, with all the bleſſings reſulting from it, is in danger: for I really fear that ſome among us would, without concern, mortgage the Thirteen States up to the value of every acre they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to any foreign power that will truſt us.</p>
            <p>It is as neceſſary that we preſerve ourſelves independent of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> as of <hi>England.</hi> It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt beyond any need of proof, that the nation who is in debt to a ſuperior power, cannot be free and independent, but is ever liable to demands the moſt inſulting and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with freedom and ſafery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:023972_0071_0FC2BCF4C2DA4D08"/>
But if after all, nothing can ſtop the career of this fatal meaſure of contracting a further foreign debt, I beg, at leaſt, that the monies neceſſary be borrowed at home on yearly intereſt, payable in bills on <hi>Europe,</hi> or in hard money at home, and let the delinquent States be charged with this intereſt, for if there was no delinquency, there would be no need of a loan: my reaſons are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If intereſt of hard money or bills muſt be paid, I think it better that our own people ſhould have it than ſtrangers, that the yearly profits of the loan ſhould lie among ourſelves, and not go out of the country, never to return.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is leſs dangerous to contract a foreign debt, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the yearly intereſt of this loan, than for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and intereſt too.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This method will have one abſurdity leſs than the other, for if bills are to iſſue for the money to be loaned in <hi>Europe</hi> (for our neceſſities are ſo preſſing, it is ſaid we cannot wait till the advices arrive that the loan is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted) they muſt be drawn on funds of mere imagination, for not one ſhilling of the fund on which they are to be drawn, is yet procured, nor do we know that the loan can be obtained at all; and therefore every bill is liable to come back proteſted, to the utter ruin, and moſt laughable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the credit of the States. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. The uncertainty of the payment of the bills will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly operate on the ſale of them. I believe nobody ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects they can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old at a loſs of leſs than 20 or 30 per cent. The preſent exchange of the currency is 40 to 1; but I have not heard any body propoſe ſelling the bills at more than 30 for 1.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The very idea of drawing bills or loaning at a loſs of 20, 30, or 40 per cent. appears to me ſo very ruinous and abſurd, and the fact ſtands in ſo glaring and ſtriking a light, that I do not know how to form one argument for the conviction of ſuch as are willing to adopt either. The great, ſure, and only ſupply of all our wants, and remedy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> diſtreſs, lies in taxes. Juſtice requires that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſhould be effectually adopted: public burdens ought
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023972_0072_0FC2BCF642341A28"/>
to reſt in due proportion on all, which can be effected in no other way. This alone will create an univerſal demand for our currency, and bring it into ſuch repute, that every neceſſary article in the country may be readily purchaſed with it; this ſettles and finiſhes the matter as we go, and relieves us at once from the anxious terrors of an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable debt, and all future demands and inſults from any power on earth.</p>
            <p>Say, <hi>Americans,</hi> if this freedom and independence, for which you have bled and nobly dared every danger, and for which you have ſet at defiance, and incurred the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of, the mighteſt power on earth, is not ſtill worth your moſt capital attention: it avails little to <hi>change our maſters;</hi> to have <hi>none</hi> is our object, which can never be our caſe, if we are in debt to foreign powers.</p>
            <p>III. I beg leave here to propoſe one thing more, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to <hi>take off every reſtraint from our trade.</hi> Let every man be at liberty to get money as faſt as he can; and let the public call for it as faſt as the public exigence requires. Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our trade have been ſo often tried, ſo ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced, and have ſo conſtantly failed of the intended effect, and have, in every inſtance, produced ſo much injuſtice and oppreſſion in our dealings, and excited ſo many quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, ſo much ill-will and chagrin among our people, that they have, in every inſtance, after ſome time of moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious continuance, been laid aſide by a kind of general conſent, and even moſt of their advocates have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their hurtful tendency, as well as utter impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability.</p>
            <p>As experiment is the ſureſt proof of the natural effects of all ſpeculations of this kind, and as this proof of fact has ever appeared in the ſtrongeſt manner, againſt the practicability and ſucceſs of all reſtraints of this ſort, and as every ſeeming, temporary advantage that has reſulted from them, has conſtantly been followed by effects ſo very pernicious and alarming, it is <hi>ſtrange,</hi> it is <hi>marvellous</hi> to me, that any perſon of common diſcernment, who has been acquainted with all the above-mentioned trials and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023972_0073_0FC2BD0034F1F098"/>
effects, ſhould entertain any idea of the expediency of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſuch method again.</p>
            <p>Not leſs abſurd ſhould I conceive a number of adepts in <hi>Barclay'</hi>s ſyſtem of ideas, driving their heads ten times go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt a wall, and ſtill preparing to try it again with greater force than before, becauſe they could not believe there was the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of a wall, but an <hi>idea</hi> only there; equally in both caſes muſt the career of the zealots be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in hard fact, and their ſkulls, if not exceeding thick, muſt be greatly wounded.</p>
            <p>Liberty and property are the moſt tender intereſts of mankind; any kind of abridgment, reſtraint, or control of theſe is ever ſenſibly felt and borne with impatience; and the natural courſe of things ſeems ſo adapted to thoſe two great and favorite rights, that any violations of them will, by their moſt natural operation, produce effects very unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary, if not fatal. Indeed, this miſchief may at any time be increaſed till the effects are tragical. Trade, if let alone, will ever make its own way beſt, and, like an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible river, will ever run ſafeſt, do leaſt miſchief and moſt good, when ſuffered to run without obſtruction in its own natural channel.</p>
            <p>IV. I humbly propoſe further, that <hi>no private property may ever be taken for public uſe, againſt the conſent of the owner, without the moſt manifeſt neceſſity,</hi> and in that caſe, not without paying the <hi>full value.</hi> If the public wants any man's property, they are certainly better able to pay for it, than an individual is to loſe it. Paying half or any thing leſs than the whole value, is a ſcurvy and evaſive way of robbing the owner, and infinitely unworthy of the juſtice and dignity of a State. There has been ſo much of this iniquity committed either with or without pretext of Law, that it has been really dangerous for a man to poſſeſs an article of capital demand; he has been in danger of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the article torn from him, not only without due pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with inſult and abuſe; and this wicked and ſhameful practice has really diſcouraged many perſons of great ability and induſtry, from procuring articles of great demand, leſt they ſhould be thereby ſubjected to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023972_0074_0FC2BD09792DA648"/>
of having them torn away with violence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
            <p>Many great neceſſaries have been rendered ſcarce by theſe means, and thereby the price has become enormous, and the procurement difficult. Inſtances in flour, ſalt, &amp;c. are moſt notorious and obvious. This greatly deſtroys the confidence of the holders of the great neceſſaries, in the officers of government, and leſſens their aſſiduity and zeal in procuring or bringing their goods to the public ſtores. The conſequences of this ſhameful iniquity are moſt fatal in their nature, and tho' ſlow and not immediately percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, yet moſt certain in their operation, and moſt ſure of effects.</p>
            <p>V. I propoſe further that there be the greateſt care and attention in the <hi>appointment of the men</hi> who are to fill all <hi>places</hi> of public truſt, and eſpecially ſuch as are employed in the <hi>revenue</hi> and <hi>expenditures</hi> of the public monies and ſupplies. I ſhould conceive the following qualifications ſo neceſſary as to admit of no diſpenſation:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the candidate for any place of public truſt have ſufficient <hi>knowledge and ability</hi> to diſcharge the duties of the office propoſed for him. A public officer, like St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s biſhop, ought to be a workman that needs not to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I am ſure any <hi>perſon needs to be aſhamed,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a public office without underſtanding the <hi>duties of it,</hi> and therefore utterly incapable of diſcharging them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: and the <hi>perſons who appointed</hi> him ought to be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him too, and he certainly will prove a <hi>ſhame to the public;</hi> for the public, <hi>i. e.</hi> a kingdom, a ſtate, a country, or a city, always ſhine thro' the medium of their <hi>public men;</hi> if they mean to have their weight, dignity, charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and intereſt well ſupported in a treaty, a Congreſs, a General Aſſembly, or a Court of Juſtice, they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>ſufficient men</hi> to repreſent them and act for them; if they would have their moſt public and important counſels, their laws, the adminiſtration of public juſtice and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil policy, or their revenue <hi>well conducted,</hi> they muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>men of knowledge</hi> ane <hi>abilities</hi> ſufficient for theſe great purpoſes, to conduct them; theſe are all objects of ſuch
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023972_0075_0FC2BD0A96BB9868"/>
magnitude, ſuch general importance, and pervade with ſuch ſubtilty every intereſt of the community, that they reach and deeply affect every individual, and preſcribe the degree of ſecurity, honor, and peace which he is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
            <p>How mad and execrable then muſt be that elector, or perſon concerned in the appointment of a public officer, who, from motives of party, perſonal friendſhip, or any worſe inducement, will give his vote for a perſon, who, he knows, is deficient in the knowledge and abilities requiſite to the proper diſcharge of the office? Let a man's virtue and integrity be never ſo great, if he wants knowledge and ability, he never can ſhine, he never can ſerve with honor or advantage in the office, but muſt be a ſhame to himſelf and to his conſtituents, and moſt probably a damage, and may be a ruin into the bargain. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. Knowledge and abilities, tho' eſſential, are not the only requiſites in a public man; <hi>integrity and prudence</hi> are alſo moſt neceſſary. The true character of the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certainly known indeed, but is beſt judged of by his general deportment; therefore the character which a man obtains among his neighbours, and thoſe who beſt know him, is the ſureſt rule by which he can be eſtimated, and will be moſt likely to pre-engage the public confidence in his favor; and it is neceſſary, not only that a public man ſhould be upright, but alſo that he ſhould be generally eſteemed ſo. The wife of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ought not to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore it muſt be the height of folly (to ſay no worſe) to appoint a man to public ſtation, whoſe private character for integrity and prudence is not good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Sound judgment and rational diſcretion</hi> is a moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of neceſſary character <hi>in a public man,</hi> eſpecially one who is concerned in the public councils, or important offices of any ſort. Nothing can ſcarcely be conceived more dangerous to the public, than to have its great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements ſubject to the influence of a man of <hi>wild pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and extravagant conceits;</hi> ſuch a perſon, eſpecially if he has a good addreſs and copious invention, is enough to <hi>make errors faſter</hi> than twenty men of the beſt wiſdom
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023972_0076_0FC2BD1957621198"/>
can <hi>mend.</hi> It is not ſtrange, to find men, who have great talents at diſcovering valuable mines, who, at the ſame time, have no knowledge in eſſaying the ore, or making the proper uſe of it. But to come more immediately to the point in view,</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the appointment of an officer of the revenue, or expenditures of the public monies, <hi>i. e.</hi> one through whoſe hands the public monies or ſupplies are to paſs, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, moſt eſſentially neceſſary, that he ſhould be a man of known <hi>induſtry, economy, and thriftineſs in his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs.</hi> If a man's <hi>regard to his own character, fortune, and family,</hi> is not a ſufficient inducement to make him <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, induſtrious,</hi> and <hi>thrifty</hi> in his own affairs, it is not to be preſumed, that any regard he may have to the public <hi>can make</hi> him ſo; a man's own intereſt always lies neareſt his heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſelf-love is the ſtrongeſt of all paſſions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. It was hardly ever known, that raiſing a man into public office, <hi>mended his private vices,</hi> but <hi>they</hi> moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly like a pervading poiſon, get incorporated into the department, in which he officiates, and greatly corrupt and injure the adminiſtration of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore to appoint a <hi>bankrupt,</hi> a man of <hi>diſſipation, idleneſs,</hi> and <hi>prodigality,</hi> to an office, through which the public <hi>monies</hi> and <hi>ſupplies</hi> are to paſs, is a ſure way to have them <hi>waſted</hi> or <hi>purloined,</hi> in which the riches, ſtrength, and blood of the States are exhauſted; not to anſwer <hi>the great ends</hi> of government, the <hi>ſafety, ſecurity,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of the great whole, but to gratify the <hi>extravagance, diſſipation,</hi> and <hi>debauchery</hi> of an individual; it would be much better, if a man has ſuch a friend, that muſt be ſerved, to <hi>give him a few thouſands,</hi> to ſpend in his own way, than to admit him into the important <hi>offices of revenue,</hi> and thereby cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt its courſe and uſe.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome errors of this ſort may have occaſioned a profuſion of expenſe, a neglect and loſs of public ſtores, and a failure of diſtribution, all which tend to increaſe our diſtreſs, and accelerate the decays of our finances; for as in private affairs, <hi>prudence</hi> in expenſe is as neceſſary to a fortune as the <hi>acquirement of money,</hi> ſo in our public admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023972_0077_0FC2BD1A23793CE0"/>
I conceive <hi>economy</hi> in expenditures, as neceſſary a part of financiering, as the <hi>acquirement</hi> of a revenue: and I conceive in this, as in all other parts of public admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, good government depends more on the <hi>men who adminiſter,</hi> than on the ſyſtem or form of the conſtitution, the wiſdom of the laws, or prudence of the general orders; for let all theſe be ever ſo good, if the executive part is not committed to induſtrious, wiſe, and faithful <hi>men,</hi> there will be a great failure of <hi>juſtice, ſecurity,</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. I propoſe a review of all our departments, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all unneceſſary expenditures</hi> in them, as far as poſſible. It is better to leſſen the expenſes, where it can be done with ſafety, than to increaſe the revenue; the one leſſens, the other increaſes the public burden. I am told there are 9000 rations iſſued daily in this city, where there is not the leaſt appearance of any military movements, except a few invalids, and ſick in the hoſpital, and the priſoners, all which do not amount to one third of the aforeſaid num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rations.</p>
            <p>I am told there are poſts of commiſſioners, quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, purchaſers, &amp;c. fixed at about 10 or 15 miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from each other thro' this State, and ſome ſay thro the whole Thirteen States; if they were all ſent out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all the ſupplies within reach of our market, would come of courſe to this city, and might be all purchaſed here by one man, much cheaper, and at leſs expenſe, than by all thoſe poſts; ſpreading them about thro' the country anſwers the ſame end, as if a private man ſhould ſend a ſervant ten miles out of town to buy his marketing; he muſt ſolicit more, pay a higher price, and have a worſe choice than if he ſtayed at home, and bought in market. But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to go into the minutiae of theſe matters; I can only obſerve, that people out of doors cannot at all conceive the reaſon or uſe of theſe multiplied officers of ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent names, that one has need of a dictionary to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; I am apt to wiſh they were all ſtruck off the liſt, by one daſh of the pen, at leaſt that their rations and clothing might be ſtopped, and ſent to camp for the uſe of our ſoldiers in real ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:023972_0078_0FC2BD1E07D02328"/>
I would add to my wiſh alſo, that their horſes might be taken away from them, that they might not be able to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade it thro' the country on horſeback, or in carriages, as they now do with a gaiety of dreſs, importance of air, and grandeur of equipage, very chagrining to the impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed inhabitants who maintain them: I conceive this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod would ſupply our camp very comfortably for ſeveral months, till our finances might be recruited by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous taxes which are coming in, and in this way the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Loans might be prevented, or at leaſt leſſened.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould not be thought expedient to ſend <hi>their wines</hi> to camp, as I do not know that an abundance of liquors do ſoldiers or any body elſe any good, I propoſe to ſend them to vendue, as they have much engroſſed that article of late, it is become very ſcarce and dear, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably bring a great price, and the proceeds of them might be a ſeaſonable ſupply to the Continental Treaſury, and further leſſen the neceſſity of loaning.</p>
            <p>In fine, my great object is to get our <hi>revenue fixed</hi> on a ſure and ſufficient foundation, and our <hi>expenditures reduced within the bounds of uſe, neceſſary to the ſafety and benefit of the community.</hi> In this caſe our people will all be willing to contribute the aids neceſſary; for the intentions of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large are <hi>ever upright,</hi> and it is rare that there is any difficulty with them in this reſpect, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the public monies are all <hi>prudently expended</hi> for neceſſary uſes.</p>
            <p>I further conceive that taxes are abſolutely neceſſary, not only to ſupply the public treaſury, but to reduce our money to a fixed ſtandard, and reſtore it to its natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary uſe, which no other method of ſupplying the treaſury can do, and which yet muſt be done, in order to deliver us from the moſt dreadful calamity of a fluctuating currency. This I conſider as of the moſt weighty importance, and at the ſame time of ſo critical, difficult, and intricate a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it will require the utmoſt attention to the means of it, and the higheſt prudence and care to watch their operations, and add to or diminiſh their force as occaſion may require.</p>

For if the money ſhould appreciate, it will, over and above all private wrong, increaſe the national debt. An appreciation of only 10 per cent. which may be done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imperceptibly, will add 20,000,000 to that debt, which muſt be paid, not in ſhadows, but by the hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of our people.

            </p>
            <p>I am but little concerned or alarmed at the preſent pinch of the treaſury. Our reſources are too great to permit ſuch a temporary, ſuch a momentary diſtreſs to be fatal; a proper reduction of our expenditures, or a ſmall anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our revenue in any way, will remedy it. If the great ſprings of our revenue can be put in motion, we may be eaſily ſaved, otherwiſe we muſt periſh.</p>
            <p>I beg leave here to add, that the attention of Congreſs, however ſufficient, if it were not unavoidably drawn off by an infinity of other objects that conſtantly crowd upon them, is not and cannot be practicable in a degree ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to this great object. Nor indeed do I think that any board of numbers or aggregate body would be likely to form a ſyſtem ſo exact, and beſtow an attention ſo accurate and uniform as would be neceſſary in this caſe. I conceive it muſt be the work of <hi>one mind,</hi> which ever could inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and ſuperintend matters of an abſtruſe nature and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical movements better alone than with company; and therefore,</p>
            <p>VII.<note n="*" place="bottom">I believe this was the firſt propoſal made in <hi>America,</hi> for the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch an officer; I was ſo much convinced of the importance of ſuch an appointment, that I repeated the propoſal in ſeveral ſubſequent publications, and about a year after this, at the particular deſire of ſome members of Congreſs, publiſhed an eſſay on the nature, authority, and uſes of this office.</note> I propoſe, that a <hi>financier or comptroller of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> be appointed, whoſe ſole object and buſineſs ſhould be to ſuperintend the finances, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>revenues and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditures</hi> of the States, the ſtate of the <hi>currency,</hi> and all the <hi>funds</hi> in which we are concerned, and in ſhort, our whole <hi>reſources</hi> and <hi>expenditures;</hi> and keep the one well in balance
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023972_0080_0FC2BD2593995198"/>
with the other, all under the authority of Congreſs, and in every thing ſubject to their control. The Congreſs would then have the ſubject examined and formed to their hand, and would have nothing more to do than correct and approve it.</p>
            <p>If a man adequate to this buſineſs could be found, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his appointment would be of the higheſt utility to the States, as we may eaſily conceive only by imagining the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which might have reſulted from ſuch an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had ſuch an one been made five years ago.</p>
            <p>However, I do but propoſe this with the ſame ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mind as I expreſs my other thoughts; if it is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, it may be eaſily rejected, with any other of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and I have only to deſire this one favor of my indulgent reader, that if he does not like this, or any other part of my Eſſays, that he would lay them by, and read them again a year or two hence, after which he has my leave to do what he pleaſes with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Time</hi> is the <hi>ſureſt expoſitor and beſt judge</hi> of all plans and ſpeculations of this ſort; the <hi>vain and vicious</hi> will either <hi>vaniſh</hi> or ſtand <hi>condemned</hi> before him; the <hi>uſeful and good</hi> only can be <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>preſerved</hi> by him: and while I make this appeal, every body will allow that I refer myſelf to a moſt equitable and reaſonable arbiter, and I hope all my readers will candidly wait this deciſion with me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cenſuring too bitterly ſentiments on which time has not yet decided.</p>

            <p>THE ſyſtem of taxation equal to the public expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, adopted and recommended by Congreſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The firſt recommendation of Congreſs to the States <hi>to raiſe money by a tax</hi> (which I recollect) was on <hi>Jan.</hi> 14, 1777; but this was done in ſo <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite</hi> a manner, <hi>without any ſums or quotas ſpecified,</hi> that little or nothing came of it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Nov.</hi> 22, 1777, Congreſs recommended to the States to <hi>raiſe</hi> 5,000,000 <hi>of dollars</hi> in the courſe of the year 1778, in quarterly payments, <hi>with the quotas of each State annexed,</hi> &amp;c. but this had little effect; <hi>ſmall ſums</hi> were raiſed and paid by <hi>ſome of the States,</hi> within the year 1778; others made ſome remittances <hi>long afterwards,</hi> when the money was 20 for 1, or more, &amp;c. but great part was never paid at all.—In the addreſs of Congreſs to the people of the United States, <hi>May</hi> 8, 1778, is this expreſſion; <q>what are the reaſons that your <hi>money is depreciated?</hi> Becauſe <hi>no taxes have been impoſed</hi> to carry on the war.</q>

               </note> is grounded on the moſt ſolid and demonſtrable principles, and, if there is no error or defect in the execution of it, cannot fail of producing the two great ends expected from it, <abbr>Viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Supplying the expenſes of the States,</hi> and <hi>reducing our currency to a fixed and permanent value.</hi> Theſe two effects will be produced by the natural operation of this ſyſtem, without any force or extraneous helps.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:023972_0082_0FC2BD335DAC2548"/>
Yet it is to be noted here with care and concern, that when theſe great and ſteady principles come to operate on the preſent diſtracted ſtate of our currency and finances, very <hi>ſad</hi> and perhaps <hi>fatal effects</hi> will be produced, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite injuſtice done, even by this forcible remedy, tho' the moſt ſalutary and only effectual one, if ſome care is not taken to <hi>direct</hi> its force and <hi>limit</hi> its firſt effects. The <hi>appreciation</hi> of our currency is among the firſt of theſe ill conſequences which I fear, and would guard againſt. The evils of this I have conſidered in my Second Eſſay; but as what I there urged either has not been underſtood or regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I think it neceſſary here to reſume the ſubject, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly merits the higheſt attention of every <hi>American.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The value of Continental money is what it is <hi>now</hi> worth to the poſſeſſor. The <hi>preſent exchange</hi> of Continental money
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023972_0083_0FC2BD3465A60020"/>
is to hard money at the rate of about 40 <hi>to</hi> 1, tho' it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fluctuating; at this exchange of 40 to 1, which is very near the truth, and for which I appeal to the merchants' and goldſmiths' books, I ſay, at this exchange, our debt of continental money, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the continental money in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, is worth 5,000,000 <hi>of dollars in hard money.</hi> For the reader need not be told that that value is found by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the whole ſum of our currency, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 200,000,000 <hi>of dollars,</hi> by the exchange, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 40, which will make a quotient of 5,000,000 of dollars of hard money.</p>
            <p>If this exchange is reduced, ſay to 20 for 1, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe this public debt to 10,000,000 of hard dollars. Therefore, it follows, that <hi>every appreciation</hi> of the money <hi>increaſes</hi> the public debt, and to an amazing degree, by movements, indeed almoſt imperceptible, yet certain, and to an amount almoſt beyond belief. For if the exchange ſhould fall to 10 for 1, the debt would riſe to 20,000,000; an exchange of 5 to 1 would raiſe the debt to 40,000,000 of hard dollars, and ſo on till the debt would riſe to 200,000,000 of hard dollars, and all this <hi>without the leaſt benefit to the public,</hi> but in every view to its <hi>detriment.</hi> For, over and above the vaſt increaſe of taxes neceſſary to pay this increaſed debt, many other evils ſtill worſe than the tax would follow, to which I muſt beg the reader's moſt ſerious attention; for however out of ſight and diſtant it may appear, the miſchief is infinite, and muſt be fatal, if not prevented.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This appreciation will raiſe the value of the money in the cheſts of the poſſeſſors, in proportion as it increaſes the public debt.</hi> This will raiſe the <hi>great money-holders into nabobs,</hi> ſo rich there will be no living with them. They have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is generally thought, much more than their ſhare. Men of <hi>overgrown riches,</hi> eſpecially of ſudden acquirement, are <hi>dangerous</hi> to any community. They are not generally people of the <hi>beſt refinement of manners</hi> or <hi>wiſeſt diſcretion,</hi> and therefore, their influence in the community (which will ever be, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> in proportion to their wealth) will be dangerous; but were they all the beſt of men, ſuch amazing and ſudden acquiſitions of wealth would be enough
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023972_0084_0FC2BD39D2D5C318"/>
to ſpoil them. We find, by long and various experience, that human nature cannot bear, without corruption, ſuch ſudden leaps into the heights of greatneſs, proſperity, wealth, and influence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſame cauſe will induce all men to hoard their money,</hi> when <hi>they find it grows better and better daily in their cheſts.</hi> Money will ſoon become ſo ſcarce, as not to be obtained without great difficulty, and this will increaſe the value <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> appreciation of it; for the value of money will ever be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> proportion to its ſcarcity and demand. Thus every ſtage of this miſchief will tend to increaſe the evil, and lead on to further ſtages of the ſame calamity and diſtreſs. This is obvious to every one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This ſame cauſe will ruin our trade and manufactures;</hi> for the riſe of money in the deſk will be more profitable than any trade or branch of manufacture. This will <hi>ruin all induſtry;</hi> for the rich will not go into buſineſs, and the poor will not find employers, and this will produce ſcarcity of all goods, both home produced and imported, and of courſe general diſtreſs and want muſt follow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This ſame appreciation will increaſe the public debt, and conſequently will increaſe the taxes by which it muſt be paid, and that in proportion to the value or amount of the apprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The appreciation of money is like an account in a merchant's book; there muſt be a <hi>debtor</hi> and <hi>creditor</hi> to it. It is not poſſible that one ſhilling ſhould be <hi>gained</hi> by one perſon in this way, which is not <hi>loſt</hi> by ſomebody. If you make the money more valuable in my pocket, it will coſt the public more to redeem it; and therefore, if it was to be appreciated up to its original value, every man's tax muſt be multiplied by the preſent exchange, <hi>i. e.</hi> made about 40 times greater than it need be, to redeem all the money at the preſent value; and therefore it is probable thoſe who think the preſent taxes are not more than the fortieth part of what they ſhould be, will be zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the ſcheme of appreciation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This ſame thing will increaſe every private debt.</hi> For nothing is plainer than this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> if the money is more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable at the time of payment than it was at the time of

contract, the debt is thereby increaſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> it will take more hard money, or more wheat to pay the debt, than would have paid it at the time of contract. This brings on the inevitable ruin of many poor people, who cannot avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more or leſs in debt for rent or ſome other neceſſary thing. It is hard enough for them to pay their debts at their juſt value; but when the ſum comes to be increaſed, perhaps doubled or trebled in a few months, the payment becomes either extremely difficult or impoſſible. This might at firſt pleaſe the rich pretty well, but they would find their miſtake, for they would be obliged ſoon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a notice of bankruptcy, inſtead of payment from their debtors.</p>

            <p>From this view of the matter, it appears that many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may imagine that they ſhall receive an advantage from the appreciation, and therefore cry loudly for it, who will, in the end, be greatly hurt by it. It ſeems they aſk <hi>they know not what,</hi> like the mother of <hi>Zebedee'</hi>s children, who, in the ardency of maternal affection, petitioned our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that her two ſons might ſit, the one on his <hi>right</hi> hand, and the other on his <hi>left,</hi> not conſidering that the purport of her petition was, that one of her ſons might be <hi>ſaved</hi> and the other <hi>damned.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. The appreciation <hi>of the Continental bills</hi> will continue thro' the <hi>whole courſe of it, all the miſchiefs of a fluctuating currency.</hi> This deſtroys or varies the <hi>ſtandard</hi> or <hi>common meaſure of value</hi> of all things bought or ſold; renders all <hi>money-contracts</hi> and <hi>debts uncertain; corrupts the equity</hi> and <hi>alters the force of our laws,</hi> by varying the <hi>fines, forfeitures,</hi> and <hi>fees</hi> limited by them; and in ſhort, throws both the <hi>private man in his dealings,</hi> and the <hi>judge on the bench,</hi> into ſuch perplexity and confuſion, that neither can have due <hi>knowledge of right,</hi> even when they may be diſpoſed to do it, whilſt the <hi>wicked</hi> have the greateſt latitude in which they may practiſe <hi>ſhocking wrongs,</hi> and that in the <hi>face of the ſun,</hi> and <hi>with impunity.</hi> This ſuſpends the <hi>rewards of virtue</hi> and the <hi>puniſhment of vice, corrupts the morals</hi> of the people, and in the end <hi>produces every evil work.</hi> Surely this picture is dreary.</p>

The uſes of the currency are to every purpoſe as great to the public, if fixed at the preſent value, at two pence or three pence the dollar, as at any <hi>other value</hi> that can be named.</p>

9. <hi>The appreciation of the currency will deſtroy the equity of the taxation itſelf,</hi> according to the known and received principles of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that all eſtates ought to be taxed in proportion <hi>to their value,</hi> in ſuch manner that every man's eſtate, after the tax is paid, ſhall bear the <hi>ſame proportion</hi> to his neighbour's as before, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo that no man ſhould <hi>be enriched</hi> or <hi>impoveriſhed</hi> by the tax more than his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>But if the money is appreciated, the tax will have a very different effect, as will be obvious at firſt ſight, only by viewing its operation in one very familiar inſtance, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Suppoſe two brothers have each a plantation of equal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, ſay worth 1000<hi>l.</hi> hard money each, and one of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ells his plantation for 1000<hi>l</hi> hard money, and changes that money into 40,000<hi>l.</hi> continental money, and the tax comes on; and we will further ſuppoſe they are both taxed according to the value of their eſtates, <hi>i. e.</hi> equally, and that the tax neceſſary to appreciate the money be 20 per cent. on the whole value; it appears then plain that the tax of <hi>the one,</hi> who keeps his plantation, will be 200<hi>l.</hi> hard money, and the tax of <hi>the other,</hi> who has 40,000<hi>l.</hi> continental money, will be 8000<hi>l.</hi> of that money; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the firſt will have a clear eſtate leſt of 800<hi>l.</hi> hard money value, but the other will have an eſtate worth 32,000<hi>l.</hi> hard money, for by the ſuppoſition all the money he has left will be <hi>appreciated</hi> up to its original value, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the value of hard money, and will be worth 40 times as much as his brother's eſtate. But if all theſe arguments do not convince, I have one more, which, I think, muſt do for the hardieſt opponent; it is this:—</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>The ſcheme of appreciation will deſtroy itſelf; it is in its nature impracticable, and its own operation will work its deſtruction.</hi> For the appreciation of the currency will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the <hi>taxes</hi> and <hi>public burdens</hi> to ſuch an enormous and <hi>inſupportable amount,</hi> that the people neither <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>ought to bear them.</hi> When they come to be told that all their taxes are not at all for the benefit of the public, but are for no other purpoſe than to increaſe the value of the money hoarded by their rich neighbours (and <hi>they certainly

            <p>Then the mighty bubble will ſink into nothing, and with it will go all our <hi>revenue, public faith, defence, honor,</hi> and <hi>political exiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very many things more might be added on this fertile ſubject; but if what I have ſaid in my Second Eſſay on this ſubject, and what I have repeated and added here, is not ſufficient for conviction, it is vain and uſeleſs in my opinion to add more, and ſhall only here beg my reader's patience and attention a moment to an affair of my own.</p>
            <p>I do here, as an individual, <hi>enter my proteſt</hi> moſt ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt this moſt fatal, uſeleſs, and chimerical ſcheme of appreciating the currency, and am determined to leave a copy of my Eſſays with my children, that my poſterity may know that in 1780 there was, at leaſt, <hi>one citizen</hi> of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia who was not totally diſtracted, and that they may have the honor and conſolation of being deſcended from a man, who was able to keep <hi>in his ſenſes</hi> in times of the greateſt <hi>infatuation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this notwithſtanding, and altho' appearances are ſtrong againſt me, I will ſtill hope that there yet is a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious majority on my ſide, who are thoroughly ſick of all <hi>viſionary projects,</hi> and wiſh to adopt the <hi>ſubſtantial and ſure</hi> remedies which ſtill remain in our power. With ſuch as theſe I will moſt cheerfully join in company, and ſit down with them with great pleaſure, and unite in farther conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the important ſubject, begging this favor at the ſame time of the reſt, who do not like our employment, that they would not come into the room to interrupt us; and this they cannot think a hardſhip, as they certainly can loſe nothing by it, for I really have not one word more to ſay to them.</p>
            <p>If it is granted that the currency ought not to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated up to its original value, <hi>I cannot ſee a ſhadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it ſhould be appreciated at all, and not be fixed at its preſent value.</hi> The <hi>truth</hi> is always better than <hi>any thing near it,</hi> altho' ever ſo near. Every ſhilling that it may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023972_0089_0FC2BD4817B04CF0"/>
is added to the public debt, for which the public receives not the <hi>leaſt advantage,</hi> but all the <hi>profit</hi> goes to the <hi>great hoarders</hi> of our currency; for thoſe who have no more on hand than juſt the amount of their whole tax get nothing by it. There remain then but two things to be conſidered: 1ſt. <hi>What the preſent exchange of the currency is;</hi> and 2dly. <hi>How to fix it to that exchange or value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. As to the firſt of theſe there is a difficulty, principally ariſing from this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the exchange is not the <hi>ſame</hi> in all the States, but <hi>different</hi> in the different States, and this difference is not fixed in the different States, but ſometimes varies in the ſeveral parts of the ſame State. But it is here to be obſerved, that the exchange of the ſeveral parts of the State differs very little from that which prevails in the great capitals neareſt to them, and what little variation there is, moſt generally appears to lie in this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the exchange riſes <hi>firſt in the great capitals,</hi> and the <hi>out towns,</hi> of leſs trade, follow pretty <hi>quickly</hi> after them; ſo that the exchange of each State may be pretty ſafely taken from that of its capital, or the great capital to which it is moſt contiguous.</p>
            <p>The rule by which I find the true exchange at any given time is, to take the exchange which prevailed at the given time in each State, and add them all together and divide the ſum by 13, and the quotient will be the mean exchange or value of the currency. For inſtance, by the beſt advice I can collect, the exchange <hi>laſt Chriſtmas,</hi> or <hi>December</hi> 25, 1779, was, in the four <hi>New-England</hi> States, <hi>New-York, North</hi> and <hi>South Carolina,</hi> and <hi>Georgia, i. e.</hi> in eight States, at 35 for 1, and in <hi>New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, Delaware, Maryland,</hi> and <hi>Virginia, i. e.</hi> in five States, at 40 for 1, their ſums will ſtand thus,—

which ſum divided by 13 gives a quotient of 36 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>/23 or 37 nearly, which I ſuppoſe to be the true mean exchange or
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023972_0090_0FC2BD5B7A121E90"/>
averaged value of the currency, through all the Thirteen States, at that time.</p>
            <p>The preſent exchange in this city is 45 to 1, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was riſing both to the eaſtward and ſouthward when the laſt advices came away, ſo that I ſuppoſe the preſent mean exchange may ſafely and truly be fixed at 40 for 1, but our future advices will ſoon determine this beyond all doubt. This is throwing aſide all theory and ſpeculation, and grounding my computation entirely on fact, and is a method which I expect will be allowed to be fair, true, and unexceptionable; <hi>and at this value I propoſe that the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency ſhould be fixed at preſent, and be finally redeemed at the ſame.</hi> Both theſe I conceive very juſt and practicable.</p>
            <p>I do not think there is any juſtice in taxing the public to appreciate any man's money in his cheſt beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent value. This would be burdening the public, merely for the benefit of a few individuals of monied men; for I before obſerved that no perſon could take benefit of ſuch an appreciation, but ſuch as have more money on hand than all their taxes for redeeming the whole currency will amount to; and thoſe few among us who have ſuch a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of money are the men who have the leaſt occaſion of aſſiſtance from the public, and in general have the leaſt right to expect or even to wiſh it. For a further conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this I refer back to all the reaſons I have given againſt an appreciation.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it will be readily granted that every principle of juſtice requires that any further depreciation of our currency ſhould, if poſſible, be prevented. The <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability</hi> of both theſe, <hi>i. e. of fixing the currency,</hi> deſerves our moſt ſerious conſideration; and here, notwithſtanding the unaccountable and ſeemingly capricious fluctuation of the exchange, both in progreſſive and retrograde motion (for we have frequently ſeen both) yet I ſay, this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I do contend <hi>there are great natural principles, which, if properly applied, will confine this ſlippery ſubject, fix it to a point, and prevent ſuch fluctuation as will greatly prejudice its uſe.</hi>—To prevent an APPRECIATION,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="unknown:023972_0091_0FC2BD5C1ED105D8"/>
I. As the currency has no real fixed value in itſelf, it is neceſſary that <hi>it ſhould be connected, tied, or faſtened firmly to ſomething that is fixed, which may hold it ſteady,</hi> as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor does a ſhip, which keeps its place by that connection, let the wind or tide ſet either way. Such a fixed medium is hard money, the value of which cannot vary much from its value in <hi>Europe,</hi> and therefore its permanency may be ſafely depended on. To this end I propoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That an order of Congreſs be paſſed, that hard money ſhall be received for taxes and all other payments into the Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Treaſury, at the preſent value or fixed exchange;</hi> ſay 40 for 1. For as the demand for taxes will be very great and univerſal; if the preſent ſyſtem of taxation be carried into effectual execution, as it doubtleſs will be, it will not be poſſible for any man to get a better exchange than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the public treaſury.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I propoſe that a reſolution paſs to redeem the whole cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency finally at the preſent value;</hi> ſay 40 for 1. This will effectually take away all inducement to raiſe the value of it beyond the exchange which can finally be obtained for it, when it ſhall be redeemed. I do apprehend that my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before aſſigned againſt the appreciation will prove the juſtice, good policy, and neceſſity of theſe reſolutions, to which I therefore refer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>I propoſe that all public eſtimates, quotas, payments, &amp;c. be made in hard money, or Continental equal to it at the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent exchange,</hi> and alſo <hi>that all judgments of courts, fees, ſalaries, &amp;c. ſhould be made up in the ſame manner,</hi> that ſo no public community or private perſon ſhould receive either injury or benefit from any future fluctuation of the curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either up or down, if ſuch ſhould happen, any farther than his caſh on hand might be affected by it. This would not only be an effectual remedy of the crying injuſtice, both public and private, which has too long prevailed among us, but will alſo take away the principal inducement and tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to attempt any fluctuation of the currency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I propoſe, for the more effectual operation of this remedy, <hi>that all the tender acts, all laws againſt dealing in hard money, and every other of that nature which now ſubſiſt
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:023972_0092_0FC2BD5F03793C88"/>
in any</hi> of the States, may be repealed. As thoſe acts were moſtly made on the recommendation of Congreſs, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a recommendation of that honorable body to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral States for ſuch repeal might be neceſſary.—It appears to me that theſe propoſitions will moſt effectually prevent any future <hi>appreciation</hi> of our currency.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid here, we are ſufficiently out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that, the preſent labor is ſtop the <hi>depreciation.</hi> But I do not know all this. I have many reaſons to fear an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation, which would be a very ruinous calamity if it ſhould happen, and I think we may do well to uſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt a poſſible evil; and I have at leaſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon argument of quacks in favor of my propoſitions, <q>that they are innocent, they can do no hurt, and they may do good.</q> If the event to which they are deſigned to be applied ſhould happen, they will be of the utmoſt uſe and benefit; if that event ſhould not happen, their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be prevented, and no bad effects can proceed from them. I am as ſenſible as any man of the urgent neceſſity of preventing a farther depreciation, and therefore recur to ſuch great natural principles as I think will moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and aſſuredly remedy the miſchief; and here I hope it will not be taken amiſs, if I repeat ſome things I have heretofore advanced; for great truths, and weighty princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of deciſive importance, ought often to be repeated, that they may be better kept in mind. I proceed then, to prevent DEPRECIATION,</p>
            <p>II. To obſerve, that <hi>one great cauſe of depreciation is the increaſe of the quantity of our currency, and therefore the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity muſt by no means be increaſed.</hi> For it is not poſſible to prevent the operation of ſuch increaſe on the depreciation. It matters not in what ſhape ſuch an increaſe may appear, whether <hi>of Continental bills, certificates, bills on</hi> Europe, <hi>or bills of particular States. If the quantity in circulation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, it is not in the nature of the thing poſſible to prevent the effect of depreciation, which muſt and will flow from that increaſe.</hi> Therefore, <hi>the incomes muſt be made equal to the expenditures.</hi> This will give the currency a quick circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſufficient for every purpoſe, without any increaſe of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023972_0093_0FC2BD5FF6B57288"/>
its quantity, will raiſe that demand for it, which is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to its nature and uſe, and from its natural operation will prevent any poſſibility of depreciation, if the confidence of the public in its final redemption can be made entire and free of doubt.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the conſideration of another great principle, on which the credit of all bills muſt depend, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>the final redemption of the bills muſt be made certain, and the value or exchange at which they ſhall be finally paid or redeemed muſt be certainly known.</hi> If there is any doubt of either of theſe in the minds of the people, that doubt will leſſen the value of the bills; for a certainty will always be better than an uncertainty, <hi>i. e.</hi> the credit of the States muſt ſtand ſo firmly connected with their real ſubſtance, that there can be no doubt but the one will be ſupported by the other. The life and uſe of money lies in a quick and ready circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; yet, although this circulation ſhould be ever ſo briſk, if it paſſes from hand to hand, like <hi>Robin's alive,</hi> in conſtant danger of <hi>dying in the laſt hand,</hi> it muſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all its ſigns of life and vigor, depreciate faſt; and <hi>I conceive a general confidence or doubt of this kind has operated more on our currency than people are generally aware of.</hi>

               </gap>, new difficulties aroſe, and the multiplied emiſſions had ſwelled the quantity of our currency to an enormous amount, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any probability or even poſſibility of payment <hi>at full value,</hi> there enſued a <hi>great abatement of the general confidence,</hi> and mighty doubts aroſe whether it would ever be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all, or, if it was, at what value; and theſe doubts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with the increaſe of the quantity, and ſome other
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023972_0094_0FC2BD6173A74C10"/>
cauſes, till the exchange roſe up to the enormous height which now exiſts. The principal cauſes of theſe doubts, and conſequently of the depreciation, I take it, have been <hi>the uncertainty of the fate of the war, or ſupport of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and the increaſing enormous ſum of our currency.</hi> I conceive all doubts ariſing from the firſt of theſe cauſes are pretty well done away.</p>
            <p>I think it is ſo far from remaining a doubt whether we ſhall ſupport our Independence, that <hi>I do not apprehend it is in our power to give it up if we were willing,</hi> and to fall back into the dominion of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> I am of opinion that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and perhaps ſome other powers, muſt be conquered, before the <hi>trade</hi> or <hi>government of America</hi> can be permitted to be monopolized and controlled by <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The vaſt <hi>extent</hi> of our country, the <hi>fertility</hi> of our ſoil, <hi>ſalubrity</hi> of our climates, with other natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, together with the <hi>rapid increaſe</hi> of our people, agriculture, and arts, make us an object of vaſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, expectation, and attention with every trading country of <hi>Europe,</hi> and they will not eaſily give up the ſhare of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which they expect to derive from us.</p>
            <p>If we continue to increaſe as we have done in time paſt, that is, to <hi>double every 25 years,</hi> the Thirteen States will contain more people at the end of the next century, than <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Great-Britain</hi> together all contain at preſent. All <hi>Europe</hi> gaze with attention on our riſing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it is a pity that <hi>America,</hi> like ſome <hi>careleſs beauty,</hi> ſhould be the only perſon in the company, <hi>inſenſible of her charms.</hi> It is time for us to know our own importance, and not throw ourſelves away in a needleſs deſpondency.</p>
            <p>As to the doubts ariſing from the great quantity of our currency, and the conſequent uncertainty of its redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I conceive they will be effectually removed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going propoſitions. The preſent debt of Continental money ceaſes to appear enormous; it does not exceed 5,000,000 <hi>of hard dollars,</hi> which is leſs than 2 dollars per head on the inhabitants; a light burden! a trifle! not adequate to the abilities of the pooreſt town in the Thirteen States. The only remaining doubt is, whether the States <hi>will in fact
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023972_0095_0FC2BD62E13AF158"/>
pay this ſum,</hi> ſmall as it is. This doubt appears to me ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous; for were we to ſuppoſe there was not a grain of <hi>honor</hi> or <hi>honeſty</hi> left in the Thirteen States, on which we could depend for the payment of their debts, yet they have ſuffered ſo much by the depreciation of their currency, that they will, from a principle of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> remedy the miſchief, and prevent it in future. A burnt child dreads the fire, and certainly we have not loſt all the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of human nature, however callous we may be to the inducements of moral principles.</p>
            <p>But <hi>my confidence, even in the morality of the States, is not ſhaken, it is entire.</hi> It is my opinion our people are able and willing to do all that is neceſſary to be done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent criſis. Nothing more is or can be neceſſary, than to put the matter in a <hi>proper train of operation.</hi>

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023972_0096_0FC2BD6F234E0E30"/>
this.</hi> I am of opinion, that we might as well expect that a <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> a <hi>Parliament,</hi> a <hi>Diet</hi> of an Empire, or a <hi>Congreſs,</hi> could deſcribe and demonſtrate the properties of the ſphere, compute the force of falling bodies, define the laws of hydroſtatics, or make an almanac, as form a ſyſtem of finance.</p>
            <p>The power of <hi>ſuperintendence</hi> and <hi>legal ſanction</hi> is theirs; but the <hi>calculation and execution</hi> of the ſyſtem is not, in my humble opinion, compatible to the ſenatorial body. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, ſome years ago, aboliſhed the <hi>Julian ſtyle,</hi> and adopted the <hi>Gregorian,</hi> and gave it legal ſanction, to the great ſatisfaction and benefit of the kingdom; but I never heard any man ſuppoſe that that Parliament was ever capable of <hi>calculating or demonſtrating</hi> either of the ſtyles; yet I do not apprehend that it is any reflection on the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, abilities, or competency of that Parliament to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that, if nobody could have calculated ſtyles better than they could, we might have done without any till this time, and computed the advance of the ſpring by the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of white-oak trees, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do.</p>
            <p>The conſequence from all this is, in my opinion, that if a ſenatorial body want ſtyles, ſyſtems of finance, or any things elſe which require peculiar abilities, ſuch as by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon probability cannot be preſumed to exiſt in ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>But were it not ſo, good policy would preſcribe this method; for <hi>the ground of finance is, every ſtep of is, moſt dangerous ground.</hi> Errors are at firſt imperceptible and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily made, but ſoon ſhoot up into capital importance, and often aſſume a moſt hideous and ghaſtly appearance; all which is apt to throw diſgrace and cenſure, and ſometimes contempt, on the authors. That which proceeded from
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023972_0097_0FC2BD7088BE9238"/>
               <hi>ignorance</hi> may be attributed to <hi>bad deſign.</hi> In any view, miſtakes and diſappointments prove the ignorance or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of the managers, and there will always be ſome degree of <hi>contempt due to perſons</hi> who undertake things which they <hi>know not how</hi> to perform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bodies of ſupreme dignity ought never to incur cenſures or aſperſions of this ſort. The public always ſuffer, when the wiſdom or integrity of their ſupreme power is called at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to queſtion.</hi> They ought, therefore, in all good policy, to appoint proper perſons to do all buſineſs of this ſort, were it only that they might have a <hi>ſcape-goat</hi> to bear away from themſelves the cenſure, diſgrace, and contempt which any errors might occaſion, when they came to be diſcovered; for it is very obſervable, that when any error or miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct happens in any great department of the State, the blame always falls on the <hi>officer under whoſe direction it was made.</hi> No part of the cenſure ever falls on the ſupreme power, unleſs it is that of making a <hi>corrupt or injudicious appointment</hi> of the officer, or taking the <hi>management of the matter out of his hands</hi> by too particular inſtructions.</p>
            <p>On the whole matter, our country <hi>abounds</hi> with <hi>men</hi> and every ſort of <hi>ſupplies</hi> which we need <hi>(military ſtores and cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> excepted, which are eaſily attainable from abroad). Our public counſels and meaſures are very little obſtructed by <hi>diſputes</hi> or <hi>parties in oppoſition.</hi> The great thing wanted is, to put our finances into ſuch a <hi>train, order,</hi> or <hi>ſyſtem,</hi> as will revive the public credit, bring our currency into ſuch an eſtabliſhed value and demand, as is neceſſary to its nature and uſe, and enable the public to call into uſe ſuch ſervices and ſupplies as are neceſſary to the public ſafety.</p>
            <p>The abilities requiſite to form and execute ſuch a ſyſtem are not to be found or expected in any <hi>ſenatorial body; i. e.</hi> by common probability it cannot be preſumed, that the component members of ſuch a body ſhould be poſſeſſed of the rare and peculiar abilities requiſite for this great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>It remains then a matter of the higheſt and moſt urgent neceſſity, that a ſuitable perſon for the great office of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancier-General,</hi> or <hi>Superintendent of Finance,</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:023972_0098_0FC2BD7CA7C4FFF0"/>
looked up, and <hi>appointed</hi> as ſoon as may be, whoſe ſole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be to inſpect and control our whole <hi>revenue and expenditures,</hi> and keep them in balance with each other.</p>
            <p>I imagine this high office will not be very greedily ſought or eagerly accepted by any perſon <hi>capable</hi> of it. It will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the moſt unwearied, unremitted application, the moſt intenſe and fixed attention to a ſubject of a moſt <hi>intricate</hi> nature and <hi>great extent;</hi> the <hi>heart-felt intereſts,</hi> the <hi>loſs or gain, the injury or benefit of millions,</hi> will ſtand cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with his concluſions and management, and of courſe his errors, if he makes any (as from the intricacy and vaſt extent of the ſubject he undoubtedly muſt) his errors, I ſay, will incur the <hi>ſevere reſentment,</hi> and raiſe the <hi>mercileſs cry</hi> of the inconſiderate and ill-natured, which make a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the world; and after all, if he conducts with ſucceſs, he will get <hi>little praiſe;</hi> for every thing in his way will go ſmoothly on in a regular train, which will ſoon grow <hi>familiar,</hi> and of courſe <hi>unnoticed,</hi> and not <hi>one in a thouſand</hi> will know to whom they are indebted for <hi>their tranquillity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, I do not know that the preſent <hi>confuſions</hi> of our revenue are capable of being ſpeedily reduced to <hi>order</hi> by any addreſs of wiſdom, ſkill, and diligence; and ſhould he fail, the weighty burden might cruſh him in an inſtant, and he may fall, like <hi>Phaëton,</hi> ridiculous and unpitied, for undertaking a work for which, perhaps any degree of human wiſdom or ability may prove inſufficient. Be this as it may, much will depend on the <hi>choice of this officer.</hi> Should an inſufficient man be appointed, his defects or miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not only be <hi>ſeverely felt</hi> while he is in office, but moſt probably his <hi>ſucceſſor</hi> may find a more difficult taſk to <hi>correct</hi> his errors, than to have taken up the matter <hi>new,</hi> and ſet out <hi>right</hi> at firſt.</p>
            <p>But to return to the main point; the great queſtion ſeems now to be, whether, in any practicable train or method, <hi>it would be poſſible to raiſe money among ourſelves equal to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expenditures, i. e.</hi> whether the people could pay ſuch a large ſum. To this I anſwer, the beſt method of judging of the mighty wealth and abilities of the States is, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting

on what they have paid in times paſt. The expenſes of the war for 5 years paſt have been about 11,000,000 of hard dollars per annum, beſides the loans, as will eaſily appear by computing the value of the bills emitted each year; and this has been all paid, except 5,000,000, and that in the <hi>worſt,</hi> moſt <hi>diſtreſſing</hi> and <hi>oppreſſive</hi> method that could be deviſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by the <hi>depreciation</hi> of the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
            <p>The payments of the laſt year, 1779, which were <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made,</hi> were much more than the ſaid ſum, for on the laſt day of the year 1778, the whole currency was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than 90,000,000, and the exchange was 6 to 1: conſequently, 90,000,000, divided by 6, will give in hard money the amount of our debt of continental money, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 15,000,000 of hard dollars, to which add the expenditures of the year 1779, <abbr>viz.</abbr> about 140,000,000 of dollars,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It may be objected to this calculation, that 33,000,000 of the 140,000,000 of dollars emitted in 1779, were for exchanging the <hi>emiſſions of May</hi> 20, 1777 (8,000,000 of dollars) <hi>and of April</hi> 11, 1778 (25,000,000) which were called <hi>out of circulation;</hi> but this does not <hi>diminiſh</hi> but <hi>increaſes</hi> the <hi>loſs</hi> by depreciation, <hi>which the States ſuffered in that year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And as to the 33,000,000 of the ſaid <hi>two emiſſions called in,</hi> it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that on the <hi>laſt</hi> day of the year 1778, they were worth at 6 for 1 (which was the exchange at that time) 5,500,000 of hard dollars; but on <hi>Aug.</hi> 1, 1779 (the <hi>day appointed</hi> by Congreſs for their <hi>redemption)</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was 20 <hi>for</hi> 1, and of courſe they <hi>were worth but about</hi> 1,700,000. which, ſubtracted from <hi>their value</hi> on the <hi>laſt</hi> of the year 1778 (5,500,000 hard dollars) leaves <hi>a loſs of</hi> 3,800,000 <hi>of hard dollars,</hi> which the States ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that year by the depreciation of the ſaid <hi>two emiſſions</hi> only.</p>
               </note> which is ſomewhat leſs than was emitted in that year. To find the value of this, we muſt divide it by the mean exchange of the year, which I conceive may be found by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exchange at the end of the year 1778, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 6 for 1, by the exchange at the end of the year 1779, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 40, which makes a product of 240, the ſquare-root of which, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 15½ nearly, is the mean exchange, and the ſum of expenditures of 1779, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 140,000,000, divided by ſaid mean exchange. <abbr>viz.</abbr> 15½, gives for quotient 9,000,000 of hard dollars, which, added to the amount of the debt at the end of the year 1778, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 15,000,000, makes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

what more than 24,000,000; out of which ſubtract the debt now remaining, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 5,000,000, there remain 19,000,000 of hard dollars, which have been <hi>actually paid</hi> by the Thirteen States in the year 1779.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This proves the prodigious <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the <hi>American</hi> States, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>great burdens</hi> they <hi>can</hi> bear, as well as their <hi>firmneſs</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in bearing them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in the above calculations a very heavy, impoveriſhing part of their burdens was not brought into the account, <abbr>viz.</abbr> over and above what is there mentioned, they had to ſupport <hi>a tax</hi> which the war itſelf impoſed, more than <hi>four times</hi> as heavy as all the preſent duties of impoſt, with all the new additions, which the States now ſupport, <hi>i. e.</hi> multiply the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent impoſt laid on every article of imported goods by 4, and add the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the old price-current of the ſame goods in 1774, and it will not raiſe them ſo high as the average price at which the ſame imported goods were ſold thro' the war.</p>

The queſtion is then reduced to this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether it is not only poſſible, but much eaſier to pay 11,000,000 of hard dollars in ſome equitable mode, which diſtributes the burden on all in due proportion to their abilities, than it was laſt year to pay almoſt <hi>double that ſum</hi> in the moſt une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and oppreſſive way imaginable. I know it will require ſtrong exertions, but we began the war with this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſolution, and I do not think our people will ſhrink or give back under the burden when it comes.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it does not appear to me poſſible to increaſe our circulating caſh in any way, without further depreciating it, which at once deſtroys its uſe, and the very end we ſhould have in view by increaſing it. Loans will do this; for every loan makes a new certificate or bill of ſome ſort, and all theſe will ſlow into circulation as ſoon as they gain that eſtabliſhed value which they ought to have, and which they muſt have, before we can borrow without a loſs or diſcount.</p>
            <p>I think it manifeſtly reaſonable, <hi>that all loan-office certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates ſhould be redeemed at the exchange which exiſted at their dates, and that there ſhould be a rate of exchange from the firſt depreciation down to the preſent time made, to aſcertain the exchange at the time when each bill was dated, and a ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in proportion to the value of the principal, ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to the poſſeſſor, until the certificate ſhall be paid.</hi> If this was done, we might borrow, perhaps, without a diſcount or loſs, and keep our debt at home, which would be much better than drawing bills on <hi>Europe</hi> at a loſs of 30 or 40 per cent. and contracting a hard money debt abroad. But this is digreſſion. To return to my ſubject.</p>

            <head type="sub">Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, March 30, 1780.</head>
            <p>THE expenditures of the preſent year 1780, are eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated (as I am told) at about 10,000,000 of dollars hard money. This ſum muſt be raiſed and paid, or our defence muſt be diſcontinued; we muſt loſe our liberties and probably many of our heads too; our ſtruggles muſt vaniſh into ſmoke and diſgrace; and our glorious <hi>revolution</hi> muſt be dubbed <hi>rebellion,</hi> and puniſhed as ſuch, and how much more God knows. The ſaid <hi>ſum</hi> muſt be <hi>raiſed,</hi> or <hi>theſe miſeries muſt enſue.</hi> We have no other alternative, and it is vain and idle to amuſe ourſelves with any hopes or even ſhadows of any other. Our <hi>defence</hi> cannot be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without the <hi>neceſſary money;</hi> if that ceaſes, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly lie open to the full power of our enemies, and muſt ſubmit to any conditions they may preſcribe.</p>
            <p>This I take to be the plain ſtate of the facts; ſtubborn facts, which can neither be removed, eluded, or ſoftened, by any poſſible <hi>fineſſe, coloring,</hi> or <hi>evaſions.</hi> We may as well keep them in <hi>ſight</hi> as to <hi>ſhut our eyes</hi> againſt them; for <hi>facts they are, and will have their operation, which we muſt feel, whether we will ſee them or not.</hi> If the expenditures, on which the eſtimates are made, can be reduced, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

every poſſible attention will be paid to ſuch an object, but we cannot flatter ourſelves that any very conſiderable ſavings can be made in this way; it only remains then that we ſet ourſelves <hi>immediately</hi> to raiſe the money, or give up the cauſe in deſpair.

            <p>In a criſis of danger, when the moſt ſpirited and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute efforts are called for, to ſee <hi>men</hi> like children ſtand with one hand in their eyes, and the other in their mouths, blubbering out with voices half aſſured, <hi>I cannot! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not! I dare not! I dare not!</hi> is ridiculous, argues ſuch meanneſs of ſpirit, ſuch heartleſs cowardice, I am aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it. If I really thought the people of <hi>America</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this, I would not move a finger to ſave them from that ſlavery and ſubjection for which they muſt, in that caſe, be ſo well fitted by nature; it would not move my pity to ſee them <hi>laſhed</hi> by their maſters into that <hi>ſeverity</hi> of effort, which their cowardly ſouls had not <hi>animation</hi> enough to <hi>exert</hi> in defence of their own liberties.</p>
            <p>The very <hi>taxes</hi> which we now heſitate to <hi>impoſe on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> to defend and ſecure our liberties, will, I dare ſay,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:023972_0106_0FC2B5882C9CB338"/>
be <hi>impoſed</hi> and <hi>rigidly extorted</hi> by our enemies, whenever they ſhall get their yoke on our necks: the price which they will make us pay for our <hi>chains,</hi> will be greater than that which is now neceſſary to pay for our <hi>liberty;</hi> the <hi>temporary</hi> burdens which are now demanded to ſecure the well-being of ourſelves and poſterity, will be made <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> on us and them by our enemies, when they ſhall find it neceſſary to ſecure <hi>our</hi> ſlavery and <hi>their</hi> luxury: for did any man ever know or read the hiſtory of any country, governed as an appendage of a diſtant empire, that was not fleeced, if not ſkinned and peeled to the bone, by their diſtant, unfeeling, unſympathizing deſpots. Such countries are never, in ſuch caſe, eſtimated by any other ſcale, than the amount of the revenue and other advantages that can be drawn from them.</p>
            <p>I do not really think that the people of the United States are at all the proper ſubjects of this kind of government; I do not think a meanneſs of ſpirit, a groſs ſtupidity, or cowardly diffidence makes any part of their character; they have, in fact, reſented injuries, aſſerted their liberties, and nobly dared to defend them, with a degree of exertion, perſeverance, and firmneſs, unparalleled and almoſt beyond belief. It is my opinion that we may ſafely depend on any <hi>degree of exertion</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> in our people, which is neceſſary to their ſafety; and if this is not all called out and put in force, when and to any degree the public ſafety may require it, the fault will lie in the <hi>rulers,</hi> not in the <hi>peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I am of opinion, there are few inſtances of any countries over-run or enſlaved, thro' any <hi>defect of virtue</hi> in the <hi>people,</hi> which does not originate in their <hi>rulers;</hi> the natural and common ſource of remedies lies in the rulers, and if they are good, they will ſee the miſchief, and apply the remedy, before it riſes to ſuch force as to endanger the liberties of a country. If vice or corruption gets ground in any popular ſtate, it generally diſcovers itſelf pretty ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the appointment of <hi>officers of notorious improper cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> or inſufficient abilities, to fill and manage the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant departments of the ſtate; for where any corruption
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:023972_0107_0FC2B58A09670B20"/>
or prejudice prevails in any ſtate, they will generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get into place, ſuch officers as are likely to <hi>ſupport ſuch corruption or prejudice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this caſe, the miſchief is carried into the very <hi>ſource of remedy,</hi> and corruption gets a whip-row, which gains by every movement; and if this whip-row can be broken, the game muſt ſoon be up, and there remains nothing to do, but to ſet again, and try a new game. But as all that is <hi>not our caſe,</hi> this may be deemed a needleſs digreſſion: we will come then directly to what <hi>is our caſe,</hi> which I will here endeavour to ſtate as it ſtands in fact, which no fretting, or jeſting, or ſhrugging can alter.</p>
            <p>I. The eſtimates of the preſent year amount to about 10,000,000 of hard dollars, or the value of them, which muſt <hi>be paid</hi> by ſomebody, or <hi>our defence cannot be continued.</hi> If this ceaſes, our country muſt lie-open to the unreſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ravages and plunders of our enemies, and every obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous individual be expoſed to their vengeance, and we have ſeen enough of them to know that their tender mercies are cruelty. And the only queſtion I conceive that can ariſe here is this, Whether this heavy burden ſhall be laid on a <hi>part only</hi> of our people, and cruſh them into ruin; or whether it ſhall be laid <hi>equably on all?</hi> In the latter caſe, heavy as it is, it may be borne; it will not amount to more than 4 dollars on each perſon, or 20 dollars on a middling family of 5 perſons. If there is a beggar in the Thirteen States who cannot pay this, he muſt have ſome rich neighbours who can pay it for him; and it lies with each State to <hi>apportion</hi> their taxes in ſuch manner as to <hi>eaſe the poor,</hi> and <hi>increaſe the ſhare of the rich,</hi> ſo as to bring the burden on all in due proportion to their abilities.</p>
            <p>If, inſtead of this, the whole weight muſt lie on a few, <abbr>viz.</abbr> ſuch as happen to have the ſupplies neceſſary for public uſe; if the wheat, hay, &amp;c. muſt be <hi>torn from the farmer;</hi> the rum, ſalt, &amp;c. from the <hi>merchant;</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the <hi>ſoldiers, waggoners,</hi> &amp;c. be <hi>compelled by force;</hi> if in this way our ſupplies and ſervices are to be <hi>extorted from a few,</hi> whilſt the <hi>reſt</hi> bear nothing, the community
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:023972_0108_0FC2B59BC2A50C38"/>
muſt ſuffer much more than it would do, were the burden equally proportioned on all.</p>
            <p>For to ſay nothing about the <hi>execrable injuſtice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> of this method, the <hi>reſentment and rage</hi> it will excite, the <hi>diſcouragement to the future induſtry</hi> of the farmer, or <hi>adventure</hi> of the merchant, the <hi>reluctant recruits</hi> of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, hereby occaſioned; to ſay nothing of theſe, it is as manifeſt that a heavy burden may be borne by a whole community with more convenience than the ſame can be borne by a part only; as that a large beam of timber can be borne by 20 men, each bearing in proportion to his ſtrength, better than by 10 only who are cruſhed by the weight, whilſt the other 10 bear nothing, or perhaps ſome of them <hi>hang on and increaſe</hi> the weight. The 10 who are cruſhed and overſtrained will be rendered unfit <hi>to bear any burden</hi> in future time, and of courſe their future ſervices will be <hi>loſt</hi> to the community; whereas if the whole 20 bore each his due proportion, it might be a heavy lift in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but none of them would be <hi>overſtrained,</hi> and they would all be <hi>fit</hi> for future ſervice.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Our currency is in ſuch a feeble</hi> and <hi>fluctuating ſtate, that the ends and uſes of it are much decayed, and in a manner loſt; it ceaſes</hi> to be a certain <hi>ſecurity</hi> to the poſſeſſor of any <hi>determinate value,</hi> and of courſe cannot be a common mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of value for other things; ſo that it becomes impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to calculate or carry on our <hi>private buſineſs</hi> or <hi>public ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> with this medium, and of courſe both muſt ceaſe, or be greatly impaired by this miſchief.</p>
            <p>This may be eaſily and ſpeedily remedied by taxes; for if every bill of our currency was a <hi>Turkiſh turban,</hi> we might eaſily ſet any price on it we pleaſed, and make the demand quick at that price, in this way; for was an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate tax made, and ſpeedily and rigidly preſſed, obliging every man to pay a turban or 10 dollars into the public treaſury, it is manifeſt the price of a <hi>turban</hi> would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be 10 <hi>dollars,</hi> and the demand quick at that price. For the ſame reaſon, we may raiſe the value and demand for our currency to any pitch or degree we pleaſe, in the ſame way, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by making a tax for any ſufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>um of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023972_0109_0FC2B5A2C1C87778"/>
continental dollars, or the value in hard money, at any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change we pleaſe to fix. This would immediately raiſe the continental money up to that exchange, if the tax was large enough, and ſufficiently preſſed.</p>
            <p>Indeed we manifeſtly have it in our power to increaſe the demand and value of our currency to a much <hi>higher degree</hi> in this way, than either the fixing the currency or the <hi>public exigencies</hi> require. This is a matter that requires great judgment and nicety of obſervation. Some may think there may be danger of oppreſſion here; but I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer there is neither danger nor poſſibility of oppreſſion, if the exchange is not fixed higher or lower than the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent exchange or <hi>real preſent</hi> value, nor more money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired than is neceſſary for the public uſe, and the States apportion the tax on their people properly according to their ſeveral abilities; all which ought to be very carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; and if any part is not <hi>done right,</hi> the fault will lie on <hi>thoſe that do it,</hi> but not at all on <hi>the principle</hi> here advanced.</p>
            <p>But before we quit this idea, I beg leave to add one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation more here, <abbr>viz.</abbr> every honeſt individual, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>loſes more</hi> in a year by the preſent fluctuating ſtate of our currency, and the preſent mode of procuring the public ſupplies, than his <hi>whole tax</hi> would amount to; he <hi>loſes his buſineſs</hi> on which the ſupport of himſelf and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depends, and muſt live on his dead ſtock, or at leaſt is ſubjected to moſt material diſadvantage and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for I ſubmit it to every man to judge, whether any man, either in the occupation of <hi>huſbandry, mechanic arts, or merchandiſe,</hi> can compute his buſineſs in ſuch a manner, as to make it ſafe to put his <hi>whole ſtock in action</hi> in any of theſe ways, while he has no <hi>reaſonable aſſurance</hi> what the produce of his diligence may be, or whether he may have <hi>the ſelling</hi> his produce, fabrics, or merchandiſe, when he has procured them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>occupations of life</hi> are of ſuch <hi>great</hi> importance to every man, that it is manifeſt that even ſmall embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in them, involve a <hi>damage much greater</hi> than any man's <hi>tax would be</hi> to the whole expenditures of the war.
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023972_0110_0FC2B5B2E64F05A8"/>
This opens to our view another actual circumſtance, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fact, which is too obvious to be overlooked, and too ſerious and intereſting to be neglected, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>The whole ſources of our ſupplies are dying away faſt, are leſſening to an alarming degree, and threaten not a mere ſcarcity, but univerſal famine, want, and deficiency in a ſhort time.</hi> Moſt people are <hi>leſſening the buſineſs</hi> of their ſeveral occupations down to a pitch juſt ſufficient for their preſent occaſions and neceſſities, and many have wholly <hi>thrown up</hi> their occupations, and live on their <hi>dead ſtock,</hi> and very few are calculating their buſineſs on any <hi>large ſcale.</hi> I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of this to common obſervation. The preſent <hi>great demand</hi> for merchandiſe, fabrics, and the farmers' produce, which would be the <hi>ſharpeſt ſpur</hi> of induſtry, were our public counſels wiſe, and our currency good, now becomes the <hi>terror of the poſſeſſors,</hi> and induces them to <hi>hide and conceal</hi> their effects, inſtead of <hi>expoſing them in open market:</hi> our public acts (for taking ſupplies by <hi>force)</hi> demonſtrate this, for ſuch acts are always ſuppoſed to <hi>be ſuited to the circumſtances of the times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a direct and manifeſt conſequence of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs inſtances of <hi>force</hi> and <hi>fraud</hi> which have been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed to <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>cheat</hi> the poſſeſſors out of their goods. Theſe methods are in every view mad, wicked, and abſurd; <hi>mad</hi> in thoſe who do not ſee the conſequences of them; <hi>wicked</hi> in thoſe who do ſee them; and <hi>abſurd</hi> in both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by their natural operation they ſoon <hi>defeat and deſtroy the very ends</hi> for which they are adopted, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>mending the currency,</hi> and <hi>procuring ſupplies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Creator has not given to all men equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; ſome politicians are ſhort-ſighted, and cannot ſee the <hi>diſtant</hi> ill conſequences of meaſures which yield a <hi>preſent advantage,</hi> but he muſt be a <hi>ſtupid blockhead</hi> who cannot ſee ſuch effects when they <hi>ſtare him in the face,</hi> and ſtand in full fact <hi>before his eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proper remedy of theſe terrible miſchiefs is to lay the public burden equally on all by taxes; this is eaſier, more reaſonable, and more ſafe for the community, than to ſuffer it to reſt upon a few. The burden muſt be borne
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023972_0111_0FC2B5B3DA2A6510"/>
by the community in ſome way; the ſupplies and ſervices cannot be procured for nothing; we have too lately tried it out and out, and have full proof that <hi>ſomething</hi> cannot be paid for with <hi>nothing,</hi> and therefore if ſomething is to be paid for, it is vain and ridiculous to be caſting about, and ſtarting and chaſing one <hi>viſionary project</hi> after another, of <hi>new emiſſions and better emiſſions,</hi> of <hi>loans foreign and domeſtic,</hi> &amp;c. We muſt recur to <hi>ſolid wealth</hi> to pay for all our <hi>ſolid ſupplies.</hi> The nature of the ſubject will drive us to this at laſt, and the longer we put it off, the longer our miſeries will increaſe; and God grant that we may not put it off till all remedy is deſperate.</p>
            <p>We muſt at laſt have recourſe to the ſolid wealth of the States, and every individual muſt be called on for his ſhare. In this there can be no reaſon of complaint; the <hi>cry of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> will ceaſe; that <hi>demand</hi> will be given to our curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which <hi>is eſſential to its nature and uſe;</hi> and every poſſeſſor of ſupplies will haſten to offer them: this will ſtimulate the induſtry of men of all occupations, and fill our country with virtue and plenty. But it may be objected here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our old currency is got ſo much out of repute, that it cannot be reformed, but may be <hi>called in,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed with a <hi>new and better one.</hi> I anſwer, all that ails the old currency is, that it is not, it carries not in it, a ſufficient <hi>certain ſecurity</hi> of any determinate value to the poſſeſſor; and this ſame thing will all the <hi>new currency</hi> or <hi>any currency</hi> we can make, unleſs we can <hi>mend the public faith</hi> on which it depends, and <hi>connect</hi> it ſo manifeſtly and firmly with the <hi>real wealth</hi> of the States, that the <hi>ſecurity may be undoubted.</hi> It is impoſſible this can be done by any thing but payment, either preſent or ſo ſecured, that there will remain no doubt in the mind of the poſſeſſor that it will be <hi>bona fide</hi> made. If this can be done, there is no doubt but we may make our currency good, yea, better than hard money, becauſe it is <hi>ſooner counted,</hi> and more <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conveyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is indeed one reaſon for calling in the old curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and iſſuing a new one, which appears to me to have real and great weight, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Many of the bills of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023972_0112_0FC2B5B55FEAA780"/>
currency are <hi>counterfeited,</hi> and it is very neceſſary the public ſhould be freed from theſe impoſitions; and to this another may be added, <abbr>viz.</abbr> It would be very deſirable to have a currency which ſhould <hi>expreſs the true value</hi> of the bills in <hi>the face of them.</hi> The preſent bills carry but a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part</hi> of the value expreſſed <hi>in their face;</hi> and this holds out the <hi>feeble, enervated,</hi> and <hi>debilitated ſtate of our public credit</hi> in ſo glaring a light, and publiſhes our <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>diſtreſs</hi> ſo very undeniably and univerſally, that I ſhould be willing to have them out of ſight; as people generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep out of view, <hi>brands</hi> and <hi>marks</hi> which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>diſgrace</hi> of their families.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is a ſort of deception in the bills, which I conceive to be hurtful; when a man gets a great bundle of them, he is apt to be cheated in ſpite of the convictions of his own heart, into an opinion that he is <hi>richer</hi> than he is, and of courſe to <hi>abate</hi> a little of that <hi>economy</hi> which he would think neceſſary if his mind was not <hi>dilated</hi> by that deluſion; whilſt, on the other hand, the taxes appear more <hi>heavy</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> when heightened under the enormous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of the currency, than they would do were they offered and demanded in <hi>a ſhape</hi> that correſponded to their real value.</p>
            <p>Theſe may perhaps by general conſent be allowed good reaſons for calling in the preſent bills and iſſuing new ones, and this may be well enough, if the mode and regulations of the meaſure are limited to its uſes.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>ſubſtance is yet wanting,</hi> every thing neceſſary to give <hi>fixture</hi> to the currency is <hi>ſtill to be done,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> remains to be done, and will remain ſo, till we can <hi>fix the funds</hi> of our currency ſo ſure as to make it a <hi>certain ſecurity of real value</hi> to the poſſeſſor, and call it in ſo faſt by taxes as to <hi>limit its quantity</hi> within the uſes of circulation, and prevent its increaſing to ſuch amount as to render the <hi>final redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion difficult, improbable,</hi> or <hi>uncertain.</hi> This is the grand gift of the whole matter; this will effectually <hi>ſave</hi> us; <hi>leſs</hi> than this <hi>will not;</hi> all the <hi>reſt</hi> is but ſhifting the weights in the ſcale, without adding a ſingle ounce to help a balance or preponderation; this therefore is our great object, from
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:023972_0113_0FC2B5B6D3D78378"/>
which our attention muſt <hi>not be diverted,</hi> no, not <hi>for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> on this our <hi>fate</hi> depends.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be further objected, that no nation of <hi>Europe</hi> can carry on a war without loans, or ſome way anticipating their revenue, and running in debt, and how can it be ſuppoſed that we can do it otherwiſe? I anſwer, their caſe differs from ours very materially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have <hi>credit to borrow on,</hi> which we have not, unleſs we allow ſuch a ruinous diſcount as makes our affairs deſperate, and muſt ſoon put it out of our power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our liberty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our country is <hi>richer,</hi> more full of <hi>men and ſtores</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in war, than thoſe of <hi>Europe</hi> in general, and of courſe the carrying on the war without running in debt is more practicable by us, than by them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have ſuch ſure and eſtabliſhed <hi>ſyſtems of finance fixed and ſettled,</hi> on which they can iſſue internal bills, as furniſh a <hi>certain ſecurity</hi> to the poſſeſſor, of payment; their treaſuries are the ſafeſt repoſitories of their nation's wealth; we have not theſe advantages, our treaſury has hitherto proved the <hi>deſtruction of the wealth</hi> that has been <hi>truſted to it,</hi> and of courſe every body is afraid of it, and therefore loaning at home to any great amount is impracticable, and what <hi>cannot be done</hi> need not be urged as <hi>politic, eligible</hi> or <hi>ſalutary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. If any nation of <hi>Europe</hi> borrows ſpecie, and thereby <hi>increaſes</hi> and of courſe <hi>depreciates</hi> their caſh but 2 or 3 per cent. that diſcount is enough <hi>to ſpread it all over Europe,</hi> by which the balance is ſoon reſtored, and the depreciation is checked; or if any nation, as <hi>Spain,</hi> imports money from <hi>Peru,</hi> and makes it over plenty and of reduced value, it ſpreads over <hi>Europe</hi> directly; and ſo by covering a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſurface the depreciation becomes inſenſible, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience little felt; but this is not the caſe with us; <hi>our currency cannot be exported,</hi> were it ever ſo good, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, any increaſe of quantity muſt have its full effect by way of depreciation among ourſelves; and of courſe any <hi>increaſe of the quantity</hi> deſtroys at once the very end and uſe of ſuch increaſe, as the <hi>value</hi> cannot be thereby <hi>increaſed,</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="unknown:023972_0114_0FC2B5B844284CF0"/>
but inſtead of this, the whole deluge of miſchiefs ariſing from a fluctuating currency muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low in upon us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The very <hi>operation of this method of loaning, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating</hi> of the revenue, adopted and practiſed by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe,</hi> is in itſelf enough, were it ever ſo practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable by us, to deter us from following ſo <hi>fatal an example.</hi> See Great-Britain enervated and benumbed under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of an enormous debt, the very intereſt of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the beſt part of the richeſt revenue which the wealth, induſtry, and oppreſſion of the nation can produce. How diſheartening muſt it be for that people to ſtruggle thro' the year merely to pay a corroding intereſt, which brings them <hi>not the nearer</hi> to the end of their miſery, but only <hi>keeps alive that gnawing vulture</hi> that muſt <hi>for ever</hi> feed on their very entrails. I cannot but wonder that any man in his ſenſes ſhould hold up ſuch a ſad ſpectacle for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the <hi>Americans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The nations of <hi>Europe</hi> never attempt to borrow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, till they have firſt <hi>raiſed all the revenue they can within themſelves,</hi> and find it not ſufficient; but this is ſo far from our caſe, that we have <hi>never yet taxed half enough</hi> to drain off that ſurpluſage of money which the war has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our capital diſtreſſes and difficulties have all along ariſen from that <hi>flood of money</hi> which made it <hi>too plenty</hi> for uſe; even <hi>hard money</hi> will buy little more <hi>than half</hi> ſo much country produce as it would purchaſe before the war.</p>
            <p>This miſchief cannot be remedied by <hi>increaſe of the quantity,</hi> by loans or any other way, but muſt in its nature be checked by <hi>draining off</hi> and <hi>leſſening that quantity,</hi> and thereby raiſing the demand for it which is eſſential to its uſe. From all this it appears to be weak and ſilly as well as abſurd, to urge for our imitation the example of other nations, the very convenience, neceſſity, or even practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of which depends on circumſtances which do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply at all to our caſe.</p>
            <p>It is not the leaſt danger of this practice that it <hi>operates inſenſibly,</hi> ſaps and mortgages our wealth before we know it; it operates like a <hi>ſlow poiſon,</hi> which is certain death, and more painful, tho' more ſlow and lingering, than the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:023972_0115_0FC2B5D0897E7B20"/>
               <hi>ſudden execution</hi> of the ball or ſword. Indeed I look on all <hi>inſenſible taxes</hi> to be highly dangerous; a fatal <hi>inſtance of which</hi> we have in the <hi>depreciation</hi> of our own currency. I think it neceſſary that the people ſhould <hi>ſee and feel</hi> what they pay, ſhould earn the money before it is ſpent; this would prevent a thouſand <hi>ſtupid, fooliſh,</hi> and <hi>needleſs ways of ſpending the public money;</hi> this would make the rulers careful how they adopt any <hi>expenſive operations,</hi> and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſtricteſt <hi>economy</hi> in the expenditure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſenſible taxes</hi> are like <hi>inſenſible perſpiration,</hi> which <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> the body, and <hi>waſtes</hi> the conſtitution before the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient knows he is ſick. Nature generally marks places of danger with ſignals of notice, and every mariner looks on one ſunken rock as more dangerous than twenty that are above water; for this reaſon I think that every branch of the revenue ſhould originate in ſuch ſenſible and viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on the wealth of the people, that they may all feel and know <hi>what they pay,</hi> and what they <hi>pay it for;</hi> and this is, in my opinion, the ſureſt way to keep a <hi>treaſury al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſupplied</hi> with enough by the cheerful contributions of the people, when the public ſafety or convenience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, and to prevent <hi>more than enough</hi> being ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or granted: a due attention to both theſe I take to be no ſmall <hi>branch</hi> or even <hi>pillar of policy</hi> in every ſtate. The foregoing ſurvey of our miſchiefs and remedies brings up to view another circumſtance which appears to me a very plain fact, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>IV. Our diſtreſſes, dangers, and difficulties do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a <hi>want of any thing,</hi> but in <hi>over plenty,</hi> in ſurpluſage of caſh, which is become ſo common and eaſy of acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is ſlighted, it is little thought of, it is ſcarce an object of <hi>deſire,</hi> much leſs of <hi>animation;</hi> our burdens are burdens <hi>of caſh,</hi> that which is the <hi>wiſh</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of moſt other diſtreſſed people is <hi>our miſery;</hi> like plethoric conſtitutions, whoſe <hi>ſtamina are all good,</hi> but are <hi>overloaded</hi> with too much blood. A ſufficient bleeding, a proper <hi>draining off</hi> of this ſuperfluous matter, would ſet us all right in a ſhort time, and every part of the conſtitution would find <hi>eaſe, relief,</hi> and a <hi>ſpeedy return of life</hi> and <hi>vigor</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:023972_0116_0FC2B5D292AFE3C8"/>
from the ſimple operation of this moſt obvious, natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. On the whole matter, I think that one more fact offers itſelf to view, which were we in a <hi>leſs torpid ſtate,</hi> might animate us to ſome ſpirited efforts, ſome lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions to extricate ourſelves from diſtreſs and danger, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>V. Every circumſtance conſpires to demonſtrate that the <hi>moſt ſure and effectual remedies are in our own power,</hi> are <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practicable, and the preſent time</hi> is the <hi>moſt ſuitable for the application of them</hi> that any nation in diſtreſs ever had or could wiſh. We are <hi>free of debt,</hi> at leaſt of the <hi>preſſures</hi> of debt; the whole public debt at home and abroad does not exceed our abilities, and may be paid in two or three years without any painful exertions. We are yet <hi>on this ſide of that bottomleſs abyſs of debt,</hi> into which our enemies find themſelves plunged; that inſupportable but everlaſting burden that preſſes and exhauſts them in ſo fatal a manner, that they are become the ſport of their enemies and neglect of their friends; none appears for them in this their day of diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>This <hi>enervating, diſheartening circumſtance we are yet free of;</hi> our ſtrength is <hi>our own,</hi> and in proper condition for uſe; we are yet to receive the fruits of our own labors; none of our crops are mortgaged or ſold before they are reaped; our wealth is entire; our country abounds with moſt of the ſupplies and ſtores we need; we have no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty but in the <hi>diſorders of our finances,</hi> and they are not only <hi>capable of being reſtored,</hi> but <hi>ſelf-preſervation will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us to it.</hi> We are like a ſtrong man who is obliged to labor, but the labor required is but juſt enough to afford that degree of exerciſe which is abſolutely neceſſary <hi>to his health,</hi> and which he muſt practiſe or <hi>be ſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>kind and degree of exertion</hi> neceſſary to reſtore our <hi>currency,</hi> reinſtate our <hi>finances,</hi> eſtabliſh our <hi>credit,</hi> and animate the <hi>induſtry</hi> of our people, will at the ſame time pay our <hi>civil liſt,</hi> and <hi>carry on the war.</hi> Our enemies are in a declining ſtate, under great degrees of embarraſſment, and have their hands full in every quarter, and every body <hi>againſt them;</hi> whilſt we <hi>are courted,</hi> like the riſing ſun, by
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023972_0117_0FC2B5D4085FA958"/>
every body; our alliances and connexions are of the ſureſt and beſt kind, grounded on <hi>ſuch intereſts</hi> as cannot deceive us; a general <hi>union</hi> prevails among ourſelves; our public <hi>counſels</hi> are all dictated by the <hi>ſame views</hi> and ends, and if ever we differ, it is only about the <hi>means</hi> of obtaining the <hi>ſame end;</hi> our relief indeed requires the animated exertions of our people, but the very diſtreſs they all feel, makes them willing to put into vigorous practice, any efforts which tend to their deliverance.</p>
            <p>Here I beg leave to call the reader's attention to the <hi>act of Congreſs of the</hi> 18<hi>th of March</hi> 1780, reſpecting our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that we may, on the beſt examination, judge how far that important act, if duly executed, will reduce our finances into ſuch method, and give them ſuch eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment as the public ſafety requires. It is neceſſary that the nature, deſign, and uſe of that act ſhould be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcuſſed, becauſe the efforts for its execution will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably take their tone from the degree of conviction which generally prevails of its utility.<note n="*" place="bottom">

I do not pretend to be adequate to ſuch a diſcuſſion, and ſhall only beg leave to make a few remarks on it; and this I am induced to do at this time, becauſe the act is but lately publiſhed, and our people have not had time to make up their minds on it, and I conceive many perſons miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the real deſign and true conſtruction of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I take it that the deſign of the act <hi>is not to be a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for taxes;</hi> our public <hi>credit or finances</hi> want the ſame <hi>ſupport and ſupplies from our real ſubſtance, our material wealth, as they did before the act.</hi> If the <hi>new bills</hi> are no better ſupported than the <hi>old ones</hi> were, they will <hi>depreciate</hi> as faſt, become as <hi>uſeleſs</hi> and more <hi>ruinous</hi> than thoſe, as theſe involve us in a vaſt debt of <hi>intereſt,</hi> which thoſe did not. The paſt error of our finances is clearly ſeen, and the deluge of miſchiefs reſulting from it is ſeverely felt, and the deſign of this act is not to <hi>continue</hi> but <hi>prevent</hi> thoſe miſchiefs in future, not to <hi>repeat</hi> our former error, but to <hi>mend</hi> it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The act contains in it <hi>a declaration or fixture of the preſent value</hi> or <hi>exchange</hi> of the <hi>public bills,</hi> making them redeemable at 40 <hi>for</hi> 1, or 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, and this on the <hi>higheſt reaſon,</hi> grounded on ſuch <hi>rigid facts,</hi> ſuch real change of circumſtances, as render the <hi>fulfilment of the promiſes</hi> contained in <hi>the old bills, impracticable, injurious</hi> to the public, <hi>abſurd,</hi> and <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> as I think I have fully prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Fourth Eſſay; and all <hi>clamor</hi> and exclamation on this ſubject is as <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>void of reaſon and ſentiment,</hi> as a clamor againſt any other promiſe, which, however proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made at firſt, is become, by a change of circumſtances, either <hi>impoſſible</hi> or <hi>highly improper to be performed,</hi> of which we have daily inſtances in every part of human experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

               </gap>ider <hi>the depreciation</hi> of our currency as a <hi>public calamity,</hi> like a <hi>blaſt,</hi> a <hi>deluge,</hi> a <hi>drought,</hi> or <hi>ravages</hi> of an enemy, which affect every man as he happens to <hi>ſtand</hi> in their way, and to become their object; in all theſe caſes the <hi>miſchief muſt lie where it lights;</hi> it is doubtleſs ſo directed by Divine Providence, that each individual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that degree of correction from it, which is ſuited to his own particular caſe.</p>
            <p>In point of remedy, it is vain to inquire whether this <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity aroſe from the public neceſſity,</hi> or from the <hi>fault</hi> of any <hi>individuals</hi> or <hi>boards</hi> of our policy; for could we <hi>find</hi> and <hi>puniſh</hi> the faulty delinquents, their <hi>heads or gibbets</hi> might hang up <hi>in terrorem,</hi> as monuments of caution to <hi>future financiers,</hi> but can <hi>avail nothing to the eaſement</hi> of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; our duty at preſent, and all we can do is, to <hi>correct</hi> the miſchief in time, and <hi>prevent</hi> it in future.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is objected to this act, that it <hi>doubles the quantity</hi> of circulating bills, becauſe it iſſues 2 <hi>dollars out</hi> for 1 that is <hi>brought in,</hi> for 10,000,000 <hi>of the new bills</hi> are equal to 400,000,000 <hi>of the old ones,</hi> at the exchange of 40 for 1, preſcribed in the act itſelf; that this will <hi>claſh with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſolution</hi> (of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1, 1779) "that the quantity of bills ſhould not be increaſed <hi>beyond</hi> 200,000,000;" will tend to a <hi>depreciation;</hi> and render the <hi>fixing</hi> the medium more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, if not impoſſible. But I beg leave to obſerve here, that few laws would be ſalutary, or even tolerable, if they were executed up to the height of their letter; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a prudent execution of this act will obviate all the ill effects ariſing from the above objections.</p>
            <p>I do not conceive it to be the deſign of Congreſs that <hi>any part of the new bills ſhall iſſue at all,</hi> if it ſhall be found that it cannot be done <hi>at their full value,</hi> without <hi>any depreciation;</hi> or that they ſhall iſſue <hi>any faſter,</hi> or to any <hi>larger amount</hi> than can be done, without any <hi>depreciation;</hi> for I can by no means admit the ſuppoſition, that the new bills are to be iſſued in <hi>a depreciated ſtate,</hi> becauſe that very depreciation <hi>defeats their uſe,</hi> renders them inſufficient for the procurement of ſupplies, and involves us over again in the <hi>miſeries of a fluctuating currency,</hi> whilſt we are at the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023972_0120_0FC2B5D8AF68D740"/>
ſame time loaded with a vaſt debt of hard money <hi>to pay the intereſt of them.</hi> I never doubted the integrity of Congreſs, and therefore cannot attribute to them ſuch abſurdity of deſign, even tho' the letter of their act might admit ſuch a ruinous and abſurd conſtruction.</p>
            <p>They reſerve, in their act, 4, <hi>tenths of the new bills for their own diſpoſal,</hi> which they will doubtleſs <hi>iſſue in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſafe</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> to the States; whilſt the other 6 <hi>tenths</hi> are left to the diſcretion of the States, who have every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to a <hi>prudent iſſue of them,</hi> as each ſtate will ſtand bound to redeem both principal and intereſt of all they ſhall iſſue.</p>
            <p>I am further told, that the Congreſs have it in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation <hi>to appoint a Financier-General, of known gravity, judgment, and economy,</hi> to <hi>ſuperintend</hi> this great department, who can either <hi>let out</hi> or <hi>withhold</hi> the iſſues in ſuch manner as to give the bills all the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> their nature will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, without <hi>overloading</hi> the public credit, or <hi>increaſing the quantity</hi> ſo far as to <hi>leſſen their demand,</hi> and, by that means, <hi>loſe the whole benefit</hi> by graſping at too much. This error is ſo fatal and recent, and the apprehenſions of the people <hi>wound up to ſuch a pitch of alarm,</hi> that I much doubt if <hi>half</hi> the propoſed quantity of the new bills can be iſſued <hi>without a ſenſible depreciation;</hi> but experience will beſt ſhow this, and prudence at the time muſt dictate the <hi>practicable degree</hi> which may be ventured on; and it is my opinion, that no poſſible height of public neceſſity can <hi>juſtify exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch degree,</hi> becauſe that exceſs is a ſure way to defeat the uſes of the currency, and of courſe to increaſe the public neceſſities, let them be ever ſo high before.</p>
            <p>The exchange is a ſure barometer of the public credit, as it is of the trade, and will always ſerve as a ſafe moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and guide to our counſels of revenue. It is the <hi>vaineſt of all vanities</hi> to imagine that a public bill is <hi>worth a dollar</hi> when it <hi>will not bring it,</hi> or that it is <hi>worth any more than it will bring.</hi> If it ſhall be ſound on trial that any larger ſum than I have ſuppoſed, or that the whole 10,000,000 can be iſſued without depreciation, the public may ſafely receive the benefit of the whole; and the addition of the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:023972_0121_0FC2B5F49C433AC0"/>
intereſt, which will be received by every individual that holds the bills, will compenſate for the increaſe of his taxes to pay it.</p>
            <p>This matter cannot be computed on with any exactneſs, without knowing the <hi>whole amount of the current caſh of the Thirteen States,</hi> which I have not yet ſeen any where aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained. I have heretofore on a few data made a ſort of looſe, rough computation of it, to be about 12,000,000 <hi>of hard dollars;</hi> but I have of late been collecting documents for a more exact calculation, and on a nearer view am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe the amount will rather fall <hi>ſhort of that ſum,</hi> and perhaps very conſiderably; and I think farther, it is very manifeſt that we muſt have a <hi>promiſcuous circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of both <hi>hard money</hi> and <hi>paper,</hi> in order to keep the <hi>exchange of them equal:</hi> but this by the bye.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It may be further objected to this act, that we can have no ſecurity that <hi>ſome neceſſity or other</hi> will not be urged next year to make a <hi>further addition to the emiſſions</hi> of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating bills, till they <hi>will depreciate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in anſwer to this, I am clearly of opinion, Congreſs will not be able to iſſue <hi>the whole</hi> 10,000,000 already voted <hi>without a depreciation;</hi> and alſo, that they will not dare to iſſue <hi>any of it in a depreciated ſtate;</hi> this will ſo manifeſtly and immediately <hi>ruin the uſe of the whole,</hi> and defeat its <hi>whole purpoſe,</hi> and bring on afreſh the miſchiefs of a <hi>fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating currency,</hi> that I can have no idea that any men in their ſenſes can think of adopting it.</p>
            <p>But if we are to ſuppoſe our wiſeſt men capable of ſuch <hi>idle frenzy,</hi> it is needleſs to reaſon any further about it, we may as well give up <hi>all uſe of our intellects,</hi> and follow where wild diſtraction roves, and take the fate which a concourſe of <hi>whim and accident</hi> ſhall provide for us: but I augur better things; I am full of expectation that before our affairs come to this paſs, our wiſeſt men, both in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and State-Aſſemblies, will be convinced of one great truth, dictated by nature and our preſent circumſtances, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that we muſt pay our expenditures as we go:</hi> and this is the only practicable method before us; this will make any ſcheme good, which is not wretched indeed, and without
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023972_0122_0FC2B5F5EAAD2FA8"/>
this, every deviſable ſcheme is but whim, viſion, and frenzy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſum of 10,000,000 is not more than the States are able to make <hi>the moſt ſufficient</hi> and <hi>undoubted ſecurity for,</hi> if they pleaſe. But let that ſecurity be ever ſo good; to give it a currency, and prevent a depreciation, they muſt raiſe a demand for it by general taxes. Theſe are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Congreſs in their act of the 18th inſtant, and others foregoing; and were they put under rigid col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection by all the States, we might judge whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thereby raiſed was ſufficient to give life and uſe to the currency; if it ſhould not be ſo, it is neceſſary that the taxes be ſtill increaſed till that effect ſhall appear, at which time, and not before, the grand point will be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that of fixing our currency. We ſhall then have the two great things neceſſary to fix any paper currency, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>good funds,</hi> which may give the poſſeſſor a certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and a <hi>quick demand</hi> and circulation of the currency itſelf.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It appears then, that if the ſaid act was put into proper and wiſe execution, duly limited and ſufficiently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, it will anſwer the great and important ends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it; and tho' it may not be thought the <hi>beſt poſſible,</hi> yet as it appears to be ſufficient for its purpoſe, were it duly put into operation, and properly ſupported, I think it clear that the States ought not to <hi>heſitate adopting</hi> it, nor <hi>ſtarve</hi> it by too languid and dilatory movements; the beſt plan poſſible may be rendered uſeleſs and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al this way; wiſdom and deciſion in counſel are not more neceſſary in any important plans of this ſort, than vigor in execution.</p>
            <p>I do not conſider the act ſo much a ſcheme of increaſing the revenue as of fixing the currency; but if it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude both, the firſt certainly depends on the <hi>laſt,</hi> and <hi>is limited by it;</hi> for Congreſs cannot think of iſſuing any part of the new bills in a depreciated ſtate; they muſt fix their value, or it is idle, dangerous, and ineffectual to the laſt degree to iſſue them; if they can be iſſued in a fixed ſtate, yet no more of them can be iſſued than can be kept
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023972_0123_0FC2B6068FD256B8"/>
in a fixed ſtate; for to exceed this limit, will be to deſtroy their whole uſe at once, and involve us in more diſtreſs than before. I look on it a <hi>very bold ſtep</hi> to put the revenue on ſuch <hi>a riſk;</hi> but I ſuppoſe the public neceſſities require it, and of this the Congreſs are the beſt judges, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs acted on more reaſons than we out of doors can ſee.</p>
            <p>The fixing the currency, and <hi>incomes of revenue</hi> are of of the laſt conſequence to us all in the preſent criſis; and therefore it appears to me abſolutely neceſſary that every State ſhould exert themſelves in the moſt ſpeedy and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner to give ſanction and force to this act, leſt, by their defect, the important chance ſhould turn againſt us, and we ſhould be left without revenue or currency at this critical time, when our <hi>political exiſtence,</hi> as well as the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation</hi> and <hi>means of living</hi> of every individual, <hi>depend on both.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In my Fourth Eſſay on Trade and Finance, publiſhed <hi>Feb.</hi> 10, 1780<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I calculated the exchange of Continental money at that time to be 40 for 1, and ſtrongly urged the <hi>fixture</hi> of it at that exchange, that the fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of a <hi>fluctuating</hi> currency, either by appreciation or depreciation, might be avoided.</p>
                  <p>From this I ſuppoſe that ſome people have ſurmiſed that the <hi>firſt idea and original plan</hi> of this act was <hi>formed</hi> by me and <hi>ſuggeſted</hi> to Congreſs, and my opinion here expreſſed, "that the States ought to adopt it without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," confirms their conjecture: this induces me to obſerve ſome things on this matter, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This act was not the abſurd, inefficient, and ridiculous thing, which ſome people have repreſented it to be; there was <hi>no error in its principle;</hi> it wanted nothing to complete its purpoſes but <hi>decided ſupport</hi> and <hi>effectual execution.</hi> The <hi>taxes then inſtituted</hi> by Congreſs, with the arrearages of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer requiſitions, would have been (if punctually paid) ſufficient to <hi>call in every bill</hi> of the old money, and a <hi>large ſum</hi> of the <hi>new bills,</hi> in the courſe of one year, and would doubtleſs have raiſed ſuch a demand for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, as would have <hi>kept up its value,</hi> and prevented any depreciation.</p>
                  <p>Yet, 2d, I did <hi>not approve</hi> of it, but in all converſations I had with Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs, whilſt it was under debate, I conſtantly <hi>oppoſed it;</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally becauſe I did not expect, as the ſtate of things then was, that it would receive that <hi>ſupport and vigorous execution</hi> which was neceſſary to give it a due effect.</p>
                  <p>The people of the States at that time had been worried and fretted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed and put out of humor by ſo many <hi>tender-acts, limitations of prices,</hi> and other <hi>compulſory methods to force value into paper money,</hi> and <hi>compel the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of it,</hi> and by ſo many vain <hi>funding ſchemes, declarations,</hi> and <hi>promiſes,</hi> all which iſſued from Congreſs, but <hi>died under the moſt zealous efforts to put them into operation</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> that their patience was all exhauſted; I ſay, theſe <hi>irritations</hi> and <hi>diſappointments</hi> had ſo deſtroyed the <hi>courage</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> of the people, that they appeared <hi>heartleſs</hi> and almoſt <hi>ſtupid</hi> when their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was called to any <hi>new propoſitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, I had objections to ſeveral clauſes of the act, <abbr>viz.</abbr> our people were pretty well accuſtomed to the old bills (bad as they were) but to <hi>call them all in,</hi> and ſubſtitute <hi>a new ſort</hi> in their ſtead, I thought would be a <hi>novelty</hi> that might have danger in it; at leaſt, it would require great <hi>expenſe, time,</hi> &amp;c. and all to very little uſe or benefit; for the <hi>ſame ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of taxation</hi> abſolutely neceſſary to <hi>ſupport the credit of the new bills,</hi> would be quite ſufficient to make <hi>

                        </gap> for the old ones</hi> as would prevent their further <hi>depreciation,</hi> and receiving hard money in their ſtead at 40 for 1. would prevent their <hi>appreciation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could not ſee any benefit in <hi>the ſignature of the States,</hi> and feared this might bring <hi>into doubt</hi> the full <hi>powers</hi> of Congreſs to iſſue bills, or do any other like acts under their <hi>own ſignature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor could I ſee any advantage ariſing from the <hi>intereſt</hi> annexed to the bills; it being payable <hi>ſix years afterwards</hi> would create mighty little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to their <hi>preſent</hi> circulation; but if the bills ſucceeded, this would greatly <hi>increaſe the price</hi> of their <hi>final</hi> redemption.</p>
                  <p>But I had another material objection to the act; for when I calculated the exchange, <hi>Feb.</hi> 10, 1780, it was really 40 to 1; but when this act paſſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the 18th of <hi>March</hi> following, the exchange had increaſed to 60 for 1, and conſequently, all the proviſions of the act which related to the exchange, became eſſentially wrong, and of courſe rendered the act itſelf utterly impracticable, without new proviſions conformable to the exchange which really exiſted at the time, or making all the requiſitions of the act in hard money or Continental bills of the ſame value, <hi>i. e.</hi> at any exchange that ſhould exiſt at the time of payment.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding all this, when the bill was actually <hi>paſt,</hi> and the <hi>revenues and ſupplies</hi> of the year depended on <hi>its ſucceſs,</hi> I readily offered my little mite of aid to give it an effectual operation, as I ſuppoſe any Member of Congreſs would and ought to do, <hi>when it was paſt,</hi> tho' he oppoſed it in every ſtage, <hi>whilſt under debate.</hi>

To have a currency of fixed value, and the ſame as is expreſſed in the face of the bills, is an object moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and deſirable, but can be obtained in no other way th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The value of money being wholly grounded in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two objects, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the quantity of money, and the objects of money, it is demonſtrable that if either varies, whilſt the other continues the ſame, the proportion muſt vary likewiſe, and of courſe the value of the money muſt fluctuate, as appears moſt plain to any perſon who has the leaſt knowledge of the nature of proportion.</p>

            <p>The nature of money is ſuch, that its quantity cannot be increaſed beyond a certain degree, without loſing its uſe; this has already been far exceeded, and it is not therefore poſſible that our remedy ſhould lie in further increaſes of it, however modified.

            <p>A cool and careful examination of the ſubject will at leaſt let us into the truth of it; and be that truth ever ſo hard and dreadful, our knowing <hi>the worſt</hi> of it, is prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>ſuſpenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things which ſtrike us at firſt as intolerable or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, loſe much of their difficulty and terror by growing familiar to us. Could we have thought it poſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the dreadful war which we have hitherto <hi>ſuſtained,</hi> had it been <hi>held up</hi> to our view five years ago? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy now propoſed is but <hi>trifling</hi> in compariſon of what we <hi>have ſuffered.</hi> And ſhall we ſink diſheartened in ſight of a deſirable ſhore, after we have ſurpaſſed the tempeſts and billows of the ocean thro' the voyage? The remedy I propoſe, is allowed by all to be <hi>effectual and ſufficient,</hi> if it can be practiſed; and we ſhall find it the only one that can ſave us from ruin; at leaſt this is my opinion, after
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:023972_0127_0FC2B61E684D7D58"/>
more than ſix months' cloſe attention to the ſubject, and viewing it in every light in which I can conſider it.</p>
            <p>I conceive, if it ſhould appear that each induſtrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual <hi>loſes more for want of the tax,</hi> than his tax <hi>would amount to,</hi> that every doubt of the expediency of the tax would inſtantly be removed and vaniſh at once; and I think this may be made very clear and plain. I ſhall attempt to prove this.</p>
            <p>I. The tax demanded will amount to about 4 <hi>hard dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> in a year to each perſon in the States, or 20 ſuch dollars, or the value of them, to a middling family of 5 perſons; and this will, by the due apportionment of the tax, be <hi>leſſened</hi> to the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>increaſed</hi> to the <hi>rich,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their abilities. This is the <hi>height</hi> of it; this is the worſt that can happen; this is the <hi>dreadful price</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for our <hi>ſalvation,</hi> to ſave us from ſure deſtruction, and which the Thirteen States are deeply <hi>heſitating</hi> and <hi>contemplating</hi> whether they <hi>will pay or no;</hi> at leaſt this tax is what the <hi>Congreſs</hi> are heſitating to <hi>recommend,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> to <hi>levy</hi> and <hi>collect,</hi> tho' I doubt if the people would heſitate a moment to pay it, if it was put under collection, eſpecially if it was demanded in monthly rates, which would render the payment much more practicable than it would be, if it was all called for at one payment. Now we will conſider what is loſt for want of this tax.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Every induſtrious man loſes his <hi>buſineſs,</hi> his <hi>occupation,</hi> or at leaſt finds it <hi>greatly embarraſſed,</hi> and ſubjected to great difficulty and diſcouragement: for, I ſubmit it to every man to judge, whether, in the preſent <hi>fluctuating ſtate of the currency</hi> and mode of <hi>procuring the public ſupplies,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſay, it can be <hi>ſafe or prudent</hi> for any man to lay out any buſineſs of huſbandry, mechanic arts, or merchandiſe, <hi>on any large ſcale,</hi> whilſt he knows not <hi>what he muſt ſell his proceeds for</hi> when he has got them, or whether he may <hi>have the ſelling of them at all or not?</hi> Theſe embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are very <hi>ſenſibly felt</hi> thro' the States, but would all vaniſh, if our finances were reſtored. And I think it very plain, that a man's occupation muſt be very poor indeed,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:023972_0128_0FC2B626D5F7A458"/>
if theſe embarraſſments are not more <hi>damage</hi> to him, than his <hi>whole tax would amount to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For want of the tax, <hi>the ſupplies of the country are daily leſſening, our plenty waſtes away faſt,</hi> and <hi>ſcarcity</hi> and <hi>want</hi> are ſucceeding in the place of them. This makes every man's eſtate in the country <hi>leſs valuable,</hi> as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that an eſtate in a country of <hi>poverty and want,</hi> is not ſo good, or worth ſo much money, as the ſame eſtate would be in a country <hi>full of riches and plentiful ſupplies. All means of living</hi> will of courſe become harder to be obtained, as it is more difficult procuring ſupplies in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where <hi>they are ſcarce,</hi> than in one where they <hi>are plenty.</hi> What may be the amount of <hi>loſs</hi> to each individual from theſe cauſes, is not eaſy to calculate; but as they affect the <hi>whole bulk of eſtates,</hi> and operate on the <hi>whole means of livelihood,</hi> they cannot be ſuppoſed <hi>ſmall,</hi> and I think will readily be allowed to <hi>exceed</hi> any man's <hi>ſhare</hi> of the <hi>tax</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to <hi>prevent them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. For want of the tax, <hi>the morality and induſtry of the people are greatly diminiſhed. Frauds, cheats,</hi> and <hi>groſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty</hi> are introduced, and a thouſand <hi>idle ways of living</hi> are attempted in the room of that honeſt <hi>induſtry, economy,</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> which heretofore <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>enriched</hi> this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And as an eſtate in a country of <hi>honeſt,</hi> induſtrious people, is better than in one filled with <hi>idle rogues;</hi> and as all property is hereby rendered more unſafe and leſs valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it is very eaſy to ſee, that the <hi>loſs</hi> of each individual in this reſpect, will be very conſiderable, and muſt, on a very moderate computation, much <hi>exceed the tax</hi> required to <hi>remedy the whole miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. For want of the tax, our <hi>trade is decaying faſt;</hi> and this not only ruins the merchant, and renders the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch neceſſaries as are uſually ſupplied by our trade, more dear and difficult, but it <hi>enervates the whole ſyſtem both of huſbandry</hi> and <hi>mechanic arts,</hi> as theſe can never flouriſh <hi>without a market,</hi> where the produce of the farmer and the fabrics of the mechanic may be ſold, when ready for ſale. This affects the whole country in a moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial manner, and muſt at leaſt involve each individual in
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:023972_0129_0FC2B62DF8A115E8"/>
a <hi>loſs</hi> of more than his <hi>tax would amount to,</hi> ſufficient to give a fixed value and uſe to our currency, and thereby reſtore our trade and huſbandry to their former vigor.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For want of the tax our <hi>defence muſt ceaſe,</hi> and we muſt <hi>lie open to the ravages</hi> and <hi>plunders of our enemies;</hi> the very riſk and danger of which involves many diſtreſſes that muſt occaſion <hi>loſs</hi> to every individual, far greater than the whole amount of his tax would be towards ſuch defence as would render the country quite ſafe and ſecure. Add to this, the danger of being finally <hi>overrun</hi> and <hi>conquered</hi> by our enemies, and falling under their unreſtrained power; in which caſe, they would doubtleſs extort <hi>perpetual</hi> taxes from us, to as great amount as are now required for <hi>a ſhort time</hi> to ſecure us againſt their power.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The want of this tax <hi>enervates our laws,</hi> renders their fines, penalties, and forfeitures uncertain and ineffectual; deſtroys the ſalaries, fees, and rewards of our civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious officers, and of courſe prevents men of abilities from ſerving in the character of judge, ſheriff, goſpel-miniſter, ſchoolmaſter, &amp;c. and of courſe the whole <hi>ſyſtem of our civil and religious polity, and education of youth is clearly on the decline</hi> to a very dangerous degree; but as all theſe inſtitutions tend much to the happineſs of ſociety, any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of them muſt greatly <hi>prejudice the value of every eſtate,</hi> and the proſpects of happineſs and utility ariſing from it, to an amount greatly <hi>beyond the tax required</hi> to ſecure all theſe wholeſome inſtitutions in their fulleſt uſe, reſpectabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and general influence.</p>
            <p>I might add here more inſtances of loſs incurred by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals from the fluctuating ſtate of our currency and diſorders of our finances, which would be all remedied by the tax I recommend; but it appears to me, thoſe already adduced are grounded on ſuch obvious and notorious facts, are of ſuch intereſting concern, and of ſuch forcible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that if they do not convince, it is needleſs to offer more on the ſubject; it is vain to <hi>offer arguments</hi> to people who will not give a <hi>ſhilling to ſave a pound;</hi> and yet this is much more than the tax I propoſe, requires, however it may be <hi>aggravated and heightened</hi> by ſtingy, timorous,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023972_0130_0FC2B640FAD6DDC0"/>
or corrupted men, into an <hi>exorbitancy</hi> utterly inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>II. As the money collected by taxes, or other money to the amount will be conſtantly iſſuing, the payment of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy taxes will be rendered as eaſy as the nature of the caſe admits; while at the ſame time the great demand for money occaſioned by the tax, will be ſufficient to keep its value fixed, and its uſes well ſecured and preſerved. The faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of raiſing ſums of money when the circulation is briſk, and the demand quick for goods on hands, is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by any perſon in the leaſt acquainted with trade. This mightily leſſens the burden of the tax below what it would be, if collected in a dull time of buſineſs, and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of caſh, and conſequently the tax itſelf becomes leſs ſenſibly felt under theſe favorable circumſtances of eaſy procurement, than the ſame would be, if deferred to ſome future time, when there might be leſs demand for goods, and greater ſcarcity of caſh; therefore it is the intereſt of every individual to pay his dues to the public whilſt he can do it with the greateſt eaſe, rather than defer it to ſome future time, when he may happen to be called on for it at a juncture when the payment will be more difficult and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing than now.</p>
            <p>III. The price of moſt kinds of country produce is <hi>much higher</hi> than it is uſually in times of general quiet, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the tax may be paid</hi> much <hi>eaſier</hi> now than then; as a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel of wheat, a cow, a ſheep, &amp;c. will bring <hi>much more</hi> now than it will do when quiet is again reſtored, and of courſe ought to be ſold now, that the payment may be made whilſt it can be done with moſt eaſe and advantage; for <hi>what is not paid now muſt lie as a debt</hi> to be paid in future time, when it will probably take near <hi>a double quantity</hi> of wheat, beef, mutton, park, &amp;c. to pay it, as would now be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
            <p>IV. Further, a prudent man will never let a demand <hi>lie againſt him</hi> when he can <hi>conveniently ſatisfy it;</hi> and a public debt is the worſt of all kind of demands, when a man is not ready for them; for I ſubmit it to every man if he would not ſee <hi>any ſort of creditor</hi> come to him when he was
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023972_0131_0FC2B6425AD245A0"/>
unprepared to pay, rather than <hi>a public collector. Preſent payment</hi> avoids all this trouble and mortification, as well as <hi>ſaves much</hi> by the high price which that produce will now bring, which muſt be ſold to pay the tax.</p>
            <p>V. The tax will procure a good market, and ſure, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient payment to individuals who have ſuch articles for ſale as are needed by the public; whereas for want of the tax, thouſands who have ſold their goods to the public, have been paid in a uſeleſs currency, or have not been able to get any payment at all, to their great diſappointment and damage. This is a conſideration of great importance to moſt people in the States, as there are few who would not chooſe to ſupply the public with ſome kind of goods or ſervices in their power, if they could be ſure of punctual and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent payment. The having a quick and profitable market for what is made ready for ſale, is no ſmall advantage to every individual; for without this all his goods which he does not need for his own conſumption, lie uſeleſs on his hands, or his time may be loſt for want of an employer, who would pay him for his ſervices.</p>
            <p>The <hi>advantages</hi> reſulting from this <hi>one circumſtance</hi> would be equal to the tax to many thouſands of individuals; as the goods or time they would <hi>loſe</hi> for want of a market or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers, would be more than equal to the <hi>tax,</hi> as they have experienced to their ſorrow, who have loſt their goods for want of a market, or ſold them where they could not get their payment either in due time, or in currency of certain value.</p>
            <p>VI. The tax would remove all cauſe of complaint, and put an end to the great oppreſſion which has taken place much too long; for if the burden is laid equally on all, no one can have any cauſe to complain of oppreſſion when his ſhare is demanded; but without this the ſupplies want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the public muſt be taken by force or fraud from the owners, without payment, to their great oppreſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. Indeed if ſupplies are not procured and ſent to the army, theſe oppreſſions muſt be multiplied to a very tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal degree; for to diſband the army and ſend them home, when their preſent ſupplies are ſpent, will not probably be
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023972_0132_0FC2B643E153F798"/>
either ſafe for the country, or agreeable to them; they muſt therefore live in free quarters; they will probably be directed to march into ſuch States and towns as have been moſt deficient in furniſhing their quotas: but even in that caſe, thouſands of individuals will ſuffer, who have not been guilty of any deficiency or delays; for in caſes of ſuch extremity, the innocent muſt be involved with the guilty, and of courſe oppreſſions muſt be infinite, and very terrible. The burden of the tax bears no proportion to the ruinous and moſt dreadful effects reſulting in this one inſtance from the want of it.</p>
            <p>VII. The tax in a few months will <hi>reſtore our finances, fix our currency,</hi> and put us in condition <hi>to unite</hi> our force with every <hi>poſſible advantage;</hi> and this will ſo clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate our unbroken ſtrength, union, and firmneſs, that the <hi>hearts</hi> of our enemies <hi>will die</hi> within them, and they will ſoon break up and leave us in deſpair. Their <hi>only hope</hi> of conqueſt has long been from the <hi>confuſions of our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;</hi> they have not attempted for two years paſt <hi>to oppoſe their capital force to ours,</hi> but have hung on us in hopes that we ſhould <hi>ſoon ſink under the preſſure of our own expenſes,</hi> and ſo fall an eaſy prey into their hands; and they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this hope as long as they ſee us <hi>ringing the changes on viſionary ſchemes,</hi> and trying in <hi>new ſhapes and attitudes</hi> an <hi>old deluſion,</hi> that always <hi>has deceived</hi> us in every ſhape, and probably <hi>always will.</hi>

The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> without inſpiration, ſomehow catched the ſame idea. <hi>Audentes fortuna juvat.</hi> They eſteemed <hi>Fortune</hi> a divinity, ready <hi>to help thoſe</hi> who had ſpirit and courage <hi>to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> Little is to be expected from <hi>languid counſels, half aſſured reſolutions, plans</hi> that want <hi>extent adequate to their purpoſe,</hi> and <hi>vigor</hi> of execution equal to their <hi>extent.</hi> If I could ſee a little more of that <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the brave old worthies, I ſhould ſoon expect to ſee the <hi>ſword of the Lord</hi> follow, and our <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>troublers</hi> all melting away before us.</p>
            <p>But before I quit this ſubject, I beg leave to add one thought more, which appears to me of the moſt capital importance, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that no plan of taxation,</hi> or any thing elſe, can be of <hi>any good effect,</hi> if there is not <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me method adopted</hi> to bring all the States into <hi>an union and punctuality of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The leaſt company of men, who have a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, if it is but in a ſhip or piece of banked meadow, find it abſolutely and eſſentially neceſſary to have ſome way <hi>to compel their partners</hi> into a punctual <hi>diſcharge of their quotas.</hi> The very exiſtence of our union requires this. If one State <hi>hangs back,</hi> another <hi>will,</hi> and the beſt concerted <hi>plan</hi> poſſible may be rendered ineffectual by <hi>delays and defects</hi> in the execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:023972_0134_0FC2B64713BF0DC0"/>
It is eſſential to the very being of any independent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, that it has in it <hi>all the powers</hi> neceſſary to its <hi>own preſervation.</hi> Theſe powers doubtleſs <hi>exiſt</hi> in the Thirteen States, <hi>as perfectly</hi> as in any other community in the world. And tho' I do not pretend to underſtand the conſtitution of our union well enough to decide <hi>where theſe powers lie,</hi> yet I ſhould ſuppoſe they muſt be <hi>veſted in the Congreſs,</hi> as I know of no powers which extend <hi>over the whole,</hi> but theirs. But if it is thought that theſe powers are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently <hi>explicit and declared</hi> to be in them, it is neceſſary that this <hi>declaration</hi> ſhould be made <hi>without delay,</hi> and put into ſuch force as is abſolutely neceſſary to give effect to our public counſels, preſerve the union, and concentre the force of the whole, and prevent that deſtruction which may enſue for want of ſuch union of effort for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety.</p>
            <p>If it was poſſible for the tardy States to go to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>alone, without dragging the reſt after them,</hi> it might be beſt to diſmiſs them from the union with contempt. But as this cannot be done, it is neceſſary to the preſervation of the whole, that ſome means be found <hi>to compel</hi> ſuch States to keep pace with their neighbours, and bear their <hi>due proportion of the burden and duty,</hi> as well as receive their ſhare of <hi>protection</hi> and <hi>benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, we want nothing but <hi>united and ſpirited efforts</hi> for a ſhort time, to reſtore our <hi>finances,</hi> eſtabliſh our <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> retrieve our <hi>honor,</hi> ſecure our <hi>ſafety,</hi> give <hi>vigor to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind of buſineſs and occupation,</hi> recover our <hi>virtue,</hi> and make ourſelves the <hi>laudable</hi> and <hi>envied example of wiſdom and happineſs to all the world.</hi> Our <hi>poſterity</hi> expect and have a right to demand this from us.

            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, Dec. 13, 1780.]</head>
            <p>THE Tender-Act of <hi>November</hi> 29, 1780, is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by order of the Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> for public conſideration, and therefore the duty and reſpect due to the Aſſembly and the Public obliges every one to conſider it, and offer ſuch remarks on it as deſerve public notice. In compliance with this duty, I have conſidered the ſaid act, and the following Strictures appear to me of importance ſufficient to engage the public attention.</p>
            <p>The <hi>nature of a Tender-Act</hi> is no more or leſs than <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing by law the ſtandard value of money,</hi> and has the ſame uſe with reſpect to the <hi>currency,</hi> that the legal ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard <hi>pound, buſhel, yard, or gallon</hi> has to <hi>thoſe goods,</hi> the quantities of which are uſually aſcertained by thoſe weights and meaſures; therefore to call any thing a <hi>pound or ſhilling,</hi> which <hi>really is not ſo,</hi> and <hi>make it a legal ſtandard,</hi> is an <hi>error</hi> of the ſame nature as <hi>diminiſhing</hi> the <hi>ſtandard buſhel, yard, gallon,</hi> &amp;c. or making a law that a <hi>foot</hi> ſhall be the <hi>legal yard,</hi> an <hi>ounce</hi> the <hi>legal pound, a peck</hi> the <hi>legal buſhel,</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:023972_0136_0FC2B65748A29A10"/>
or a <hi>quart</hi> the <hi>legal gallon,</hi> and compelling every body to receive all <hi>goods due to them</hi> by ſuch deficient meaſures.</p>
            <p>Further, to make any thing the <hi>legal ſtandard</hi> of any of theſe, which is not of <hi>fixed</hi> but <hi>variable nature,</hi> is an error of the ſame kind and miſchief as the other; <hi>e. g.</hi> to make a <hi>turnip</hi> the ſtandard pound weight, which may dry up in the courſe of a year to a <hi>pith</hi> of not more than <hi>two or three ounces,</hi> or to make a <hi>flannel ſtring</hi> the ſtandard <hi>yard,</hi> which will ſhrink in uſing to half its length. The abſurdity of this is too glaring to need any thing further ſaid on it.</p>
            <p>But to come to the matter now in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The firſt obſervation which occurs to me is, that the bills, which are made a tender, contain a <hi>public promiſe of money to be paid in ſix years.</hi> On which I beg leave to remark,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:023972_0137_0FC2B6717B138CE8"/>
that the beſt and moſt indubitable ſecurity of money to be paid in <hi>ſix years,</hi> or any <hi>future time,</hi> is not ſo good or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable as ready caſh. The truth of this propoſition is ſo evident and obvious to every body, that it cannot need proof.</p>
            <p>Therefore the law, which obliges a man to accept theſe bills inſtead of ready caſh, obliges him to receive a <hi>leſs</hi> valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing in full payment of a <hi>more</hi> valuable one, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures him to amount of the difference; and is ſo far a direct violation of the <hi>laws of commutative juſtice—laws</hi> grounded in the nature of <hi>human rights,</hi> ſupported by the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>natural principles,</hi> and enjoined by the moſt expreſs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>of God Almighty,</hi> and which it is not poſſible that any legiſlature on earth ſhould <hi>have right</hi> to infringe or abrogate.</p>
            <p>Again, the ſecurity ariſing from the public promiſe is not generally deemed <hi>certain.</hi> The public <hi>faith</hi> has been <hi>ſo often violated,</hi> and the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of individuals thence ariſing have been ſo <hi>multiplied and extenſive,</hi> that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral confidence of our people in that ſecurity is much <hi>leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and as a chance or <hi>uncertainty</hi> can never be ſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a <hi>certainty,</hi> thoſe bills muſt and will be conſidered as leſs valuable than they would be, was the ſecurity on which they depended, free of all doubt or uncertainty; and conſequently, the diſcount of their value will always be eſtimated by, and of courſe be equal to, this difference. Therefore, the injuſtice of forcing them on the ſubject at <hi>full value</hi> of preſent caſh, is greatly increaſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe poſitions and reaſonings are grounded on ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety of fact, that any explanation or proof is needleſs; and I hope an objection againſt a law, drawn from the moſt manifeſt and acknowledged injuſtice of its operation and effect, will not be deemed trivial, or be eaſily ſet aſide or got over.</p>
            <p>Naked facts are <hi>powerful</hi> things, and arguments ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do beſt, and have the greateſt effect, when addreſſed to the <hi>feelings</hi> of mankind; and that I may preſs the matter as cloſe as I can, I beg leave to propoſe the following caſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Suppoſe a man of grave phiz and character ſhould, <hi>in diſtreſs,</hi> apply to his neighbour for the loan of 1000
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023972_0138_0FC2B673460ECBE8"/>
               <hi>ſilver</hi> dollars, with ſolemn promiſe on his <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> to repay them in a month, and in the mean time the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-act under conſideration ſhould paſs into a law, and the borrower, at the month's end, ſhould tender 1000 of the <hi>new</hi> paper dollars in payment.</p>
            <p>I beg leave here to propoſe to every <hi>Member</hi> of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly who voted for that law, and to every <hi>other</hi> man, who is a <hi>member of this State,</hi> what their ſentiments of that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be, and in what light they would view the <hi>borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> who tendered the <hi>paper</hi> dollars <hi>(i. e.</hi> 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the debt) in payment of the ſilver ones he had received; <hi>i. e.</hi> would they conſider him as an <hi>upright, honeſt man,</hi> or a <hi>ſhameleſs raſcal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In whichever of the two characters they may chooſe to conſider ſuch a man, it may be proper to note, that the <hi>act</hi> in queſtion, if paſſed into a law, would <hi>protect</hi> him, and not only ſo, but would ſubject the lender to the <hi>loſs</hi> of the <hi>whole money</hi> if he refuſed to receive it. This is a ſomewhat delicate matter, which it is painful to dwell long upon. I will therefore cloſe what I have to ſay on it with a few very ſerious remarks, the truth, juſtice, and propriety of which I humbly ſubmit to the reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The worſt kind of evil, and that which corrupts and endangers any community moſt, is that <hi>iniquity which is framed by a law;</hi> for this places the miſchief in the very ſpot, on the very ſeat, to which every one ought to look and apply for a remedy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot be conſiſtent with the honor, the policy, the intereſt, or character of an Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> to make a law, which, by its natural operation, ſhall afford <hi>protection</hi> to manifeſt injuſtice, deliberate knavery, and known wrong.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No cauſe or end can be ſo good, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo <hi>heavenly</hi> in its origin, ſo <hi>excellent</hi> in its nature, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>perfect</hi> in its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſo <hi>uſeful</hi> in its operation, as to require or juſtify <hi>infernal means</hi> to promote it. By <hi>infernal means</hi> I mean ſuch as are moſt <hi>oppoſed to Heaven and its laws;</hi> moſt repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to natural principles of <hi>equity,</hi> which are all derived from <hi>Heaven;</hi> and moſt deſtructive of the <hi>rights</hi> of human nature, which are eſſential to the happineſs of ſociety, the laws of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:023972_0139_0FC2B674B1D147D8"/>
which are <hi>engraven by Heaven</hi> on the heart of every man; ſome wicked men have formerly ſaid, "let us do <hi>evil,</hi> that <hi>good</hi> may come, whoſe <hi>damnation</hi> is juſt."</p>
            <p>But perhaps this <hi>ſort</hi> of argument may not have all the effect I could wiſh on the mind of <hi>every</hi> reader. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to another argument, which goes to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and principle of the act itſelf, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the <hi>credit or value of money</hi> cannot, in the very nature of the thing, be ſupplied, preſerved, or reſtored by <hi>penal laws,</hi> or any <hi>coercive</hi> methods. The ſubject is <hi>incompatible to force,</hi> it is out of its reach, and never can be made ſuſceptible of it, or controllable by it. The thing which makes money an object of deſire, which gives it ſtrength of motive on the hearts of all men, is the general <hi>confidence,</hi> the <hi>opinion</hi> which it gains, as a ſovereign <hi>means</hi> of obtaining every thing needful. This confidence, this opinion, exiſts in the mind only, and is not <hi>compellable</hi> or <hi>aſſailable by force,</hi> but muſt be grounded on that evidence and reaſon which the mind can ſee and believe; and is no more ſubject to the action of force, than any other paſſion, ſentiment, or affection of the mind; any more than faith, love, or eſteem.</p>
            <p>It is not more abſurd to attempt to <hi>impel faith</hi> into the heart of an unbeliever by <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>faggot,</hi> or to <hi>whip</hi> love into your miſtreſs with a <hi>cowſkin,</hi> than to force <hi>value</hi> or <hi>credit</hi> into your money by <hi>penal laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may, indeed, by force compel a man to deliver his goods for <hi>money</hi> which he does not <hi>eſteem,</hi> and the ſame force may compel him to deliver his goods without any <hi>money</hi> at all; but the credit or value of the money cannot be helped by all this, as appears by numberleſs examples. Plain facts are ſtubborn and undeniable proofs of this. Indeed, this has been tried among ourſelves in ſuch extent of places and variety of ſhapes, and in every inſtance been found ineffectual, that I am amazed to ſee any attempt to revive it, under any deviſable form whatſoever. Number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are the inſtances of flagrant oppreſſion and wrong, and even ruin, which have been the ſad effects of theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experiments, with infinite detriment to the community
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023972_0140_0FC2B6762BD32D60"/>
in general, without effecting in any one inſtance the <hi>ends intended.</hi> The facts on which this argument depends, are freſh in every one's memory.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh, for the honor of my country, to draw a veil over what is paſt, and that wiſdom might be derived from paſt errors, ſufficient to induce every one to avoid them in future. In fine, from the contemplation of the nature of the thing, and of the facts and experiments which have been made in every variety of mode, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by every degree of power and exertion, it appears as plain and undeniable as intuitive proof, that the credit or value of money is not in its nature controllable by force, and therefore, any attempt to reach it in that way, muſt end in diſappointment, and the greater the efforts, and the higher the authority which may be exerted in that way, the greater muſt be the chagrin, ſhame, and mortification, when the baſeleſs fabric ſhall vaniſh into ſmoke.</p>
            <p>The only poſſible method then of giving value or credit to money is, to give it ſuch qualities, and clothe it with ſuch circumſtances, as ſhall make it a ſure means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing every needful thing; for money that will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all things, is defective, and has not in it the full na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and qualities of money. In this way only it will grow faſt enough into eſteem, and become a ſufficient object of deſire, to anſwer every end and uſe of money. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the queſtion is propoſed, how ſhall we give credit or value to our money? the anſwer, the only true anſwer, is, bring it into demand, make it neceſſary to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, make it a high means of happineſs, and a ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of miſery. To attempt this in any other way is to go out of nature, and of courſe into difficulty, only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhameful diſappointment in the end.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I therefore haſten to another topic of argument, <abbr>viz.</abbr> It appears to me the act is founded in miſtaken and very had policy, and by its natural operation muſt produce many ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects extremely prejudicial to our great and moſt important intereſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſeems plain to me, that the act has a fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to deſtroy the great motives of <hi>induſtry,</hi> and to diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and diſcourage men of every profeſſion and occupation from purſuing their buſineſs <hi>on any large ſcale</hi> or to any <hi>great effect,</hi> and therefore will prevent the production of thoſe ſupplies derived from huſbandry and manufactures, which are eſſential to our ſafety, ſupport and comfort. Few men will beſtow their labor, attention, and good money, with zeal, to procure goods and commodities for ſale, which they know they muſt ſell for money which they eſteem bad, or at beſt doubtful. This propoſition is ſo obvious and natural, that it ſtrikes the mind with conviction at firſt ſight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof, and is ſo amply confirmed by our paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it can admit no doubt as to its truth or conſequence.</p>
            <p>The extent and dreadful effects of this are <hi>unavoidable and immenſe.</hi> If the induſtry of the farmer and tradeſman is diſcouraged, and they ceaſe to lay themſelves out for large crops and fabrics, the conſequence muſt be an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:023972_0142_0FC2B6896F5CD120"/>
diminution and ſcarcity of the produce of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and moſt important articles of living, as well as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. The general induſtry of the country is of ſuch vaſt importance, is an object of ſuch magnitude, that to check it, is to bring on ruin, poverty, famine, and diſtreſs, with idleneſs, vice, corruption of morals, and every ſpecies of evil; but enumeration or enlargement is unneceſſary here.</p>
            <p>As money is the ſinews of every buſineſs, the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a doubtful medium, and forcing it into currency by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws, muſt weaken and leſſen every branch of buſineſs, in proportion to the diminution of inducement found in the money.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame thing will <hi>render the procurement of ſupplies for the army difficult,</hi> if not utterly <hi>impracticable.</hi> Moſt men will hold back their goods from the market, rather than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell them for money of a doubtful credit; and there will be no poſſible way of collecting them, but to ſend a <hi>ſuperior force</hi> into the country, and there take them by <hi>violence</hi> from the owner, which will occaſion ſuch an expenſe as will <hi>double the coſt</hi> of the ſupplies by the time they get to the army, be ſubject to a thouſand <hi>frauds,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. This is the moſt obvious and ntural operation of the act, if we conſider its own nature only, and is confirmed by ſuch am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple experience, recent in the memory of every man, that it can leave no doubt but all this train of michiefs muſt follow the act from its firſt operation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I apprehend the act will, by its natural operation, tend to <hi>corrupt the morality of the people, ſap</hi> the ſupport, if not the very foundation, of our <hi>independence,</hi> leſſen the reſpect due to our <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> and deſtroy that <hi>reverence for our laws,</hi> which is abſolutely neceſſary to their proper operation, and the peace and protection of ſociety. Many people will be ſo terrified with the apprehenſion of ſeeing their real ſubſtance, the fruit of their labor and anxious attention, converted into a bundle of paper bills of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain value, that, to avoid this evil, they will have ſtrong inducements to rack their invention for all deviſable ways and methods of avoiding it; and this will give riſe to ſuch
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:023972_0143_0FC2B68A896C6E08"/>
numberleſs <hi>frauds, ambiguities, lies, quibbles,</hi> and <hi>ſhams,</hi> as will introduce the habit and give a kind of facility to the practice of ſuch guile and feats of art, as will endanger the <hi>uprightneſs, plain honeſty,</hi> and <hi>noble ſincerity,</hi> which ever <hi>mark</hi> the character of a happy and virtuous people.</p>
            <p>Many, who wiſh well to our independence, and have many neceſſaries for our army which they would wiſh to ſupply, will be yet held back from offering their goods, from the ſole conſideration of the doubtful value of the bills in which thoſe ſupplies muſt be paid for; and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this ſort I conceive will be ſo numerous, as greatly to affect the ſupplies of our army, and of courſe the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our independence. The injuries and ſufferings of people, who are compelled to take ſaid bills in ſatisfaction of contracts for real money, will induce them in their rage to uſe the legiſlature, who formed the act, with great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and perhaps groſs diſreſpect; whilſt the habit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the legiſlature, and eluding the injurious act, will become general, and pave the way to an habitual and univerſal abhorrence of our legiſlature and contempt of our laws, with a kind of facility and artful dexterity in eluding the force of the whole code.</p>
            <p>I freely ſubmit it to my reader, if theſe conſequences are at all unnatural or ill-drawn, if the ſurmiſes are at all groundleſs, or the painting a white too ſtrong. No art of government is more neceſſary, than that of keeping up the dignity and reſpectability of the legiſlatures, and all courts and officers of government, and exciting and preſerving in the hearts of the people a high reverence for the laws; and any thing which endangers theſe great ſupports of the ſtate ought to be avoided as a deadly evil.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The act, I apprehend, will give a bad appearance to our <hi>credit, honor,</hi> and <hi>reſpectability,</hi> in the eyes of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on this continent, and the nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and other more diſtant parts of the world. For when they come to be informed that our <hi>own people muſt be compelled,</hi> by the loſs of half their eſtates and impriſonment of their perſons, <hi>to truſt the public faith,</hi> they will at once conclude there muſt be ſome great danger, ſome ſhocking miſchief
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:023972_0144_0FC2B69D4429DB60"/>
dormant there, which the people neareſt to and beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, abhor ſo much; and of courſe, as they are out of the reach of our <hi>confiſcations and impriſonments,</hi> will have little inducement to truſt or eſteem us. And</p>
            <p n="5">5. Will give great <hi>exultation and encouragement</hi> to <hi>our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and induce them to <hi>prolong the war,</hi> and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the horrid penalty of impriſonment, which is to laſt during the war. When they ſee that our money is become ſo deteſtable, that it requires ſuch an act as this to compel our own people to take it, they muſt at leaſt be convinced that its nature is greatly corrupted, and its efficacy and uſe nearly at an end. When we ſee the paſſionate <hi>admirers</hi> of a great beauty <hi>forced</hi> by laſhes and tortures into her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, we at once conclude that ſhe has loſt <hi>her charms,</hi> and is become <hi>dangerous and loathſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be fairly objected to theſe Strictures, that they ſuppoſe the bills funded by this act are of leſs value than hard money. The act itſelf implies this. The Aſſembly never thought of waſting time in framing an act to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel people to take guineas, joes, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dollars, under penalty of confiſcation and impriſonment. Beſides, the fact ſtands in ſuch glaring light in the eyes of all men, that it is mere trifling to diſpute it.</p>
            <p>I dare think that there is not a man to be found, either in the Aſſembly or out of it, that would eſteem himſelf ſo rich and ſafe in the poſſeſſion of 1000 of theſe dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as of 1000 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ones; and the moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way to impreſs a ſenſe of the deficiency of the act on the minds of all men, and even diſcover the idea which the Aſſembly themſelves have of it, is to enforce it by penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of extreme ſeverity; for were there no deficiency in the act, it could not poſſibly require ſuch penalties to give it all neceſſary effect, nor is it ſuppoſable that the Aſſembly would add the ſanction of horrid penalties to any of their acts, unleſs they thought there was need of them.</p>
            <p>The enormity of the penalty deſerves remark. The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty for <hi>refuſing</hi> a dollar of theſe bills is greater than for <hi>ſtealing ten times the ſum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="unknown:023972_0145_0FC2B69E8E81A750"/>
Further, the act alters, and of courſe deſtroys, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and value of public and private contracts, and of conſequence ſtrikes at the root of all public and private credit. Who can lend money with any ſecurity, and of courſe who can borrow, let his neceſſity and diſtreſs be ever ſo great? who can purchaſe on credit, or make any contract for future payment? in very deed all confidence of our fellow-citizens in one another is hereby deſtroyed, as well as all faith of individuals in the public credit.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, the bills muſt reſt on the <hi>credit of their funds,</hi> their <hi>quantity,</hi> and other <hi>circumſtances.</hi> If theſe are ſufficient to give them a currency at full value, they will paſs readily enough without the help of penal laws. If theſe are not ſufficient, they muſt and will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate, and thereby deſtroy the end of their own creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this will proceed from ſuch ſtrong natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſuch phyſical cauſes, as cannot, in the nature of the thing, be checked or controlled by <hi>penal laws,</hi> or any other <hi>application of force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Strictures are humbly offered to public conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The facts alleged are all open to view, and well underſtood. If the remarks and reaſonings are juſt, they will oarry conviction; if they are not ſo, they are liable to any one's correction.</p>

            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, Dec. 13, 1780.]</head>
            <p>I PROPOSE, firſt, ſome remarks on the <hi>ſubject of paper money,</hi> and, ſecondly, ſome particular conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Acts of our Aſſembly for iſſuing the new Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental bills,</hi> with ſome reaſons why I think the true intereſt of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> requires that <hi>thoſe acts ſhould be repealed,</hi> and the iſſuing of thoſe bills ſhould be ſtopped or ſuſpended for the preſent, and I hope to do this without offence; for the great intereſts of a State, in which 400,000 <hi>citizens</hi> are concerned, cannot be too well underſtood, nor the utility of its laws be too carefully examined, or the errors of them be diſcovered and amended too ſoon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two things are eſſential neceſſary to give paper bills a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and currency equal to hard money.</hi> 1. <hi>Such certainty of</hi> HONEST <hi>and</hi> PUNCTUAL REDEMPTION, as ſhall fully ſatisfy the mind of the poſſeſſor. 2. <hi>That the</hi> CREDIT <hi>and</hi> DEMAND <hi>for ſaid bills ſhould be ſo conſtantly kept up, from the time of their</hi> EMISSION <hi>to that of their</hi> REDEMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, <hi>that the poſſeſſor may be able, at any time, to paſs them at hard money value.</hi> The firſt of theſe is provided for by
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:023972_0147_0FC2B6B7A17BD6A0"/>
the Aſſembly, if their act ſhall produce the <hi>certainty</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption required, which I am not here to diſpute: but the ſecond is equally neceſſary; for ſhould the bills paſs from their emiſſion to their redemption, or any part of that intermediate time, at a depreciated value, ſay 2, 3, or 4 for 1, tho' they ſhould be redeemed at full value at the <hi>expiration</hi> of their currency in the moſt punctual manner, yet the <hi>miſchiefs</hi> they would occaſion <hi>in the mean time</hi> would be infinite.</p>
            <p>One of which would be, that the depreciation it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would render the final redemption of the bills at full value both unjuſt and pernicious, as well as very hard and oppreſſive to the body of the people; for, in this caſe, the people muſt be taxed, ſay <hi>two, three,</hi> or <hi>four times</hi> the value or current exchange of the bills; not to the <hi>public benefit,</hi> but ſolely to increaſe the wealth of thoſe <hi>rich peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who will hoard up the bills, and have them in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at the time of their redemption. From which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears (and indeed I think it may be demonſtrated from the plaineſt principles) <hi>that public bills ought always to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that value or current exchange, at which they uſually paſs at the time of redemption, let their nominal value be what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may.</hi> Indeed, the infinite and ruinous miſchiefs of a fluctuating currency are ſo generally felt and well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that I conceive there is no need of proof, that it is equally neceſſary to keep the value or exchange of bills ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unvarying thro' the <hi>whole time of their currency,</hi> as to provide ſure funds for their <hi>final redemption,</hi> and that the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe does not depend ſolely on the <hi>laſt.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe depends on opinion, perſuaſion, and general prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; the <hi>laſt</hi> on the ability and integrity of the redeemer.</p>
            <p>If you offer a bill to a ſtranger, he never thinks of aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when, by whom, or how certainly that bill is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, but his only queſtion is, whether he can <hi>paſs it again?</hi> Not one in a thouſand who takes a public bill, takes it with a deſign to lay it up five or ſix years, tho' its redemption be ever ſo ſure at that time, but his object is immediate uſe, to ſerve his preſent occaſions by inſtantly paſſing it again, or at leaſt having it in his power to do
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023972_0148_0FC2B6B986356AA0"/>
it whenever occaſion may offer. I take it that theſe principles and reaſonings are perfectly plain and clear, and will afford, by the cleareſt inference, the following conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That no public bills ought ever to be iſſued, which have not theſe two great and eſſential ſupports,</hi> 1. a CERTAINTY <hi>of final redemption; and, 2. ſuch general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and demand, as will inſure their currency at full value without depreciation, during the whole time of their circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, it appears to me, that to iſſue public bills with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe ſupports is the plaineſt folly, bordering on inſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and muſt be very <hi>criminal,</hi> when done in the face of clear evidence and conviction. It further appears to me, that the <hi>new Continental bills have not theſe ſupports at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and therefore ought not to be iſſued till theſe ſupports can be obtained,</hi> and of conſequence, that the great intereſt of the State requires that the laws for iſſuing them ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; or at leaſt that the iſſuing them ſhould be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till theſe ſupports can be obtained; for which I offer the following reaſons, which ſeems to me to be of weight and force ſufficient to engage the moſt ſerious attention of the public.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The quantity (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 10,000,000 of dollars) is at leaſt <hi>four times as much in value as all the old Continental bills,</hi> and therefore muſt, from the nature of the thing, depreciate it, were its funds ever ſo indubitable, and the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in it ever ſo great.—I conceive the preſent mean exchange of the Continental bills is about 100 for 1, at leaſt they cannot be ſet at leſs than 80 for 1, on any ſure facts, which makes the whole quantity (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 200,000,000) worth 2,500,000 of hard dollars, which is but one fourth of 10,000,000;—and further, that increaſing the quantity of money will <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> decreaſe its value. This will always be a natural truth, as long as the value of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is nothing but the proportion between the quantity of circulating money and the <hi>occaſions</hi> of money (as I think I have demonſtrated in my <hi>Eſſays</hi> on Free Trade and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and eſpecially in the <hi>Second Eſſay</hi>) and which now
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023972_0149_0FC2B6BB0AF73C58"/>
is become ſuch a received truth, that it cannot need further proof here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſum of 10,000,000 of dollars, added to the other bills which will continue circulating, ſuch as State money, and certificates of various kinds, &amp;c. <hi>is much more paper money than the Thirteen States ever did or can bear.</hi> The whole circulating caſh of the Thirteen States, on the beſt calculation I have been able to make, never did exceed 12,000,000, I rather think it not more than 10,000,000 of hard dollars in value, and not more than half, or at moſt three fifths, of the circulating caſh in this State was paper in 1774; and I am convinced, by very good docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that that proportion was not exceeded in the other States, where paper money was circulated; and as moſt of the trade and buſineſs that requires ſtock or caſh, is now in ſtagnation, there cannot be occaſion for ſo much circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating caſh as in 1774, when every buſineſs, trade, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation was in full vigor.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is eaſy to make a pretty juſt eſtimate of the quantity of circulating paper which the country can now bear, from fact, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the value of the preſent circulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paper, of which the Continental bills are much the greateſt part; by which it will appear, that the preſent circulating paper cannot exceed <hi>four</hi> millions of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dollars in value,—and that it is as much as the Thirteen States can bear, or rather more, is plain from this,—<abbr>viz.</abbr> that the paper of all ſorts continues to depreciate. Now, in theſe circumſtances, to pour on 3 or 4 times as much new paper as we are found, by experiment, by plain fact, able to bear, is in my opinion a ſure way to depreciate it. I think it is not more certain, if you pour three or four buckets of water into one that is already full, that ſome of it muſt run over; yea, I think that the whole quantity you pour in muſt all run over.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have <hi>already too much money circulating among us,</hi> for it is certain that even hard money will not purchaſe more than two thirds as much labor, country produce, or other neceſſaries, which are not heightened in their price by the extraordinary expenſe of importation, as the ſame
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:023972_0150_0FC2B6BC86A74AF8"/>
would have purchaſed in 1774. Hence it follows, that the quantity of money has increaſed beyond the occaſions of money in that proportion. This is reaſoning on ſure prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which any body may diſprove that can; the price of market, rents, and even real eſtates, afford a moſt plain and ſtriking proof of this; it is further to be noted here that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Britiſh</hi> armies import much money, which they are daily ſpreading among us, and thereby ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly increaſe our circulating caſh. It follows then, that our beſt policy is to reduce the quantity of our circulating medium, eſpecially that dangerous part of it which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in paper, that we may avoid, as far as poſſible, the further horrors and miſchiefs of a depreciating currency, rather than to increaſe the evil by pouring in immenſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The preſent Continental money <hi>paſſes at its exchange</hi> thro' all the Thirteen States readily enough; any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even hard money, may be purchaſed with it; therefore it anſwers well the ends and uſes of a circulating medium. But the new bills, however well eſtabliſhed their funds may be, <hi>have not the confidence</hi> of the public in general, nor will they be readily <hi>received.</hi> They are a <hi>new thing,</hi> and their fate uncertain. This will naturally depreciate them in the firſt beginning of their circulation, by which the whole <hi>commerce</hi> of the Thirteen States, as well as the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic finance and expenditures,</hi> will receive the moſt eſſential injury. Now <hi>to call in a currency that is well received, and which anſwers well the ends and uſes of a circulating medium, and iſſue of it one of doubtful credit, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be received with diffidence, if not diſguſt, appears to me the height of abſurdity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>new bills,</hi> however funded, muſt ſtand on the <hi>ſame baſis as the old,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> the PUBLIC FAITH, which however modified, is neither better nor worſe in the one caſe than the other, and therefore the new bills will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on no better ſupports than the old ones, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence nothing can be gained by the exchange, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, riſk, and expenſe of which muſt therefore be wholly loſt.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:023972_0151_0FC2B6BDF987B4F8"/>
6. If the old bills ſhould depreciate, the public will <hi>gain</hi> the depreciation; but if the new bills ſhould depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, the public muſt <hi>loſe</hi> the depreciation, or muſt ſuffer a ſecond bankruptcy to avoid the loſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>If the new bills ſhould be emitted, they will not anſwer the purpoſe of a</hi> GENERAL CURRENCY, <hi>which is one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of their creation: but, like the State money, will be confined to the State that ſigns them.</hi> For it is very certain, that one State will no ſooner take the new bills ſigned by another State, than they will take any other bills ſigned by the ſame State; for the Continental ſecurity, added to the new bills, is neither expreſſed nor intended to mend the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or make good the <hi>deficiencies</hi> of any of the States, but ſuch as are rendered <hi>incapable of</hi> payment by the <hi>power or poſſeſſion of the enemy.</hi> The preſent Continental bills have a general currency, and therefore ought to be kept in circulation in preference to the new bills, if no other reaſon could be given for it.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

year, the States would find themſelves in debt 5,000,000 of hard dollars, over the above the heavy balance now againſt them, and the annual increaſe of the public debt abroad.</p>
            <p>But if (as will moſt likely be the caſe) moſt of the new bills ſhould be outſtanding at the end of the year, we muſt add to the aforeſaid 5,000,000 of hard dollars debt, the amount of all the outſtanding bills, with one year's hard money intereſt on them all—a vaſt chaos this, equal to the dreary regions of ancient night! My reader may think my reaſoning is ſanguine, and expreſſion ſtrong, but both proceed from the real convictions of my own mind, from the force of truth.</p>
            <p>If I have diſcovered and deſcribed properly theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the new bills on the Thirteen States, it follows that <hi>this State muſt take its ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What I would humbly propoſe, inſtead of this meaſure, is, <hi>to repeal the acts for iſſuing the new bills, or ſuſpend their execution till we are in condition to give them a currency truly and really equal to hard money, and keep them ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the mean time to continue the circulation of the preſent Continental or State bills, or both, till we can get hard money enough for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:023972_0153_0FC2B6D490FA38D0"/>
Upon the whole matter, I conceive that <hi>union in counſels, uniformity of method</hi> in our finances, and the benefits of a <hi>general currency,</hi> were the principal <hi>objects</hi> of the reſolution of Congreſs of the 18th of March, 1780 (tho' I confeſs I never could ſee the advantages of that reſolution.) I further conceive <hi>theſe objects are already loſt;</hi> for the different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change at which the different States iſſue and paſs the bills, and the want of confidence of the States in each other (for one State will not take the bills of the other <hi>States,</hi> as we find by experiment) together with the deficient and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſupports given to thoſe reſolutions, I ſay, all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtroy the intended union of counſels and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of finances, and render a general currency of the bills impracticable.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I ever conſidered the <hi>enormous quantity of bills propoſed for emiſſion in the ſaid reſolution,</hi> to be a ſeed of miſchief, which would grow up with force in the courſe of its operation, and defeat its effects; the ill conſequences of which could no otherwiſe be avoided, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n by the moſt ſtrenuous and united efforts of the States in its ſupport, and uſing the greateſt prudence and caution as to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity iſſued; all which I noticed with great freedom in my ſtrictures on ſaid reſolution, in my <hi>Fifth Eſſay,</hi> publiſhed ten months ago. It now appears that the efforts of the States in ſupport of ſaid reſolution have been very dilato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, far from deciſive, and widely differing in the manner of exertion; that the general confidence of the public in the ſucceſs of the bills is greatly ſhaken; and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral currency of them is rendered impracticable, and not to be expected, and of courſe that the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> deſign, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of the meaſure are already become deſperate.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee that it would be wiſe in our Aſſembly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to purſue a <hi>ſcheme, the principal objects of which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready defeated,</hi> and which, of courſe, has already <hi>loſt its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital uſes;</hi> eſpecially when there are ſo many and important objections lying in the way of its operation: to ſuppoſe that we can <hi>cut our way</hi> thro' all theſe difficulties, and force the bills into circulation by <hi>penal laws</hi> is an idea which I cannot think admiſſible, for the reaſons I alleged in my

Strictures on the Tender-Act, whilſt it was under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; at leaſt this dependence is dangerous to a great degree, for ſhould it fail, we ſhall be left dreadfully deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, without any caſh at command, and without time or means of recurring in ſeaſon to our more ſure reſources.</p>
            <p>If the emiſſion of the new Continental bills ſhould be laid aſide, we may be able well to ſupport our new emiſſion of ſtate bills; <hi>if</hi> the <hi>demand</hi> for them is ſufficiently increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by taxes which is very practicable; and <hi>if</hi> the legiſlature could be prevailed on to take off <hi>the penalties</hi> of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-act, which were deſigned to enforce their circulation, but which, in my opinion, add <hi>horror</hi> to the currency itſelf, and raiſe <hi>doubts and fears</hi> which otherwiſe would not be thought of; and, in any view, ſtand as a monument of the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of our public credit, which requires ſuch <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſupports</hi> to keep it in exiſtence, and will be a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>folly, ſhame, and inadequate policy,</hi> if it ſhould fail of producing the effects intended.</p>
            <p>I apprehend it would be much more ſure, natural, and adviſable, if we need money for any uſe, <hi>e. g.</hi> to pay and feed the army, &amp;c. to lay a tax on our people for it, and <hi>ſolemnly appropriate</hi> it to that purpoſe ONLY, and tell them ſo. I am of opinion ſuch a tax would be ſpeedily and cheerfully paid, and let the ſame be done for every other branch of expenditure. This will be <hi>ſettling and finiſhing the matter as we go along,</hi> and will keep our State and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels free from the confuſion of <hi>perplexed finances,</hi> the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>labor of ſettling public accounts,</hi> the <hi>preſſure</hi> of a public debt, and the diſheartening <hi>horrors of future endleſs taxes,</hi> to diſcharge the Lord knows what of intereſt and principal, which will remain to be paid in future time.</p>
            <p>If other States are diſpoſed to involve themſelves and poſterity in an <hi>endleſs labyrinth</hi> of confuſed accounts, fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating currency, and immenſity of debt, it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that it is either prudent or neceſſary that we ſhould imitate their example.

If this ſhould not ſuit them, they will be at liberty to load themſelves with <hi>paper,</hi> whilſt we ſhall draw their <hi>hard money</hi> to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which will be the natural and unavoidable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>their continuing,</hi> and <hi>our reſtraining,</hi> the emiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of paper money.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing will fill our <hi>State</hi> with the beſt inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; for it is plain that every ſenſible man would chooſe to ſettle himſelf in a State free of debt, rather than in one loaded with a debt which would require the galling taxes of an age to diſcharge it.</p>
            <p>But, all this aſide, I would rather diſcharge the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditures as we go, tho' it ſhould prove heavy, than to leave a <hi>legacy of debt on poſterity,</hi> which will mix bitterneſs with the ſweets of that liberty which we are endeavouring to procure for them, and induce them to cenſure the humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our counſels, and leſſen their gratitude to us for a moſt valuable bleſſing ſecured to them, becauſe they will find themſelves charged with the expenſe of it.</p>
            <p>But ſtill I expect to hear the old cry againſt my princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that they are good <hi>in theory,</hi> but not admiſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>impracticable;</hi> that taxing equal to the expenditures is impoſſible, becauſe the people cannot bear ſuch weight of taxes; but there is no diſputing againſt <hi>neceſſity,</hi> I therefore beg the reader's patient attention to the following ſhort propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Taxing equal to the expenditures is the only poſſible <hi>method of keeping our currency to a fixed value;</hi> for if there is more money in any country iſſued into currency, than is taken out during the year, there muſt be more money in circulation at the end of the year than there was in the beginning of it, and an increaſe of quantity will depreciate the value of any currency (hard or paper:) this depends on principles as natural and unalterable as the laws of <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi> or powers of the <hi>magnet.</hi>

               <pb n="149" facs="unknown:023972_0156_0FC2B6E706B88520"/>
2. A fluctuating currency is by all men confeſſed to be a <hi>calamity,</hi> much more dreadful and ruinous than <hi>any degree of taxation</hi> neceſſary to prevent it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>miſchief</hi> of a fluctuating currency is dreadfully increaſed by all <hi>regulations, tender-acts,</hi> and every other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>force</hi> made uſe of to prevent it; the noiſe, force, and devaſtation of an irreſiſtible current are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſed by <hi>obſtacles</hi> thrown in its way, beyond what would happen, if it was ſuffered to take its natural courſe without interruption; for a practical proof of theſe two laſt propoſitions, I appeal to the experience of every man of any buſineſs, with this plain queſtion, <hi>"Sir, would you not rather pay your ſhare of the whole expenditures of the year in monthly or quarterly taxes, than ſuffer, thro' the year, the pains, injuries, and inconveniences of a fluctuating currency, with regulations, committees, tender-acts, and penalties in force?"</hi> I dare believe that ſcarce a man of buſineſs and character can be found in this State, who would not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily anſwer, and from full conviction, that the tax would be much the leaſt burdenſome of the two.—I will then ſtate my propoſitions with freedom, and ſubmit them to the candid examination and cenſure of the public.

            <head>AN ESSAY ON The ECONOMY, POLICY, and RESOURCES of the THIRTEEN STATES, AND The MEANS of their PRESERVATION.</head>
            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, in January 1781.]</head>
            <p>THE exhauſted ſtate of the public treaſury, and the univerſal diſorder of our finances, the preſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for ſupplies for every department of the public ſervice, the convulſions which begin to appear, and the general confuſion that threatens us, are become very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and alarming, are become matters of very anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and even painful deſpondency, in the minds of many very wiſe and good men; and the public neceſſities are thence ariſen to ſuch a pitch of urgency, as muſt convince every thinking man that a ſpeedy remedy or ruin muſt be the conſequence. In this dreadful criſis, I will venture to lay before the public ſome thoughts on the preſent ſtate of our affairs, and the ways and means of deliverance, which appear to me moſt wiſe, natural, and practicable; and this I propoſe to do with the ſame openneſs and freedom of mind and expreſſion, which I have heretofore uſed, and hope for the ſame candor and indulgence from the public which I have heretofore experienced.</p>

1. Our country is not exhauſted; <hi>it is full of ſupplies of every kind, which are needed for public ſervice.</hi> We have men enough who would wiſh to ſerve in the army, if they could be properly <hi>ſupported and paid.</hi> We have proviſions and all other ſupplies enough in the hands of our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who wiſh to ſell them to any body who would <hi>pay for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have <hi>unanimity and general zeal for the great cauſe of liberty,</hi> for which we are contending. Neither our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic counſels nor movements are obſtructed or weakened by ſtrong, <hi>oppoſite factions,</hi> waſting our wiſdom or force in counter-working each other. The moſt dangerous and alarming <hi>commotions</hi> among us, ſhow ſuch firmneſs, zeal, and unſhaken attachment to the great <hi>American</hi> cauſe, as plainly demonſtrate that they do not at all ariſe from diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but from <hi>other real, diſtreſſing cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We want nothing but <hi>wiſdom, to draw into uſe the force and ſupplies of which the country has ſufficient plenty.</hi> Like the fooliſh prodigal, we are feeding and ſtarving on <hi>

Our <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of counſel</hi> will be <hi>topics of ridicule</hi> and <hi>by-words</hi> of ſcorn, whilſt our poſterity will be noticed groaning under the iron rod of oppreſſion, and laſhed into that <hi>effort</hi> for the benefit of their maſters, which would <hi>now be ſufficient</hi> to ſecure their and our liberty; but which we have not now <hi>wiſdom and virtue</hi> enough to call into uſe.</p>
            <p>How will the by-ſtanders <hi>laugh,</hi> and our poor poſterity <hi>groan,</hi> at the abſurdity of our plans of <hi>appreciating</hi> our cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency <hi>month by month,</hi> whilſt every cauſe of depreciation continues and <hi>increaſes;</hi>—of <hi>leſſening</hi> the number of buyers, in order to <hi>increaſe</hi> the ſellers;—of <hi>limiting, forcing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing</hi> the market, in order to <hi>increaſe</hi> the quantity of goods brought for ſale;—of <hi>forcing credit, value,</hi> and <hi>deſirableneſs</hi> into our currency by <hi>tender-acts</hi> and <hi>penal laws;</hi>—and of

               <hi>procuring</hi> the vaſt ſupplies for the public ſervice, by <hi>taking away</hi> every inducement of <hi>induſtry,</hi> and throwing every branch of our trade, mechanic arts, and huſbandry into ſtagnation;—and, which caps all the reſt, the ſacred ſcheme of <hi>ſupporting</hi> our government, and <hi>ſecuring</hi> all the bleſſings of liberty by a <hi>ſhameleſs departure</hi> from every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of honeſty and juſtice, which is eſſential to the very exiſtence of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>Theſe are but few of the <hi>abſurdities in politics</hi> which we have ſeen adopted, and <hi>forced</hi> into practice by every appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of compulſive methods, and with a <hi>perſeverance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</hi> Nothing but the abſolute impoſſibility of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice could compel the <hi>chimerical zealots</hi> to diſcontinue their mad career; but, however <hi>laughable</hi> to our enemies, and <hi>diſtreſſing</hi> to our poſterity, and <hi>incredible</hi> to both, theſe things may appear, they may be of <hi>uſe to us,</hi> as the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and deſtructive conſequences, the ſhame, diſgrace, and ruin, which we have ſeen reſulting from them, and which now threaten us in a manner that makes every conſiderate face gather paleneſs; theſe, I ſay, all tend to work an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conviction in the minds of all men, of their total inutility and the abſolute neceſſity of an immediate reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p>And as a neceſſary means of it, to <hi>reject for ever from our public counſels,</hi> thoſe weak, unprincipled men of <hi>wild projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and madneſs of deſign,</hi> who have infatuated the land with their extravagant <hi>chimeras,</hi> and drawn many of the honeſt, unthinking, but too eaſy people into their methods of ſhame and ruin. A man will not <hi>kill his own child,</hi> tho' ever ſo monſtrous; nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our preſent diſtreſs will ever heartily concur in the <hi>rejection</hi> and public <hi>cenſure</hi> of their <hi>own darling ſchemes,</hi> or that they are capable of that <hi>wiſdom</hi> neceſſary to bring about a total reformation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Tho' the <hi>principle</hi> of the <hi>American</hi> revolution was perfectly <hi>juſt,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of adopting it <hi>unavoidable,</hi> yet the ſame great evil and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience happened in the courſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which, I conceive, always did take place, more or leſs, in all public commotions and revolutions which have exiſted in all States in the world; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that many very <hi>improper men</hi> worked themſelves ſomehow or other <hi>into places of great truſt and importance,</hi> both in the <hi>legiſlative</hi> and <hi>executive</hi> departments; by which the <hi>vices,</hi> the <hi>whims,</hi> the <hi>wild projections,</hi> and <hi>viſionary plans</hi> of individuals became diffuſed and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incorporated into the <hi>character, counſels, laws,</hi> and <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of the States.</p>
                  <p>Such men are ever dangerous, but moſt peculiarly ſo in times of general <hi>calamity and diſtreſs,</hi> when wiſdom, fortitude, and prudence are moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary in rulers and leading men. But however unfortunate our States have been in that reſpect, they were ſtill happy in this, that the evil did not reach their moſt capital departments; the <hi>army, foreign affairs,</hi> and, in moſt inſtances, the <hi>preſidency of Congreſs</hi> were under the direction of men of moſt unblemiſhed <hi>integrity, adequate abilities,</hi> and moſt <hi>conſummate prudence;</hi> and had not our confuſions been in ſome degree under their check, it is hard to ſay to what lengths they might have extended.</p>

Here I muſt ſtop a little, and obſerve that the thing which makes <hi>one nation excel another</hi> in glory, political pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and happineſs, is moſt commonly this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That <hi>men of genius, abilities, integrity, and induſtry, are placed at the head of their public departments.</hi> The public will ever receive its <hi>tone, in reſpect of its dignity, fame, good order, and happineſs, from the men who are intruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the public affairs.</hi> This obſervation is ſo manifeſtly true, that every man, in the ſmall circle of his own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics or neighbours, can judge well <hi>how any buſineſs will be done, if he knows who is to do it.</hi> We cannot hope for reformation and good management of our public affairs, unleſs we ſee <hi>judicious, upright,</hi> and <hi>ſteady</hi> men in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral departments of the State; men <hi>adequate</hi> to the offices they fill, and <hi>induſtrious</hi> and <hi>perſevering</hi> in attending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. But to return,</p>
            <p>I will ſuppoſe for once that every public department was filled with the beſt and moſt ſuitable men, and that every individual was willing to adopt and purſue the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of ſafety and deliverance which our caſe admits; what then can and ought to be done? I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Every man is to be called on for the debt which he owes the public.</hi> Every man ſtands indebted to the public for his ſhare or proportion of all the money or ſupplies neceſſary to the public ſafety, and this debt muſt be paid, or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſafety muſt be inſecure, muſt be in danger. The public ſafety cannot be put off, as ſome people ſerve their Maker, <hi>with empty prayers and good wiſhes.</hi> This payment can <hi>ruin</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:023972_0163_OFC2B715234AC270"/>
nobody. It is manifeſt, that if any individual, even the leaſt able to pay, ſhould, by ſome accident, loſe as much money or other eſtate as his ſhare of this debt amounts to, it would not <hi>ruin</hi> him, it would not greatly diſtreſs him; for the truth of this I appeal to every man's knowledge of his own and his neighbour's circumſtances; but on the other hand, how many thouſands of individuals are <hi>ruined for want of this payment?</hi> Dreadful and ſwift witneſſes of this are, all thoſe who have ſuffered by the <hi>violations of our public faith,</hi> by the <hi>depreciation</hi> of our currency; all thoſe who are <hi>not paid</hi> for the <hi>produce of their lands,</hi> or perſonal <hi>ſervices,</hi> or <hi>other fruits</hi> of their labor, with which the public has been <hi>furniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people of the Thirteen States are almoſt in the ſame condition which they would have been in, if they <hi>had ſold their principal produce to bankrupts</hi> or broken merchants, who could not pay them. They, by this means, have not money <hi>to pay</hi> their debts, to <hi>trade</hi> with, to <hi>buy</hi> of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, to <hi>lay in their ſtock</hi> for the enſuing year, to increaſe their ſcale of buſineſs, &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi>One diſappointment creates another;</hi> an univerſal ſtagnation of buſineſs is the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and all induſtry is checked even in its firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as well as in practice; and of courſe the produce of the lands, and the fabrics of the tradeſman are daily leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of courſe the <hi>great ſtock for home conſumption,</hi> and the great <hi>ſtaples of trade,</hi> are daily dwindling away. Theſe are facts notorious to every body, and ariſe directly from this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that there is not public money enough to pay the public creditors.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if every man was called on for his ſhare of the public debt, <hi>there would be money enough to pay every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and all this dreadful deluge of calamity would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied at once, and every individual would be a gainer by the tax he would pay, becauſe he loſes more every year by the <hi>confuſions</hi> and <hi>diſappointments</hi> ariſing from <hi>this want</hi> of public monies, than his <hi>tax</hi> would amount to. This is all <hi>mighty well</hi> in THEORY, but <hi>impoſſible enough</hi> in PRACTICE. Do you ſay this in earneſt? I do moſt ſeriouſly contend,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023972_0164_OFC2B7169BA3C288"/>
that it is very poſſible in <hi>practice;</hi> it is poſſible, it is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, it is neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To make out a true eſtimate of the public debts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and iſſue a monthly tax</hi> for the amount, in which every one ſhall be called on for his ſhare, and no more than his ſhare. The money which is collected in the firſt month's tax will go out again among the people, and help them to pay the next month's tax; that will go out again, to be again called in by the third tax, and ſo on; and the quickneſs of circulation hereby excited will ſupply the want of medium; for it is plain to every man, that <hi>a guinea, which paſſes from hand to hand thirty times in one month, pays as much, and of courſe goes as far, as thirty guineas which are paid but once in a month.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is further manifeſt, that ſuch an univerſal <hi>demand</hi> for money will give it <hi>value,</hi> will make it an object of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>deſire;</hi> this will give <hi>ſpring</hi> to induſtry, <hi>motion</hi> to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry method of obtaining money, and <hi>ſecurity</hi> to every man who has obtained it. It is neceſſary for us <hi>to know the worſt of the matter, let that worſt be as bad as it will.</hi> Let us know how much it will <hi>coſt</hi> to <hi>ſave</hi> our country, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore our morality,</hi> our <hi>induſtry,</hi> our <hi>ſafety,</hi> and <hi>happineſs.</hi> The <hi>profits of the year at moſt will do it,</hi> becauſe no more <hi>is or can</hi> be ſpent in the year than is raiſed or produced in the year; for we loan abroad enough to pay for all we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from abroad for the public uſe.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible indeed to <hi>increaſe our huſbandry or manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, without a free, open, and ſufficient market.</hi> Shut or diminiſh the market, and the ſupplies of it will ſoon leſſen; open and increaſe the demand of the market, and all ſupplies of it will ſoon increaſe. All this is too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to need proof; therefore it is neceſſary to <hi>remove wholly all obſtructions</hi> of our market, <hi>all fetters, and reſtraints, and diſcouragements</hi> of buſineſs, ſuch as <hi>embargoes, tender-acts, limitations, regulations,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. Let every body be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>to get money as faſt as they can,</hi> and be put under every natural advantage for doing it.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion that our people would receive an <hi>enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement</hi> of this ſort with as much joy, as the inhabitants
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023972_0165_OFC2B7299DF5CCC0"/>
of <hi>Greece</hi> received the declaration of their liberties from the mouth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ambaſſador. If premiums had been offered for <hi>ſtupid plans</hi> and <hi>wild projections,</hi> I think worſe could not have been offered than ſuch as we have ſeen, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>laying embargoes on the exports, to increaſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the country for the army; forcing people to ſell their goods below the market price, in order to induce them to bring more to market; offering money with horrid penalties, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make folks love and eſteem it; embarraſſing all buſineſs, to get the more of it done;</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such wild, ſtupid, horrible, and unnatural projects, with the effects of them, diſcourage our people, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wheels of government heavy, and deſtroy all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the people in the public counſels, much more than the real weight and burdens of the war. Theſe bear no ſort of proportion to the diſtreſſes which are produced by the madneſs of our counſels, and unnatural way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing. Laws ought to be <hi>conformed to the natural courſe of things;</hi> but we have been abſurdly endeavouring to <hi>control</hi> the natural courſe of things, and <hi>bend it to our laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it impoſſible that further arguments ſhould be neceſſary to prove the expediency, yea, the ſtrong propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and urgent reaſon of diſmiſſing at once all theſe moſt unnatural and deſtructive meaſures, theſe abſurd <hi>ſcandals of human reaſon, and of</hi> American <hi>policy;</hi> that ſo our minds may be open to impreſſions from the true ſtate of our caſe; open to the real difficulties we are under, and to the proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which will, by their natural operation, afford us relief. We ought to <hi>ſtudy hard</hi> for this. Perhaps we may by ſtrong exertion, by cloſe <hi>attention,</hi> and the <hi>bleſſing of God,</hi> be able to find out, <hi>that means muſt be adequate to their ends;</hi> that <hi>the way to reſtore our credit is to pay our debts;</hi> that <hi>the way to pay our debts is to get money to pay them with; that any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den laid on the whole community is ſafer for the whole, than when the ſame burden is laid on a part only; that the only way to keep the members ſtrong and in health is, to keep the belly full of ſubſtantial food, not of huſks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="unknown:023972_0166_0FC2B730872427D0"/>
But the abſurdity of our meaſures is not all the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have to them. They are <hi>inadequate</hi> to their own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. What can it ſignify to plague the continent, and exhauſt all the patience of our people with difficult, <hi>intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate plans</hi> of raiſing money, when all the plans put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and fully executed, would not produce <hi>half, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not a quarter, of the ſum neceſſary to our preſervation?</hi> This is like bailing a leaky ſhip with a ſpoon, when buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets are neceſſary to keep her free. I think it would be far more <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to our people, to make out <hi>eſtimates and demands equal to our neceſſities,</hi> which will give this ſtrong inducement to the efforts of each individual, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that it will be adequate to the purpoſe; that the <hi>means, however difficult, will be ſufficient to produce the great ends deſigned.</hi> When the great demand is made known, the firſt queſtion will be, <hi>Is this enough? Will this be ſufficient to the purpoſe?</hi> An aſſured, affirmative anſwer will inſpire great courage and effort, when the object is the <hi>great wiſh,</hi> the <hi>paſſionate deſire</hi> of almoſt every individual, as is moſt manifeſtly the caſe with our people. It is a falſe delicacy, a ſhameful timidity, a dangerous injury to a nation, to keep them ignorant of their <hi>true circumſtances and real dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and not give them an opportunity to put the means of their ſafety in practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am clearly of opinion, that ſcarce a man of any weight could be found in the Thirteen States, who would not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and with joy pay a much larger ſum than his tax would amount to, if he had reaſonable hope that the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, oppreſſions,</hi> and <hi>dangers</hi> of the country could be thereby removed, a <hi>free courſe of juſtice</hi> be reſtored, every man's <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>property</hi> be <hi>protected,</hi> and the <hi>natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of induſtry</hi> be favored and encouraged, and our <hi>inſulting enemies be effectually oppoſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>yearly incomes of the country</hi> are much more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to do all this, if properly called into uſe. We have two armies in the country to feed, and the produce of the country is amply ſufficient for both. The ſupplies of the <hi>one</hi> we are paid for, it is only <hi>the other</hi> which muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from our own reſources; and after ſupplying both
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:023972_0167_0FC2B7378E62B958"/>
armies (if our huſbandry and trade could be ſuffered to take their natural courſe) we ſhould have large produce to ſpare for exportation.</p>
            <p>In addition to all this, I am clearly of opinion that our reſources are ſo great, that with proper management (even tho' the war ſhould continue ſeven years longer) <hi>the treaſury of the Thirteen States might be filled with ſilver and gold coin, and be made a BANK as ſafe and uſeful as that of</hi> Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>or</hi> Venice; and all this within a very ſhort time, as may be clearly demonſtrated to any body who is acquainted with the nature and conſtitution of this kind of ſubject.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> as ſoon as they found out the ſecret of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring their people with the true ſpirit of induſtry and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, ſoon recovered their national credit, and grew amazingly rich, long <hi>before their wars with</hi> Spain <hi>ceaſed.</hi> We have vaſtly greater means in our power than they had, and want nothing but <hi>their wiſdom</hi> to improve them to as great advantage. I conceive it to be very certain and manifeſt, that <hi>our national character, honor, and ſafety are yet in our own power,</hi> and depend on nothing for their full and <hi>perfect eſtabliſhment,</hi> but our own <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>effort,</hi> and the <hi>bleſſing</hi> of Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Eſſay with one propoſition, which, however much like a paradox it may appear at firſt ſight, I think is very demonſtrable, and I conceive will require little more than mere inſpection for a ſhort time, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every man of diſcernment and ſerious attention of its truth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>it would be eaſier and cheaper for every man of buſineſs, whether farmer, tradeſman, or merchant, to pay his ſhare of the whole annual expenditures of the public within the year, than not to pay it; i. e.</hi> he would live more <hi>eaſy</hi> thro' the year, and be <hi>richer</hi> at the end of it, by <hi>paying</hi> ſuch tax, than by <hi>not paying</hi> it. This was the great <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtlethwait's</hi> grand doctrine in <hi>England</hi> thirty years ago, and every body now ſees the great advantages which would have reſulted from his advice, had it then been adopted and purſued.—</p>
            <p>"Oh! that we could know <hi>the things of our peace,</hi> in this the day of them." God forbid they ſhould be <hi>hid</hi> from
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:023972_0168_0FC2B73F50FAA248"/>
our eyes. Men often look abroad for things that are at home, and ſeek at a diſtance for things that are near. I apprehend that union of ſentiment and effort, <hi>in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of means,</hi> which it does not require any great ſagacity to diſcover, would be quite ſufficient for our ſafety. A plain <hi>ſimplicity</hi> is more to our purpoſe, than any <hi>depth of deluſive policy.</hi>

            <p>AS the appointment of a <hi>Financier-General,</hi> or <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of the finances or public revenues,</hi> has been <hi>ſome time</hi> in contemplation, it may not be unacceptable to the public to ſee a diſſertation on the <hi>nature</hi> of that high office, and the <hi>duties, powers,</hi> and <hi>privileges</hi> annexed to it, with ſome notes on its <hi>importance, dignity, and uſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a new ſubject in <hi>America;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The office of <hi>Superintendant of finance</hi> was firſt created by reſolution of Congreſs, <hi>Feb.</hi> 7. 1781; and on the 20th of the ſame month, <hi>Robert Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> 
                     <abbr>eſq.</abbr> was appointed by vote of Congreſs to execute the office under the name of <hi>Superintendant of finance,</hi> tho' he was commonly called the <hi>finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier-general,</hi> or ſimply the <hi>financier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He continued in the office till <hi>Nov.</hi> 1, 1784, when he reſigned, and <hi>no ſucceſſor</hi> has been ſince appointed <hi>under that name;</hi> (the buſineſs of the treaſury was put into commiſſion afterwards, and continued ſo till the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the old Congreſs) but I take it that the ſame office is revived and continued by the preſent Congreſs under a <hi>new name,</hi> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> that of <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the treaſury;</hi> which office is at preſent held by <hi>Alexander Hamilton, </hi> 
                     <abbr>eſq.</abbr> and the appointment of this officer lies (among others) in the Preſident of the United States, with the approbation of the Senate.</p>

               </gap> may therefore be expected that the firſt eſſays on it will be imperfect. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but experience in ſo immenſe a ſubject can give a full and comprehenſive knowledge of all its parts, and of the duties, powers, and privileges neceſſary to the proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and due execution of it. I have thought much on the ſubject, and find it greatly exceeds my comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I can only give the public ſuch thoughts as occur to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:023972_0170_0FC2B74B0E9B45E8"/>
me, which, without further preface or apology, I ſhall do with freedom, and hope they may be received with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
            <p>The duty of a Financier-General, I humbly conceive, is,</p>
            <p>I. To <hi>inſpect and take account of the whole finances or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic revenues</hi> of the States, and the whole <hi>funds</hi> or <hi>ſtock</hi> out of which they are to grow; <hi>i. e.</hi> every ſort of public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, all ſources of all kinds out of which public monies are to be derived to ſupply the public treaſury, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend all theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> take due care that they are <hi>well kept,</hi> free from waſte, deſtruction, and embezzlement, and that they be <hi>managed</hi> and <hi>improved</hi> to the beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>II. To inſpect and point out, arrange and put into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>the ways and means by which the neceſſary ſupplies of the public treaſury</hi> may be derived from all theſe <hi>ſources</hi> or <hi>funds,</hi> that the ſame be done with moſt <hi>eaſe</hi> to the ſubject, and <hi>ſafety</hi> to the States, with all that <hi>effect, deciſion,</hi> and <hi>expedition</hi> neceſſary to all public movements, and at the <hi>leaſt expenſe</hi> which can be adequate to theſe great ends; <hi>i. e.</hi> to make <hi>eſtimates</hi> of the yearly expenditures, and point out the <hi>ways and means</hi> of ſupplies, and to arrange both in ſo clear and particular a manner for the inſpection of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that they may have at once a view of the whole and all the parts, to the end that, having ſuch a ſtate of all the facts and materials before them, they may be able to form the moſt wiſe and proper reſolutions thereon, which the ſafety and well-being of the States require.</p>
            <p>It is further neceſſary that this be done in ſuch <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> as to give ſufficient time for the deliberations of Congreſs, and carrying their reſolutions into effect, in the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eaſy way, that thereby the dangers, miſchiefs,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:023972_0171_0FC2B757E4D57950"/>
and confuſion of precipitation, hurry, and extreme urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe very weighty matters, may be avoided.</p>
            <p>III. To <hi>inſpect and control all officers</hi> who have the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſpoſal,</hi> or <hi>management of each and all of ſaid funds,</hi> to the end they may be properly directed, encouraged, checked, and ſupported in the diſcharge of their ſeveral offices, in ſuch manner that their management, accounts, and payments may be completed with leaſt delay and moſt advantage to the States.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>To call on the ſeveral States for ſuch quotas as may be aſſeſſed by Congreſs,</hi> and to keep them adviſed of every thing that the demands of Congreſs and the public exigencies may require of them, reſpecting the revenue.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>To inſpect all the expenditures of the States,</hi> of every kind, to the end they may be made with the <hi>beſt economy,</hi> and to the <hi>utmoſt benefit</hi> of the public.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>To inſpect and control all officers, concerned in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or expenditure of the public monies or revenues,</hi> and to demand a return of all ſuch expenditures from ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with the balance of all their accounts, that ſo he may be enabled to keep an exact balance of all the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and expenditures, ready for the inſpection or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Congreſs, whenever they ſhall call for the ſame.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>To inſpect all debts due to and from the States, all bills of credit,</hi> and <hi>all treaties</hi> and <hi>contracts</hi> relating to the revenue or public monies, to the end there may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and payment made, with that punctuality and deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion neceſſary to the <hi>ſupport of the public faith,</hi> that ſo the States may receive no detriment from any <hi>failure or delay</hi> in this delicate and important particular.</p>
            <p>VIII. <hi>To keep an account of the whole revenue,</hi> and all its parts, and of the <hi>whole expenditures,</hi> and all their parts, in ſo clear and digeſted a manner, as to be able, on reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able notice, to report to Congreſs the ſtate and amount of each, with the <hi>deficiency</hi> or <hi>ſurpluſage</hi> of the revenue for purpoſes of government.</p>
            <p>IX. <hi>To procure ſuch certain documents of the whole funds or reſources</hi> of the public revenue, and all their parts, and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023972_0172_0FC2B759589C1068"/>
make himſelf ſo acquainted with the ſame, as to be able to point out the <hi>beſt ways and means</hi> of increaſing the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, for any purpoſes of public ſafety and advantage, when Congreſs ſhall require ſuch ſervice from him.</p>
            <p>X <hi>To make diſcovery and report to Congreſs</hi> of any depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the expenditures, which are <hi>more expenſive th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n neceſſary,</hi> and of any that <hi>are ſtarved</hi> thro' want of ſuch ſupplies and allowances as are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>XI. To be in all things ſubject to the <hi>control of Congreſs,</hi> and to be <hi>accountable to them only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This view of the extenſive duty of a Financier clearly diſcovers the <hi>nature, importance, and uſes</hi> of his office. The great deſign of it is, to range the ſeveral ſources of the public revenue in order, that the <hi>whole ſyſtem</hi> of it may be <hi>clearly underſtood,</hi> that any <hi>part that is wanted</hi> may be at hand, that the whole may be <hi>raiſed</hi> with the <hi>leaſt burden</hi> poſſible to the people, and be made to go as <hi>far, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as much benefit,</hi> as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The <hi>invention of ways and means</hi> of improving the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or raiſing public money, is not a more neceſſary part of the buſineſs of finance, than <hi>economy and prudence in the expenditures.</hi> Perhaps the latter is the more important and difficult of the two. For I conceive there may be found <hi>ten men</hi> who know how to <hi>get money,</hi> to <hi>one</hi> who knows how to <hi>keep it,</hi> or <hi>pay it away with proper economy and prudence;</hi> and I apprehend that our preſent diſtreſſes, and the exhauſted ſtate of our revenues, ariſe more from defects in the <hi>laſt</hi> of theſe, than the <hi>firſt.</hi> The natural operation of this office diſcovers theſe errors, and leads to a remedy. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is manifeſt that the man, whoſe duty it is to <hi>find all the money</hi> which is to pay every department, will be moſt likely to ſtudy and introduce <hi>economy</hi> in the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to ſpy out and check any <hi>exceſſive expenſe or waſte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is further very natural to ſuppoſe, that when the Congreſs are informed with certainty of the <hi>extent of the revenue,</hi> they will calculate their <hi>expenditures within the limits of it;</hi> ſo that this office becomes a reſtraint even
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023972_0173_0FC2B76ED5E11300"/>
on Congreſs itſelf, if we can ſuppoſe them <hi>capable of any want of due conſideration or prudence</hi> in this reſpect: And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every officer of expenditure will find himſelf under <hi>ſome check</hi> alſo, when he reflects that he muſt bear the <hi>pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating eye of the man</hi> who finds all the money which he <hi>ſpends or pays out</hi> of his office. Further,</p>
            <p>The <hi>powers, rights,</hi> and <hi>privileges</hi> of this great office are alſo obvious from the above ſurvey of its nature and uſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It appears that this office is of <hi>great extent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,</hi> and therefore ought to receive from every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the States all ſuch <hi>ſuitable helps, countenance, and ſupport,</hi> as are neceſſary to procure and preſerve its <hi>uſes, proper operation, authority, and dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That this officer ought to be <hi>kept conſtantly adviſed by Congreſs, of all ſuch reſolutions</hi> of that body as reſpect the public <hi>revenues and expenditures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ſhould have right to <hi>demand all accounts,</hi> and <hi>inſpection of all books,</hi> which reſpect the public revenues and expenditures. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. That he ſhould be veſted, by commiſſion from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, with all <hi>the authority</hi> neceſſary to the full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcharge of all the duties of his office, and be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>all the privileges</hi> neceſſary to the <hi>ſucceſs, uſe, and dignity</hi> of it.</p>

From which it appears, that this office does not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with any other offices of the revenue or expenditures; ſuch as the office of <hi>Treaſurer or Treaſury Board, Auditor of Accounts,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. This office <hi>begins</hi> where they <hi>end.</hi> This office takes the ſtate and balance of the accounts of all the other officers, as they make up and finiſh them. This office arranges and brings them all into one view, and ſtates in order every branch both of revenue and expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the aggregate of which the amount of the whole is made.</p>
            <p>This brings into diſtinct and plain view, the <hi>whole ſtock, caſh, credits,</hi> and <hi>incomes of the revenue</hi> of every kind, and alſo all the <hi>debts and expenſes</hi> which are to be provided for and paid.</p>

               </gap>ther, this great officer, with ſuch a comprehenſive view of the whole ſtock and reſources of the revenue, will be furniſhed with the beſt advantages to conſider the nature and ſtrength of each of them, and to <hi>form ſuch arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and put them all into ſuch <hi>operation and effect,</hi> as to produce the greateſt ſupply with the leaſt burden to the people.</p>
            <p>This is of mighty importance. This may be done, and often is, <hi>in ſuch an injudicious and unnatural way, as to double the burden of the people, without increaſing the ſupplies;</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:023972_0175_0FC2B7714F04C5B8"/>
the worſt way that perhaps ever was or could be thought of, is that which has been adopted for five years paſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>paying the expenditures by the depreciation of the currency. This has done it indeed in ſome meaſure, but with ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of calamities as are enough to draw tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>good Financier</hi> is much the <hi>rareſt character</hi> to be found of any in the great departments of ſtate. <hi>France</hi> has had but <hi>three</hi> in 400 years, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>Duke of Sully,</hi> under <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry IV. Colbert,</hi> under <hi>Louis XIV.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Neckar. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has not had one ſince Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Lord <hi>North</hi> is equal to any that have gone before him, but his whole talents at finance are all exhauſted in <hi>running his nation in debt,</hi> and contriving ways and means of paying the <hi>intereſt</hi> by the endleſs oppreſſion of his people.</p>
            <p>The great <hi>Poſtlethwait</hi> indeed, about thirty years ago, had the true genius of financiering, as appears by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious treatiſes on that ſubject; but the ſtupid miniſtry of his time had ſo little conception of the matter, that they did <hi>not know a Financier when they ſaw one,</hi> or, like the cock in the fable, did not know the <hi>value of the jewel</hi> which <hi>ſhined</hi> in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight.</p>
            <p>We rarely read in hiſtory of any wars, or other move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>of expenſe,</hi> undertaken by any nation, but we find their <hi>finances ſoon fail,</hi> and then the movements (be they ever ſo important) muſt be <hi>diſcontinued,</hi> or <hi>ſtarved</hi> into ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trivial effect. This generally happens becauſe they have not an <hi>able financier,</hi> who can calculate and balance the <hi>expenſes</hi> and <hi>reſources,</hi> and keep the latter in ſuch effectual operation, as will be ſufficient for the exigencies of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This calamity does not always ariſe from the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes</hi> being greater than the <hi>reſources;</hi> it more commonly takes its origin from ſome or all of the following capital errors of finance:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the aſſeſſment and collection;</hi> as when the tax is not laid <hi>in ſeaſon,</hi> or is ſo laid that it does not operate by way of <hi>equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> on every part of the community; when the tax is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in the collection of taxes;</hi> by an over number of officers or other needleſs expenſe; by the <hi>embezzlement</hi> of the officers; &amp;c. &amp;c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, May 9, 1781.]</head>
            <p>I HAVE read Preſident <hi>Reed'</hi>s defence of the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Council of the 2d inſtant, for raiſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Continental currency from 75 to 175 for 1 of ſpecie, or State money; but am not convinced that that reſolution was grounded on the intereſts of this State, much leſs, that it was <hi>indiſpenſably neceſſary</hi> in our preſent circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I agree perfectly in his opinion, that it is not <hi>beneath the dignity</hi> of a government to explain any public meaſures which may be miſunderſtood thro' <hi>ignorance;</hi> but ſhould they be miſunderſtood any <hi>other way,</hi> I do not pretend to ſay how far the dignity of government might ſuffer by an explanation.</p>
            <p>I am alſo clearly of his opinion, that there has long been a number of perſons in this city, who have fermented unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſparing neither <hi>art, nor falſehood, nor violence,</hi> to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their purpoſe. We have ſeen uneaſineſſes, tumults, and ferments among our citizens riſe even to the <hi>ſhedding of blood,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>We had many tumults during mr. <hi>Reed'</hi>s adminiſtration; the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable of which was, the riotous aſſault of mr. <hi>Wilſon'</hi>s houſe, <hi>Oct.</hi> 4, 1779, in which the mob proceeded from inſulting language and violent abuſe, to actual firing with muſkets, with which they were all armed.</p>
                  <p>A great number of moſt reſpectable citizens, who were in the houſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the fire on the mob, and in fine, a number of lives were loſt.</p>
                  <p>Many of theſe rioters were taken up, and held under legal proſecution for their offence; but the Aſſembly, by their act of <hi>March</hi> 13th following, indemnified and pardoned them all.</p>
               </note> which doubtleſs originated with very <hi>bad men,</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:023972_0180_0FC2B799EA1A32C0"/>
and I could have wiſhed that inquiries and proſecutions might have gone on, till the <hi>true, guilty authors</hi> could have been diſcovered, held up to public view, and puniſhed; but government has found this inconvenient, ſo I have no more to ſay about it.</p>
            <p>I will only obſerve, that I do not think the character of our citizens is that of uneaſineſs, tumult, and faction: I rather think they have exhibited an example of great meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of tame patience, almoſt bordering on ſtupidity. Nor am I at all convinced, that the objections that have been made to the aboveſaid reſolution of Council, ariſe at all from <hi>faction,</hi> or any diſpoſition to impoſe on the unwary. When a man finds that <hi>eleven ſhillings out of every pound</hi> of his caſh, is annihilated by a public reſolution, we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to be <hi>uneaſy,</hi> without calling him <hi>factious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed, with all reſpect due to the honorable Council, to make ſome remarks on their defence. I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in cavilling at the meaſures of government, but only wiſh to caſt light on a ſubject, in which our <hi>whole State is intereſted.</hi> And, as I have never been concerned in fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ferments, tumults, or riots, but ever have been a peaceable citizen, and hearty well-wiſher to the true inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of our State, I expect a candid attention of my fellow-citizens to the arguments I offer.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The facts referred to in theſe Eſſays were, at the time of their publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, freſh in every one's memory, and matters of general notoriety; but that is not the caſe with ſtrangers, or even our own people, at this diſtance of time; therefore a ſtatement of theſe facts may be neceſſary to enable the reader to underſtand theſe remarks, and the reaſonings on them.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſembly of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> 25th of <hi>March,</hi> 1780, iſſued 100,000<hi>l.</hi> paper bills, funded on the <hi>faith</hi> of the State, ſome <hi>city lots,</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Iſland,</hi> which at that time belonged to the State (hence this emiſſion was called Iſland money:) they alſo iſſued the bills on intereſt at 5 <hi>per cent. per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe bills, thus propped up, were uſhered into the world with great confidence of the Aſſembly. They, however, paſſed in a depreciated ſtate, much below their nominal value: to remedy which, a ſubſequent act was paſſed, <hi>Dec.</hi> 23, 1780, by which theſe bills were made "a legal tender; with penalties for <hi>refuſing</hi> to take them for goods, &amp;c. <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <hi>forfeiture</hi> of <hi>double</hi> the value offered; and for the ſecond offence, of <hi>half</hi> the offender's lands, goods, and chattels, and <hi>impriſonment of his perſon</hi> during the war."</p>
                  <p>This act had ſeveral uncommon clauſes inſerted in it, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That agents for the public, collectors of taxes, &amp;c. ſhould account to the treaſury for ſuch of theſe bills as they had received, at the price or rate at which they received them, <hi>i. e.</hi> at their depreciated value.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the exchange, till <hi>Feb.</hi> 1, then next, between Continental cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and theſe bills, ſhould be 75 for 1; but the real exchange of Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental to hard money was 100 for 1, at that time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Executive Council were empowered and required to publiſh the rate of exchange between ſpecie and Continental money, in the firſt week of every month after ſaid <hi>Feb.</hi> 1: and</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That exchange, ſo publiſhed, ſhould be the exchange between <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental money and theſe bills.</hi> On <hi>May</hi> 2, 1781, the current exchange of theſe bills to hard money was 3 for 1, and to Continental, was 75 for 1; but the exchange of hard money for Continental was about 220 or 225 for 1; and the practice was, to multiply the exchange of the State bills reduced to Continental, by their exchange with hard money, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 3; which gave 225 Continental for the value of one hard dollar.</p>
                  <p>At this time, the Council declared the rate of exchange of hard money for the month of <hi>May,</hi> to be 175 for 1, which was the ſame thing (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the operation of the ſaid act of the 23d of <hi>Dec.</hi> 1780) as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the exchange of the State bills to Continental to be 175 for 1; and the practice ſtill continued of multiplying the State money reduced to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental, which was now become 175 for 1, by its hard money exchange, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 3; which made the exchange of Continental money three times 175, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 525 for 1 of hard; a vaſt and ſudden leap indeed, and which became the <hi>current exchange</hi> in <hi>leſs than a week</hi> from the declaration of the exchange by the Council.</p>
                  <p>So that every perſon who had one week before given a hard dollar for 225 Continental ones, found that he had loſt <hi>above half the value of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> as it would, at the end of the week, purchaſe but 3-7ths of a hard dollar.</p>
                  <p>This made a mighty noiſe, and deeply affected every body; as Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental money was then <hi>the general currency,</hi> and <hi>all prices in market were ſet or eſtimated in it,</hi> as much as they were in <hi>old Tenor</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> at the cloſe of the <hi>laſt French war</hi> in 1763.</p>
                  <p>This rouſed the feelings of mr. <hi>Reed,</hi> who was Preſident of the State at that time, and was ſuppoſed to be the <hi>prime mover,</hi> not only of the ſaid <hi>declaration of Council,</hi> but of the <hi>act</hi> on which it was grounded, and induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to publiſh his defence of ſaid declaration, on which theſe remarks were made.</p>
                  <p>The error really lay in the <hi>abſurdity of the law itſelf,</hi> which limited the State money to a certain exchange of Continental (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 75 to 1) with ſuch variations of exchange of hard money, as ſhould be publiſhed by Council the <hi>firſt week in every month;</hi> which exchange of <hi>hard money, by the operation of the act,</hi> became the legal exchange of the <hi>State bills,</hi> and of courſe raiſed their exchange 4-7ths higher than the <hi>real, true exchange</hi> of them was at that time, and made them bring indeed more than double the continental money which they would have purchaſed before, but did not enable the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to buy any more hard money than before.</p>
                  <p>Had the Council <hi>purſued the act,</hi> they might have <hi>been excuſed;</hi> but their <hi>error</hi> lay in declaring <hi>a falſe exchange</hi> of hard money, <hi>much below</hi> the true one, with deſign, by way <hi>of trimming and bending facts,</hi> to reduce a <hi>little</hi> the abſurd effects of the act itſelf. The true exchange of Continental for hard money, the firſt week in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1781, was about 100 for 1, where it had ſtood ſeveral months; in <hi>March</hi> it was about 115 to 1, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>April,</hi> 130; but roſe faſt thro' the month, and got up to 220, the firſt week in <hi>May.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe exchanges and the intereſting effects of every variation of them, will appear to a ſtranger as <hi>intricate and hard to underſtand</hi> as the <hi>price of ſtocks</hi> in <hi>Change-alley;</hi> but they were perfectly underſtood by people of all ranks at that time, in as much as every variation of the exchange altered the value of all their caſh on hand.</p>
                  <p>One thing makes theſe manoeuvres very important, <abbr>viz.</abbr> they not only <hi>raiſed the exchange</hi> of Continental money up to 500 or 600 to 1, but in a few days <hi>ſtopped the currency of the Continental bills intirely,</hi> after which they never paſſed at all <hi>as money;</hi> or any otherwiſe than as an article of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, at moſt deſultory and capricious exchanges from 400 to 1000 for 1.</p>
                  <p>The ſame cauſe ſo diſguſted the minds of all men with paper bills of all ſorts, that our State money (tho' undoubtedly well funded) depreciated in leſs than a month to 6 and 7 to 1: the final redemption of which, by a <hi>future appreciation,</hi> coſt this State above 120,000<hi>l.</hi> tho' we never received more than 20, or at moſt, 30,000<hi>l. real value</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps this whole tranſaction affords the moſt ſtriking proof conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of the abſurdity of all attempts to <hi>fix the value of money by a law,</hi> or any other methods of <hi>compulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this inſtance we ſee the Continental money <hi>mortally wounded,</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>fell, ended, and died,</hi> the Continental currency, aged 6 <hi>years;</hi> the moſt <hi>powerful ſtate engine,</hi> and the greateſt <hi>prodigy of revenue,</hi> and of the moſt <hi>myſterious, uncontrollable,</hi> and almoſt <hi>magical operation,</hi> ever known or heard of in the <hi>political</hi> or <hi>commercial</hi> world; bubbles of a like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I hear that ſome folks are preparing to dig the ſkeleton of it out of the grave where it has quietly reſted 9 <hi>years,</hi> that we may have the pleaſure of <hi>waſting a million or two</hi> upon its obſequies.</p>

                  <p>I hope the reader will excuſe this ſmall digreſſion; for when I came to the <hi>ſpot</hi> where the poor old CONTINENTAL died, I could not help ſtopping to mark <hi>the place</hi> with ſome little <hi>ſignal of notice.</hi>

1. The firſt fact alleged by the Council is, "<hi>that by the law</hi> of the State, and their <hi>own oaths,</hi> they are required to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:023972_0182_0FC2B7AEE84EF070"/>

publiſh the <hi>true</hi> exchange the firſt week in every month<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the whole city knows, that 175 for 1 was not the <hi>true exchange</hi> on the 2d inſtant; and the Council cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of what is known to every other perſon in the city, and which the laws ſuppoſe them to be acquainted with, or it would be abſurd to lodge the power of judgment with them.</p>
            <p>So that their <hi>variation from the true exchange</hi> cannot be excuſed by any plea of <hi>ignorance.</hi> Therefore, when they ſay, "that they have not the ſame opportunity of <hi>knowing</hi> the current rate of exchange with accurate preciſion," as the merchants have, I think it follows, that they ought to have inquired of the merchants, and gained the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate information poſſible, in a matter of that conſequence and delicacy, in which the <hi>laws</hi> of the State, their own <hi>oaths,</hi> and the <hi>intereſts</hi> of the whole State, were concerned; but not that they ſhould adopt the <hi>loweſt</hi> known rate, at which they could diſcover that any commercial tranſactions had been adjuſted.</p>

But while the obligations of the <hi>law,</hi> and their <hi>oaths,</hi> are urged, and the <hi>integrity</hi> and <hi>conſciences</hi> of the Council are deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; would any one ſuppoſe that the Council would publiſh what all the world knows to be <hi>falſe,</hi> and that under the ſanction of an <hi>oath?</hi> Could the Council, without violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every principle of truth and veracity, declare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to be 175, when there was not one perſon in the city but muſt know the contrary; Indeed I think it is bad
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:023972_0184_OFC2B7B1D0D1E498"/>
enough when a Council, by any ſolemn act, violate their <hi>faith;</hi> but when they are hardy enough to violate their <hi>oath and "veracity"</hi> too, the matter muſt look very ſerious to all good men.</p>
            <p>Further, while we are told ſo much about <hi>laws</hi> of the State and <hi>oaths</hi> of office, I am led to inquire where theſe <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>oaths</hi> have been for ſeveral months paſt, during which time the exchange was <hi>conſtantly and gradually riſing:</hi> and the Council, in the firſt week in each month as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly declaring and publiſhing the exchange to be 75 for 1, for three ſucceſſive months paſt, when there was not a ſingle perſon in the city but muſt have known the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? <hi>Conſiſtency</hi> in the acts and declarations of public bodies, is of great uſe, and much to be deſired; their <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> ſtands mightily tarniſhed, and nigh unto ridicule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another fact adduced by the Council, is, "that the rate of exchange has been, by common conſent and uſage of trade, <hi>gradually riſing</hi> for ſome time paſt; ſo that no perſon, in his private dealing, pays or receives at the rate of 75 for 1;" and the whole city may add, <hi>neither was it on the 2d inſt.</hi> (the date of their reſolution) at 175 for 1; the current exchange was known to every one to be at leaſt 220 for 1, at that time.</p>
            <p>The Council go on to argue, "that the people have raiſed it (the exchange) by common conſent, and Council have only followed them, by making a declaration of what <hi>they</hi> have done." If this allegation is <hi>true,</hi> it will juſtify the Council's concluſion; but if it <hi>is not,</hi> it may be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a provoking, inſulting attempt to impoſe a <hi>deception</hi> on <hi>"the unwary"</hi> public, and beneath the <hi>dignity</hi> of Council to adduce it. I will examine it with confidence, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry merchant in the city knows whether it is true or not.</p>
            <p>The reſolution of Council declares (if not expreſsly, at leaſt <hi>in effect,</hi> and all the effect that it could in reaſon be ſuppoſed to have) that the exchange of old Continental to State money is 175 for 1. Now the people, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent and uſage of trade, have never done this; have not raiſed that exchange to 175 for 1; it had never
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:023972_0185_OFC2B7B35BEB4EF0"/>
exceeded 75 at that time; therefore the reſolution annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the difference between 175 and 75, <hi>i. e.</hi> 4-7ths, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſomewhat more than eleven ſhillings in the pound, of all the Continental money, which every man was poſſeſſed of at that time. The truth of theſe facts and obſervations are obvious to every <hi>merchant,</hi> and indeed to every <hi>market-woman;</hi> and I leave them to ſtand on their own ground, having no diſpoſition to indulge a vein of ſarcaſm or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule on this ſerious ſubject.</p>
            <p>I would only obſerve, that this fatal reſolution has taken from thouſands their <hi>daily bread,</hi> and ruined the fortunes of many who had capital ſums of that money on hand; that all the Continental money in the <hi>treaſury</hi> of the State, or <hi>due</hi> in taxes, or any other way, is reduced more than half, to the great loſs and embarraſſment of the public; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man who has <hi>not paid</hi> his taxes, may now pay them with <hi>leſs than</hi> half the real value which thoſe paid, whoſe rates were collected one week before. "And is this reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Is this juſt?"</p>
            <p>Further, the Council adduce this fact, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "that the rate of exchange has been <hi>gradually riſing</hi> for ſome time paſt:" and they might have added, that the people have been <hi>gradually conforming</hi> themſelves to that riſe. But the caſe is widely different, when they make ſuch a ſhocking <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>art at once,</hi> as from 75 to 175. A man may deſcend from the <hi>garret</hi> to the <hi>lower floor</hi> by a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light of ſtairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any damage; but were he to deſcend at <hi>one leap,</hi> he would probably break his neck. The feelings of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny make any further explanation of this matter quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the third fact adduced by the Council, and which, I ſuppoſe, is deſigned for a clincher, and which is to afford an argument of <hi>indiſpenſable neceſſity,</hi> is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "that the State of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> had, on the 27th ult. raiſed their exchange to 150 for 1; and that the people of that State were pouring in their Continental money on us," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I cannot but ſtop here, to obſerve how quick the old tone is changed. It has been a long time urged by people of great judgment, that the only natural and ſure way to
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:023972_0186_0FC2B7C7CE4B2A18"/>
prevent our being deluged by an inundation of Continental money, is, to keep the exchange of it ſomewhat higher here, than it was in the neighbouring States. Yet thoſe very people who now, for this reaſon, force up the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, have, for years paſt, been in the bittereſt manner raiſing an outcry againſt ſuch as depreciated the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.</p>
            <p>It is true, indeed, that the <hi>Jerſey</hi> people could bring their Continental money over <hi>Delaware,</hi> and purchaſe State money at 75 for 1; and it is as true, that our people could carry the <hi>Jerſey</hi> money over the <hi>Delaware,</hi> and ſell it at 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0 for 1; and the advantage, on the whole, would be on our ſide; becauſe all the Continental money which was in the <hi>Jerſies</hi> at the date of their reſolution, coſt their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple 75 for 1, and they get no more for it here. Whereas our people, who carry their State money to them, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed it for 75, and got 150 for it.</p>
            <p>But after all, it could be but the <hi>bubble of a day;</hi> it might furniſh employment for ſtock-jobbers, ſchemers, and idle people a ſhort time, but could not continue long; it is not poſſible that advantage could be taken long of different ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes on the two ſides of <hi>Delaware,</hi> whilſt the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is ſo very great; and after all, the difference could be but trifling.</p>
            <p>For neither the reſolution of the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> nor of <hi>our State,</hi> can make the State money of either a whit more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, <hi>i. e.</hi> make it purchaſe any more hard money or any other valuable goods, than before; but the <hi>violent ſhock</hi> muſt depreciate both, as we find by experience, which is the ſureſt evidence in matters of this nature.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſalus populi, ſuprema lex.</hi> What is now to be done? Is it beſt to repeal the reſolution? I think not. The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief <hi>is done.</hi> A repeal will not <hi>remedy it.</hi> The <hi>Continental money has received its mortal wound.</hi> I do not think it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable or poſſible to <hi>heal</hi> it. The State money follows faſt after it. The exchange for hard money on the 2d inſtant was 3 for 1; it is now ſaid to be 4 for 1 at leaſt.</p>
            <p>I think we have now no choice left, but to adopt my old doctrine, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "To recur to our ſolid ſubſtance, or real
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:023972_0187_0FC2B7C9D2CD5AC0"/>
wealth, bidding a <hi>final</hi> farewel to all bubbles, vain expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and ſhadows."</p>
            <p>The preſent evil originates <hi>in the law,</hi> which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil have undertaken to <hi>execute.</hi> If a law is ſo <hi>abſurdly</hi> made as to be <hi>incapable of execution,</hi> nothing but abſurdity and perplexity can ariſe out of it. It will lie with the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in their approaching ſeſſion, to repeal the law or not.</p>
            <p>On the whole, if the Council have not increaſed the <hi>eſteem</hi> of the public by their reſolution, they are at leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to ſome <hi>compaſſion.</hi> They have undertaken a <hi>taſk that is impoſſible;</hi> and I imagine their difficulties would puzzle much <hi>abler heads</hi> than theirs. If a legiſlature ſhould make a law that a <hi>bar of iron</hi> ſhould be cut aſunder with an <hi>ax of wood,</hi> the officer entruſted with the execution of it, might think it his duty to <hi>try;</hi> but he need not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, after all his labor and chopping, to find the <hi>iron bar intire,</hi> and his <hi>ax ſadly bruiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The exchange, or operation of money, is a very nice, touchy, delicate ſubject; and no man can, by right or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, intermeddle with it, who does not <hi>underſtand its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and principles.</hi> No <hi>dignity</hi> of ſtation, or <hi>reverence</hi> of character, can ſecure a man againſt <hi>ridicule</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> when he comes to be knocked about by the <hi>magical effects</hi> of that all-powerful ſubject, when put into operation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of <hi>unſkilful hands.</hi>

                  <p>TIMOLEON was an angry writer, who appeared in the <hi>Freeman's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 16, 1781<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in vindication of the <hi>reſolve of Council</hi> on which the foregoing Remarks <hi>(of the Citizen)</hi> were made.</p>
                  <p>I ever ſuppoſed the author to be Preſident <hi>Reed;</hi> but as he choſe to ſhroud himſelf <hi>in darkneſs,</hi> and the printer would not <hi>give up his name,</hi> I did not think myſelf under any obligation to addreſs him in a <hi>ſtyle or manner</hi> due to the <hi>firſt officer</hi> of the State; but, with the greateſt freedom, treated the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance according <hi>to the merit of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whoever was the author, the arguments (ſuch as they were) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in theſe Strictures; but where the author was mean enough to <hi>leave</hi> the merits of the matter, and <hi>deſcend</hi> to low ſcurrility and perſonal abuſe, I paſſed over it, as it was of no conſequence to the public; and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked on one or two ſcandalous perſonal imputations, which I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of from any body but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the <hi>fatal importance of the faces,</hi> not any <hi>perſonal animoſity,</hi> was at that time my ſole motive for making my Remarks and Strictures, and is now the ſame for re-publiſhing them.</p>

            <p>IT is of no conſequence to the public, whether TIMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEON or myſelf have the <hi>blackeſt heart,</hi> the <hi>fouleſt mouth,</hi> or the <hi>moſt ſpiteful pen.</hi> I yield to him the <hi>palm</hi> in every article of perſonal abuſe, ſly innuendo, or groſs ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; I mean to confine myſelf to ſuch particulars as the public have an <hi>intereſt</hi> in.</p>
            <p>In my Remarks on the Reſolution for raiſing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, I obſerved that the Council, in their defence, had urged that both the <hi>laws of the State,</hi> and their <hi>oaths of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> required what they had done.</p>
            <p>I replied, that the exchange which they had publiſhed for ſeveral ſucceſſive months, was not the <hi>true exchange;</hi> and therefore could not ſatisfy either the <hi>law</hi> or their <hi>oaths</hi> of office. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to deny this, but ſays, the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part of the community repreſented the exchange as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious from 150 to 200 or 225. This I deny, and call on mr. <hi>T.</hi> to produce <hi>one virtuous perſon</hi> of the community, of
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:023972_0189_0FC2B7CD058905D0"/>
knowledge fit to be conſulted, who ever <hi>told</hi> the Council the exchange on the date of their reſolution was 175; or one reſpectable merchant (as he goes on to aſſert) who ever <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>agreed</hi> that the exchange in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> laſt, was 75 for 1. The <hi>contrary of both</hi> is well known to every body in this city. <hi>Plain fact</hi> is here notoriouſly againſt mr. <hi>T.;</hi> for which I appeal to the <hi>whole city,</hi> who are the moſt competent judges.</p>
            <p>What mr. <hi>T.</hi> aſſerts, and I deny, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that <hi>the exchange of hard money was here in</hi> February, March, <hi>and</hi> April <hi>laſt, at 75 for 1, and in</hi> May 2<hi>d, inſtant, at</hi> 175 <hi>for</hi> 1. I do not begrudge mr. <hi>T.</hi> the whole credit of his fetch, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "that the act of Aſſembly does not require the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to publiſh the moſt <hi>current rate,</hi> but ſimply <hi>the rate of exchange;</hi>" but whatever credit this precious ſubtilty may give to his ingenuity, it can afford no help to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe <hi>the exchange</hi> does mean the <hi>current</hi> or uſual <hi>exchange,</hi> from the force of the particle <hi>the,</hi> for which I refer to the moſt common <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grammar of the ſchools. The words are not <hi>an exchange,</hi> or <hi>any exchange,</hi> but <hi>the exchange,</hi> which cannot with any propriety mean any but that <hi>particular one</hi> which was moſt <hi>current</hi> or uſual at the time.</p>
            <p>But mr. <hi>T.</hi> cannot poſſibly underſtand this myſtery, how a <hi>buyer</hi> can be a <hi>loſer</hi> by the Council's declaring the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change 175. I can eaſily explain this matter of fact; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the date of that declaration, with 220 dollars the buyer could purchaſe candles or fiſh to the value of one hard
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:023972_0190_0FC2B7E192A00D18"/>
dollar; but after that declaration, he muſt pay 500 of the ſame dollars for the ſame goods; his loſs therefore is the difference between 220 and 500, <hi>i. e.</hi> 280, or <hi>ſomething more than eleven ſhillings in the pound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a computation grown very familiar in the city; and I cannot but wonder it ſhould remain ſo long a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to mr. <hi>T.;</hi> for this ſame reaſon, or to uſe the numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal figures of the reſolution (to make the matter plainer to mr. <hi>T.</hi> who diſcovers much myſtery, and ſome <hi>myſtery of myſteries</hi> in the matter) becauſe that 175 dollars bring no more after the reſolution, than 75 would bring before, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſeſſor of Continental money, and of courſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic treaſury, <hi>loſes 4-7ths of all they have on hand,</hi> and all <hi>debts due and payable</hi> in that currency.</p>
            <p>This he <hi>confidently aſſerts to be a falſehood.</hi> I think he might be aſhamed to deny a <hi>truth of public notoriety;</hi> but if he is really ſo dull as not to be able to ſee this, it is manifeſt the Council ſee it very plain, as is very evident by their attempt (tho' a vain one) to obviate the miſchiefs of it, in the payment of <hi>taxes, fines,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">By reſolve of Council, <hi>May</hi> 4, 178<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But in this he is very much miſtaken, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy adopted by the Council is <hi>void of effect,</hi> as it does not reach or remedy the <hi>miſchief;</hi> for tho' the tories and whigs too cannot pay their <hi>State money</hi> for taxes at more than 75, yet they can and daily do change their State money for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental,</hi> and pay their taxes with much leſs than <hi>half the real value</hi> which thoſe paid, who paid their taxes before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was publiſhed, and this is publicly known to every body. Nor can I ſee any thing but perſonal honeſty which prevents all our collectors from changing all the State money which they received before the reſolution, for old Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental;
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:023972_0191_0FC2B7E2B5AC47B8"/>
and paying <hi>that</hi> into the treaſury. This is the bleſſed way in which (it is the peculiar felicity of mr. <hi>T.</hi> to diſcover) our treaſury has been enriched ſince the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
            <p>If it ſtill does not appear to mr. <hi>T.</hi> that the old Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental money, either in his own deſk or in the treaſury, is reduced to leſs than <hi>half the value</hi> it had before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, the beſt way I know of to ſatisfy himſelf is, to take ſome of it to buy any neceſſaries, and he will, I doubt not, have a <hi>practical proof</hi> too ſtrong to admit a doubt; and if in this or any other way he ſhould happen to be <hi>convinced,</hi> I ſhall expect that he will <hi>publicly acknowledge it,</hi> for his own ſake.</p>
            <p>But to follow mr. <hi>T.</hi> a little further. I have ſaid in my Remarks, that "the reſolution of Council declares (if not expreſsly, at leaſt <hi>in effect,</hi> and all the effect that it could in reaſon be ſuppoſed to have) that the exchange of old Continental to State money, is 175 for 1." This mr. <hi>T.</hi> denies with great triumph. I muſt beg the reader's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here a moment; the words of the law are, that the Council are required to publiſh "the then rate of exchange between ſpecie and Continental money, which exchange, ſo publiſhed, ſhall be <hi>the exchange of the Continental money and the State money,"</hi> &amp;c. in which it is manifeſt, that the moſt expreſs deſign of publiſhing the exchange of <hi>ſpecie,</hi> was thereby to fix the exchange of the <hi>State money</hi> on a par with it; this was the effect which the legiſlature intended, and the very effect which the Council intended, as appears by their proviſion <hi>againſt</hi> the effects of it, in the caſe of taxes, fines, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet mr. <hi>T.</hi> with great aſſurance aſks, "What has this to do with the Council's publication, which has not State money in contemplation?" His <hi>law logic</hi> helps him out but poorly here, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the <hi>operation of the law</hi> on this publication, and not this <hi>publication</hi> itſelf, produced the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: he might as well deny that a <hi>miller</hi> grinds wheat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>millſtones</hi> grind it; or that a <hi>man</hi> travels a journey on horſeback, becauſe the <hi>horſe</hi> only travels; for it is very plain, that the law, without this publication, would no
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:023972_0192_0FC2B7E415689B28"/>
more have raiſed the exchange of State money, than the mill would grind the wheat without the <hi>miller</hi> to ſet it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>going, or the horſe perform the journey without the <hi>rider</hi> on his back. I therefore conclude, that every one will be convinced that my propoſition is true; and if it is true, mr. <hi>T.</hi> acknowledges that <hi>"my obſervation will apply."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> among other reaſons why the Council did not raiſe the exchange laſt month, gives this one, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> improved the <hi>credit</hi> of the old Continental money here, and therefore was not to be interrupted by any <hi>diſadvantageous alteration</hi> of the exchange.</p>
            <p>This ſpeculation was, to purchaſe Continental <hi>here</hi> at 220 for 1, and ſell it at <hi>Boſton</hi> for 75; but in the very next paragraph, he reprobates the ſame kind of <hi>ſpeculation to the Jerſies</hi> very ſeverely, I ſuppoſe, becauſe it was not ſo <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</hi> "Is this," ſays he, "a traffic which public coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are to promote and encourage?" I have no where ſaid theſe ſpeculations were <hi>good,</hi> I mentioned them as <hi>bad</hi> things; and all I ſaid, and all my argument required, was, that they were but <hi>bubbles of a day,</hi> &amp;c. and could not juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify ſo <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>ruinous</hi> a meaſure, as raiſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change to prevent their miſchief, becauſe this would make the remedy worſe than the diſeaſe.</p>

as he calls it, may have ſome palliation. But I can ſee no <hi>indecency</hi> in pointing out the evils or impracticabilities of a law, which the whole community muſt ſuffer; if this is done in ſuch a way as tends to a remedy. <hi>The numberleſs inſtances of private diſtreſs,</hi> as well as the <hi>ſtarving condition</hi> of all the public departments, and eſpecially the <hi>unprovided ſtate of the army,</hi> were my great inducements to write my Remarks, and thereby expoſe the errors which at leaſt ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated our calamities.

            <p>I cannot forbear animadverting a little on the rancorous, malignant concluſion of mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his invective againſt ſome of our citizens. I think a little <hi>decency</hi> to the place which gives him bread, might have induced him to ſpare his black epithets. It is a foul bird that beſmears his own neſt.

            <p>I did, indeed, on repeated advices of the great diſtreſs of <hi>Boſton,</hi> for flour and iron, in 1777, load a veſſel of my own with a cargo of both, and ſailed for <hi>Boſton,</hi> but was (on <hi>April</hi> 6) unfortunately taken on the paſſage, by the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus, Engliſh</hi> frigate, and carried into <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> where, after a month's impriſonment, I was releaſed <hi>on exchange,</hi> having <hi>loſt my whole veſſel and cargo,</hi> to the amount of about 2000<hi>l.</hi> hard money; for which I <hi>never had,</hi> nor <hi>do expect</hi> ever to have, the <hi>leaſt compenſation</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>I alſo did remain in the city when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured it, having, among other reaſons, a child in the ſmall-pox at the time, who could not be removed; but it is not true that I enjoyed the leaſt <hi>friendly or confidential intercourſe</hi> with them or their adherents.</p>
            <p>I ſpent three months of the time in viſiting the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> priſoners in the gaols here, and procuring and carrying to their relief, ſuch food and clothing as I could collect, at a time when their diſtreſſes were beyond all deſcription, and when it was deemed <hi>a crime</hi> to ſhow compaſſion to

them; and on the 6th of <hi>February,</hi> 1778 (long before there was any probability of an evacuation of the city) I was committed to gaol, and ſuffered not a <hi>colluſive,</hi> but a moſt ſevere, confinement of 132 days, without being able, by every poſſible application,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>When the <hi>Britiſh</hi> troops under the command of general ſir <hi>William Howe</hi> took poſſeſſion of <hi>Philadelphia, Sep.</hi> 26, 1777, my whole family then in town was myſelf and two daughters, the one a little over, and the other under, twenty years of age, and were under ſuch terrors, that I could ſcarce leave them an hour in the day-time.</p>
                  <p>On the 6th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1778, I was taken out of bed at 11 o'clock at night, by orders (as was ſaid) of general <hi>Howe,</hi> and confined in the public gaol of the city.</p>
                  <p>I was under great apprehenſions that my daughters would go <hi>out of their ſenſes,</hi> with the <hi>fright</hi> and their <hi>unprotected condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I repreſented my diſtreſs in ſundry letters to general <hi>Howe,</hi> to his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant of police in the city, and to ſundry other officers, with moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt requeſt that I might be informed of the cauſe of my impriſonment, and have an opportunity of a hearing before the general, or any court he might appoint; but never could get any anſwer or knowledge of any crime or fault charged to me, but was held in cloſe confinement till the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the evacuation of the city, 17th <hi>June,</hi> 1778.</p>
                  <p>My property to a large amount was likewiſe ſeized and conveyed into the king's ſtores; part of which I indeed recovered afterwards, but I ſuſtained a final loſs of about 500<hi>l.</hi> value, which I could never recover or obtain any compenſation for.</p>
                  <p>And more than all this, my long and cloſe confinement ſo injured my health, and impaired my conſtitution, that I am not yet, nor ever expect to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>From theſe circumſtances (which were well known to Preſident <hi>Reed,</hi> and the whole city) we may judge with what rancor and malignancy of heart it could be ſuggeſted by TIMOLEON, that <hi>my intercourſe</hi> with the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> troops was <hi>friendly and confidential,</hi> or my <hi>confinement colluſive,</hi> and of my own ſeeking, that I might plead the merit of it with my countrymen after the <hi>Britiſh</hi> were gone.</p>
               </note> to obtain any knowledge of the cauſe of my confinement; but the preſumption generally admitted was, that my <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>careful attendance</hi> on the <hi>American priſoners</hi> was thought to imply too ſtrong an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to <hi>Americans,</hi> to be compatible with either the duty or protection of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject.</p>
            <p>As to what mr. <hi>T.</hi> very malignantly ſuggeſts about <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling government, evading reſolutions of committees, and croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcontent,</hi> I beg leave to obſerve, that I never have oppoſed either <hi>projects</hi> of committees, or <hi>meaſures</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, except ſuch as have ſince, on the fulleſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the plaineſt demonſtration of fact, been <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated</hi>

by our graveſt counſels, and <hi>condemned</hi> by the general conſent of <hi>Americans</hi> as <hi>bad policy;</hi> ſuch as <hi>limitations of prices, forcing ſales</hi> of private property, <hi>tender-acts,</hi> emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>deluges of paper currency, fixing</hi> the value of paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency <hi>by law,</hi> and other <hi>abſurdities</hi> which have involved <hi>America</hi> in <hi>greater calamities</hi> than the <hi>Britiſh arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I freely ſubmit it to every ſound <hi>American,</hi> whether I may not, <hi>with</hi> good right, <hi>and without</hi> vanity, boaſt of it as an inſtance and proof of <hi>ſound judgment</hi> and moſt <hi>genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine patriotiſm,</hi> that I have <hi>early</hi> diſcovered and oppoſed thoſe <hi>ill-judged</hi> and <hi>pernicious expedients,</hi> which, by the general voice of <hi>America,</hi> are now <hi>execrated</hi> as the undoubted ſources and cauſes of our preſent <hi>corrupted morality, ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtate</hi> of defence, <hi>ruin</hi> of <hi>public faith, proſtitution</hi> of <hi>national character, loſs</hi> of the <hi>confidence</hi> of our friends, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> and <hi>diſgrace abroad,</hi> and <hi>confuſion at home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have, indeed, with great reluctance, <hi>oppoſed</hi> popular prejudices, when they were incapable of being <hi>controlled.</hi> But I freely ſubmit it to my fellow-citizens, whether time and fact have not ever juſtified my concluſions, with this only difference, that the conſequences have been verified in <hi>fact</hi> in a much <hi>ſtronger degree,</hi> and more <hi>aggravated miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,</hi> than I have <hi>delineated.</hi> If one material inſtance of my oppoſition to projects of committees, or meaſures of government, different from this, can be produced, I am content to ſtand corrected in the face of the public; and I am confident my fellow-citizens will not ſuffer me to be <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> becauſe I have told them the <hi>truth before every one could ſee it.</hi>

            <p>I do at leaſt call on mr. <hi>T.</hi> to produce the leaſt ſpark of proof of the contrary. However injurious I conſider his malignity, I am yet leſs affected by his <hi>publication,</hi> than I

ſhould have been by his <hi>ſecret whiſpers,</hi> which I could have no opportunity to contradict.</p>
            <p>I humbly beg leave to ſuggeſt further here, that out of theſe <hi>very facts,</hi> ſo ſpitefully miſrepreſented by mr. <hi>T.</hi> when they are candidly conſidered, ariſes a <hi>ſtronger proof</hi> of <hi>my attachment</hi> to the <hi>American</hi> cauſe, than moſt whigs are able to exhibit, and a much ſtronger proof than any which I even heard mr. <hi>T.</hi> ever has exhibited of <hi>his</hi> whig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm.</p>
            <p>My writings on <hi>finance</hi> are open to every body, and have met the approbation of many of the <hi>greateſt men</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica;</hi> and I believe mr. <hi>T.</hi> begins to feel the <hi>force</hi> of them: for I find he begins to '<hi>hope</hi> we ſhall have <hi>ſpirit</hi> enough to enforce a <hi>hard money tax,'</hi> which has long made <hi>a part</hi> of my ſcheme of finance, and which mr. <hi>T.</hi> has conſtantly <hi>reprobated,</hi> till now. But this does not flatter my vanity much; for I believe he might as well 'jump out of the garret into the ſtreet,' as write on the ſubject of finance at all.</p>
            <p>I have only to beg the reader to keep his eye ſteadily on <hi>the facts,</hi> not on <hi>the colorings,</hi> of mr. <hi>T.</hi> or myſelf, and from thoſe facts to form his judgment. Facts are hardy, ſtubborn things, which mr. <hi>T.</hi> or I may <hi>color</hi> indeed, but neither of us can <hi>break</hi> or <hi>bend</hi> them; ſuch as follow, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Was the current exchange of ſpecie in <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April</hi> laſt, 75 for I; or was it 175 for I on the 2d inſtant, as declared by Council?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Was the exchange required by law to be publiſhed, <hi>an</hi> or <hi>any exchange,</hi> and not <hi>the current exchange,</hi> as mr. <hi>T.</hi> quibbles?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Did the Council's declaring the exchange of ſpecie at 175, produce the ſame effect as declaring the exchange of State money at 175 would have done?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Did the Council's declaring the exchange of 75 in <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and 175 in <hi>May,</hi> which was not the then current rate of exchange, ſatisfy either the words of the <hi>law,</hi> or <hi>their oaths</hi> of office?</p>

               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:023972_0197_0FC2B7FFC751DEF0"/>
5. Did any reſpectable merchants, on conſultation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Council that the current exchange in <hi>February, March,</hi> and <hi>April</hi> laſt, was 75, or 175 on the 2d in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Did the declaration of the Council on the 2d inſtant ſo operate on the old Continental money, as to reduce the value of it to leſs than half, both in private hands and in the public treaſury?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Did the raiſing the exchange in the <hi>Jerſies</hi> afford rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by any means ſufficient to juſtify our following ſo fatal an example?</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the principal facts conteſted between mr. <hi>T.</hi> and myſelf. They are all matters of public noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety. The public are not all beholden either to mr. <hi>T.</hi> or myſelf, for the knowledge of any of them, <hi>except the 5th,</hi> of which we muſt depend on mr. <hi>T.</hi> for the neceſſary proof.</p>
            <p>If the above facts and reaſonings are true, I think it will follow, that the <hi>poiſon</hi> which mr. <hi>T.</hi> is ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to find an antidote for, will prove to be theſe <hi>poiſon truths,</hi> which he fears will have an operation to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I am ſorry, too, that they ever were truths. I am quite of opinion they are a ſort of <hi>poiſon truths,</hi> which have done, and I fear will do, much hurt; and therefore I hope I may be excuſed for putting my mark of diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation on them.</p>

            <p>THESE authors, together with TIMOLEON, are the <hi>ſons of darkneſs.</hi> The printers are not at liberty to <hi>give up their names.</hi> I take PHOCION and TIMOLEON to be the ſame perſon. But as I ſuppoſe they are aſhamed to be ſeen, I do not mean to diſoblige them by hauling them <hi>into light,</hi> but hope, whilſt it is impoſſible for me to know who they are, it will be deemed very abſurd to ſuppoſe any thing I write, deſigned for a <hi>perſonal application</hi> to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. PHOCION ſays, that "the CITIZEN has inſinuated that no merchant could <hi>have adviſed the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of the exchange at 75 in <hi>April</hi> laſt." This is <hi>not true,</hi> PHOCION; you do <hi>depart from the fact;</hi> and you <hi>know you
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:023972_0199_0FC2AD9957B5BB90"/>
do.</hi> Had you kept to the fact, your ſentence would have ſtood thus, <abbr>Viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>The CITIZEN denies that any reſpectable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ever informed the Council that the true or current ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſpecie was</hi> 75 <hi>in</hi> April <hi>laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this I have challenged TIMOLEON, and now chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge PHOCION. It is mean for you, PHOCION, to ſneak out from the point in queſtion, by ſuch an artful but piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evaſion. A man of character would be aſhamed of it; but it is eaſier to <hi>bluſh in the dark</hi> than before company.</p>
            <p>You go on to mention mr. <hi>Robert Morris,</hi> as having given his opinion and advice to publiſh "the exchange in <hi>April</hi> at 75." I have reaſon to believe that this is <hi>not true;</hi> that mr. <hi>Robert Morris</hi> never was conſulted in <hi>April</hi> laſt, nor did give any <hi>opinion</hi> or <hi>advice about publiſhing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> ſo late as <hi>April</hi> laſt; and that his opinion at that time was decidedly for publiſhing the exchange <hi>as high as the truth,</hi> if it was determined to publiſh it <hi>at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. PHOCION has called up mr. <hi>Morris'</hi>s name, which obliges me to do the ſame. Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> is eaſily conſulted, and will doubtleſs inform, if deſired, what he did ſay on the ſubject to which I refer.</p>
            <p>At an earlier period, ſay the beginning of <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> when the exchange ſtood with little variation, and the ſubſequent riſe of it was not foreſeen; when the effects of the tender law could not be known; many merchants, and mr. <hi>Morris</hi> among them, might think it dangerous to ſhock the then ſtate of our trade and currency by any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ſudden ſtart of the exchange, and might give it as their opinion and advice to publiſh it at 75. But if this is admitted ever ſo true, it does not follow that any of them ever meant to intimate thereby, that the <hi>true exchange</hi>

even in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> much leſs in <hi>April</hi> laſt; <hi>was</hi> 75.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the whole matter does not contain any the leaſt contradiction to any thing which I have aſſerted, is therefore a manifeſt departure from the fact in queſtion, and of courſe is juſt ſo much foreign matter lugged in for the mere purpoſe of artful ſhuffle and deception.</p>
            <p>Mr. PHOCION, you muſt ſtick better to the point; it is ſhameful to ſtart, ſhuffle, and evade the true matter which labours at bar; you muſt keep to the fact; if you do not do this <hi>for yourſelf,</hi> I will do it <hi>for you;</hi> for I can and will hold you <hi>ſo cloſe,</hi> that it ſhall not be in your power to <hi>ſquirm out of the graſp</hi> which pinches you. Farewell.</p>
            <p>Now mr. IMPARTIAL calls for my attention a moment. It would be hard to take no notice of this man, who ſeems to be boiling over with galliſh matter, and to have taken great pains to ſcrape together a conſiderable number of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, black words, ſuitable to expreſs it. It is eaſy to ſee what ſort of a blowing genius this is, by only caſting an eye over his <hi>"crude revilements, villanies, hollow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, peſtilent ſpirit, jaundiced eyes, feculencies of wealth, execrable characters, ſtream of diſcord, Sodom, falſe patriot,</hi> BECAUSE JEALOUS, <hi>ſneer of the States, diſappointment and malice, which are</hi> IMMORTAL <hi>with the wicked</hi> AFTER THEIR DEATH," to which may be added his poor old hackneyed word, <hi>"junto,"</hi> which he has honored with large employment in this ſervice.</p>
            <p>But I muſt beg to be excuſed from following him thro' ſuch a foul thicket of hard names, coarſe ſcurrility, and low dirt. I can eaſily believe he is not acquainted with Preſident <hi>Reed,</hi> tho' I cannot ſo eaſily admit that he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>his government,</hi> yet it is very clear he means to defend it; but as he ſeems to be very ſcant of matter, and barren of argument, it may be deemed a good-natured action to help him out a little. We generally judge of our governors as we do of our carpenters, <hi>by the goodneſs of their work when it is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will therefore attempt to lay down ſome general rules, marks, or ſigns, by which a good or bad government may
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:023972_0201_0FC2ADC070262FE8"/>
be diſtinguiſhed; by the help of which mr. IMPARTIAL may, if he pleaſes, elucidate and embelliſh the government of his hero, and ſupport it with <hi>ſome kind of argument,</hi> which will probably have more weight with the public, than any <hi>loud-ſounding, hollow</hi> encomiums whatever.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the <hi>laws protect</hi> the perſons and property of the ſubject, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but it muſt be <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>wicked,</hi> when the laws are ſo framed, as in their operation to <hi>injure</hi> and <hi>oppreſs</hi> the ſubject in his perſon or eſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the laws are held in general <hi>reverence</hi> by the people, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but it muſt be bad, when the laws are generally conſidered as <hi>iniquitous,</hi> and <hi>execrated</hi> as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the laws <hi>reſtrain</hi> wicked men, and ſupport, <hi>protect,</hi> and encourage honeſty, upright dealings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when the laws let all the <hi>rogues</hi> in the community <hi>looſe on the honeſt</hi> and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous citizen, the government muſt be very <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When men of grave <hi>wiſdom,</hi> proper <hi>abilities,</hi> and known <hi>integrity,</hi> are put <hi>into office,</hi> the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when we ſee men of <hi>wild projection,</hi> doubtful <hi>morals,</hi> and inadequate <hi>abilities,</hi> crowding themſelves by addreſs and corruption into office, the <hi>confidence</hi> of the people in the government muſt be <hi>loſt,</hi> and the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> itſelf muſt be <hi>very weak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When the laws are made a <hi>rule of duty,</hi> and <hi>bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of ſafety</hi> and <hi>protection</hi> to the ſubject, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when we ſee people impriſoned, perſecuted, and ruined, <hi>without trial, conviction,</hi> or a <hi>day</hi> in <hi>court,</hi> the adminiſtration will be deemed <hi>bad.</hi> The <hi>worſt man</hi> that ever lived has a <hi>right to a day in court,</hi> to a cool hearing, and an opportunity <hi>to ſay,</hi> by himſelf or counſel, all which he fairly can <hi>for himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. When the laws are gravely adminiſtered by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per officers, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when <hi>mobs, riots, and inſurrections</hi> infeſt the community, and diſturb the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic peace; when the force of the community is put under any <hi>other direction</hi> than that of the <hi>law;</hi> the government becomes <hi>dangerous,</hi> and all ſecurity is loſt.</p>

7. When the forces and reſources of a State are ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled, put into order, and under ſuch control, that both may be called into action and uſe, when, and to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as the public ſafety requires, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when the public debts are unliquidated or unpaid, the army ill-ſupplied or ill-paid, the force of the State dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling away, and the means of preſervation loſt, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration muſt be amazingly <hi>bad,</hi> and the State in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moſt alarming danger.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When the trade, agriculture, and mechanic arts, thoſe great ſources of, not the wealth only, but even <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> of a country, are properly encouraged, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>good:</hi> but when we ſee our merchants drove, by the <hi>oppreſſion</hi> of the <hi>laws,</hi> or <hi>abſurdity of adminiſtration,</hi> out of the State, and the farmers and tradeſmen following them with their produce and fabrics, the government muſt be <hi>bad</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When the <hi>dignity</hi> of public boards, and the <hi>perſonal</hi> reſpectability of public men, are well kept up in the minds of the people, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic <hi>boards</hi> are execrated as wanting common honeſty or pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and public <hi>men</hi> curſed, hated, and deſpiſed, as void of <hi>honor, truth, ſkill,</hi> and <hi>uprightneſs,</hi> the government muſt be <hi>bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. When we ſee the officers of government carefully attending to the forms, deciſions, and ſpirit of the laws, which ſecure the liberty of the ſubject, the government is <hi>good:</hi> but when we ſee officers in the great departments ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly and impatiently graſping at <hi>enormous, dangerous,</hi> and <hi>arbitrary powers,</hi> attempting to deprive the ſubject of the <hi>rights of a jury,</hi> the <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> and other eſſential legal forms of proceſs and trial, we have reaſon to apprehend the government is <hi>bad.</hi> Theſe are the very <hi>tyrannies</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> court, and are ranked among the <hi>capital articles</hi> of complaint, on which we ground our <hi>war</hi> againſt them, and <hi>ſeparation</hi> from them.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A good government is willing to come to the <hi>light,</hi> and to <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>public movements</hi> to the underſtandings of the ſubject: <hi>bad governments</hi> are more impatient of <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
               <pb n="196" facs="unknown:023972_0203_0FC2ADC364A1CEC0"/>
are apt to complain of the <hi>liberty of the preſs,</hi> and when remarks are made on their meaſures with ever ſo much propriety, truth, and modeſty, they rarely attend with candor, but endeavour to <hi>divert</hi> the attention of the public by <hi>artful evaſions</hi> of the matter in queſtion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of anſwers, entertain their fellow-citizens either with fulſome <hi>rapture</hi> of <hi>panegyric,</hi> or declamations of <hi>perſonal abuſe,</hi> or <hi>foul ſcurrility,</hi> neither of which has the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant relation to the grievances complained of, and which require their explanation.</p>
            <p>It may be objected that the above rules, as far as they relate to the laws, will not apply, becauſe it <hi>luckily</hi> happens that our conſtitution does not veſt the Preſident with the power of legiſlation; it is equally true, that our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not empower the Preſident to <hi>raiſe mobs,</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point committees,</hi> and therefore the objection may go to that part too. Upon this I have only to obſerve, that the whole management of the public affairs, which is ſuppoſed to be under the great influence of any <hi>prime mover,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the adminiſtration or government of ſuch a miniſter.</p>
            <p>But as I am not going to make uſe of any of theſe rules for myſelf, but wrote them ſolely for the benefit of mr. IMPARTIAL, he or any body elſe that reads them, may <hi>leave out</hi> all which he thinks <hi>not for his purpoſe,</hi> and make uſe of, and apply, ſuch of them only as he thinks <hi>apropos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the whole I have to obſerve to TIMOLEON, PHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CION, IMPARTIAL, and every other writer, that if any of them are diſpoſed to object to the truth of any fact or principle which I have advanced or may advance, and will ſtate their objections fairly and candidly, I ſhall have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in giving them all the information in my power; but if they are diſpoſed to <hi>run off in a tangent,</hi> thro' the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs wilds of <hi>abuſe, perſonal reflection,</hi> and <hi>ſcurrility,</hi> in which the public can have <hi>no concern,</hi> I muſt beg leave to inform them once for all, that I think it inconſiſtent with the <hi>reſpect</hi> I owe the public, and the <hi>dignity of character</hi> I mean to aſſume to myſelf, to follow them in ſuch a <hi>dirty career.</hi> I have neither talents nor taſte for that kind of writing.</p>

I mean to addreſs the underſtanding of my readers, not their paſſions, their biaſſes, much leſs their corrupt taſte. I mean to write on very ſerious, important ſubjects, and wiſh to convince and inform ſerious minds. I have no more ambition to be thought a <hi>witling,</hi> a <hi>punſter,</hi> or <hi>ſharp dealer</hi> in <hi>ſquibs</hi> or <hi>innuendoes,</hi> than I have to be reputed an <hi>able bruiſer,</hi> a <hi>ſly ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Facts and principles are my only objects, and the public good the great end I have in view, and it is painful to me to be diverted from my courſe by objects of <hi>low wit, ſeur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,</hi> or <hi>ſcandal,</hi> which can only raiſe a <hi>laugh,</hi> or a <hi>grin,</hi> without the leaſt advantage to the public.</p>
            <p>SINCE writing the above, I find mr. PHOCION begins to acknowledge and mend his errors. I doubt not he was compelled to this by force of very <hi>ſtrong conviction.</hi> It is <hi>human</hi> to err, it is <hi>honorable</hi> to own and correct an error, it is <hi>diabolical</hi> to perſiſt in an error after conviction.

            <p>The UNION of the Thirteen States of <hi>America</hi> is of mighty conſequence to the <hi>ſecurity, ſovereignty,</hi> and even <hi>liberty</hi> of each of them, and of all the individuals who compoſe them; <hi>united</hi> under a natural, well adjuſted, and effectual conſtitution, they are a ſtrong, rich, growing power, with great reſources and means of defence, which no foreign power will eaſily attempt to invade or inſult; they may eaſily command reſpect.</p>
            <p>As their exports are moſtly either <hi>raw materials</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi> and their imports moſtly <hi>finiſhed goods,</hi> their trade becomes a capital object with every manufacturing nation of <hi>Europe,</hi> and all the ſouthern colonies of <hi>America;</hi> their friendſhip and trade will of courſe be courted, and each power in amity with them will contribute to their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>union</hi> is of great moment in another reſpect; they thereby form a <hi>ſuperintending power among themſelves,</hi> that can moderate and terminate <hi>diſputes</hi> that may ariſe between <hi>different States,</hi> reſtrain inteſtine violence, and prevent any recourſe to the <hi>dreadful deciſion</hi> of the ſword.</p>
            <p>I do not mean here to go into a detail of all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of our union; they offer themſelves on every view,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:023972_0208_0FC2ADE3ABE0DD48"/>
and are important enough to engage every honeſt, prudent mind, to ſecure and eſtabliſh that union by every poſſible method, that we may enjoy the full benefit of it, and be rendered happy and ſafe under the protection it affords.</p>
            <p>This <hi>union,</hi> however important, cannot be ſupported without a <hi>conſtitution founded on principles of natural truth, fitneſs,</hi> and <hi>utility.</hi> If there is one article wrong in ſuch conſtitution, it will diſcover itſelf in practice, by its bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation, and deſtroy or at leaſt injure the union.</p>
            <p>Many nations have been ruined by the <hi>errors of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical conſtitutions.</hi> Such errors firſt introduce wrongs and injuries, which ſoon breed diſcontents, which gradually work up into mortal hatred and reſentments; hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate parties are formed, which of courſe make the whole community a houſe divided againſt itſelf, which ſoon falls either a prey to ſome enemies without, who watch to devour them, or elſe crumble into their original conſtituent parts, and loſe all reſpectability, ſtrength, and ſecurity.</p>
            <p>It is as phyſically impoſſible to ſecure to civil ſociety, good <hi>cement of union, duration, and ſecurity, without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> founded on principles of natural fitneſs and right, as to raiſe timbers into a ſtrong, compact building, which have not been framed upon true geometric principles; for if you cut one beam a <hi>foot too long or too ſhort,</hi> not all the <hi>authority</hi> and all the <hi>force</hi> of all the carpenters can ever get it into its place, and make it fit with proper ſymmetry there.</p>
            <p>As the fate then of all governments depends much on their political conſtitutions, they become an object of mighty moment to the happineſs and well-being of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and as the framing of ſuch a conſtitution requires great knowledge of the rights of men and ſocieties, as well as of the intereſts, circumſtances, and even prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſeveral parts of the community or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for which it is intended; it becomes a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex ſubject, and of courſe requires great ſteadineſs and comprehenſion of thought, as well as great knowledge of men and things, to do it properly. I ſhall, however, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:023972_0209_0FC2ADE54FE6FBE0"/>
it with my beſt abilities, and hope from the candor of the public to eſcape cenſure, if I cannot merit praiſe.</p>
            <p>I BEGIN with my firſt and great principle, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That the conſtitution muſt veſt powers in every department ſufficient to ſecure and make effectual the ends of it.</hi> The ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority muſt have the power of <hi>making war</hi> and <hi>peace</hi>—of <hi>appointing armies</hi> and <hi>navies</hi>—of appointing <hi>officers both civil</hi> and <hi>military</hi>—of making <hi>contracts</hi>—of <hi>emitting, coining,</hi> and <hi>borrowing money</hi>—of <hi>regulating trade</hi>—of making <hi>treaties with foreign powers</hi>—of eſtabliſhing <hi>poſt offices</hi>—and in ſhort of doing <hi>every thing</hi> which the <hi>well-being</hi> of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth may require, and which is <hi>not compatible</hi> to any particular State, all of which require money, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be made effectual without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They muſt therefore of neceſſity be veſted with a power of taxation.</hi> I know this is a moſt important and weighty truſt, a dreadful engine of oppreſſion, tyranny, and injury, when ill uſed; yet, from <hi>the neceſſity of the caſe,</hi> it muſt be admitted.</p>
            <p>For to give a ſupreme authority a power of making <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,</hi> without any power of <hi>payment</hi>—of appointing <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi> civil and military, without money to <hi>pay</hi> them—a power to <hi>build ſhips,</hi> without <hi>any money</hi> to do it with—a power of <hi>emitting money,</hi> without any power to <hi>redeem</hi> it—or of <hi>borrowing</hi> money, without any power to make <hi>payment,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. ſuch ſoleciſms in government, are ſo nugatory and abſurd, that I really think to offer further arguments on the ſubject, would be to inſult the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of my readers.</p>
            <p>To make all theſe payments dependent on the votes of <hi>thirteen popular aſſemblies,</hi> who will undertake to judge of the propriety of every contract and every occaſion of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>withhold</hi> ſupplies according to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whilſt at the ſame time, the operations of the whole may be ſtopped by the vote of a ſingle one of them, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd; for this renders all <hi>ſupplies</hi> ſo <hi>precarious,</hi> and the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic credit</hi> ſo extremely <hi>uncertain,</hi> as muſt in its nature ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all <hi>efforts in war,</hi> and all <hi>regular adminiſtration in peace,</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="unknown:023972_0210_0FC2ADE6D81B72A0"/>
utterly impracticable, as well as moſt pointedly ridiculous. Is there a man to be found, who would lend money, or render perſonal ſervices, or make contracts on ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious ſecurity? of this we have a proof of fact, the ſtrongeſt of all proofs, a fatal experience, the ſureſt tho' ſevereſt of all demonſtrations, which renders all other proof or argument on this ſubject quite unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>The preſent <hi>broken ſtate of our finances</hi>—public debts and bankruptcies—enormous and ridiculous depreciation of public ſecurities—with the total annihilation of our public credit—prove beyond all contradiction the vanity of all recourſe to the ſeveral Aſſemblies of the States. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent inſtance of the duty of 5 per cent. on imported goods, ſtruck dead, and the bankruptcies which enſued on the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle vote of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> affords another proof, of what it is certain <hi>may be done again</hi> in like circumſtances.</p>
            <p>I have another reaſon why <hi>a power of taxation or of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money,</hi> ought to be veſted in the ſupreme authority of our commonwealth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the monies neceſſary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ought to be raiſed by a <hi>duty impoſed on imported goods,</hi> not a bare 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> or <hi>any other per cent.</hi> on all imported goods indiſcriminately, but a duty <hi>much heavier</hi> on all arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>luxury or mere ornament,</hi> and which are conſumed principally by the <hi>rich</hi> or prodigal part of the community, ſuch as <hi>ſilks</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>muſlins, cambricks, lawns, ſuperfine cloths, ſpirits, wines,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such an impoſt would eaſe the <hi>huſbandman,</hi> the <hi>mechanic,</hi> and the <hi>poor;</hi> would have all the practical effects of a <hi>ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary law;</hi> would mend the economy, and increaſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, of the community; would be collected without the ſhocking circumſtances of <hi>collectors and their warrants;</hi> and make the <hi>quantity of tax</hi> paid, always depend on the <hi>choice</hi> of the perſon who pays it.</p>
            <p>This tax can be laid by the ſupreme authority much more conveniently than by the particular Aſſemblies, and would in no caſe be ſubject to their <hi>repeals</hi> or <hi>modifications;</hi> and of courſe the public credit would never be dependent on, or liable to bankruptcy by the <hi>humors</hi> of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Aſſembly.—In an <hi>Eſſay on Finance,</hi> which I deſign ſoon
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:023972_0211_0FC2ADEB58E90788"/>
to offer to the public, this ſubject will be treated more fully. <hi>(See my Sixth Eſſay on Free Trade and Finance, p. 229.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The delegates which are to form that auguſt body, which are to hold and exerciſe the ſupreme authority, ought to be <hi>appointed by the States in any manner they pleaſe; in which they ſhould not be limited by any reſtrictions;</hi> their own <hi>dignity</hi> and the <hi>weight</hi> they will hold in the great pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic councils, will always depend on the <hi>abilities</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they appoint to repreſent them there; and if they are wiſe enough to chooſe men of <hi>ſufficient abilities,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable characters, men of ſound ſenſe, extenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, gravity, and integrity, they will reap the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of ſuch wiſdom.</p>
            <p>But if they are <hi>fools enough</hi> to appoint men of <hi>trifling</hi> or <hi>vile characters,</hi> of <hi>mean abilities, faulty morals,</hi> or <hi>deſpicable ignorance,</hi> they muſt reap the <hi>fruits</hi> of ſuch folly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to have <hi>no weight, dignity,</hi> or <hi>eſteem</hi> in the public councils; and what is more to be lamented by the Commonwealth, to do <hi>no good there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no objection to the States electing and recalling their delegates as often as they pleaſe, but think it hard and very injurious both to them and the Commonwealth, that they ſhould be <hi>obliged to diſcontinue them after three years' ſervice,</hi> if they find them on that trial to be men of ſufficient integrity and abilities; a man of that experience is certainly much more qualified to ſerve in the place, than a new member of equal good character can be; experience makes perfect in every kind of buſineſs—<hi>old, experienced ſtateſmen,</hi> of tried and approved integrity and abilities, are a great <hi>bleſſing to a State</hi>—they acquire great authority and eſteem as well as wiſdom, and very much contribute to keep the ſyſtem of government in good and ſalutary order; and this furniſhes the ſtrongeſt reaſon why they ſhould be continued in the ſervice, on <hi>Plato'</hi>s great maxim, that "the man <hi>beſt qualified</hi> to ſerve, ought to be <hi>appointed".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſee a contrary maxim adopted in our <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> counſels; to make the <hi>higheſt reaſon</hi> that can be given for <hi>continuing a man in</hi> the public adminiſtration, aſſigned as a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> and <hi>abſolute reaſon for turning him out,</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="unknown:023972_0212_0FC2ADEF952CA780"/>
ſeems to me to be a ſoleciſm of a piece with <hi>many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,</hi> by which we ſet out to ſurpriſe the world with our wiſdom.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould adopt this maxim in the common affairs of life, it would be found inconvenient, <hi>e. g.</hi> if we ſhould make it a part of our conſtitution, that a man who has ſerved a three years' apprenticeſhip to the trade of a <hi>tailor</hi> or <hi>ſhoemaker,</hi> ſhould be obliged to diſcontinue that buſineſs for <hi>the three ſucceſſive years,</hi> I am of opinion the country would ſoon be cleared of good ſhoemakers and tailors.—Men are no more born ſtateſmen than ſhoemakers or tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors—Experience is equally neceſſary to perfection in both.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me that a man's <hi>inducements to qualify himſelf for a public employment,</hi> and make himſelf maſter of it, muſt be much diſcouraged by this conſideration, that let him take whatever pains to qualify himſelf in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he muſt be ſhortly <hi>turned out,</hi> and of courſe it would be of more conſequence to him, to turn his attention to ſome other buſineſs, which he might adopt when his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent appointment ſhould expire; and by this means the Commonwealth is in danger of loſing the zeal, induſtry, and ſhining abilities, as well as ſervices, of their moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and valuable men.</p>
            <p>I hear that the ſtate of <hi>Georgia</hi> has improved on this bleſſed principle, and limited the continuance of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors to <hi>one year;</hi> the conſequence is, they have already the <hi>ghoſts of departed governors ſtalking</hi> about in every part of their State, and growing more plenty every year; and as the price of every thing is reduced by its plenty, I can ſuppoſe governors will ſoon be very low there.</p>
            <p>This <hi>doctrine of rotation</hi> was firſt propoſed by ſome ſprightly geniuſes of brilliant politics, with this cogent reaſon; that by introducing a rotation in the public offices, we ſhould have a great number of men trained up to public ſervice; but it appears to me that it will be more likely to produce many <hi>jacks at all trades,</hi> but <hi>good at none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think that frequent elections are a ſufficient ſecurity againſt the continuance of men in public office whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is not approved, and there can be no reaſon for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:023972_0213_0FC2AE02EFD6B440"/>
thoſe whoſe conduct is approved, and who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be better qualified than any men who can be found to ſupply their places.</p>
            <p>Another great object of government, is the <hi>apportionment of burdens and benefits;</hi> for if a <hi>greater quota</hi> of burden, or a <hi>leſs quota</hi> of benefit than is juſt and right, be allotted to any State, this ill apportionment will be an everlaſting ſource of uneaſineſs and diſcontent. In the firſt caſe, the over-burdened State will complain; in the laſt caſe, all the States, whoſe quota of benefit is under-rated, will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy; and this is a caſe of ſuch delicacy, that it cannot be ſafely truſted to the arbitrary opinion or judgment of any body of men however auguſt.</p>
            <p>Some natural principle of confeſſed equity, and which can be reduced to a certainty, ought, if poſſible, to be found and adopted; for it is of the higheſt moment to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to obviate, and, if poſſible, wholly to take away, ſuch a fruitful and common ſource of infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, as that of apportionment of quotas has ever proved in all States of the earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>value of lands</hi> may be a good rule; but the <hi>aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that value</hi> is impracticable; no aſſeſſment can be made which will not be liable to exception and debate—to adopt a good rule in any thing which is impracticable, is abſurd; for it is phyſically impoſſible that any thing ſhould be good for <hi>practice,</hi> which cannot be <hi>practiſed</hi> at all;—but if the value of lands was capable of certain aſſeſſment, yet to adopt that value as a rule of apportionment of quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, and at the ſame time to <hi>except from valuation</hi> large tracts of ſundry States of immenſe value, which have all been defended by the joint arms of the whole Empire, and for the defence of which no additional quota of ſupply is to be demanded of thoſe States, to whom ſuch lands are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by ſuch joint efforts of the States, is in its nature unreaſonable, and will open a door for great complaint.</p>
            <p>It is plain without argument, that ſuch States ought either to <hi>make grants</hi> to the Commonwealth of ſuch tracts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended territory, or <hi>ſell as much</hi> of them as will pay their proper quota of defence, and <hi>pay ſuch ſums</hi> into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:023972_0214_0FC2AE16E0F26AF0"/>
treaſury; and this ought to be done, let what rule of quota ſoever be adopted with reſpect to the cultivated part of the United States; for no propoſition of natural right and juſtice can be plainer than this, that every part of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable property which is <hi>defended,</hi> ought to contribute its quota of ſupply for that <hi>defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then the value of cultivated lands is found to be an impracticable rule of apportionment of quotas, we have to ſeek for ſome other, equally juſt and leſs exceptionable.</p>
            <p>It appears to me, that <hi>the number of living ſouls</hi> or <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perſons</hi> of whatever age, ſex, or condition, will afford us a rule or meaſure of apportionment which will for ever <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>decreaſe</hi> with the <hi>real wealth</hi> of the States, and will of courſe be a <hi>perpetual rule,</hi> not capable of corruption by any circumſtances of future time; which is of vaſt conſideration in forming a conſtitution which is deſigned for <hi>perpetual duration,</hi> and which will in its nature be as juſt as to the inhabited parts of each State, as that of the value of lands, or any other that has or can be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Land takes its value not merely from the goodneſs of its ſoil, but from innumerable other relative advantages, among which the population of the country may be conſidered as principal; as lands in a full-ſettled country will always <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> bring more than lands in thin ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—On this principle, when the inhabitants of <hi>Ruſſia, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. ſell real eſtates, they do not value them as we do, by the <hi>number of acres,</hi> but by the <hi>number of people</hi> who live on them.</p>
            <p>Where any piece of land has many advantages, many people will crowd there to obtain them; which will create many competitors for the purchaſe of it; which will of courſe raiſe the price. Where there are fewer advantages, there will be fewer competitors, and of courſe a leſs price; and theſe two things will for ever be proportionate to each other, and of courſe the one will always be a ſure index of the other.</p>
            <p>The only conſiderable objection I have ever heard to this, is, that the quality of inhabitants differs in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:023972_0215_0FC2AE18AF369028"/>
States, and it is not reaſonable that the <hi>black ſlaves</hi> in the <hi>ſouthern</hi> States ſhould be eſtimated on a par with the <hi>white freemen</hi> in the <hi>northern</hi> States. To diſcuſs this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fairly, I think it will be juſt to eſtimate the <hi>neat va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> of the labor of both; and if it ſhall appear that the labor of the black perſon produces as much neat wealth to the ſouthern State, as the labor of the white perſon does to the northern State, I think it will follow plainly, that they are equally uſeful inhabitants in point of wealth; and therefore in the caſe before us, ſhould be eſtimated alike.</p>
            <p>And if the amazing profits which the ſouthern planters boaſt of receiving from the labor of their ſlaves on their plantations, are <hi>real,</hi> the ſouthern people have greatly the advantage in this kind of eſtimation, and as this objection comes principally from the ſouthward, I ſhould ſuppoſe that the gentlemen from that part would bluſh to urge it any further.</p>
            <p>That the ſupreme authority ſhould be veſted with powers to <hi>terminate</hi> and <hi>finally decide controverſies ariſing between different States,</hi> I take it, will be univerſally admitted, but I humbly apprehend that an <hi>appeal</hi> from the firſt inſtance of trial ought to be admitted in cauſes of great moment, on the ſame reaſons that ſuch appeals are admitted in all the States of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is well known to all men verſed in courts, that the firſt hearing of a cauſe, rather gives an opening to that evidence and reaſon which ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide it, than ſuch a full examination and thorough diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ſhould always precede a final judgment, in cauſes of national conſequence.—A detail of reaſons might be added, which I deem it unneceſſary to enlarge on here.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme authority ought to have a power of <hi>peace and war,</hi> and forming <hi>treaties</hi> and <hi>alliances</hi> with all foreign powers; which implies a neceſſity of their alſo having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient powers to <hi>enforce the obedience</hi> of all ſubjects of the United States to ſuch treaties and alliances; with <hi>full powers to unite the force</hi> of the States; and direct its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in war; and to puniſh all tranſgreſſors in all theſe reſpects; otherwiſe, by the imprudence <hi>of a few,</hi> the whole Commonwealth may be embroiled with foreign
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:023972_0216_0FC2AE19CCA7DE40"/>
powers, and the operations of war may be rendered uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or fail much of their due effect.</p>
            <p>All theſe I conceive will be eaſily granted, eſpecially the latter, as the power of Congreſs to appoint and direct the army and navy in war, with all departments thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, and puniſhing delinquents in them all, is already admitted into practice in the courſe of the preſent unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py war, in which we have been long engaged.</p>
            <p>II. But now the <hi>great and moſt difficult</hi> part of this weighty ſubject remains to be conſidered, <abbr>viz.</abbr> how <hi>theſe ſupreme powers are to be conſtituted in ſuch manner that they may be able to exerciſe with full force</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> the vaſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities committed to them, for the <hi>good and well-being</hi> of the United States, and yet be <hi>ſo checked</hi> and <hi>reſtrained</hi> from exerciſing them to the <hi>injury and ruin</hi> of the States, that we may <hi>with ſafety</hi> truſt them with a commiſſion of ſuch vaſt magnitude;—and may <hi>Almighty wiſdom direct my pen</hi> in this arduous diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The men who compoſe this important council, muſt be <hi>delegated from all the States;</hi> and, of courſe, the <hi>hope</hi> of approbation and continuance of honors, will naturally ſtimulate them to act right, and to pleaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>dread</hi> of cenſure and diſgrace will naturally operate as a check to reſtrain them from improper behaviour: but however na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and forcible theſe motives may be, we find by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, they are not always <hi>ſtrong enough</hi> to produce the effects we expect and wiſh from them.</p>
            <p>It is to be wiſhed that none might be appointed that were not <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>adequate</hi> to this weighty buſineſs; but a little knowledge of human nature, and a little acquaintance with the political hiſtory of mankind, will ſoon teach us that this is not to be expected.</p>
            <p>The repreſentatives appointed by popular elections are commonly not only the <hi>legal,</hi> but <hi>real,</hi> ſubſtantial repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of their electors, <hi>i. e.</hi> there will commonly be about the <hi>ſame proportion</hi> of <hi>grave, ſound, well-qualified men,</hi>—<hi>trifling, deſultory men,</hi>—<hi>wild</hi> or <hi>knaviſh ſchemers,</hi>—and <hi>dull, ignorant fools,</hi> in the <hi>delegated aſſembly,</hi> as in the <hi>body of electors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p n="2">2.

time, <hi>the emulation</hi> naturally ariſing between them, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a very <hi>critical and ſharp-ſighted inſpection</hi> into the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each other. Their different opinions will bring on conferences between the two houſes, in which the <hi>whole ſubject</hi> will be <hi>exhauſted</hi> in arguments pro and con, and <hi>ſhame</hi> will be the portion of obſtinate, convicted <hi>error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under theſe circumſtances, a man of ignorance or evil deſign will be afraid to impoſe on the credulity, inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or confidence of his houſe, by introducing any <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> or <hi>indigeſted propoſition,</hi> which he knows he muſt be called on to defend againſt the <hi>ſevere ſcrutiny</hi> and <hi>poignant objections</hi> of the other houſe. I do not believe the many hurtful and fooliſh legiſlative acts which firſt or laſt have injured all the States on earth, have originated ſo much in corruption as indolence, ignorance, and a want of a full comprehenſion of the ſubject, which a full, prying, and emulous diſcuſſion would tend in a great meaſure to remove: this naturally rouſes the lazy and idle, who hate the pain of cloſe thinking; animates the ambitious to excel in policy and argument; and excites the whole to ſupport the dignity of their houſe, and vindicate their own propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>I am not of opinion that bodies of elective men, which uſually compoſe <hi>Parliaments, Diets, Aſſemblies, Congreſſes,</hi> &amp;c. are commonly <hi>diſhoneſt;</hi> but I believe it rarely happens that there are not <hi>deſigning men</hi> among them; and I think it would be much more difficult for them to unite their partiſans in two houſes, and corrupt or deceive them both, than to carry on their deſigns where there is but <hi>one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alarmed, unapprehenſive</hi> houſe to be managed; and as there is <hi>no hope</hi> of making theſe bad men good, the beſt policy is to <hi>embarraſs</hi> them, and make their work as <hi>difficult</hi> as poſſible.</p>
            <p>In theſe aſſemblies are frequently to be found ſanguine men, upright enough indeed, but of ſtrong, wild projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe brains are always teeming with <hi>Utopian, chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical plans,</hi> and <hi>political whims,</hi> very deſtructive to ſociety.

viſions at beſt end in darkneſs, and the <hi>dance,</hi> tho' eaſy and merry enough at firſt, rarely fails to plunge the credulous, ſimple followers into <hi>ſloughs</hi> and <hi>bogs</hi> at laſt.</p>
            <p>Nothing can tend more effectually to obviate theſe evils, and to mortify and cure ſuch maggotty brains, than to ſee the abſurdity of their projects expoſed by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>arguments</hi> and <hi>keen ſatire</hi> which a full, emulous, and ſpirited diſcuſſion of the ſubject will naturally produce: we have <hi>had enough of theſe geniuſes</hi> in the ſhort courſe of our politics, both in our national and provincial councils, and have felt enough of their evil effects, to induce us to wiſh for any good method to keep ourſelves clear of them in future.</p>
            <p>The conſultations and deciſions of national councils are ſo very important, that the <hi>fate of millions</hi> depends on them; therefore no man ought to ſpeak in ſuch aſſemblies, without conſidering that the fate of millions <hi>hangs on his tongue,</hi>—and of courſe a man can have no right in ſuch auguſt councils to utter indigeſted ſentiments, or indulge himſelf in ſudden, unexamined flights of thought; his moſt tried and improved abilities are due to the State, who have truſted him with their moſt important intereſts.</p>
            <p>A man muſt therefore be moſt inexcuſable, who is either <hi>abſent</hi> during ſuch debates, or <hi>ſleeps,</hi> or <hi>whiſpers,</hi> or <hi>catches flies</hi> during the argument, and juſt <hi>rouſes</hi> when the vote is called, to give his <hi>yea</hi> or <hi>nay,</hi> to the <hi>weal</hi> or <hi>woe</hi> of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Therefore it is manifeſtly proper, that every natural motive that can operate on his underſtanding, or his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to engage his attention and utmoſt efforts, ſhould be put in practice, and that his preſent feelings ſhould be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every motive of honor and ſhame, to ſtimulate him to every practicable degree of diligence and exertion, to be as far as poſſible uſeful in the great diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>I appeal to the feelings of every reader, if he would not (were he in either houſe) be much more ſtrongly and naturally induced to exert his utmoſt abilities and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any queſtion which was to paſs thro' the <hi>ordeal of a ſpirited diſcuſſion</hi> of another houſe, than he would do, if the <hi>abſolute deciſion</hi> depended on <hi>his own houſe,</hi> without any further inquiry or challenge on the ſubject.</p>

As Congreſs will ever be compoſed of men delegated by the ſeveral States, it may well be ſuppoſed that they have the <hi>confidence</hi> of their ſeveral States, and underſtand well the policy and preſent condition of them; it may alſo be ſuppoſed that they come with ſtrong <hi>local attachments,</hi> and habits of thinking limited to the <hi>intereſts</hi> of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular States: it may therefore be ſuppoſed they will need much information, in order to their gaining that <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ideas,</hi> and great comprehenſion of thought, which will be neceſſary to enable them to think properly on that <hi>large ſcale,</hi> which takes into view the intereſts of all the States.</p>
            <p>The greateſt care and wiſdom is therefore requiſite to give them the beſt and ſureſt information, and of that kind that may be the moſt ſafely relied on, to prevent their being deluded or prejudiced by partial repreſentations, made by intereſted men who have particular views.</p>
            <p>This <hi>information</hi> may perhaps be beſt made by <hi>the great miniſters of ſtate,</hi> who ought to be men of the <hi>greateſt abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> and <hi>integrity;</hi> their buſineſs is confined to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral departments, and their attention engaged ſtrongly and conſtantly to all the ſeveral parts of the ſame; the whole arrangement, method, and order of which, are formed, ſuperintended, and managed in their offices, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations relative to their departments centre there.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>miniſters</hi> will of courſe have the beſt information, and moſt perfect knowledge, of the ſtate of the Nation, as far as it relates to their ſeveral departments, and will of courſe be able to give the <hi>beſt information</hi> to Congreſs, in what manner any bill propoſed will affect the public inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in their ſeveral departments, which will nearly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the whole.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Financier</hi> manages the whole ſubject of <hi>revenues</hi> and <hi>expenditures</hi>—the <hi>Secretary of State</hi> takes knowledge of the general <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> government—the <hi>miniſter of war</hi> preſides in the whole buſineſs of <hi>war</hi> and <hi>defence</hi>—and the <hi>miniſter of foreign affairs</hi> regards the whole ſtate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it ſtands related to, or connected with, all foreign powers.</p>

I mention a <hi>Secretary of State,</hi> becauſe all other nations have one, and I ſuppoſe we ſhall need one as much as they, and the multiplicity of affairs which naturally fall into his office will grow ſo faſt, that I imagine we ſhall ſoon be under neceſſity of appointing one.</p>
            <p>To theſe I would add <hi>Judges of law,</hi> and <hi>chancery;</hi> but I fear they will not be very ſoon appointed—the one ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the exiſtence of <hi>law,</hi> and the other of <hi>equity</hi>—and when we ſhall be altogether convinced of the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the real and effectual exiſtence of both theſe, we ſhall probably appoint proper heads to preſide in thoſe departments.—I would therefore propoſe,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That when <hi>any bill ſhall paſs the ſecond reading</hi> in the houſe in which it originates, and before it ſhall be finally enacted, copies of it ſhall be ſent to <hi>each of the ſaid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of ſtate,</hi> in being at the time, who ſhall give ſaid houſe <hi>in writing,</hi> the fulleſt information in their power, and their moſt explicit ſentiments of the operation of the ſaid bill on the public intereſt, as far as relates to their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective departments,</hi> which ſhall be received and read in ſaid houſe, and <hi>entered on their minutes,</hi> before they finally paſs the bill; and when they ſend the bill for concurrence to the <hi>other houſe,</hi> they ſhall ſend therewith the ſaid <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of the ſaid miniſters of ſtate,</hi> which ſhall likewiſe be read in that houſe before their concurrence is finally paſſed.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to give theſe great miniſters of ſtate a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative on Congreſs,</hi> but I mean to oblige Congreſs to receive <hi>their advices</hi> before they paſs their bills, and that every <hi>act</hi> ſhall be <hi>void</hi> that is not paſſed with theſe forms; and I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propoſe, that either houſe of Congreſs may, if they pleaſe, admit the ſaid <hi>miniſters</hi> to be <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt</hi> in the debates of the houſe, but <hi>without any right of vote</hi> in the deciſion.</p>
            <p>It appears to me, that if every act ſhall paſs ſo many different corps of <hi>diſcuſſion</hi> before it is completed, where each of them ſtake their characters on the advice or vote they give, there will be all the <hi>light thrown on the caſe,</hi> which the nature and circumſtances of it can admit, and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:023972_0222_0FC2AE4085CC96B0"/>
any <hi>corrupt</hi> man will find it extremely difficult to foiſt in any erroneous clauſe whatever; and every <hi>ignorant or lazy</hi> man will find the ſtrongeſt inducements to make himſelf maſter of the ſubject, that he may appear with ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable degree of character in it; and the whole will find themſelves in a manner compelled, diligently and ſincerely to ſeek for the <hi>real ſtate</hi> of the facts, and the natural <hi>fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth</hi> ariſing from them, <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole <hi>natural principles</hi> on which the ſubject depends, and which alone can endure every teſt, to the end that they may have not only the inward ſatisfaction of <hi>acting properly</hi> and uſefully for the States, but alſo the <hi>credit and character</hi> which is or ought ever to be annexed to ſuch a conduct.</p>
            <p>This will give the great <hi>laws</hi> of Congreſs the higheſt <hi>probability, preſumption, and means of right, fitneſs, and truth,</hi> that any laws whatever can have at their firſt enaction, and will of courſe afford the higheſt reaſon for the confidence and acquieſcence of the States, and all their ſubjects, in them; and being grounded in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>natural fitneſs,</hi> their operation will be <hi>eaſy,</hi> ſalutary, and ſatisfactory.</p>
            <p>If experience ſhall diſcover <hi>errors</hi> in any law (for prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice will certainly diſcover ſuch errors, if there be any) the legiſlature will always be able to correct them, by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, amendments, or new laws as ſhall be found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but as it is much eaſier to <hi>prevent</hi> miſchiefs than to <hi>remedy</hi> them, all poſſible caution, prudence, and attention ſhould be uſed, to make the laws <hi>right at firſt.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. There is <hi>another body of men</hi> among us, whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, and whoſe full and extenſive intelligence, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and domeſtic, naturally make them more perfectly acquainted with the ſources of our wealth, and whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſts are more intimately and neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the general proſperity of the country, than any other order of men in the States.—I mean the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;</hi> and I could wiſh that Congreſs might have the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that <hi>extenſive and important information,</hi> which this body of men are very capable of laying before them.</p>
            <p>TRADE is of ſuch eſſential importance to our intereſts, and ſo intimately connected with all our ſtaples, great and
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:023972_0223_0FC2AE420CD0BB30"/>
ſmall, that no ſources of our wealth can flouriſh, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the general benefit of the community, <hi>without it.</hi> Our <hi>huſbandry,</hi> that grand ſtaple of our country, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceed our home conſumption <hi>without this</hi>—it is plain at firſt ſight, that the <hi>farmer</hi> will not toil and ſweat thro' the year to raiſe great plenty of the produce of the ſoil, if there is <hi>no market</hi> for his produce, when he has it ready for ſale, <hi>i. e.</hi> if there are no merchants to buy it.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the <hi>manufacturer</hi> will not lay out his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs on any large ſcale, if there is no merchant to buy his fabrics when he has finiſhed them; a <hi>vent</hi> is of the moſt eſſential importance to every manufacturing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—the merchants, therefore, become the natural negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the wealth of the country, who take off the <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> and ſupply the <hi>wants,</hi> of the inhabitants;—and as this negotiation is the buſineſs of their lives, and the ſource of their own wealth, they of courſe become better acquainted with both our abundance and wants, and are more intereſted in finding and improving the beſt <hi>vent</hi> for the one, and <hi>ſupply</hi> of the other, than any other men among us, and they have a natural intereſt in making both the purchaſe and ſupply as convenient to their cuſtomers as poſſible, that they may ſecure their cuſtom, and thereby increaſe their own buſineſs.</p>
            <p>It follows then, that the merchants are not only <hi>qualified to give the fulleſt and moſt important information</hi> to our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme legiſlature, concerning the ſtate of our trade—the abundance and wants,—the wealth and poverty, of our people, <hi>i. e.</hi> their moſt important intereſts, but are alſo the moſt likely to do it <hi>fairly</hi> and <hi>truly,</hi> and to forward with their influence, every meaſure which will operate to the convenience and benefit of our commerce, and oppoſe with their whole weight and ſuperior knowledge of the ſubject, any <hi>wild ſchemes,</hi> which an ignorant or arbitrary legiſlature may attempt to introduce, to the hurt and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment of our intercourſe both with one another, and with foreigners.</p>
            <p>The States of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> have ever been govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>merchants,</hi> or at leaſt their policy has ever been
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:023972_0224_0FC2AE439D469930"/>
under the great influence of that ſort of men. No States have been better ſerved, as appears by their great ſucceſs, the eaſe and happineſs of their citizens, as well as the ſtrength and riches of their Commonwealths: the one is the <hi>oldeſt,</hi> and the other the <hi>richeſt,</hi> State in the world of equal number of people—the one has maintained ſundry wars with the <hi>Grand Turk</hi>—and the other has withſtood the power of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>capitals</hi> of both have long been the principal marts of the ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe</hi> in which they are ſituated; and the <hi>banks</hi> of both are the beſt ſupported, and in the beſt credit, of any <hi>banks in Europe,</hi> tho' their countries or territories are very ſmall, and their inhabitants but a handful, when compared with the great States in their neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Merchants muſt, from the nature of their buſineſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly underſtand the intereſts and reſources of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the beſt of any men in it; and I know not of <hi>any one reaſon</hi> why they ſhould be deemed <hi>leſs upright or patriotic,</hi> than any other rank of citizens whatever.</p>
            <p>I therefore humbly propoſe, if the merchants in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral States are diſpoſed to ſend delegates from their body, to meet and attend the ſitting of Congreſs, that they ſhall be permitted to form a <hi>chamber of commerce,</hi> and <hi>their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> to Congreſs be <hi>demanded and admitted</hi> concerning all bills before Congreſs, as far as the ſame may affect the <hi>trade of the States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no idea that the continent is made for Congreſs: I take them to be no more than the upper ſervants of the great political body, who are to find out things by <hi>ſtudy and inquiry</hi> as other people do; and therefore I think it neceſſary to place them under the beſt poſſible advantages for information, and to require them to improve all thoſe advantages, to qualify themſelves in the beſt manner poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the wiſe and uſeful diſcharge of the vaſt truſt and mighty authority repoſed in them; and as I conceive the advice of the merchants to be one of the greateſt ſources of mercantile information, which is any where placed within their reach, it ought by no means to be neglected,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:023972_0225_0FC2AE64AAD0B180"/>
but ſo huſbanded and improved, that the greateſt poſſible advantages may be derived from it.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, I have another reaſon why the merchants ought to be conſulted; I take it to be very plain that the huſbandry and manufactures of the country muſt be ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the preſent weight of taxes is continued on them much longer, and of courſe a very great part of our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue muſt ariſe from <hi>impoſts on merchandiſe,</hi> which will fall directly within the merchants' ſphere of buſineſs, and of courſe their concurrence and advice will be of the utmoſt conſequence, not only to direct the propereſt mode of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying thoſe duties, but alſo to get them carried into quiet and peaceable execution</p>
            <p>No men are more converſant with the citizens, or more intimately connected with their intereſts, than the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and therefore their weight and influence will have a mighty effect on the minds of the people. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect an inſtance, in which the Court of <hi>London</hi> ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the remonſtrances and advices of the merchants, and did not ſuffer ſeverely for their pride. We have ſome ſtriking inſtances of this in the diſregarded advices and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of very many <hi>Engliſh</hi> merchants againſt the <hi>American</hi> war, and their fears and apprehenſions we ſee verified, almoſt like prophecies, by the event.</p>
            <p>I know not why I ſhould continue this argument any longer, or indeed why I have urged it ſo long, in as much as I cannot conceive that Congreſs or any body elſe will deem it below the dignity of the ſupreme power to conſult ſo important an order of men, in matters of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, which fall immediately under their notice, and in which their experience, and of courſe their knowledge and advice are preferable to thoſe of any other order of men.</p>

            <p>It may be further objected that the forms herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed will <hi>embarraſs the buſineſs</hi> of Congreſs, and make it at beſt <hi>ſlow and dilatory.</hi> As far as this form will prevent the hurrying a bill thro' the houſe without due examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>objection</hi> itſelf becomes an <hi>advantage</hi>—at moſt theſe checks on the ſupreme authority can have no further effect than to <hi>delay or deſtroy a good bill,</hi> but cannot <hi>paſs a bad one;</hi> and I think it much better in the main, to <hi>loſe a good bill</hi> than to ſuffer a <hi>bad one to paſs</hi> into a law.—Beſides it is not to be ſuppoſed that clear, plain caſes will meet with embarraſſment, and it is moſt ſafe that untried, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, difficult matters ſhould paſs thro' the graveſt and fulleſt diſcuſſion, before the ſanction of law is given to them.</p>
            <p>But what is to be done if the <hi>two houſes grow jealous and ill-natured,</hi> and after all their information and advice, grow out of humor and inſincere, and <hi>no concurrence can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</hi>—I
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:023972_0227_0FC2AE6B44A8CB78"/>
anſwer, <hi>ſit ſtill and do nothing</hi> till they get into better humor: I think this much better than to paſs laws in ſuch a temper and ſpirit, as the objection ſuppoſes.</p>
            <p>It is however an ill compliment to ſo many grave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, to ſuppoſe them capable of throwing aſide their reaſon, and giving themſelves up like children to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol of their paſſions; or, if this ſhould happen for a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that it ſhould continue any <hi>length of time,</hi> is hardly to be preſumed of a body of men placed in ſuch high ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>importance,</hi> with the <hi>eyes of all the world</hi> upon them—but if they ſhould, after all, be capable of this, I think it madneſs to ſet them to making laws, during ſuch fits—it is beſt, when they are in <hi>no condition to do good,</hi> to keep them <hi>from doing hurt,</hi>—and if they do not grow wiſer in reaſonable time, I know of nothing better, than to be aſhamed of our old appointments, and make new ones.</p>
            <p>But what if the country is invaded, or ſome other exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency happens, ſo preſſing that the ſafety of the State re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires an immediate reſolution?—I anſwer, what would you do if ſuch a caſe ſhould happen, where there was <hi>but one houſe, unchecked,</hi> but <hi>equally divided,</hi> ſo that a legal vote could <hi>not be obtained.</hi> The matter is certainly equally diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and embarraſſed in both caſes: but in the caſe propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I know of no better way than that which the <hi>Romans</hi> adopted on the like occaſion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that both houſes meet in one chamber, and chooſe a <hi>dictator,</hi> who ſhould have and exerciſe the <hi>whole power of both houſes,</hi> till ſuch time as they ſhould be able to concur in diſplacing him, and that the whole power of the two houſes ſhould be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mean time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I further propoſe, that no grant of money whatever ſhall be made, without <hi>an appropriation,</hi> and that <hi>rigid pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties</hi> (no matter how great, in my opinion the halter would be mild enough) ſhall be inflicted on any perſon, however auguſt his ſtation, who ſhould <hi>give order, or vote for</hi> the payment, or actually pay one ſhilling of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to any <hi>other purpoſe than that of its appropriation,</hi> and that no order whatever of any ſuperior in office ſhall juſtify
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:023972_0228_0FC2AE6CE20A37D8"/>
ſuch payment, but every order ſhall expreſs what funds it is drawn upon, and what appropriation it is to be charged to, or the order ſhall not be paid.</p>
            <p>This kind of embezzlement is of ſo fatal a nature, that <hi>no meaſures or bounds</hi> are to be obſerved in curing it; when miniſters will ſet forth the moſt <hi>ſpecious</hi> and <hi>neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> for money, and <hi>induce</hi> the people to pay it in full tale; and when they have gotten poſſeſſion of it, to neglect the great objects for which it was given, and <hi>pay it,</hi> ſometimes <hi>ſquander it away,</hi> for different purpoſes, oftentimes for <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> yea, <hi>hurtful ones,</hi> yea, often even to <hi>bribe</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> the very officers of government, to <hi>betray</hi> their truſt, and <hi>contaminate the State,</hi> even in its <hi>public offices</hi>—to force peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>buy</hi> their <hi>own deſtruction,</hi> and <hi>pay for it with their hard labor,</hi> the very ſweat of their brow, is a <hi>crime</hi> of ſo high a nature, that I know not any <hi>gibbet too cruel</hi> for ſuch offenders.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I would further propoſe, that the aforeſaid <hi>great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of ſtate ſhall compoſe a Council of State, to whoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Congreſs may add three others,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> one from <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> one from the <hi>middle States,</hi> and one from the <hi>ſouthern States,</hi> one of which to be <hi>appointed Preſident by Congreſs;</hi> to all of whom ſhall be committed the <hi>ſupreme executive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the States</hi> (all and ſingular of them ever account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Congreſs) who ſhall ſuperintend all the executive departments, and appoint all executive officers, who ſhall ever be accountable to, and removable for juſt cauſe by, them or Congreſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> either of them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I propoſe further, that the powers of Congreſs, and all the other departments acting under them, ſhall all be <hi>reſtricted to ſuch matters only of general neceſſity and utility</hi> to all the States, as cannot come <hi>within the juriſdiction</hi> of any particular State, or to which the <hi>authority</hi> of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular State is not <hi>competent:</hi> ſo that each particular State ſhall enjoy all ſovereignty and ſupreme authority to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, excepting only thoſe high authorities and powers by them delegated to Congreſs, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the general union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="unknown:023972_0229_0FC2AE7F99F2D280"/>
There remains one very important article ſtill to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> what methods the conſtitution ſhall point out, to <hi>enforce the acts</hi> and <hi>requiſitions of Congreſs</hi> thro' the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States; and how the States which <hi>refuſe or delay</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſuch acts or requiſitions, ſhall be treated: this, I know, is a particular of the greateſt delicacy, as well as of the utmoſt importance; and therefore, I think, ought to be decidedly ſettled by the conſtitution, in our cooleſt hours, whilſt no paſſions or prejudices exiſt, which may be excited by the great intereſts or ſtrong circumſtances of any particular caſe which may happen.</p>
            <p>I know that ſupreme authorities are liable to err, as well as ſubordinate ones. I know that courts may be in the wrong, as well as the people; ſuch is the imperfect ſtate of human nature in all ranks and degrees of men; but we muſt take human nature as it is; it cannot be mended; and we are compelled both by wiſdom and neceſſity, to adopt ſuch methods as promiſe the greateſt <hi>attainable</hi> good, tho' perhaps not the greateſt <hi>poſſible,</hi> and ſuch as are liable to the <hi>feweſt</hi> inconveniences, tho' not altogether <hi>free</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>This is a queſtion of ſuch magnitude, that I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to premiſe the great natural principles on which its deciſion ought to depend—In the preſent ſtate of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all human life is a life of chances; it is impoſſible to make any intereſt ſo certain, but there will be a chance againſt it; and we are in all caſes obliged to adopt a chance againſt us, in order to bring ourſelves within the benefit of a greater chance in our favor; and that calculation of chances which is grounded on the great natural principles of truth and fitneſs, is of all others the moſt likely to come out right.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>No laws of any State whatever, which do not carry in them a force which extends to their effectual and final execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can afford a certain or ſufficient ſecurity to the ſubject:</hi> this is too plain to need any proof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Laws or ordinances of any kind (eſpecially of auguſt bodies of high dignity and conſequence) which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

expoſe it to contempt; deſtroy the confidence of all men, natives and foreigners, in it; and expoſe both ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate bodies and individuals, who have placed confidence in it, to many ruinous diſappointments, which they would have eſcaped, had no law or ordinance been made: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To appoint a Congreſs with powers to do <hi>all acts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſupport and uſes of the union;</hi> and at the ſame time to leave all the States at liberty to <hi>obey them or not with impunity,</hi> is, in every view, the groſſeſt <hi>abſurdity,</hi> worſe than a ſtate of nature without any ſupreme authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all, and at beſt a ridiculous effort of childiſh non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe: and of courſe,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Every State in the Union is under the higheſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>to obey the ſupreme authority of the whole,</hi> and in the <hi>higheſt degree amenable to it,</hi> and ſubject to the <hi>higheſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for diſobedience</hi>—Yet all this notwithſtanding, I think the ſoul that ſins ſhould die, <hi>i. e.</hi> the cenſure of the great ſupreme power, ought to be ſo directed, if poſſible, as to light on thoſe perſons, who have betrayed their country, and expoſed it to diſſolution, by oppoſing and rejecting that ſupreme authority, which is the <hi>band of our union,</hi> and from whence proceeds the <hi>principal ſtrength and energy</hi> of our government.</p>
            <p>I therefore propoſe, that every <hi>perſon</hi> whatever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>public</hi> or <hi>private character,</hi> who ſhall, by <hi>public vote</hi> or other <hi>overt act, diſobey the ſupreme authority,</hi>

            <p>It may be objected here, that this will make a Member of Aſſembly accountable to Congreſs for his vote in Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; I anſwer, it does ſo <hi>in this only caſe,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> when that vote <hi>is to diſobey the ſupreme authority:</hi> no Member of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly can have right to give <hi>ſuch a vote,</hi> and therefore ought to be puniſhed for ſo doing—When the ſupreme authority is diſobeyed, the government muſt loſe its energy
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:023972_0231_0FC2AE89A87C49D0"/>
and effect, and of courſe the Empire muſt be ſhaken to its very foundation.</p>
            <p>A government which is but <hi>half executed,</hi> or whoſe <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may all be ſtopped by a ſingle vote,</hi> is the moſt <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all inſtitutions.</hi>—See the preſent <hi>Poland,</hi> and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Greece</hi> buried in ruins, in conſequence of this fatal error in their policy. A government which has not energy and effect, can never afford protection or ſecurity to its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>i. e.</hi> muſt ever be ineffectual to its own ends.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore admit, that the great ends of our Union ſhould lie at the mercy of a ſingle State, or that the energy of our government ſhould be checked by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle diſobedience, or that ſuch diſobedience ſhould ever be ſheltered from cenſure and puniſhment; the conſequence is too capital, too fatal to be admitted. Even tho' I know very well that a ſupreme authority, with all its dignity and importance, is ſubject to paſſions like other leſſer pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they may be and often are heated, violent, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, and very tyrannical; yet I know alſo, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is not to be hoped for in this life, and we muſt take all inſtitutions with their natural defects, or reject them altogether: I will guard againſt theſe abuſes of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as far as poſſible, but I cannot give up all government, or deſtroy its neceſſary energy, for fear of theſe abuſes.</p>
            <p>But to fence them out as far as poſſible, and to give the States as great a check on the ſupreme authority, as can conſiſt with its neceſſary energy and effect,</p>
            <p>I propoſe that any State may petition Congreſs to repeal any law or deciſion which they have made, and if <hi>more than half the States</hi> do this, the <hi>law or deciſion ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed,</hi> let its nature or importance be however great, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting only ſuch acts as <hi>create funds for the public credit,</hi> which ſhall never be repealed till their end is effected, or other funds equally effectual are ſubſtituted in their places; but Congreſs ſhall not be obliged to repeal any of theſe acts, ſo petitioned againſt, till they have time to lay the reaſons of ſuch acts before ſuch petitioning States, and to receive their anſwer; becauſe ſuch petitions may ariſe from ſudden heats, popular prejudices, or the publication
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:023972_0232_0FC2AE9A0C69BFE8"/>
of matters falſe in fact, and may require time and means of cool reflection and the fulleſt information, before the final deciſion is made: but if after all, <hi>more than half</hi> the States perſiſt in their demand of a repeal, it ſhall take place.</p>
            <p>The reaſon is, the <hi>uneaſineſs of a majority</hi> of States af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a ſtrong <hi>preſumption</hi> that the act is <hi>wrong,</hi> for unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ariſes much more frequently from <hi>wrong</hi> than <hi>right;</hi> but if the act was <hi>good and right,</hi> it would ſtill be better to <hi>repeal</hi> and <hi>loſe</hi> it, than to <hi>force</hi> the execution of it againſt the opinion of a <hi>major part</hi> of the States; and laſtly, if every act of Congreſs is ſubject to this repeal, Congreſs itſelf will have <hi>ſtronger inducement</hi> not only to examine well the ſeveral acts under their conſideration, but alſo to <hi>communicate the reaſons</hi> of them to the States, than they would have, if their ſimple vote gave <hi>the final ſtamp of irrevocable authority</hi> to their acts.</p>
            <p>Further I propoſe, that if the <hi>execution of any act or order of the ſupreme authority ſhall be oppoſed by force in any of the States</hi> (which God forbid!) it ſhall be lawful for Congreſs to ſend into ſuch State <hi>a ſufficient force to ſuppreſs it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the whole, I take it that the very <hi>exiſtence and uſe of our union</hi> eſſentially depends on the <hi>full energy and final effect</hi> of the laws made to ſupport it; and therefore I <hi>ſacrifice all other conſiderations to this energy and effect,</hi> and if our UNION is not worth this purchaſe, we muſt give it up—the <hi>nature of the thing</hi> does not admit any other alternative.</p>
            <p>I do contend that <hi>our UNION is worth this purchaſe</hi>—<hi>with it,</hi> every individual reſts ſecure under its protection againſt foreign or domeſtic inſult and oppreſſion—<hi>without it,</hi> we can have no ſecurity againſt the oppreſſion, inſult, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of foreign powers; for no ſingle State is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance enough to be an object of treaty with them, nor, if it was, could it bear the expenſe of ſuch treaties, or ſupport any character or reſpect in a diſſevered ſtate, but muſt loſe all reſpectability among the nations abroad.</p>
            <p>We have a very <hi>extenſive trade,</hi> which cannot be carried on with ſecurity and advantage, <hi>without treaties</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and alliance with foreign nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="unknown:023972_0233_0FC2AE9C2DCED650"/>
We have an <hi>extenſive weſtern territory</hi> which cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be defended againſt the invaſion of foreign nations, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on our frontiers, who will cover it with their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and we ſhall loſe it for ever, and our extent of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire be thereby reſtrained; and what is worſe, their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous poſterity will in future time drive ours into the ſea, as the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> formerly conquered the <hi>Romans</hi> in like circumſtances, unleſs we have the force of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to repel ſuch invaſions. We have, without the union, no ſecurity againſt the <hi>inroads and wars of one State upon another,</hi> by which our <hi>wealth and ſtrength,</hi> as well as <hi>eaſe and comfort, will be devoured by enemies growing out of our own bowels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conclude then, that our UNION is not only of the moſt eſſential conſequence to the well-being of the States in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but to that of every individual citizen of them, and of courſe ought to be ſupported, and made as uſeful and ſafe as poſſible, by a conſtitution which admits that <hi>full energy</hi> and <hi>final effect of government which alone can ſecure its great ends and uſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a diſſertation of this ſort, I would not wiſh to deſcend to <hi>minutiae,</hi> yet there are ſome ſmall matters which have important conſequences, and therefore ought to be noticed. It is neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould have all uſual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary powers of <hi>ſelf-preſervation and order, e. g.</hi> to <hi>impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for contempt, inſult, or interruption,</hi> &amp;c. and to <hi>expel their own members</hi> for due cauſes, among which I would rank that of <hi>non-attendance</hi> on the houſe, or <hi>partial attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> without ſuch excuſe as ſhall ſatisfy the houſe.</p>
            <p>Where there is ſuch a vaſt authority and truſt devolved on Congreſs, and the grand and moſt important intereſts of the Empire reſt on their deciſions, it appears to me highly unreaſonable that we ſhould ſuffer their <hi>auguſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations to be ſuſpended,</hi> or their <hi>dignity, authority,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence leſſened</hi> by the <hi>idleneſs, neglect, and non-attendance</hi> of its members; for we know that the acts of a <hi>thin houſe</hi> do not uſually carry with them the ſame degree of weight and reſpect as thoſe of a <hi>full</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="227" facs="unknown:023972_0234_0FC2AE9DB79A9A98"/>
Beſides I think, when a man is deputed a delegate in Congreſs, and has undertaken the buſineſs, the <hi>whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> becomes of courſe poſſeſſed of a <hi>right to his beſt and conſtant ſervices,</hi> which if any member refuſes or neglects, the Empire is <hi>injured</hi> and ought to <hi>reſent the injury,</hi> at leaſt ſo far as to <hi>expel</hi> and <hi>ſend him home,</hi> that ſo his place may be <hi>better ſupplied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one argument in favor of my whole plan, <abbr>viz.</abbr> it is ſo formed that no men of <hi>dull</hi> intellects, or <hi>ſmall knowledge,</hi> or of <hi>habits too idle</hi> for conſtant attendance, or cloſe and ſteady attention, can do the buſineſs with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable degree of reſpectability, nor can they find either honor, profit, or ſatisfaction in being there, and of courſe, I could wiſh that the choice of the electors might never fall on <hi>ſuch a man,</hi> or if it ſhould, that he might have <hi>ſenſe enough</hi> (of <hi>pain</hi> at leaſt, if not of <hi>ſhame</hi>) to decline his acceptance.</p>
            <p>For after all that can be done, I do not think that a good adminiſtration depends wholly on a good conſtitution and good laws, for inſufficient or bad men will always make <hi>bad work,</hi> and <hi>a bad adminiſtration,</hi> let the <hi>conſtitution and laws be ever ſo good;</hi> the management of able, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and upright men alone can cauſe an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>brighten,</hi> and the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> of an Empire to <hi>riſe into reſpect;</hi> make <hi>truth</hi> the line and meaſure of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic deciſion;</hi> give <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to the government, and <hi>ſecurity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> to the ſubject.</p>
            <p>We now hope that we are on the cloſe of a war of mighty effort and great diſtreſs, againſt the greateſt power on earth, whetted into the moſt keen reſentment and ſavage fierceneſs, which can be excited by wounded pride, and which uſually riſes higher between brother and brother of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, than between ſtrangers in conteſt. <hi>Twelve</hi> of the Thirteen United States have felt the actual and cruel inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the enemy, and <hi>eleven of our capitals</hi> have been under their power, firſt or laſt, during the dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; but a good Providence, our own virtue and firmneſs, and the help of our friends, have enabled us to riſe ſuperior
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:023972_0235_0FC2AE9F58D5D190"/>
to all the power of our adverſaries, and made them ſeek to be at peace with us.</p>
            <p>During the extreme preſſures of the war, indeed, many errors in our adminiſtration have been committed, when we could not have experience and time for reflection, to make us wiſe; but theſe will eaſily be <hi>excuſed, forgiven, and forgotten,</hi> if we can now, while at leiſure, <hi>find virtue, wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>foreſight enough to correct them,</hi> and form ſuch eſtabliſhments, as ſhall ſecure the great ends of our union, and give dignity, force, utility, and permanency to our Empire.</p>
            <p>It is a pity we ſhould loſe the honor and bleſſings which have coſt us ſo dear, for want of wiſdom and firmneſs in meaſures, which are eſſential to our preſervation. It is now at our option, either to <hi>fall back</hi> into our original atoms, or <hi>form ſuch an union,</hi> as ſhall command the <hi>reſpect</hi> of the world, and give <hi>honor and ſecurity</hi> to all our people.</p>
            <p>This vaſt ſubject lies with mighty weight on my mind, and I have beſtowed on it my utmoſt attention, and here offer the public the beſt thoughts and ſentiments I am ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The firſt thing which naturally offers itſelf to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the expenſe of government; this is a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine qua non</hi> of the whole, and all its parts. No kind of adminiſtration can be carried on without expenſe, and the ſcale or degree of plan and execution muſt ever be limited by it. Two grand conſiderations offer themſelves here. 1. <hi>The eſtimate of the expenſes which government requires: and,</hi> 2. <hi>Such
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:023972_0238_0FC2AEB1BB39A6D0"/>
ways and means of raiſing ſufficient money to defray them, as will be moſt eaſy, and leaſt hurtful and oppreſſive, to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is not my <hi>preſent principal object:</hi> I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only obſerve upon it, that the <hi>wants of government,</hi> like the <hi>wants of nature,</hi> are <hi>few</hi> and <hi>eaſily ſupplied;</hi> it is <hi>luxury</hi> which incurs the moſt expenſe, and drinks up the largeſt fountains of ſupply, and what is moſt to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſame luxury which <hi>drinks up</hi> the greateſt ſupplies, does at the ſame time <hi>corrupt</hi> the body, <hi>enervate</hi> its ſtrength, and <hi>waſte thoſe powers</hi> which are deſigned for uſe, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or delight. The <hi>ways and means of ſupply</hi> are the object of my principal attention at preſent. I will premiſe a few propoſitions which appear to me to deſerve great conſideration here.</p>
            <p>I. When a ſum of money is wanted, <hi>one way of raiſing it may be much eaſier than another.</hi> This is equally true in States as in individuals. A man muſt always depend for ſupply on thoſe articles which he can <hi>beſt ſpare,</hi> or which he can furniſh with <hi>leaſt</hi> inconvenience: he ſhould firſt ſell ſuch articles as he has <hi>purpoſely provided for market:</hi> if theſe are not enough, then ſuch articles of his eſtate as he can <hi>beſt ſpare,</hi> always ſacrificing <hi>luxuries firſt,</hi> and neceſſaries <hi>laſt</hi> of all.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Any intereſt or thing whatever, on which the burden of tax is laid, is diminiſhed either in quantity or neat value, e. g.</hi> if <hi>money</hi> is taxed, part of the ſum goes to pay the tax; if <hi>lands,</hi> part of the produce or price goes to pay it; if <hi>goods,</hi> part of the price which the goods will ſell for, goes to pay it, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>The conſumption of any thing, on which the burden of tax is laid, will always be thereby leſſened,</hi> becauſe ſuch tax will <hi>raiſe</hi> the price of the article taxed, and fewer people will be able or willing to pay <hi>ſuch advance</hi> of price, than would purchaſe, if the price was <hi>not raiſed:</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>The burden of tax ought to lie heavieſt on ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the uſe and conſumption of which are leaſt neceſſary to the community; and lighteſt on thoſe articles, the uſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:023972_0239_0FC2AEB8B61834A0"/>
of which are moſt neceſſary to the community.</hi> I think this ſo plain, that it cannot need any thing ſaid on it either by way of illuſtration or proof.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>The ſtaples of any country are both the ſource and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of its wealth,</hi> and therefore ought to be <hi>encouraged and increaſed</hi> as far as poſſible. No country can enjoy or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume more than they can raiſe, make, or purchaſe. No country can purchaſe more than they can pay for; and no country can make payment beyond the amount of the <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> which remains of their ſtaples, after their <hi>conſumption</hi> is ſubtracted. If they go beyond this, they muſt run in debt, <hi>i. e.</hi> eat the calf in the cow's belly, or conſume this year the proceeds of the next, which is a direct ſtep to ruin, and muſt (if continued) end in deſtruction.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>The great ſtaples of the Thirteen United States, are our</hi> HUSBANDRY, FISHERIES, AND MANUFACTURES. <hi>Trade</hi> comes in as the <hi>hand-maid</hi> of them all—the <hi>ſervant</hi> that tends upon them—the <hi>nurſe</hi> that takes away their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancies, and ſupplies their wants. <hi>Theſe</hi> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as the great <hi>ſources</hi> of our wealth; and our <hi>trade,</hi> as the great <hi>conduit</hi> thro' which it flows. All theſe we ought in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound policy to guard, encourage, and increaſe <hi>as far as poſſible,</hi> and to load them with burdens and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments <hi>as little</hi> as poſſible.</p>
            <p>VII. When any country finds that any articles are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into uſe, and their conſumption increaſing ſo far as to become hurtful to the proſperity of the people, or to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their morals or economy, <hi>it is the intereſt and good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of ſuch country to check and diminiſh the uſe and conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch articles,</hi> down to ſuch degree as ſhall conſiſt with the greateſt happineſs and purity of their people.</p>
            <p>VIII. This is done the moſt effectually and unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably, by <hi>taxing ſuch articles, and thereby raiſing the price of them ſo high,</hi> as ſhall be neceſſary to <hi>reduce</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as far as is needful for the general good. The force of this obſervation has been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elt by all nations; and <hi>ſumptuary laws</hi> have been tried in all ſhapes, to <hi>prevent or reduce</hi> ſuch hurtful conſumptions; but none ever did or can do it ſo effectually as <hi>raiſing the price of them:</hi> this touches the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:023972_0240_0FC2AED0B4ADFE10"/>
feelings of every purchaſer, and connects the uſe of ſuch articles with the pain of the purchaſer, who cannot afford them, ſo cloſely and conſtantly, as cannot fail to operate by way of <hi>diminution</hi> or <hi>diſuſe</hi> of ſuch conſumption; and as to ſuch rich or prodigal people, as can or will go to the price of ſuch articles, they are the very perſons who, I think, are the moſt able and ſuitable to pay taxes to the State.</p>
            <p>I think it would not be difficult to enumerate a great number of ſuch articles of <hi>luxury, pride, or mere ornament,</hi> which are growing into ſuch exceſſive uſe among us, as to become dangerous to the <hi>wealth, economy, morals,</hi> and <hi>health</hi> of our people, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>diſtilled ſpirits</hi> of all ſorts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whiſky and country rum, all imported <hi>wines, ſilks</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>cambrics, lawns, laces,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. <hi>ſuperfine cloths and velvets, jewels</hi> of all kinds, &amp;c. to which might be added a very large catalogue of articles, tho' not ſo <hi>capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> dangerous as theſe, yet ſuch as would admit <hi>a check</hi> in their conſumption, without any damage to the States, ſuch as <hi>ſugar, tea, coffee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, fine linens,</hi> all <hi>cloths and ſtuffs</hi> generally uſed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>richer kind</hi> of people, &amp;c. all which may be judiciouſly taxed at <hi>ten, twenty, fifty,</hi> or <hi>one hundred per cent.</hi> on their firſt importation; and to theſe might be added, a ſmall duty of perhaps <hi>five per cent.</hi> on all other imported goods whatever.</p>
            <p>Two things are here to be conſidered and proved. 1. That <hi>this mode</hi> of taxation would be more <hi>beneficial</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity than any other: and, 2. that this mode is <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable.</hi> If theſe two things are fairly and clearly proved, I think there can be no room left for doubt, whether this kind of taxation ought to be immediately adopted, and put in practice.</p>
            <p>I will offer my reaſons in favor of theſe propoſitions as fully, clearly, and truly as I can, and hope they may be judged worthy of a candid attention. I will endeavour in the firſt place, to point out <hi>the benefits ariſing from this mode of taxation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. This mode of taxation may ſafely be raiſed to ſuch a degree, as <hi>to produce all the money we need for the public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="unknown:023972_0241_0FC2AED21C744188"/>
or ſufficiently <hi>near</hi> it; perhaps a <hi>ſmall tax</hi> in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way would be more beneficial to the States than <hi>none,</hi> becauſe this tax keeps the cuſtomary avenues from the wealth of individuals to the public treaſury always open, which may be uſed on emergencies, and the <hi>habit and practice</hi> being ſettled, would avoid the difficulties natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ariſing from <hi>novelty</hi> or <hi>innovations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my argument. It is greatly in favor of this kind of tax, that it will bring money <hi>enough</hi> for the public ſervice; it is matter of great animation in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of any object, to know that, when accompliſhed, it will be <hi>adequate to its purpoſes.</hi> People all want to ſee the <hi>end of things,</hi> and to know when they are to <hi>have done:</hi> this will naturally produce much ſtronger efforts, vigor, and cheerfulneſs, than if the thing, when accompliſhed, would be but <hi>half adequate</hi> to its purpoſes.</p>
            <p>II. This mode of taxation <hi>applies for money where it is to be had in greateſt plenty, and can be paid with moſt eaſe and leaſt pain.</hi> If we apply to the <hi>farmer, tradeſman,</hi> or <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer</hi> for caſh, they have mighty little of it, and it is hard for them to raiſe the neceſſary ſum; but it is matter of <hi>common courſe</hi> with the merchant, <hi>thro' whoſe hands the great current of circulating caſh paſſes;</hi> he will conſider the tax as part of the <hi>firſt coſt</hi> of his goods, and ſet his price and ſell accordingly: it matters little to him, whether he <hi>pays half</hi> the coſt of his goods <hi>abroad,</hi> and the <hi>other half at home,</hi> or whether he pays it all abroad; his object is to get the whole out of his ſales, with as much profit to himſelf as he can.</p>
            <p>III. This mode <hi>lays the burden of tax on that kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which is exceſſive and hurtful, and leſſens that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and of courſe mends the economy, and increaſes the induſtry and health, of the people.</hi> For it is plain, that <hi>no more money</hi> will be paid for the goods taxed, than would have been paid for the ſame kind of goods, had they <hi>not</hi> been taxed: the difference is, the ſame money paid for the taxed goods will not buy <hi>ſo many</hi> of them as before the tax, becauſe the tax will <hi>raiſe the price</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="unknown:023972_0242_0FC2AEE9E46E2C00"/>
And when the conſumption or uſe of ſuch goods is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and hurtful, this <hi>leſſening</hi> of it is a <hi>benefit,</hi> tho' the ſame money is paid for them as before, for the ſame reaſon that it is better for a man that happens to be at a tavern with exceſſive drinkers, to pay his <hi>whole ſhare of the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but drink <hi>leſs than his ſhare</hi> of the liquors, and <hi>go home ſober,</hi> than to pay the <hi>ſame</hi> reckoning, drink his <hi>full ſhare</hi> of the liquors, and <hi>go home drunk.</hi> It is always bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to buy poiſon and <hi>not uſe</hi> it, than to buy the ſame poiſon and <hi>uſe</hi> it; in the one caſe he loſes nothing but his <hi>money,</hi> in the other caſe he loſes his money and <hi>health</hi> too. For the ſame reaſon it is better for a reaper to drink <hi>half a pint</hi> of rum in a day, than to reap for the ſame wages, and drink a <hi>quart</hi> of rum. This reaſoning will hold in its proper degree, with reſpect to every kind of conſumption which is exceſſive and hurtful.</p>
            <p>IV. This mode of taxation <hi>ſaves the whole ſum of the tax to the States,</hi> while at the ſame time <hi>it mends the habits and health of the people:</hi> for it is plain, that if the conſumption of ſuch imported goods is leſſened by the tax, <hi>a leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> will be <hi>imported,</hi> and of courſe a <hi>leſs</hi> ſum of money need be <hi>ſent abroad</hi> to pay the firſt coſt of theſe goods; and this exceſs of money, which is thus ſaved from going abroad (from whence it <hi>would never return</hi>) is paid by the tax into the <hi>public treaſury,</hi> from whence it iſſues on the public ſervice, and is directly thrown <hi>into circulation again</hi> thro' the States, and of courſe becomes a <hi>clear ſaving,</hi> or balance of increaſe of the circulating medium, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>realized</hi> wealth in the country; whilſt at the ſame time, the people are better ſerved and accommodated by the <hi>reduced</hi> conſumption, than they could have been by the <hi>exceſſive</hi> one.</p>
            <p>V. It appears from what has been juſt now obſerved, that <hi>this mode of taxation naturally increaſes the circulating caſh of the States,</hi> and every one knows what <hi>a ſpring, what vigor</hi> this gives to every kind of buſineſs in the country, whether of huſbandry, mechanic arts, or trade. There is no compariſon between the advantages of carrying on any ſort of buſineſs in a country where <hi>caſh circulates freely,</hi> and
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:023972_0243_0FC2AEF365AE8F88"/>
in a country where caſh is <hi>ſcarce.</hi> In the one caſe, every kind of buſineſs will <hi>flouriſh,</hi> and induſtry has every ſort of <hi>encouragement</hi> and motive for exertion; in the other all bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs muſt be ſadly <hi>embarraſſed,</hi> and of courſe make but a feeble and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We can ſcarce form a conception, what a <hi>different face theſe two circumſtances will give a country</hi> in a ſhort time; in the one caſe, <hi>buildings</hi> riſe, <hi>huſbandry</hi> improves, <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>manufactures</hi> flouriſh, the country is <hi>alive,</hi> and every part of it <hi>abounding</hi> with induſtry, profits, and delight; the other can produce little more than <hi>languiſhment, decay, dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>fruitleſs anxiety, diſappointment,</hi> and <hi>wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. The tax I propoſe, <hi>will operate in a way of general equality, juſtice, and due proportion.</hi> A tax on general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions cannot fail to bring the burden in <hi>due</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on individuals, becauſe every one will pay in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his conſumption; and the preſumption is, that the man who ſpends <hi>moſt,</hi> is <hi>beſt able</hi> to ſpend.</p>
            <p>If this propoſition admits of exceptions, they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in favor of the <hi>economiſt,</hi> the careful, penurious man, and againſt the <hi>prodigal</hi> who diſſipates his eſtate, and will operate as a check upon him, if he is not paſt all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of intereſt. If this is the caſe with him, the ſooner his eſtate is run thro' the better it is, both for himſelf and the public, for when this happens, he muſt either <hi>die</hi> or <hi>work</hi> for his living, and of courſe do <hi>ſome good</hi> in the world, or at leaſt <hi>ceaſe doing hurt;</hi> he will then no longer be able to ſet an <hi>example</hi> of idleneſs, extravagance, and diſſoluteneſs, and draw other <hi>gay ſpirits</hi> into his pernicious practices; and if his conſtitution ſhall happen to out-laſt his eſtate, he may by temperance enjoy ſome good degree of health, and his adverſities may perhaps bring on ſerious reflections, ſincere repentance, and amendment of life, and if his fortune is deſperate in this world, he may at leaſt find ſtrong inducements to prepare for the next; ſo that he is in no ſenſe injured by the tax, but may by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence derive grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> benefits from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="unknown:023972_0244_0FC2AEF4D1E23770"/>
Beſides, I am of opinion that government ought to leave every man <hi>maſter of his own eſtate,</hi> and permit him to <hi>judge</hi> for himſelf <hi>how faſt</hi> and <hi>in what way</hi> he will ſpend it; he knows well what tax he pays on every expenditure, and every part of it is ſubject to his own <hi>free choice,</hi> and if his career of <hi>diſſipation</hi> cannot be <hi>reſtrained,</hi> it is as <hi>well</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> and much <hi>better</hi> for <hi>the public,</hi> that he ſhould give part of his wealth to the public treaſury, than waſte the whole of it in his luxury and pleaſures; ſo that I do not ſee that he has in this caſe the leaſt ground of complaint of <hi>injury</hi> or <hi>oppreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, I think there is a kind of <hi>juſtice</hi> in framing the public inſtiiutions in ſuch a manner, that a man cannot ſpend a dollar in <hi>luxury</hi> and <hi>diſſipation,</hi> which is <hi>hurtful</hi> to the public, but he muſt at the ſame time <hi>pay another dollar</hi> into the public treaſury, to make thereby ſome <hi>compenſation</hi> for the injury which the public receives from his <hi>luxury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>niggard, the penurious man,</hi> who does not ſpend his money in proportion to his <hi>wealth,</hi> and of courſe does not pay <hi>his ſhare</hi> of tax; it is obſervable that even his very <hi>penury</hi> inures to the <hi>benefit</hi> of the community, for what he does <hi>not ſpend,</hi> he <hi>ſaves,</hi> and thereby enriches him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of courſe adds to the <hi>wealth</hi> of the community, for the <hi>wealth of the community</hi> is always the <hi>aggregate of the wealth</hi> of every individual who compoſes it; this ought therefore to be a <hi>favored caſe,</hi> as the community eventually gains more by a ſhilling <hi>ſaved,</hi> than it could by a ſhilling conſumed and <hi>loſt,</hi> tho' the conſumer ſhould pay <hi>ſix-pence</hi> into the public treaſury.</p>
            <p>In fine, the <hi>tax</hi> on this principle <hi>is carved out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures of the nation,</hi> not indeed <hi>all</hi> expenditures indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, but is ſo calculated as to fall <hi>heavieſt</hi> on thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures which are the moſt general <hi>indices of wealth,</hi> and are uſually made by the <hi>rich</hi> who are the beſt able to bear them; and the few exceptions which may be ſuppoſed to take place, will generally operate <hi>in favor of virtue</hi> and <hi>economy,</hi> and againſt <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>diſſipation;</hi> and where it falls heavieſt, and becomes moſt burdenſome, it is deſigned, and does actually tend, to <hi>correct</hi> that very <hi>vicious taſte</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:023972_0245_0FC2AEF620B1A8D0"/>
               <hi>habit,</hi> which is the <hi>true cauſe</hi> of the burden, and which it is always <hi>in the power</hi> of the ſufferer to <hi>eaſe</hi> himſelf of, whenever he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Point out any other mode of taxing, if you can, that <hi>finds its way</hi> ſo ſurely to the <hi>wealth</hi> of individuals, and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions</hi> itſelf thereto ſo <hi>equitably,</hi> that no ſubject can be burdened beyond his due proportion, without having <hi>a full remedy always in his own power;</hi> yea, a <hi>ſure, eaſy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent remedy,</hi> becauſe a man may always avail himſelf of it, without the expenſe and trouble of a <hi>law-ſuit,</hi> or being ſubjected to <hi>any body's deciſions, opinions, or caprices,</hi> but his own.</p>
            <p>VII. This mode of taxing will make <hi>the quantity and time of the tax depend on the free choice of the man who pays it.</hi> If a man has a mind to drink a bowl of punch or bottle of wine with his friend, or buy a ſilk gown for his daughter, he knows very well how much <hi>tax</hi> is <hi>incorporated</hi> with the purchaſe, and adopts and pays it with cheerfulneſs and good-humor; a <hi>humor</hi> very different from the <hi>irritated ſenſibility</hi> of a man, who ſees an <hi>awful collector</hi> enter upon him with his warrant of <hi>plenary powers</hi> to <hi>diſtrain</hi> his goods, or <hi>arreſt</hi> his perſon, for a <hi>tax</hi> which perhaps he <hi>abhors,</hi> either from religious ſcruples, or an opinion that he is rated beyond his due proportion, or becauſe he is not at that time <hi>in condition</hi> to pay it.</p>
            <p>The good-humor of the ſubject is of great conſequence in any government. When people have their <hi>own way</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> in a matter, they will bear <hi>great</hi> burdens with <hi>little</hi> complaint; but when matters are forced on them <hi>contrary to their humor,</hi> they will make <hi>great</hi> complaints on <hi>ſmall</hi> occaſions, and the public peace is often deſtroyed, much more by the <hi>manner of doing,</hi> than by <hi>the thing done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VIII. This mode of taxing <hi>will give our treaſury ſome compenſation for the monies which our people pay towards the tax of other countries which they travel thro', or reſide in, when abroad.</hi> An <hi>American</hi> cannot travel thro' any country of <hi>Europe,</hi> and drink a bowl of punch or eat a dinner, but he <hi>contributes to the tax</hi> of the country; and if our taxes, like theirs, were laid on ſuch <hi>luxurious conſumptions</hi> as
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:023972_0246_0FC2AEF859873F70"/>
               <hi>travellers</hi> uſually indulge themſelves in, <hi>their</hi> people who travel thro' <hi>our</hi> country, or reſide in it, would contribute towards <hi>our</hi> taxes, in like manner as <hi>our</hi> people who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or reſide in <hi>their</hi> countries, contribute to <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we expect that the intercourſe between us and all the countries of <hi>Europe</hi> will be very great, it is highly reaſonable that <hi>our treaſury</hi> ſhould receive the <hi>ſame benefit</hi> from <hi>their</hi> travellers among us, that <hi>their</hi> treaſuries receive from <hi>our</hi> people who travel or reſide among <hi>them,</hi> and a little attention to the ſubject will be ſufficient to convince any man that this article <hi>is more than a trifle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IX. This mode of taxing, which brings the burden of the tax principally on articles of luxury, or at moſt on ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of not the firſt neceſſity, <hi>gives eaſement and relief to our huſbandry and manufactures, which are in danger of ruin from the preſent weight of taxes which lies on them.</hi> If we tax land, we <hi>leſſen its value,</hi> and of courſe diminiſh the whole <hi>farming intereſt.</hi> If we tax <hi>polls,</hi> we in effect tax <hi>labor,</hi> which diſcourages it, and of conſequence we caſt a damp and deadening languor on the very <hi>firſt ſprings,</hi> the <hi>original principle</hi> and <hi>ſource</hi> of our national wealth, and <hi>wound</hi> the great ſtaples of the country <hi>in their embryo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I think that any mode of taxing, which gives <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and relief</hi> againſt ſo <hi>great,</hi> ſo <hi>fatal an evil,</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve conſideration, even tho' it had not theſe advantages in its favor, which I have before enumerated. I have heard a ſtupid and cruel argument urged, that taxing labor has this advantage, that it promotes induſtry, becauſe it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes neceſſity. This argument proves in a very cogent manner, that it is beſt to make every body poor, becauſe it will make them work the harder.</p>
            <p>But I ſhould think it would be more humane and liberal in a government to manage the public adminiſtration ſo, that <hi>induſtry</hi> might have all poſſible <hi>encouragement,</hi> that it might be rather <hi>animated</hi> by an increaſe of happineſs and hope of reward, than <hi>goaded on</hi> by dire neceſſity and the dreadful ſpurs of pinching want.</p>
            <p>I freely give it as my clear and decided opinion, that it is the intereſt, duty, and beſt policy of every government,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:023972_0247_0FC2AEF9226C8FA0"/>
to give all poſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe, exoneration, and encouragement to that induſtry, thoſe occupations, and kinds of buſineſs, which moſt <hi>enrich, ſtrengthen,</hi> and <hi>happi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> a nation, and to lay the <hi>burdens</hi> of government as far as poſſible on thoſe <hi>faſhions, habits,</hi> and <hi>practices,</hi> which tend to weaken, <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh,</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> the people; and therefore that any mode of taxing which tends to encourage the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, and diſcourage the <hi>laſt,</hi> is worthy of the moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>But perhaps the advantage of this kind of taxation will appear in a more ſtriking light, by conſidering its <hi>practical</hi> and <hi>general effects</hi> on a nation which adopts it; in which view of the matter I think it will be very manifeſt,</p>
            <p>I. That any man of buſineſs, whether he be merchant, farmer, or tradeſman, <hi>may live eaſier and better, i. e. be happier thro' the year, and richer at the end of it, in a country where this tax is paid,</hi> than he could live in the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>if the tax was not paid;</hi> for as the tax is laid on <hi>uſeleſs conſumptions,</hi> it would of courſe <hi>diminiſh</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoſe conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of courſe <hi>ſave the firſt coſt</hi> of the part diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the <hi>additional expenſe</hi> which the uſe of that part would require.</p>
            <p>If a man lives in a country abounding in luxury, he muſt <hi>go</hi> in ſome degree <hi>into it,</hi> or appear <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>mean,</hi> and that part which he would be in a manner compelled to adopt, would probably coſt him <hi>more</hi> than his <hi>tax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is here to be conſidered, that the <hi>firſt coſt</hi> of an article of luxury is not near <hi>all the coſt of it.</hi> One article often makes another neceſſary, and that a third, and ſo on almoſt <hi>ad infinitum;</hi> if you buy a ſilk cloak, there muſt alſo be <hi>trimmings,</hi> and that will not do without a <hi>hat</hi> or <hi>bonnet,</hi> and theſe require a <hi>ſuitable accommodation</hi> in every other part of the dreſs, in order to keep up any ſort of <hi>decency and uniformity</hi> of appearance; and there alſo muſt be ſpent a great deal of time to put theſe <hi>fine things on,</hi> and to <hi>wear</hi> them, to <hi>ſhow</hi> them, to <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>pay</hi> viſits in them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And when this kind of luxury prevails in a country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the degree which its <hi>wealth can bear,</hi> the conſequence
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:023972_0248_0FC2AEFA9B43B4B0"/>
is <hi>pride, poverty, debt, duns, law-ſuits,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer finds the proceeds of the year <hi>vaniſhed into trifles;</hi> the merchant and tradeſman may ſell their goods indeed, but cannot <hi>get payment</hi> for them. Every family finds its expenſe greatly <hi>increaſed,</hi> and the <hi>time</hi> of the family much <hi>conſumed</hi> in attending to that <hi>very expenſe.</hi> Many families ſoon become embarraſſed, and put to very mortifying ſhifts to keep up that appearance, which ſuch a corrupt taſte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>compels</hi> them to ſupport.</p>
            <p>But were theſe families, with the ſame income, to live in a country of <hi>more economy</hi> and <hi>leſs luxury,</hi> they would eaſily pay the taxes on the luxuries they did uſe, keep on a <hi>good footing</hi> with their neighbours, appear with as <hi>much diſtinction,</hi> live <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>unembarraſſed thro'</hi> the year, and have money in their pockets at the <hi>end</hi> of it. In ſuch a country, payments would be punctual, and induſtry ſteady, and of courſe all buſineſs both of merchandiſe, huſbandry, and mechanic arts, might be carried on with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe are no high colorings, but <hi>an appeal to plain facts,</hi> and to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of every prudent man on theſe facts; and I here with confidence aſk every <hi>wiſe man,</hi> if he would not chooſe to live in a country where articles of <hi>hurtful luxury</hi> and <hi>needleſs conſumption</hi> were, by taxes or any other cauſe, raiſed ſo high in their price, as to prevent the <hi>exceſſive uſe</hi> of them, rather than in a country where ſuch articles were of <hi>eaſy acquirement,</hi> and the uſe of them ſo <hi>exceſſive</hi> among the inhabitants, as to <hi>conſume</hi> their <hi>wealth, deſtroy</hi> their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,</hi> and corrupt the <hi>morals</hi> and <hi>health</hi> of the people.</p>
            <p>II. I think it is very plain, that articles of <hi>hurtful,</hi> or at beſt of <hi>needleſs, conſumption</hi> are making ſuch <hi>rapid progreſs</hi> among us, and growing into ſuch <hi>exceſſive uſe,</hi> as to throw the <hi>econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, induſtry, ſimplicity,</hi> and <hi>even health</hi> of our people into danger; and of conſequence, <hi>raiſing the price of ſuch articles ſo high as will be neceſſary to produce a proper check to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe of them, will require a tax ſo great, as, when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a ſmall and very moderate impoſt on articles of general and neceſſary conſumption, will bring money enough into the public treaſury, for all the purpoſes of the public ſervice.</hi> We
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:023972_0249_0FC2AF1A2C27C5A0"/>
will ſuppoſe then that all this is done, and when this is done, we will ſtop a moment, and look round us, and view the <hi>advantages</hi> reſulting from this meaſure, over and above the capital one of checking and reſtraining that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive luxury that threatens, if not an <hi>abſolute deſtruction,</hi> yet at leaſt a <hi>tarniſhment of every principle</hi> out of which our proſperity, wealth, and happineſs muſt neceſſarily and for ever flow. I ſay, we will ſtop a minute and view the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous effects of this meaſure.</p>
            <p>The firſt grand effect which preſents itſelf to my view is, that <hi>our army will be paid;</hi> and that our brethren, our fellow-citizens, who, by their <hi>valor,</hi> their <hi>patience,</hi> their <hi>perſeverance</hi> in the field, have ſecured to us our <hi>vaſt, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive country,</hi> and all its bleſſings, will be enabled to <hi>return</hi> to their friends and connexions, not only <hi>crowned</hi> with the <hi>laurels</hi> of the field, but <hi>rewarded</hi> by the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of their country, and be thereby enabled to ſupport their <hi>dignity of character,</hi> or at leaſt be put on <hi>a footing with their fellow-citizens</hi> (whom they have ſaved) in the procurement of the means of living.</p>
            <p>The next advantage of this meaſure which occurs to me is, <hi>the eaſement and exoneration of the laborers of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the huſbandman and tradeſman,</hi> out of <hi>whoſe labor</hi> all our <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>ſupplies</hi> are derived; by them we are <hi>fed,</hi> by them we are <hi>clothed,</hi> by the various modifications of <hi>their labor</hi> our <hi>ſtaples</hi> are produced, our <hi>commerce</hi> receives its principle, and our utmoſt <hi>abundance</hi> is ſupplied; we are therefore bound by every principle of <hi>juſtice, gratitude,</hi> and <hi>good policy,</hi> to give them encouragement and uninterrupted ſecurity in their peaceful occupations, and not, by an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> and <hi>ill-fated</hi> arrangement of our finances, compel them to <hi>leave</hi> their <hi>labors,</hi> which are the grand object of <hi>their</hi> attention and <hi>our</hi> ſupplies, <hi>to go and hunt up money</hi> to ſatisfy a collector of taxes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>gratitude</hi> operate only on <hi>minds</hi> which theſe virtues can <hi>reach.</hi> There may be ſome few among us, of no little weight, who are content, if they can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>ſervices,</hi> to let the <hi>ſervant ſhift for himſelf,</hi> and who, when they are <hi>ſure</hi> of the <hi>benefit,</hi> remember <hi>no longer</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="unknown:023972_0250_0FC2AF1AF1E87570"/>
the <hi>benefactor,</hi> and, as in this great argument of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concern, I wiſh to find the way to <hi>every man's ſenſe,</hi> and addreſs myſelf not only to thoſe who <hi>have virtue,</hi> but even to thoſe who <hi>have none,</hi> I will therefore mention an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other advantage of this meaſure, which I think will <hi>(vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or no virtue)</hi> reach the feelings of every man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the leaſt ſenſe of intereſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That in this way <hi>all our public creditors would be paid and ſatisfied,</hi> either by a total diſcharge of their <hi>principal,</hi> or an undoubted, <hi>well-funded ſecurity</hi> of it, with a <hi>ſure and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual payment</hi> of their <hi>intereſt,</hi> which would be the beſt of the two; becauſe a total diſcharge of the principal at once, if ſufficient money could be obtained, would make ſuch a <hi>ſudden, ſo vaſt an addition</hi> to our circulating caſh, as would depreciate it, and reduce the value of the debt paid, much below its worth at the time of contract, and introduce a <hi>fluctuation</hi> of our markets, and other <hi>fatal evils</hi> of a depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated currency, which have been known by experience and ſeverely felt, enough to make them dreaded.</p>
            <p>It would therefore be much better for the creditor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a certain, <hi>well-funded ſecurity</hi> of his debt than <hi>full payment:</hi> for in that caſe, if he needed the caſh for his debt, he might ſell his ſecurity <hi>at little</hi> or <hi>no diſcount,</hi> which is the conſtant practice of the public creditors in <hi>England,</hi> where every kind of <hi>public ſecurity</hi> has <hi>its rate of exchange</hi> ſettled every day, and may be negotiated in a very ſhort time. Suppoſing this ſhould be the caſe, ſtop and ſee what an <hi>amazing effect</hi> this would have on <hi>every kind</hi> of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in the country.</p>
            <p>The public bankruptcies have been ſo amazingly great, that vaſt numbers of our people have been reduced by them to the condition of men <hi>who have ſold their effects to broken merchants, who cannot pay them, their buſineſs is leſſened, or perhaps reduced to nothing for want of their ſtock ſo detained from them.</hi> Suppoſing then that their ſtock was reſtored to them all, they would inſtantly all <hi>puſh into buſineſs,</hi> and the proceeds of their buſineſs <hi>would flow thro' the country in every direction of induſtry, and every ſpecies of ſupply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

In fine, the whole country would be alive, and as it is obvious to every one, that it is much better living in a country of <hi>briſk</hi> buſineſs than in one of <hi>ſtagnated</hi> buſineſs, every individual would reap benefits from this general ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of induſtry, beyond account <hi>more than enough</hi> to compenſate the tax which he has paid to produce it.</p>

               <hi>dollar</hi> a hundred for <hi>ſugar, one tenth of a dollar</hi> a pound on <hi>coffee,</hi> and the ſame on <hi>cocoa,</hi> above the ordinary prices, &amp;c. &amp;c. with an addition of <hi>five per cent.</hi> on all articles of <hi>importation</hi> not enumerated, except <hi>cotton, dying woods,</hi> and other <hi>raw materials</hi> for our own manufactures; for whilſt <hi>importations</hi> are <hi>diſcouraged,</hi> our <hi>own manufactures</hi> will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be increaſed, and ought to be <hi>encouraged,</hi> or at leaſt to be <hi>diſburdened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this ſtate of the matter I beg leave to obſerve, that the war itſelf for ſeven years paſt has laid a tax on us near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>equal to the higheſt of theſe,</hi> and on ſome articles of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſumption, from <hi>two hundred</hi> to a <hi>thouſand</hi> per cent. <hi>higher,</hi> ſuch as <hi>ſalt, pepper, allſpice, allum, powder, lead,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. and yet I never heard any body complain of being ruined by the war, becauſe <hi>rum</hi> was <hi>twenty ſhillings</hi> per gallon, <hi>tea</hi> twelve ſhillings per pound, or <hi>mantuas</hi> three dollars a yard, or <hi>pepper</hi> ten ſhillings a pound, or <hi>ſuperfine cloths</hi> eight dollars a yard, &amp;c. Nor does it appear to me, that the country has paid <hi>a ſhilling more</hi> for <hi>rum, ſilks, ſuperfine cloths,</hi> &amp;c. for the <hi>laſt ſeven years,</hi> than was paid for the ſame articles the ſeven <hi>preceding years, i. e.</hi> the whole tax was paid by <hi>leſſening the conſumption</hi> of theſe articles.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think that the health, habits, or happineſs of the country have ſuffered in the leaſt on the whole, from its being obliged to uſe <hi>leſs of theſe articles</hi> than was before uſual; but be this as it may, it is very certain that the country has ſuffered but little from the increaſed price of theſe articles which I propoſe to tax, except at ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular times when thoſe prices were raiſed much higher than the point to which I propoſe to raiſe them, <hi>i. e.</hi> at particular times <hi>rum</hi> has been as high as <hi>three dollars</hi> a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; <hi>tea, three dollars</hi> a pound; <hi>ſugars, three ſhillings</hi> and <hi>ſix-pence,</hi> and <hi>coffee, three ſhillings and ſix-pence</hi> a pound; <hi>mantuas</hi> four dollars a yard, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But it is obſervable, that the principal increaſed prices which have really hurt and diſtreſſed the country during the war, have been of <hi>other articles</hi> which I propoſe to tax very lightly, or not at all; ſuch as <hi>ſalt,</hi> which has at times
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:023972_0253_0FC2AF3D4149D968"/>
been ſix dollars a buſhel, and perhaps three or four dollars on an average, <hi>coarſe cloths</hi> and <hi>coarſe linens, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>abrigs, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,</hi> and <hi>crockery wares,</hi> &amp;c. which have often roſe to <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> prices, and ſtood for years together at <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four,</hi> and yet the burden of theſe exceſſive prices of even neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary articles of unavoidable conſumption, has not been ſo great, if you <hi>except the article of ſalt,</hi> as to be ſo much <hi>as mentioned</hi> very often among the <hi>ruinous effects</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> of the war.</p>
            <p>The uſe I mean to make of theſe obſervations is, to prove from plain, acknowledged fact, that the <hi>increaſed price</hi> of the articles which I wiſh to tax, up to the utmoſt point to which I propoſe to raiſe them, will be but a <hi>light inconvenience</hi> (if any at all) on the people, and the <hi>diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> conſumption of thoſe articles, and the <hi>increaſe</hi> of <hi>circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating caſh</hi> (both which will naturally and unavoidably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from the tax) will be <hi>benefits</hi> which will at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the <hi>burden</hi> of the tax, and I think it is very plain, will leave a <hi>balance of advantage</hi> in favor of the tax.</p>
            <p>But if you ſhould think I conclude too ſtrongly, and you ſhould not be able to go quite my lengths in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſo much, I think, does at leaſt appear inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly plain, that if there is a <hi>real diſadvantage</hi> ariſing from my mode of taxing, it is <hi>ſo ſmall,</hi> that it holds <hi>no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon</hi> with the burden of tax <hi>hitherto in uſe</hi> on polls and eſtates, which <hi>diſcourages induſtry, oppreſſes the laborer, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens</hi> the value of our <hi>lands, ruins</hi> our <hi>huſbandry</hi> and <hi>manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi> and with all theſe dreary evils, cannot poſſibly be collected to <hi>half the amount</hi> which <hi>the public ſervice requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſave further argument on this head, I will with great aſſurance appeal to the ſenſe, the feelings of our <hi>farmers,</hi> who make the great bulk of our inhabitants, if they would not <hi>prefer living</hi> in a <hi>country</hi> where they muſt pay the afore-mentioned <hi>increaſed prices</hi> on the goods I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to tax, rather than <hi>where</hi> they muſt part with the ſame number of <hi>cows, oxen, ſheep, buſhels of wheat,</hi> or <hi>pounds of pork</hi> or <hi>beef,</hi> &amp;c. which are now, in the preſent mode of taxing, annually demanded of them to ſatisfy the tax.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="unknown:023972_0254_0FC2AF3E447D8D28"/>
I dare make the ſame appeal to all our <hi>tradeſmen,</hi> and even to our <hi>merchants,</hi> who, in my opinion, would have clear and decided advantages from my mode of taxing, as well as the farmers. I do not ſee how the merchant or any body elſe can be hurt by the tax; but will all be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefited by it, if the following particulars are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</p>
            <p>I. That <hi>the tax be laid with ſuch judgment and prudence, and different weight on different articles, that the conſumption of no article ſhall be diminiſhed by it, beyond what the good and true intereſt of the nation requires;</hi> for it is certainly <hi>better for the merchant</hi> to deal with his cuſtomers in ſuch articles as are <hi>uſeful</hi> to them, and in ſuch way that they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, <hi>real benefit from their trade with him,</hi> than to ſupply them with articles that are <hi>uſeleſs</hi> or <hi>hurtful</hi> to them, and which of courſe impoveriſh them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt caſe, he will make his cuſtomers <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>able to continue</hi> trading with him, and to make him good and punctual <hi>payments:</hi> in the other caſe, he makes his cuſtomers <hi>poor,</hi> and of courſe ſubjects himſelf to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>dilatory payments,</hi> or perhaps of a <hi>final loſs</hi> of his debts.</p>
            <p>II. That <hi>the tax be univerſal and alike on every part of the country,</hi> for if one State is taxed, and its neighbour is not, the State taxed will loſe its trade. This proves in the moſt intuitive manner, that every tax of impoſt on imported goods muſt be laid by the <hi>general government,</hi> and not by any <hi>particular State,</hi> whoſe laws cannot be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its own juriſdiction. And,</p>
            <p>III. <hi>That the tax be univerſally collected. Smuggling</hi> hurts the <hi>fair trader;</hi> favor and connivance of collectors to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular importers, thro' <hi>bribery, friendſhip,</hi> or <hi>indolence,</hi> has the ſame effect; the perſon who <hi>avoids</hi> the tax can <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell</hi> him who <hi>pays</hi> it; therefore it is the <hi>great intereſt of the merchant,</hi> when the duty is laid, to make it a <hi>decided point,</hi> that <hi>every</hi> importer ſhall <hi>pay the duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am of opinion, that when the <hi>body of merchants</hi> make it a <hi>decided</hi> matter to carry any point of this nature, they are very <hi>able</hi> to accompliſh it; they certainly <hi>know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="unknown:023972_0255_0FC2AF3FD1C69D08"/>
than all the cuſtom-houſe officers and tide-waiters on earth, how to <hi>prevent or detect</hi> ſmuggling, and to <hi>diſcover and puniſh</hi> the indulgence or connivance of collectors, who may be induced to <hi>favor</hi> particular importers, and they have the <hi>higheſt intereſt</hi> in doing this, of any ſet of people in the nation; and therefore I think it <hi>good policy</hi> to truſt this matter to their <hi>prudence,</hi> with proper powers to execute it in the moſt effectual way.</p>
            <p>From a pretty extenſive acquaintance, I am convinced there is a <hi>profeſſional honor in merchants</hi> which may be <hi>ſafely</hi> truſted; and I apprehend it is a policy both <hi>needleſs and cruel,</hi> to ſubject the perſons and fortunes of merchants, the great negotiators of the nation's wealth, and a body of men at leaſt as reſpectable as any among us, to the <hi>inſults</hi> of cuſtom-houſe officers and tide-waiters, the rabble of whom, in <hi>Europe</hi> (I hope ours may be better) are generally allowed to be as corrupt, unprincipled, intolerable, and low-lived a ſet of villains as can be ſcraped out of the dregs of any nation; and to ſet ſuch fellows to watch and guard the <hi>integrity and honeſty</hi> of a moſt reſpectable order of men, and ſubject <hi>honorable and uſeful citizens</hi> to ſuch mortifying inſpection, appears to me to be ſuch an <hi>inſult</hi> on <hi>common ſenſe,</hi>—ſuch an <hi>outrage</hi> on every natural principle of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi>—ſuch a groſs corruption of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>poliſhed manners,</hi> that I ſhould imagine it muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ages to give it that degree of practice and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which has long taken place in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The quickeſt way to to <hi>make men knaves,</hi> is to <hi>treat them as ſuch.</hi> It is a common obſervation, when a woman's <hi>character</hi> is gone, her <hi>chaſtity</hi> ſoon follows. Few men think themſelves much obliged to exhibit inſtances of <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity</hi> to men, who will return them neither <hi>credit</hi> nor <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> for their uprightneſs. Let every man have the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his own virtues, and be <hi>preſumed to be virtuous</hi> till the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> appears. Honeſty</hi> is as eſſential and delicate a part of a <hi>merchant's character,</hi> as <hi>piety</hi> is of a clergyman's, or <hi>chaſtity,</hi> of a woman's, and you wound them all alike ſenſibly, when you ſhow, by your conduct towards them,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:023972_0256_0FC2AF41259AA5E0"/>
that you even ſuſpect that <hi>they are wanting</hi> in theſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic virtues.</p>
            <p>I conceive nothing more is neceſſary to make the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this tax eaſy, than to convince the <hi>merchants,</hi> and indeed the whole <hi>community,</hi> that the tax is <hi>neceſſary for the public ſervice,</hi>—for the eſſential <hi>purpoſes</hi> of government; and that every one who pays it, receives a full compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>benefits</hi> he derives from the union; and that the <hi>management of the affair</hi> be committed to the <hi>merchants,</hi> to which, from the nature of their profeſſion and buſineſs, they are <hi>more adequate and qualified,</hi> than any <hi>other</hi> men; and as it falls directly within the ſphere of their buſineſs, it ſeems to be an <hi>honor,</hi> a <hi>mark of confidence,</hi> to which they are entitled.</p>
            <p>Indeed, let the community at large be <hi>convinced</hi> that the money proceeding from this tax, is <hi>neceſſary for the public ſervice,</hi> and that it can be aſſeſſed with <hi>leſs burden</hi> on the people <hi>in this way,</hi> than in the <hi>mode hitherto practiſed,</hi> and the collection will be <hi>eaſy and natural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tax will ceaſe to be conſidered, like the taxes form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly impoſed on us by the <hi>Britiſh Parliament, unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> in their <hi>aſſeſſment,</hi> and <hi>uſeleſs</hi> in their <hi>expenditure,</hi> for they plagued us with taxes only to ſatisfy their harpies (little or none of the money ever reached the <hi>Britiſh treaſury</hi>) but <hi>this tax</hi> is impoſed by our own people,—by our own repreſentatives, and for our own benefit.</p>
            <p>It muſt be impoſed by Congreſs indeed, as the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any particular Aſſembly cannot be adequate to it; for it muſt operate alike in all the States, be alike univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in its effects, and uniform in its mode of aſſeſſment and collection; and muſt therefore proceed from the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> authority which preſides over the whole Union, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the Congreſs; but it is a Congreſs of our <hi>own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:</hi> for the members of Congreſs are as much <hi>our repreſentatives,</hi> and choſen by <hi>our people,</hi> as the members of the ſeveral <hi>State-Aſſemblies;</hi> and the end and uſe of the tax is <hi>our own public ſervice,</hi> to ſecure the benefits of <hi>our</hi> union, without which it is impoſſible we ſhould obtain <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability abroad,</hi> an <hi>uniform adminiſtration</hi> of civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:023972_0257_0FC2AF42C18D6E30"/>
at <hi>home,</hi> an eſtabliſhed public <hi>credit,</hi> or full <hi>protection</hi> againſt <hi>domeſtic or foreign</hi> inſult.</p>
            <p>I never knew any meaſure of government oppoſed in its execution by the people, when a general conviction took place that the meaſure was properly planned, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the public good. We have had full proof thro' the war, what <hi>great burdens</hi> our people will, very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and even without complaint, bear, when they are <hi>convinced</hi> that the <hi>exigencies</hi> of the State, and the <hi>public ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> made <hi>them neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This exhibits <hi>the tax in an advantageous light,</hi> rather <hi>eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> than <hi>ſhocking,</hi> connects the ideas of <hi>burden</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> together, and naturally brings the <hi>evils</hi> removed by the tax, and the <hi>advantages</hi> reſulting from it, into one view, and may ſtrike the minds of the people ſo ſtrongly, as to make the <hi>burden</hi> of it appear light, when compared with its <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings me to the conſideration of the <hi>practicability of my mode of taxation</hi> which I propoſed, and which I do conceive is a matter of capital weight in this diſcuſſion, for which I do rely on theſe two grand propoſitions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That whatever is the real, great intereſt of the people, they may, by proper meaſures, be made to believe and adopt:</hi> and,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That whatever is admitted to be a matter of common and important intereſt, in the general opinion of the people, may be eaſily put in practice by wiſdom, prudence, and due manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do contend, that when this tax is fairly propoſed to the public, with a proper elucidation of the <hi>evils</hi> it avoids, and the <hi>advantages</hi> which reſult from it, it will not be looked on as a <hi>burden of oppreſſion,</hi> an <hi>impoſition of power,</hi> but as the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of our moſt <hi>precious bleſſings,</hi> as a meaſure ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> to our moſt eſſential and important <hi>

ineffectual the <hi>public meaſures</hi> adopted by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for the public ſecurity, tranquillity, and happineſs.</p>
            <p>Such an action implies in it great <hi>meanneſs</hi> of character in the agent, and a <hi>high crime</hi> againſt the State, and the detection of it will be conſidered as a very material <hi>ſervice</hi> to the Commonwealth.

            <p>
               <hi>The reaſons of governmental meaſures ought always to attend their publication,</hi> ſo far as to afford good means of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the people at large, that their <hi>object and tendency</hi> is the <hi>public good.</hi> This greatly facilitates their execution and ſucceſs.

            <p>I abhor a <hi>myſterious government.</hi> I think an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like a private man, which affects to have a great <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſecrets</hi> that muſt not be explained, has generally a great many <hi>faults</hi> which will not bear <hi>telling,</hi> or a great deal of <hi>corruption</hi> which will not bear <hi>examining.</hi> Government, like private perſons, may indeed have <hi>ſecrets,</hi> which ought to be kept ſo; but in that caſe, caution ſhould be uſed againſt any intimations or hints getting abroad, even <hi>that there are ſuch ſecrets,</hi> or any ſecrets: for this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an anxious inquiry and ſolicitous inſpection, which might make the <hi>keeping</hi> the ſecret more <hi>difficult,</hi> and beſides bring on many other inconveniencies ariſing from number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs apprehenſions, which ſuch a circumſtance would give birth to.</p>
            <p>An <hi>oſtentatious giving out</hi> that there are <hi>mighty ſecrets</hi> in the cabinet, or many <hi>myſteries</hi> in the State, that muſt not be <hi>pried</hi> too cloſely <hi>into,</hi> is the very contrary of all this, and generally is a ſign of a <hi>weak adminiſtration,</hi> and not ſeldom of a <hi>corrupt</hi> one; but of all public meaſures which require explanations to the people, <hi>that of taxes,</hi> which touches

their money (which is always a very ſenſible part) may ſtand <hi>as chief;</hi> and to make theſe go down any thing well, it is always neceſſary to ſpread an univerſal conviction,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the money required in taxes is neceſſary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good:</hi> and,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That it will certainly be actually expended only on the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for which it is aſked and given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if theſe two things are <hi>really true,</hi> there will rarely be much difficulty in making them to be <hi>believed</hi> thro' the moſt ſenſible part of the Commonwealth; but if theſe two things either a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> not <hi>really true</hi> or not <hi>really and generally believed,</hi> I do not know that a <hi>ſtanding army</hi> would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to collect the taxes.</p>
            <p>I am of opinion their force, authority, and influence, like the conqueſts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> army, would laſt no longer in any place than they ſtaid to ſupport it. Whenever they ſhall go away, I imagine they will find that they have left behind them infinitely more <hi>abhorrence</hi> than <hi>obedience</hi> among the people.</p>
            <p>Tho' I am clearly of opinion that there muſt exiſt <hi>an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate force</hi> or <hi>power of compulſion</hi> in every effective and good government, yet it is plain to me, that ſuch force is never to be put in action <hi>againſt the general conviction</hi> or <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the people; nor indeed do I believe it ever <hi>can</hi> be ſo exerciſed with ſucceſs and final effect, for every attempt of this kind tends to <hi>convulſions and death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such an ultimate force indeed ought to fall upon and correct thoſe who ſin againſt the peace, intereſt, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the public. But this can be done with ſafety and advantage only in caſes where the <hi>crime puniſhed</hi> is againſt the <hi>opinions,</hi> the <hi>ſentiments,</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>political principles,</hi> which generally prevail in the people; for if the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent declaimer and mover of ſedition in a government, ſhould happen to be received by the people <hi>as a patriot,</hi> and his harangues ſhould be eagerly adopted as the <hi>doctrines of their liberties and rights,</hi> any attempt to <hi>puniſh</hi> him would be vain or uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>For either the people would <hi>interpoſe</hi> and <hi>reſcue</hi> him, or, if he was pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

of their cauſe,</hi> and thereby the public uneaſineſs, tumult, and uproar would be augmented: but when ſingle perſons or parties counteract the laws, and diſturb that peace and order of government which is eſtabliſhed by general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and in which there is a general perſuaſion that the ſecurity of every individual is concerned, there will be no difficulty in making ſuch examples of puniſhment, as ſhall be ſufficient to curb thoſe <hi>turbulent and factious ſpirits,</hi> more or leſs of which may be found in every community, and which would become intolerable, if not kept under a <hi>rigorous reſtraint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all caſes of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort, the <hi>righteous ſeverities</hi> of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be <hi>approved, ſupported,</hi> and even <hi>applauded</hi> by the general voice.</p>
            <p>Yea, if we were to ſuppoſe that the general opinion was wrong in any particular matter of importance, yet it is plain, that vicious opinion could not be <hi>controlled by force;</hi> it muſt continue till the ill effects of it ſhall produce a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conviction</hi> of its error, or till the people can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by reaſon and argument of the danger of ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, before the ill conſequences of it are <hi>actually</hi> felt; in both which caſes the people will <hi>turn about faſt enough of their own accord,</hi> and the <hi>error</hi> will be <hi>corrected</hi> moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and with eaſe, and without any danger of diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public tranquillity.</p>
            <p>Opinions indeed of a dangerous, hurtful nature may ſpread among the people, and, when they become general, are to be conſidered as great public calamities, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no remedy but that which they carry with them, and which will prove effectual in the end, <abbr>viz.</abbr> their <hi>own evil tendency,</hi> and therefore muſt be <hi>let alone,</hi> like inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, however calamitous, whatever waſte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they make, cannot be controlled; any attempt to <hi>ſtop</hi> their force, <hi>increaſes</hi> their violence and miſchief; they do <hi>leaſt hurt</hi> when they are <hi>unmoleſted,</hi> and are ſuffered to drain themſelves off in their own natural channels.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, there is no forcing every body, and therefore I reject with abhorrence every idea of <hi>governing a country by a ſtanding army,</hi> or any other engines of force. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:023972_0261_0FC2AF7144A18C00"/>
every plan of this kind as a departure from the true principles of government, as deſtructive in its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as abſurd and ineffectual to its own ends; for ſuch a government, whenever it has been tried, inſtead of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>peace, ſecurity,</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of the State, has ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been found to have operated by way of <hi>tyranny and oppreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears from all this, that the true art of government lies in <hi>good and full information of the facts</hi> to which its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are to be accommodated, and <hi>in wiſdom in adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch inſtitutions, laws, and plans of operation,</hi> as ſhall beſt ſuit the ſtate and true intereſts of the people; and <hi>acting openly, fairly, and candidly with them.</hi> You may as well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by fineſſes, to cheat people into <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>heaven,</hi> as into their <hi>real political intereſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are people ſcattered over the whole nation, who underſtand the great intereſts of the community and the wiſdom of public meaſures, and are as firmly attached to them as thoſe who ſit in the ſeat of government, and who are always diſſatisfied, and their confidence in the public counſels is leſſened, when they obſerve public meaſures are adopted, which they do not ſee the <hi>uſe of,</hi> and the <hi>ends</hi> for which they are calculated; and of courſe <hi>little myſtery</hi> and <hi>few ſecrets</hi> are neceſſary in government. Let the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration be ſuch as will <hi>bear examining,</hi> and the more it is <hi>examined, the better it will appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſuch a mode of adminiſtration as this, if burdens that are <hi>really heavy</hi> are <hi>neceſſary</hi> for the public ſafety, they will be <hi>cheerfully</hi> taken up, and <hi>patiently borne,</hi> by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple without endangering the public tranquillity.</p>
            <p>Another objection againſt my mode of taxing (which, in my opinion, is the greateſt by far that can be fairly urged) remains yet to be conſidered. I once almoſt concluded not to mention it here, becauſe its hurtful operation is <hi>diſtant,</hi> we are in no <hi>preſent</hi> danger of its effects, and its <hi>evils may be prevented</hi> or <hi>remedied</hi> in future time by neceſſary meaſures, without requiring our preſent attention. But I will ſubjoin it, becauſe I think it beſt to communicate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quality, effect, and tendency of this ſubject, which my
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:023972_0262_0FC2AF828A649560"/>
utmoſt inveſtigation of it has been able to diſcover, that the public may take it up or reject it on the fulleſt reaſon that I can lay before them. The objection is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That this tax is inſenſible, and will produce more money than the people are apprized of, and in future time, when our trade and conſumptions ſhall increaſe, may produce more than the public ſervice will require,</hi> and of courſe <hi>will tend to public diſſipation and corruption.</hi> For <hi>frugality</hi> in a <hi>court</hi> ever ſprings from <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and a <hi>rich treaſury naturally makes a prodigal adminiſtration,</hi> and too often a <hi>corrupt one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be anſwered, that it will always be eaſy to <hi>leſſen or take the tax off,</hi> whenever it ſhall become <hi>too productive.</hi> This may be <hi>eaſy,</hi> but will always be <hi>dangerous.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it at the cloſe of the war will prevent the <hi>fall of the goods taxed,</hi> and keep them <hi>up partly to the war pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> and of courſe <hi>ſave the merchants</hi> who have goods by them, from <hi>very great loſs,</hi> and is a good reaſon for impoſing it now; but when it ſhall be taken off, it will <hi>reduce</hi> the price of the goods taxed, in ſo <hi>ſudden a manner,</hi> as will be very <hi>hurtful</hi> to thoſe who have ſtock on hand, and may ruin ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many families.</p>
            <p>There is another, and perhaps better, way of guarding againſt the evils of the objection. It will be eaſy to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to each State an account of the annual proceeds of the tax, and when the <hi>amount</hi> ſhall exceed the <hi>annual expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> an <hi>account of the ſurplus,</hi> together with an eſtimate of the proportion of each State (according to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quota of burdens and benefits) may be returned with it, and the ſaid <hi>proportion of the ſurplus</hi> may be made <hi>ſubject to the orders of each State reſpectively;</hi> and if they judge that they can <hi>more ſafely truſt their own economy,</hi> than that of the <hi>ſupreme adminiſtration,</hi> each State may draw its quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta out of the <hi>general treaſury</hi> into <hi>its own,</hi> and there keep it as a depoſited fund of public wealth, or diſpoſe of it as they pleaſe. Perhaps <hi>a fund to defray the internal expenſes of each State might be as eaſily raiſed in this way as any other;</hi> but I leave a further diſcuſſion of the objection and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to the wiſdom of future times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="unknown:023972_0263_0FC2AF83CF10FEA0"/>
But if this my mode of taxing, or any other that may be adopted, ſhould not be ſufficient for the public ſervice, I could wiſh the deficiency might ſomehow be made up <hi>at home,</hi> without recurring to the ruinous mode of ſupplies by <hi>public loans abroad.</hi> I think that <hi>every light</hi> in which this ſubject can be viewed, will afford <hi>an argument</hi> againſt it. I have known this cogent argument uſed in favor of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign loans, <abbr>viz.</abbr> we give but <hi>five per cent.</hi> intereſt <hi>abroad,</hi> and our people can make <hi>ten per cent. advantage</hi> of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>at home,</hi> therefore they gain five per cent. by the loan.</p>
            <p>This ſtupid argument, if it proves any thing, juſt proves that it is every man's intereſt to borrow money, for it is certainly profitable to buy any thing for five pounds which will bring ten; but the natural fact is the very reverſe of this, for if you bring money into a kingdom or family, which is not the <hi>proceeds of induſtry,</hi> it will naturally <hi>leſſen the induſtry</hi> and <hi>increaſe the expenſes of it.</hi> It has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten obſerved, that when a perſon gains any <hi>ſudden acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wealth</hi> by treaſure-trove, captures at ſea, drawing a high prize in a lottery, or any other way <hi>not connected with induſtry,</hi> he is rarely known to <hi>keep it long,</hi> but ſoon <hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates it.</hi> The <hi>ſenſible value</hi> of money is loſt, when the idea of it becomes <hi>diſconnected</hi> with the <hi>labor and pain of earning it,</hi> and expenſes will naturally <hi>increaſe</hi> where there is <hi>plenty of wealth</hi> to ſupport them. The effect is the ſame on a nation.</p>
            <p>Is <hi>Spain</hi> a whit richer for all the mines of <hi>South-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca?</hi> The induſtry of <hi>Holland</hi> has proved a much ſurer ſource of durable wealth. We already find a dangerous <hi>exceſs of luxury</hi> growing out of our <hi>borrowed money,</hi> and our <hi>induſtry</hi> (eſpecially in procuring ſupplies of our own) wants <hi>great animation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, the aforeſaid argument is not grounded on fact; it is true, I ſuppoſe, that we pay but five per cent. intereſt on our foreign loans, but they coſt us from fifteen to twenty per cent. more to get them home, for that is at leaſt the diſcount which has been made on the ſale of our bills for ſeveral years paſt, and if we bring it over in caſh,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:023972_0264_0FC2AFA20C533A48"/>
there is freight and inſurance to be paid, which increaſes the loſs.</p>
            <p>From this it appears, that for every eighty pounds of ſupply which we obtain in this way, we muſt pay at leaſt an hundred pounds, even if we were to pay the principal at the end of the year, and the conſuming worm of five per cent. intereſt every year after, if the payment is delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: to all this loſs is to be added, all the expenſe of <hi>nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating</hi> the loans abroad, <hi>brokerage</hi> on ſale of the bills, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To eſcape the ruinous effects of this mode of ſupply, I think <hi>every exertion</hi> ſhould be made to obtain our ſupplies <hi>at home;</hi> it is certainly very plain our country i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted,</hi> it is <hi>full</hi> of every kind of <hi>ſupply</hi> which we need, and nothing further can be neceſſary, than to find <hi>thoſe ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues from the ſources of wealth</hi> in the hands of individuals, which <hi>lead into the public treaſury,</hi> thoſe <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>proportions</hi> that are moſt <hi>juſt,</hi> moſt <hi>equal,</hi> and moſt <hi>eaſy</hi> to the people. This is the <hi>firſt great art</hi> of finance; that of <hi>economy</hi> in expenditures is the next.</p>
            <p>Any body may receive money and pay it out; borrow money and draw bills; but to <hi>raiſe and manage the internal revenue,</hi> ſo as to make the <hi>wealth</hi> of the country <hi>balance</hi> the <hi>public expenditures,</hi> is not ſo eaſy a taſk, but yet I think not ſo hard as to be impracticable; unleſs this can be done, the <hi>greateſt conceivable abilities</hi> muſt <hi>labor in vain,</hi> for it is naturally impoſſible that any eſtate, which cannot pay its expenditures, ſhould continue long without embarraſſment and diminution; the load of debt muſt continually increaſe, and the intereſt will make a continual addition to that debt, and render the eſtate more and more unable every year to clear itſelf; but if the eſtate <hi>can pay its expenditures,</hi> it is the height of madneſs <hi>not to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If revenues can be ſpared ſufficient to diſcharge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the debt, ſo as to ſtop its increaſe, the eſtate may be ſaved, and a future increaſe of revenue may in time wipe off the principal; but no hope is left, if <hi>intereſt upon intereſt</hi> muſt continue to <hi>accumulate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="unknown:023972_0265_0FC2AFA426BC5608"/>
And as the <hi>intereſt of every individual is inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the public credit</hi> or ſtate of the finances, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that this affair becomes a matter of the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and very important moment to <hi>every perſon</hi> in the community, and therefore ought to be attended to as a matter of the higheſt national concern; and <hi>no burden</hi> ought to be accounted <hi>too heavy,</hi> which is ſufficient to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy</hi> ſo great a miſchief.</p>
            <p>It may be objected to all this, that the duties I propoſe are ſo extremely high, that, 1. <hi>they will hurt our trade:</hi> and, 2. <hi>can have no chance of obtaining a general conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt I anſwer—as far as this tax tends to leſſen the importation of hurtful luxuries and uſeleſs conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is <hi>the very object I have in view;</hi> and it is ſo very <hi>light</hi> on all other articles, that the <hi>burden</hi> will be almoſt <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the ſecond objection—it is in vain to <hi>trifle</hi> with a matter of ſuch weight and importance, or weary our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with <hi>ſmall plans</hi> and <hi>remedies,</hi> utterly inadequate to the purpoſe. In weighty matters, <hi>weak, half-aſſured attempts</hi> will appear to every one to be <hi>labor loſt,</hi> and a <hi>ridiculous diſproportion</hi> of the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the end: it is better in itſelf, as well as more likely to ſucceed with the people, to take ſtrong hold, and, with a bold, firm aſſurance, propoſe ſomething, which, when done, will be <hi>an adequate and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our national debt, including the ſupplies for the preſent year, I am told, by the Financier's eſtimate delivered to Congreſs, amounts to about 35,000,000 <hi>of dollars,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual intereſt of which will be ſomewhat above 2,000,000 of dollars, which, I think, may be raiſed by the tax I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (tho' it is impoſſible to tell with much preciſion, what the proceeds of a tax will be, which has not been tried:) it is very plain that the proceeds will be large, and ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated as to be almoſt wholly a clear ſaving, not to ſay a benefit, to the country; and if there ſhould be deficiencies, a ſmall additional tax may be laid in the uſual way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="unknown:023972_0266_0FC2AFA65A4C1610"/>
Our annual expenditures, on the peace eſtabliſhment, may, I think, be reduced to a quarter or third of a million of dollars, and perhaps, if our national debt <hi>was liquidated as it ought to be,</hi> a great ſaving might be made both of <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intereſt;</hi> but the detail of theſe matters is in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one's power, who has leiſure and proper documents to make the calculations.</p>
            <p>Without deſcending to <hi>minutiae,</hi> I only mean to examine the <hi>great principles</hi> of reſource and <hi>mode</hi> of ſupply which are within our power, and give my reaſons as clear as I can for adopting a <hi>practical trial.</hi> Such a practice would doubtleſs <hi>diſcover</hi> many things which no <hi>foreſight</hi> can reach, and <hi>experience only</hi> can elucidate; it is an <hi>untrodden path</hi> which I recommend, and tho' it cannot be perfectly known, yet it ſeems to me to have ſuch an <hi>appearance of advantage</hi> as deſerves a trial.</p>
            <p>The <hi>expenſe</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of collection will be <hi>no greater</hi> on the <hi>high tax</hi> I propoſe, than it would be on a <hi>trifling one,</hi> which would produce leſs than a <hi>tenth part</hi> of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply which this would furniſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if it ſhould be judged prudent to make the trial, I think it moſt adviſable to take it up on <hi>ſuch a large ſcale,</hi> as will make it <hi>ſufficiently productive</hi> to become an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject worthy of <hi>ſtrong effort</hi> and <hi>perſevering diligence,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give it <hi>a full effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, we have not children or dunces to deal with, but a people who have as quick a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

when obtained, ſhall, to the <hi>laſt ſhilling,</hi> be paid for ſuch <hi>neceſſary purpoſes;</hi> the tax will then ceaſe to be <hi>odious.</hi> It will become an object of <hi>acknowledged intereſt,</hi> and every perſon who <hi>ſmuggles</hi> or otherwiſe <hi>avoids</hi> the tax, will be conſidered as <hi>ſhrinking from a burden</hi> which the public good makes neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Every attempt of this ſort will become <hi>diſreputable</hi> and <hi>infamous,</hi> and when you can connect the <hi>tax</hi> and <hi>character</hi> together, there will be <hi>little difficulty</hi> in collecting it.</p>
            <p>This will effectually obviate the great objection, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that it will be <hi>impracticable</hi> to collect a heavy tax on goods of <hi>great</hi> value, but <hi>little</hi> bulk, ſuch as <hi>ſilks, laces,</hi> and the like, becauſe they may be <hi>eaſily</hi> ſmuggled, &amp;c. Whenever they are to be ſold, they muſt be expoſed to view, and let the <hi>burden of proof</hi> ever lie on the <hi>poſſeſſor, that the tax has been bona fide paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould think it adviſable to commit the management of this matter to the merchants; they are <hi>moſt hurt</hi> by <hi>ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling,</hi> and of courſe have the <hi>higheſt intereſt</hi> in preventing it. It will be <hi>ten times more difficult</hi> to cheat and impoſe on them, than any others, becauſe the matter falls wholly within their <hi>own ſphere of buſineſs. Two of a trade cannot cheat one another as eaſy</hi> as <hi>either</hi> of them might cheat <hi>a ſtranger.</hi> If the merchants would take the matter up, and make it a kind of <hi>profeſſional honor</hi> to prevent ſmuggling, and ſee that the duty is <hi>effectually paid,</hi> there is little doubt but <hi>they</hi> could effect it.</p>
            <p>All this reaſoning depends on this one principle, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that our <hi>public meaſures</hi> muſt carry in them <hi>wiſdom, natural fitneſs, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>propriety:</hi> then they will gain character, reputation, and confidence among the people at large, and mutual intereſt will ſoon make the government eaſy and effective; every individual will ſoon find his <hi>intereſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with <hi>that of the public,</hi> and he will have every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement both of <hi>honor and profit</hi> to ſtand well with the government, and effectually ſupport it.</p>
            <p>And in this way, even the great doctrine of taxation it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that <hi>common and almoſt univerſal ſource of complaint,</hi> may become an object of <hi>acknowledged neceſſity,</hi> of <hi>confeſſed

right,</hi> and the payment made like that of any other debt, with <hi>conviction of right and full ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude this Eſſay with one argument more in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of my principle of taxation, which appears to me of ſuch mighty weight and vaſt importance, as muſt reach the feelings, and govern the heart, of every upright <hi>American,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that our public union, with all its bleſſings, depends on it, and is ſupported by it,</hi> and muſt, without it, diſſolve and waſte away into its original atoms.</p>
            <p>To refuſe any plan its <hi>neceſſary ſupport,</hi> and to <hi>murder and deſtroy</hi> it, is the <hi>ſame thing;</hi> the union cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without ſo much money as is neceſſary to that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and that money <hi>may be raiſed in the way</hi> I propoſe, and <hi>cannot in any other.</hi> We have a moſt plain and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable proof of fact, that the uſual mode of taxation of polls and eſtates, is in its principle <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>unequal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it does not operate on our people in any <hi>due proportion to their wealth:</hi> this miſchief was leſs felt, when our taxes were <hi>very ſmall,</hi> and therefore, tho' <hi>unjuſt,</hi> were not <hi>ruinous;</hi> but the caſe is greatly altered, now the taxes are <hi>grown up into the burden</hi> which the preſent exigencies of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion require.</p>
            <p>The ſaid tax hitherto in uſe is further ruinous, becauſe it carves what money it does produce, out of the very <hi>firſt reſources,</hi> the <hi>original principle of our national wealth,</hi> which, like <hi>tender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The mode of ſupply by <hi>foreign loans</hi> need not be further reprobated; it is plain to every body, that if they can be continued (which is doubtful) they will ſoon involve us in <hi>a foreign debt,</hi> vaſtly beyond all <hi>poſſibility of payment:</hi> our

            <p>The ſcheme of iſſuing any more Continental money, I take for granted, nobody will think of; and therefore I conclude, that all the ways and means which <hi>have hitherto been tried,</hi> have proved utterly inſufficie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>To ſay all this, may be thought very <hi>great preſumption</hi> in an individual; be it ſo; ſtill I am ſafe, for no man can contradict me, who is not able to find and explain ſome <hi>other way of ſupply, equally eaſy</hi> to the people, and <hi>equally productive</hi> of all the money which the ſupport of the union requires: but in as much as the eagerneſs of inquiry for ſeveral years paſt has not been able to diſcover any <hi>ſuch other mode,</hi> I conclude there is <hi>no ſuch,</hi> and of courſe, the one I have propoſed is the only one that can be adopted, to ſave our union from diſſolution.</p>
            <p>And under the impreſſion of this full perſuaſion, may I be permitted to addreſs our public adminiſtration, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Congreſs, but in all the States, in the ſtrong language of Lord <hi>Chatham—Set me down as an idiot, if you do not adopt it, or rue your neglect;</hi> and it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

become incapable of remedy; for what can they think, when they ſhall ſee that you ſuffer our union, which is committed <hi>to your care, to fall to pieces under your hands,</hi> becauſe you will not attempt to give it <hi>that ſupport,</hi> which, to ſay the leaſt of it, is in its nature <hi>practicable,</hi> and the <hi>due practice</hi> of which would produce the <hi>great remedy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay perhaps, we admit your principle to be juſt and good, but we cannot raiſe our ideas up to <hi>your height of ſcale or degree of impoſt; your tax is too high; it graſps too much, and is thereby in danger of loſing all; it will ſcare our people out of their wits.</hi> I do not think much of this; if the <hi>wits</hi> which the people now have, <hi>are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> for their ſalvation, it matters little how ſoon they are <hi>ſcared out of them;</hi> but it is not certain that their wits are ſo volatile; there is at leaſt a poſſibility, a chance, that they may have <hi>wit enough to adopt the remedy</hi> that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe calamities, which (if not prevented) will ſoon drive them out of their <hi>ſecurity</hi>—their <hi>property</hi>—their <hi>nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal honor</hi>—their <hi>country</hi> and <hi>wits too;</hi> at leaſt I think it needleſs for <hi>you</hi> to loſe <hi>your wits,</hi> for fear the <hi>people</hi> will loſe <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would aſk you ſeriouſly, do you think that a leſs ſcale of tax than that which I propoſe, would be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly productive for the public ſervice, or the ſupport of the Union? I think you muſt probably ſay no, on the bare preſumption (for the produce of an untried tax cannot be reduced to a certainty:) to what purpoſe then, I further aſk, would it be to ſet on foot ſo expenſive and troubleſome an operation, which, when completed, would be <hi>utterly inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate</hi> to its purpoſes? or what funds have you, out of which you expect to draw the deficiency?</p>
            <p>If there is any wiſdom or effort in our counſels and plans, they muſt <hi>reach thro';</hi> they muſt <hi>connect the means with the end,</hi> and make the <hi>one adequate</hi> to the <hi>other.</hi> Would you not laugh at a ſailor, who ſhould moor a ſhip with an inch rope, and ſo loſe the ſhip, for fear his owners ſhould find fault with him for wetting a cable?

when adopted in matters of conſequence; people loſe all <hi>confidence</hi> in their effects, and therefore loſe <hi>all courage and inducement</hi> to uſe ſtrong efforts to make them operate.</p>
            <p>I am clearly of opinion, if our people have loſt their confidence in our public counſels, and are backward in puſhing them into practice, the reaſon is, not becauſe they <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> to their intereſts, or <hi>wanting in zeal</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote them, but becauſe their <hi>courage</hi> is all <hi>worn out,</hi> and their <hi>patience exhauſted,</hi> by a ſeven years' courſe of <hi>viſionary, ineffectual, ill-contrived,</hi> and <hi>half-digeſted</hi> plans, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed little in <hi>theory,</hi> but conſtantly in <hi>practice,</hi> proved the baſeleſs fabrics of a viſion, and vaniſhed at laſt, not only <hi>without uſe,</hi> but with conſequences very <hi>detrimental</hi> to our national character of integrity and wiſdom, as well as to the intereſts and morals of our people; not the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging of all which was this conſtant effect which they all had, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that thoſe States or individuals, which <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted them with moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>I am of opinion it is quite time to quit this <hi>childiſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature</hi> of counſels, and adopt ſomething <hi>up to the full life,</hi> and propoſe ſome ſyſtem to our people, that will, when executed, be <hi>effective and ſufficient</hi> for it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But if you will continue to believe that my <hi>high ſcale</hi> of tax will ſtupify our people with terror on firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some objects, when ſeen thro' a miſt, or at a diſtance, appear frightful and clothed with terrors, which all vaniſh on a <hi>nearer</hi> view, and more <hi>cloſe</hi> inſpection.

                  </gap>ant</hi> expectation painted out.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe and realize to ourſelves then, that my ſcale of tax was adopted and become habitual to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; can you imagine that the country would be thereby rendered a whit the worſe, or more inconvenient to live in, than if the tax was not paid? or if you cannot come quite up to this, do you conceive the inconvenience of the tax paid in this way, by any compariſon <hi>ſo heavy and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> as the preſent tax on <hi>polls and eſtates,</hi> or any other <hi>of equal product,</hi> that has <hi>ever been practiſed</hi> or <hi>propoſed,</hi> would be to the people at large.</p>
            <p>I do not know how far our people at large are impreſſed with a ſenſe of the <hi>importance of our union;</hi> it is, in my opinion, an object of the utmoſt weight; I conceive that the very exiſtence of our <hi>reſpectability abroad,</hi> the intereſt which we are to derive from our <hi>connexions with foreign nations,</hi> and our <hi>ſecurity</hi> againſt foreign and domeſtic inſults and invaſions, <hi>all depend on it,</hi> and even our <hi>independence</hi> itſelf cannot be ſupported <hi>without it;</hi> and as I know well that the attachment of our people to their independence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſal, I ſhould ſuppoſe that our union, which is ſo cloſely and inſeparably connected with it, would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be an equal object of their attachment and concern.</p>
            <p>If this is the caſe, I cannot be perſuaded that our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will revolt againſt any reaſonable and neceſſary means of ſupporting both the one and the other, and as the tax I propoſe appears to me the <hi>only poſſible</hi> and <hi>practicable
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:023972_0273_0FC2AFCB2E1CCF40"/>
means,</hi> any how within our power, which can be <hi>adequate</hi> to this great purpoſe, I cannot ſay that I ſhudder to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch a tax; but I think we may ſafely preſume on the <hi>good ſenſe of our people,</hi> their <hi>patience, and diſcernment</hi> of their intereſts, enough to expect their concurrence in the meaſure, and even cheerfulneſs and zeal in ſupporting it.</p>
            <p>But if this cannot be obtained, I can add no more; I have no conception that the <hi>Americans</hi> either <hi>can</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to be governed <hi>againſt</hi> their conſent, or that the collection of taxes, of any kind, or in any mode, can be made with ſucceſs, whilſt an opinion becomes general among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the <hi>taxes</hi> are <hi>unneceſſary, unjuſt, or improperly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it would not be very difficult to make out <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of particulars</hi> neceſſary to form the plan or ſyſtem, both of the tax and its collection, on the principles herein urged; but the whole is humbly ſubmitted to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the public, who, I hope, are enough impreſſed with the importance of the ſubject, and the neceſſity of adopting ſome deciſions relating to it, without delay, to induce every one to give it that attention that its <hi>nature and weight</hi> requires, and which our preſent critical circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances make indiſpenſable to our political ſalvation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It may be of uſe to the reader, to advert to ſome particulars of the ſtate and condition of the country and its revenues, at the time when this Eſſay was firſt publiſhed.</p>

                  <p>But theſe taxes were levied by the States neither in any <hi>due proportion</hi> of quotas, nor with any <hi>equality</hi> of either <hi>quantity</hi> or <hi>punctuality</hi> in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and as no <hi>power of compulſion was veſted in Congreſs</hi> at that time, the ſupplies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>PUBLIC <hi>ſecurities are notes or promiſes of payment, made in writing, to the public creditors, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on the public for monies lent, ſupplies furniſhed, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices rendered,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.

As the public was in no condition to pay theſe ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties when they became due, they ſuffered <hi>a great deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> the owners ſold them for what they could get, and they have long been <hi>an article of traffic</hi> in the hands of the <hi>brokers</hi> and <hi>ſpeculators;</hi> and the price-current, or eſtimated

value of them, as they paſs from hand to hand, is become as much <hi>fixed</hi> and as <hi>well known</hi> in the brokers' offices, as that of any <hi>other goods</hi> or merchandiſes.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>price-current,</hi> made in market by the general conſent of buyers and ſellers, <hi>determines the value</hi> of all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of traffic, whether <hi>goods, bills of exchange, public ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities, ſtocks</hi> of every kind, or even <hi>money itſelf:</hi> and this rule of eſtimation is ſo <hi>fixed</hi> and natural, that no external force or height of authority can <hi>alter</hi> it, as has been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by experiment (the ſtrongeſt proof in nature) in the inſtances of <hi>tender-laws and regulation of prices,</hi> which have often been attempted <hi>in vain,</hi> tho' puſhed as far <hi>as law, authority, violence,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> could go.</p>
            <p>Therefore it follows, that the public ſecurities, when they become articles of exchange or traffic, are really <hi>worth</hi> what they will <hi>bring</hi> in market, and no more; <hi>i. e. let their nominal value be what it will, their real value is ſo much as, and no more than, they will bring in market:</hi> this is plain, natural law, which it is in vain for the greateſt force or higheſt authority to oppoſe; it will prove too ſtrong for the moſt mighty oppoſition; it is therefore moſt wiſe to ſubmit to it, and obey its ſovereign dictates, without reluctance.</p>
            <p>The price-current of public ſecurities has been different at different times, and the different kinds of them are eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated at different prices; very many have been purchaſed at 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, or 8 for 1; others at 6<hi>s.</hi> or 7<hi>s.</hi> in the pound, or about 3 for 1. A few inſtances may be produced of ſales at higher and lower prices; but in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I believe, the above prices may be eſtimated as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes: very great numbers of <hi>final ſettlements</hi> have been bought at 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, or 8 for 1.</p>
            <p>It is very certain, and undoubtedly confeſſed on all ſides that our <hi>ſoldiers,</hi> when their <hi>ſervices were over,</hi> and their accounts were fairly adjuſted, were entitled to the liquidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed balances in their favor, in <hi>genuine money<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We will ſuppoſe, that inſtead of a certificate of 20<hi>s.</hi> which would bring but 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> they had been paid <hi>in braſs,</hi> at <hi>20s. per lb.</hi> which was worth in market, and would bring <hi>no more than, 2s. 6d. per lb.</hi> it is plain their condition would have been exactly the ſame, <hi>i. e.</hi> the ſoldier that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>pound of braſs,</hi> which he could ſell for 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> and no more, would be juſt as well off, and as well paid, as the ſoldier who received the <hi>certificate of 20s.</hi> which he could ſell for 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> and no more; it is a very plain caſe that neither of them are paid more than 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, and that the remaining 17<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> remains unpaid, and conſequently due to them.</p>
            <p>And if any <hi>juſtice of honor to the public faith</hi> is deſigned or attempted, if muſt be effected by <hi>paying</hi> to them what ſtill <hi>remains due</hi> to them. But can the human mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that any ſort of juſtice or honor to the public faith would be done, not by <hi>pitying</hi> the poor ſoldiers, and <hi>paying</hi> the balance due to them, but inſtead of this, by raiſing a large ſum of money, by taxing the community, to buy in <hi>all the braſs,</hi> and giving 20<hi>s.</hi> per lb. for it to the ſpeculators who had bought it of the ſoldiers for 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> per lb. (even whilſt the current market price was but 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>) and giving intereſt till the caſh was paid? which would be giving thoſe ſpeculators <hi>eight times</hi> as much money as the <hi>capital</hi> they advanced, and 48 <hi>per cent. per ann. intereſt</hi> for it, till the caſh was paid.</p>
            <p>The brokers' intereſt of 4 per cent. per month, is a fool to this; for this not only recovers 4 <hi>per cent. per month in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> but ſecures the payment of <hi>eight-fold the capital,</hi> when the intereſt ceaſes. Beſides, the brokers run ſome riſk of <hi>opprobrium and loſs</hi> of their debt; but this plan gives <hi>honor and ſecurity</hi> to the whole tranſaction, by giving it the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſanction of the ſupreme power of the State.</p>

It makes no difference to the argument, whether the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle to traffic paid to the ſoldiers, and purchaſed in again by the State, be <hi>braſs</hi> or <hi>certificates;</hi> becauſe both, by the ſuppoſition, are of <hi>equal price</hi> in the market, and make a payment of <hi>equal value</hi> to the ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>The whole argument holds good and in equal force, with regard to all <hi>original holders</hi> of public ſecurities, as to the <hi>ſoldiers,</hi> all of whom are ſuppoſed to have furniſhed to the public, <hi>caſh, goods, or ſervices,</hi> to the amount of the certificates they received.</p>
            <p>The argument alſo has the ſame force, with reſpect to ſpeculators, who have purchaſed public ſecurities at a <hi>higher exchange</hi> than 8 for 1: with reſpect to theſe, the concluſion is the ſame in <hi>nature,</hi> but differs only in <hi>degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This plan of paying the vaſt ſums of public monies to ſpeculators, which were originally due to the ſoldiers and other original holders of the public ſecurities, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being <hi>withheld</hi> from them to whom it ought to have been made, <hi>ſtill remains due:</hi> I ſay, the plan of paying theſe monies to the ſpeculators, who at preſent hold the ſecurities, <hi>i. e.</hi> paying to theſe ſpeculators <hi>eight times</hi> the capital they advanced for the purchaſe of them, <hi>with 48 per cent. per ann. intereſt,</hi> till actual payment is made to them, and taxing the State to raiſe theſe monies, and of courſe <hi>taxing the poor ſoldiers</hi> (who, in their penury and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, ſold their certificates at 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>) in the pound, for the <hi>money</hi> neceſſary <hi>to pay them at 20s.</hi> in the pound, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to the ſpeculators who purchaſed them: I ſay, this plan is adopted by ſome folks with great ſeriouſneſs and gravity; and their ideas are ſupported with very ſpecious arguments, the detail of which I wave conſidering juſt now, that I may mention one propoſition, which I think neceſſary to introduce here, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb n="274" facs="unknown:023972_0281_0FC2AFFB32B8FC40"/>
All the arguments that can be adduced, can never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any body that this plan is right; there is not a <hi>boy</hi> in a compting-houſe, or <hi>maid</hi> in a kitchen, who would not exclaim againſt the injuſtice of it, the moment they heard and underſtood it; the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> which reſides in every human breaſt, <hi>revolts</hi> againſt it; for this I appeal to the ſentiments and feelings of every body who has any.</p>
            <p>Do not you think, my fellow-citizens, that a ſpeculator in public ſecurities muſt be pretty well brazed, yea, bra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>This plan, however cruel, ſhocking, and execrable it may appear, is defended by ſome folks by this argument, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>public ſecurities, like bonds, bills of exchange, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory notes,</hi> &amp;c. are aſſignable or transferable over, by which the aſſignee becomes poſſeſſed of <hi>all the right and intereſt,</hi> which the <hi>original holder</hi> had therein; that the whole property paſſes by the aſſignment, and the ſum paid by the aſſignee to the original holder, whether <hi>little or much,</hi> is of no conſideration in the caſe.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe this holds true <hi>generally</hi> with reſpect to bonds, bills of exchange, promiſſory notes, &amp;c. but I do not think it holds true <hi>univerſally:</hi> the rule has its exceptions, and I think the <hi>caſe in point</hi> is manifeſtly one of the <hi>ſtrongeſt inſtances</hi> of them. The <hi>Continental money</hi> is a moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one; the <hi>public faith</hi> was plighted for the redemption of <hi>that money,</hi> as ſacredly as <hi>force</hi> of words, <hi>height</hi> of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and <hi>appeals to Heaven</hi> could do it. Yet every man acknowledges, that if that money, tho' all made <hi>payable to the bearer,</hi> was to be redeemed at a <hi>hard dollar</hi> for every <hi>Continental one,</hi> the moſt abſurd <hi>injuſtice</hi> would be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="unknown:023972_0282_0FC2AFFCB053CBB0"/>
The <hi>old State money</hi> of this State affords another inſtance of the ſame kind. The <hi>loan-office certificates</hi> afford a third inſtance, the value of which is eſtimated by Congreſs, by a public <hi>ſcale of depreciation,</hi> grounded on the <hi>real value of the certificates,</hi> at the ſeveral <hi>dates</hi> at which they were iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. Nobody pretends to object to this meaſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or the principle on which it was founded.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance may be adduced from a clear, decided rule of the law of the land, <abbr>viz.</abbr> if an executor buys up the bonds of his teſtator at a diſcount, <hi>i. e.</hi> by paying leſs than the nominal value for them, when he comes to make up the accounts of his executorſhip, he ſhall not be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>nominal value</hi> of thoſe bonds, but ſo much only as he <hi>actually paid</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>To all this I will venture to add here a propoſed caſe, with my opinion on it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> ſuppoſe a merchant ſtops pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who has thouſands of bonds, notes, &amp;c. againſt him, and upon the beſt ſurvey of his affairs, it becomes the general opinion that he will pay 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, and his <hi>bonds and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>otes</hi> are generally paſſed from hand to to hand, <hi>at that exchange.</hi> Every broker and banker has them, and paſſes them for years together at that rate; but, after a ſeries of time, the debtor becomes able and willing to pay his whole debt, and is cited into a moſt ſovereign court of chancery, where <hi>mere right and juſtice</hi> is the rule of the court; where it is confeſſed that the 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> is either paid or now due to the aſſignee of the note for 20<hi>s.</hi> and the ſole queſtion before the court is, <hi>who ſhall have the other 17s. 6d.</hi> whether the <hi>original creditor,</hi> to whom the debt was due, for full conſideration paid, or to the aſſignee who had never paid <hi>any thing</hi> for it?</p>
            <p>We will ſuppoſe the court is under no bias, but <hi>honeſtly</hi> mean to make ſuch a decree as will be <hi>moſt juſt,</hi> do the <hi>moſt honor</hi> to their court, and be <hi>beſt approved in Heaven.</hi> I make no difficulty in giving my opinion, that the court will award in favor of the original creditor, who has paid the <hi>full conſideration</hi> of the debt, in preference to the aſſignee, who has <hi>never paid any thing</hi> for it.</p>

Find fault with and diſprove this opinion, whoever of you can; I expoſe it with confidence, to the cenſure of you all. Where two perſons are in equal poſſeſſion of an eſtate, <hi>it ſhall be given to him that hath right.

            </p>
            <p>I take it, that the facts out of which <hi>the reaſons grow,</hi> that govern aſſignments of bonds, bills of exchange, and negotiable notes, are ſo <hi>toto c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>One inſtance of this difference, of full notoriety, and ſtriking enough, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that in the caſe of transfer of bills of exchange, negotiable notes, &amp;c. a <hi>valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> is always preſumed to be given; but in the caſe in point <hi>no ſuch thing,</hi> but the <hi>very contrary, appears</hi> in full blaze of evidence; 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound has not the <hi>leaſt pretenſion</hi> of being a valuable conſideration for <hi>eight times</hi> the principal advanced, and 48 <hi>per cent. intereſt</hi> for the ſame, till the whole ſhall be paid, together with 48 per cent. for ſeveral years' intereſt due on the certificate, <hi>before the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer ever ſaw it,</hi> or even <hi>paid his 2s. 6d. for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This fact ſtands glaring in the <hi>face of the world,</hi> and ſtrikes conviction of its own injuſtice and abſurdity into every beholder; it gives concern to the moſt avaricious ſpeculator, and brings a <hi>bluſh</hi> even into the <hi>anvil counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> of the ſanguine promoters of the bleſſed ſcheme of making proviſion for the enormous payment.</p>
            <p>They endeavour to <hi>palliate</hi> it, or <hi>ſhuffle it out of ſight,</hi> by ſuggeſting that the inſtances of this ſort are but <hi>few</hi> and inconſiderable, and ſo blended with the right and juſtice due to the diſtreſſed widows, orphans, ſoldiers, and other worthy citizens, who are public creditors, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated, and are therefore not worthy to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed; but here again the fact is notoriouſly againſt them. I ſhould think a man had need of a <hi>front as hard as an

andiron,</hi> to affirm, in the face of the public, that <hi>theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are but few and inconſiderable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a matter of public notoriety and general belief, that almoſt the <hi>whole</hi> of the <hi>widows, orphans, ſoldiers,</hi> and other <hi>diſtreſſed public creditors,</hi> have ſold their certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, which are now in the hands of the ſpeculators, who are known to be very numerous, and many of whom have a vaſt amount of them.</p>
            <p>But let theſe inſtances be few or many, it is a vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to ſay they are <hi>ſo blended with the other public credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that they cannot be ſeparated.</hi> A method of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>due diſcrimination</hi> is <hi>eaſily inveſtigated;</hi> the public creditors are <hi>eaſily found;</hi> their <hi>names</hi> are all on the <hi>public books,</hi> with the <hi>balances which were due to them</hi> when their accounts were ſettled.</p>
            <p>I propoſe then, that <hi>they ſhall be debited with the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates they received, at the price, exchange, or value at which they paſſed or could be ſold, when they received them, and have the reſidue of their balance paid to them honeſtly, with intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will take <hi>no more money</hi> to pay <hi>them</hi> than to pay the <hi>ſpeculators;</hi> and as to the certificates, except ſuch as are in the hands of the <hi>original holders,</hi> let them be paid <hi>to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever brings them in,</hi> at a ſcale of value founded on their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal value when they were iſſued, or the mean exchange at which they have paſſed for two or three years back.</p>
            <p>This will repay to the ſpeculators all the caſh they have advanced, which, I think, is all the juſtice or tenderneſs to which they are entitled from the public; for, to ſay the beſt of them, I eſteem them a ſort of men <hi>barely tolerable,</hi> but by no means worthy of <hi>encouragement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some people ſay they have merit, and ſupport the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith, by giving <hi>ſomething</hi> for certificates, when others would <hi>not buy them at all;</hi> but I think we are not much beholden to them, for vilifying and decrying the public faith, till they have perſuaded the poor ſoldiers to ſell their certificates for 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, rather than truſt the public any longer.</p>
            <p>As my propoſal leaves no ground of complaint on the part of the ſpeculators, ſo I think it will do manifeſt juſtice

            <p>This is ſtating the matter, I conceive, clearly and fairly, and I beg leave to give my opinion decidedly in favor of the original creditors. It does appear to me, that the <hi>quid pro quo, or valuable conſideration, goes ſo into the nature, and makes ſuch a part of, the very eſſence of commutative juſtice, that it is impoſſible that an equitable debt ſhould be generated without it, by any contract whatever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a matter of the moſt public notoriety, that the <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> or valuable conſideration paid by the ſpeculators, is <hi>no more than the exchange</hi> at which they purchaſed the certificates, which is ſuch a <hi>mere trifle,</hi> that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>onts the common feelings of the human mind, to pretend that ſuch a trifle (ſay, one ſixth or eighth part) is a valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for <hi>the whole;</hi> it is a valuable conſideration for <hi>no more than was paid,</hi> and of conſequence can generate a debt of <hi>no more;</hi> the <hi>reſt</hi> ſtill ſtands connected with the original conſideration paid, <hi>i. e. ſticks</hi> to the original credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and there will adhere, till it is diſcharged by an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate payment.</p>
            <p>For no man is <hi>born</hi> with, or <hi>can acquire,</hi> a right to the <hi>earnings</hi> or <hi>fortune</hi> of another, without giving a <hi>valuable conſideration</hi> for it, and that conſideration muſt be of <hi>ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate value;</hi> for a <hi>penny</hi> can no more be a valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for a <hi>pound,</hi> than <hi>nothing</hi> at all can be for a <hi>penny:</hi> for it ſtrikes the human underſtanding as plainly, and with as much force, that a <hi>pound</hi> is worth more than a <hi>penny,</hi> as that a <hi>penny</hi> is worth more than <hi>nothing at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I do conclude, and contend ſtrongly for the concluſion, that the ſpeculators are entitled to no more than they have paid a valuable conſideration for, and <hi>the
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:023972_0288_0FC2B04CDB8C3730"/>
reſt remains due</hi> to the original creditors, as their <hi>dear earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> for which they have <hi>not yet been paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well that the ſpeculators have many ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arguments, ſpun as fine as ſilk, to prove their right to the whole debt ſpecified in their certificates; but the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier has a much better one, ſtrong as iron, yea, made of iron, I mean his <hi>earnings with ſword and muſket,</hi> thro' a ſeven years' war, which yet remain <hi>unſatisfied.</hi> Do you think that the fineſt ſilken arguments of the ſpeculator can ſtand any the leaſt chance with this iron one of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier?</p>
            <p>There is ſomething in <hi>original right,</hi> which ſtrikes the human mind w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> irreſiſtible force: this <hi>original right</hi> will for ever attach itſelf to <hi>original earnings;</hi> there it will <hi>ſtick,</hi> and cannot be <hi>torn</hi> away by any force, nor be <hi>decoyed</hi> by any fraud, till it is <hi>ſatisfied</hi> by adequate payment. A <hi>juſt debt</hi> will for ever <hi>remain a debt due, till it is paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It therefore follows, that if we pay the ſpeculators the immenſe ſums which they demand, the public debt of the whole ſum will <hi>ſtill remain due to the original creditors,</hi> who have, by their <hi>caſh, ſupplies,</hi> and <hi>earnings,</hi> advanced the full, valuable conſideration, out of which the debt firſt grew, and who have <hi>never been paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Public juſtice</hi> and the honor of the <hi>public faith</hi> require, not only that we pay as <hi>much money</hi> as we owe, <hi>but that we pay it to the perſons to whom it is due;</hi> for paying it to any <hi>body elſe</hi> can be no ſatisfaction of that juſtice and faith which we owe to our <hi>real creditors,</hi> but is an additional injury to them.</p>
            <p>The human mind can no otherwiſe know <hi>right and wrong,</hi> than by the <hi>force and manner</hi> in which they ſtrike the mind, and raiſe an <hi>approbation or diſapprobation</hi> in it; and I appeal to the <hi>feelings</hi> of all my readers, whether my propoſitions do not <hi>ſtrike</hi> their minds ſtrongly, and <hi>force their approbation</hi> of my concluſion. I challenge the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpeculator to believe it <hi>right,</hi> if he can, or rather not to believe it <hi>wrong,</hi> to lay the burden of a tax on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and among the reſt on the <hi>public creditors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> to raiſe money to pay the public debt, and when it
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:023972_0289_0FC2B053AA0FAB70"/>
is collected, to pay it away, not to the <hi>real creditors,</hi> who, by their earnings and advances, have paid the full conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the debts due to them, but to <hi>others who never earned</hi> any thing for us, nor paid any valuable conſideration to us, and, of conſequence, can have nothing due to them from us.</p>
            <p>There is another very ſerious conſequence, which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend from our paying ſuch an enormous ſum to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators, as they demand, if we now had the whole mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the treaſury, <abbr>viz.</abbr> it would be ſuch a drain of our public money, as would put it wholly <hi>out of our power to pay our real creditors</hi> in any tolerable ſeaſon, and would, in a great meaſure, <hi>reduce them to deſpair,</hi> of ever receiving their debts due, and of courſe would greatly leſſen all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the public faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the money is not in the public treaſury (which I take to be the fact) our iſſuing another deluge of <hi>public promiſes,</hi> by way of <hi>funding</hi> ſuch an enormous ſum, I fear would hurt the credit of the State ſtill more; for <hi>public promiſes,</hi> like all other promiſes that are broken, become of <hi>leſs and leſs value,</hi> the oftener they are <hi>repeated,</hi> and the more they are <hi>multiplied;</hi> and tho' I profeſs to believe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe new and multiplied public bills would be good enough to pay the ſpeculators with, yet I ſhould be ſorry that our <hi>real creditors</hi> (who have paid a full conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their debts due from the public) ſhould partake of the inconveniencies of them.</p>
            <p>I therefore humbly propoſe, that the firſt thing we do, ſhould be to ſet about <hi>raiſing the money;</hi> for <hi>this</hi> will be more acceptable when it comes, whoever is to have it, than <hi>any promiſes</hi> we can make.</p>
            <p>And in the next place I would propoſe, that the <hi>real cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> ſhould be <hi>paid firſt,</hi> and the ſpeculators <hi>laſt of all,</hi> if it is judged neceſſary that they ſhould ever be paid. I have ſeveral very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgent reaſons for this propoſition, both moral and political.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The real creditors have lain out of their money <hi>longer</hi> than the ſpeculators, and it ſeems to me very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and juſt, that the <hi>oldeſt</hi> debts ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> paid.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="283" facs="unknown:023972_0290_0FC2B055E05392E0"/>
2. The ſpeculators who expect <hi>eight-fold their principal,</hi> and 48 <hi>per cent. intereſt,</hi> can <hi>better afford</hi> to lie awhile out of their money, than the <hi>real creditors,</hi> who have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to <hi>any more than barely their principal,</hi> and 6 per cent. intereſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The general eſteem of the people, and public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the juſtice of the demand, is much greater with reſpect to the real creditors, than to the ſpeculators; and therefore, when the citizens of the State are told, when the money is to be collected, that it is deſigned <hi>for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the real creditors,</hi> the tax will probably be paid <hi>more cheerfully,</hi> and with <hi>leſs uneaſineſs and diſturbance,</hi> than may be expected if it was publicly known that it was <hi>to go to the ſpeculators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The real creditors are poor, and would be greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the payment made to them, and be enabled <hi>to go into buſineſs</hi> for their <hi>own</hi> and the <hi>public</hi> advantage. But when the ſpeculators are paid, they will all at once become ſo <hi>amazingly rich,</hi> that they will probably ſet up their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and run into other courſes of <hi>idleneſs and pleaſures, luxury and diſſipation,</hi> which are ever hurtful to the public; and I think it good policy to pay that money <hi>firſt</hi> which is like to do the <hi>moſt</hi> good, and to pay that which is like to do the <hi>moſt hurt, laſt of all,</hi> if it muſt be paid at all; for I ſhall ever think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound wiſdom, if <hi>evils and miſchiefs</hi> cannot be <hi>wholly avoided,</hi> to keep them at <hi>as great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> as poſſible.</p>
            <p>On the whole, whether any or all my propoſitions can be admitted or not, it does at leaſt appear that the real, original <hi>creditors,</hi> and <hi>ſpeculators,</hi> are characters of ſuch <hi>different</hi> predicament and merit, and their demands on the public, founded on ſuch <hi>different original conſiderations, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> and <hi>real earnings,</hi> that the leaſt conſequence that can be drawn from the whole matter, is a moſt manifeſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that there ſhould be a <hi>diſcrimination between them;</hi> that they can, with no propriety, or appearance of juſtice, be conſidered on an <hi>equal footing</hi> with each other, or in any manner entitled to the <hi>ſame conſideration</hi> and <hi>treatment</hi> from the public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="unknown:023972_0291_0FC2B0576587FC88"/>
But I muſt ſtop here a moment, to conſider a capital argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment advanced very ſeriouſly, <hi>"that if all the certificates are not indiſcriminately paid up to the holders of them, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic credit will receive ſuch a wound that we ſhall never be able to perſuade any body in future to loan money, or furniſh ſupplies or ſervices on the public faith, let our neceſſities be ever ſo great."</hi> I believe it will be readily admitted, that I have ſtated this argument in the <hi>ſame light</hi> in which it is <hi>urged</hi> by thoſe who make uſe of it; but I think there is a <hi>delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in this ſtatement of the argument, which I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>correct</hi> in the following manner, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>If, by any <hi>miſmanagement or neglect,</hi> if, by any <hi>deficiency or miſapplication</hi> of the public monies, it ſhall ſo fall out, that the <hi>real, worthy, public creditors</hi> cannot be paid; if matters are <hi>worked about</hi> by any <hi>ſhifts, arts, combinations, contrivances,</hi> or <hi>deceits,</hi> ſo that the man who has <hi>loaned mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, furniſhed ſupplies,</hi> or <hi>rendered ſervices</hi> to the public in its neceſſities, <hi>cannot be paid:</hi> no <hi>pretty, plauſible excuſe,</hi> no <hi>fine-ſpun arguments,</hi> no <hi>force</hi> of words, which really mean <hi>nothing,</hi> no pathetic <hi>addreſſes</hi> upon perverted facts, can help us out; but the public credit muſt ſuffer; and if the very men who make theſe miſtakes, or even ſome wiſer men, were to rule the roaſt in any future time of public diſtreſs, there is the higheſt probability that they would find people <hi>backward to lend their money,</hi> furniſh <hi>ſupplies,</hi> or render <hi>ſervices,</hi> on the credit of the public.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if we conſent to pay the ſpeculators the <hi>bare principal,</hi> which they have paid, with the intereſt of it, but ſhall refuſe to ſecure by the public ſanction, the <hi>profits of 8 or</hi> 900 per cent. which they demand, the amount of which, in moderate computation, cannot be leſs than 2 <hi>or</hi> 3,000,000 <hi>of dollars,</hi> which they never <hi>earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>paid</hi> for, nor we ever received any <hi>benefit</hi> or valuable conſideration for; I ſay, if we refuſe to pay to the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors theſe <hi>enormous profits,</hi> it will ſo <hi>diſcourage</hi> them, that it may make them <hi>backward</hi> in venturing again, and ſo we may be obliged to do <hi>without them</hi> in future times, let us <hi>want them ever ſo much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe alternatives are doubtleſs very <hi>dreadful,</hi> and
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:023972_0292_0FC2B058E13B37A8"/>
I think there can be no doubt, but we are under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable neceſſity of incurring <hi>one of them;</hi> but I am in no condition to give my opinion, which would be the moſt <hi>terrible</hi> of the two. So having clearly and fairly ſtated the facts, I leave the reſt to the reader.</p>
            <p>But it may be further objected,—if all this is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, will it not put it out of the power of the holder of any public ſecurity, <hi>to ſell it?</hi> Experience will perhaps furniſh the beſt anſwer to this queſtion. The <hi>depreciation</hi> of Continental money never <hi>ſtopped</hi> the circulation of it. As long as it retained any value at all, it paſſed quick enough; and would purchaſe hard money or any thing elſe, as readily as ever, when the exchange was 200 for 1, and when every <hi>hope,</hi> or even <hi>idea,</hi> of its being <hi>redeemed</hi> at nominal value, had <hi>entirely vaniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am told, the price of <hi>ſtocks</hi> or <hi>public ſecurities</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is now at 55 per cent. <hi>i. e.</hi> reduced by depreciation to near half their nominal value; and not a man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has the moſt diſtant idea that they will <hi>ever be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> at their nominal value, yet <hi>they paſs</hi> quick enough <hi>at their exchange,</hi> and any perſon who is diſpoſed <hi>to ſell out,</hi> has no difficulty in finding a <hi>purchaſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be further objected, that if the ſpeculators could have known before-hand, that they ſhould <hi>come off ſo,</hi> they would not have been concerned in ſuch ſpeculations at all; but would have laid out their money in <hi>trade, huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, manufactures,</hi> or ſome <hi>other way.</hi> However <hi>lamentable</hi> this may be, I muſt leave it unanſwered.</p>
            <p>It may be further objected, that this doctrine will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet and throw into confuſion the common <hi>rules and laws,</hi> which regulate aſſignments of <hi>bonds, bills of exchange, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiable notes,</hi> &amp;c. which have had the ſanction of long uſage and practice, and have ever been found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be both juſt and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it will not, for this plain reaſon, which would demonſtrably govern the caſe, if nothing elſe could be ſaid upon it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> every <hi>law or rule of right,</hi> whether commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, political, moral, or divine, holds <hi>right and juſt, only in its mean;</hi> the moment it is puſhed <hi>out of its mean,</hi> into
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:023972_0293_0FC2B0656C609880"/>
its <hi>extremes,</hi> it loſes the <hi>reaſons</hi> on which it is founded, and becomes <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have a law which forbids to make <hi>graven images;</hi> but this prohibits not <hi>ſtatues</hi> in gardens or <hi>heads</hi> on ſhips. We have another forbidding to do any <hi>work on the Sabbath;</hi> but this does not make it unlawful to <hi>put out the fire</hi> of a houſe that is burning, or laboring hard to <hi>ſave a drowning man,</hi> or to pull <hi>an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x out of the mire.</hi> We have a law that ſays, "thou <hi>ſhalt not kill;</hi>" but this prohibits not the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> of a malefactor, or <hi>fighting a battle.</hi> We have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that ſays, "thou ſhalt not <hi>ſteal;</hi>" yet a man may <hi>lawfully ſteal</hi> to <hi>ſatisfy his hunger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only queſtion, I conceive, which the ſubject admits in this place is, whether the demand of the ſpeculator is an <hi>extreme caſe,</hi> which comes not <hi>within the reaſons,</hi> and of courſe cannot be juſtified or ſupported by the <hi>rule, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aſſignments?</hi> I contend for the affirmative of this queſtion, and for reaſon ſay the demand is <hi>morally wrong,</hi> becauſe it would take an immenſe ſum of money from the community, which muſt be a large proportion of their earnings, and give the ſame to the ſpeculators, <hi>without any adequate valuable conſideration,</hi> either paid by the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or received from them by the citizens, contrary to the moſt fundamental law of <hi>commutative juſtice,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that a <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> or a valuable <hi>conſideration,</hi> ſhall always be given <hi>in lieu</hi> of the property transferred. This is the moſt <hi>eſſential part of the moral law,</hi> which regards property.</p>
            <p>Further, this is not only <hi>morally</hi> wrong, but <hi>politically</hi> ſo too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an immenſe property from thoſe who had <hi>earned</hi> it, and would, of courſe, probably make the <hi>beſt uſe</hi> of it, and places it in the hands of people who have <hi>not earned</hi> it, and who would, of courſe, probably make the <hi>worſt uſe</hi> of it. And it is certainly high policy to keep the wealth of the State as far as poſſible in the hands of thoſe people who will make the <hi>beſt uſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe this would <hi>impoveriſh the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> who are ever the ſtrength of every nation, in order to
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:023972_0294_0FC2B0665870F540"/>
throw immenſe wealth into the hands of individuals, which would not only <hi>weaken</hi> the State, but deſtroy that <hi>equality of the citizens</hi> which is neceſſary to the continuance of our republican form of government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe this plan will <hi>retard the increaſe</hi> of our <hi>trade</hi> and our <hi>population,</hi> and leſſen the <hi>value</hi> of our lands. We all know that burdens on trade leſſen it; heavy taxes on the country will diſcourage people from coming to ſettle on our lands, and, of courſe, the increaſe of our population will be retarded, which will reduce the number of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers of lands, and, of courſe, leſſen their value.</p>
            <p>Our neighbours, eſpecially <hi>New-York,</hi> have a vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of unſettled lands; they court ſettlers with this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motive, that they have means to pay their debts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any burdenſome recourſe to <hi>taxes</hi> on their <hi>lands, labor,</hi> or <hi>cattle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The funding plan in queſtion, I am told, will require about 300,000 dollars per ann. to defray the intereſt only; beſides which, we have ſundry immenſe demands againſt the State. The principal debt, the funding of which is now under conſideration, is <hi>about 5,000,000 of dollars,</hi> near half of which I take to be deſigned for <hi>clear profit</hi> to the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; to be due to them, or from us, it cannot be ſaid, for they never paid us any thing for it; it muſt then be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive generoſity</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>It may do for people to be <hi>generous,</hi> when their <hi>incomes are affluent,</hi> and <hi>caſh, plenty;</hi> but when they are oppreſſed with <hi>debt</hi> to ſuch an amount as to bring their <hi>credit,</hi> and even their <hi>capital,</hi> into danger, in this critical circumſtance, the ſtricteſt <hi>economy,</hi> yea, even <hi>cloſe parſimony,</hi> become very important duties. But in ſuch a criſis of diſtreſs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to aſſume an immenſe, needleſs, additional debt, even if a due conſideration was paid for it, would be extreme ill policy; but to do it without <hi>any conſideration</hi> at all, would be the height of <hi>abſurdity and madneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At all times we ought to be <hi>juſt,</hi> before we are <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> But at ſuch a criſis, a laviſhment that will put it <hi>out of our power to be juſt,</hi> muſt be reprobated as downright wickedneſs. And as the <hi>criminality</hi> of all crimes is eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:023972_0295_0FC2B07C803B76A8"/>
by the <hi>damage</hi> they do, that <hi>conduct in a ruler,</hi> which deſtroys the <hi>credit</hi> of a State, and even puts it out of the power of it to be <hi>juſt,</hi> and of courſe deſtroys the <hi>rights</hi> of thouſands of its moſt meritorious citizens, ought to be branded, as the moſt cenſurable of <hi>any crime</hi> which can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect human <hi>property, character, and honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This plan is impolitic, becauſe it will convey the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney collected from the people to <hi>a great diſtance</hi> from the places where it was collected, and of courſe the people who paid it, will have <hi>little or no benefit</hi> from its future cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. If the ſame monies were to be paid (as they ought to be) to the <hi>real creditors, i. e.</hi> the ſoldiers and others, who furniſhed monies, ſupplies, &amp;c. who are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered over the whole State, and are to be found in every part of it; I ſay, if the monies collected from the people were to be paid to thoſe, it would be <hi>diffuſed over the whole State,</hi> and every perſon who paid the tax to raiſe theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, would have a chance of <hi>taking benefit of its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the caſe will be widely different, when it ſhall be paid to the ſpeculators; moſt of them live in the city, and the few who reſide in the country, when they come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their immenſe fortunes, will immediately come to the city, with all their money; the country will be no proper place to parade in; they will find nobody there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, this will not do at all; they muſt move into the city, where they can find people of their own claſs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate with.</p>
            <p>And this is not the worſt of it; the ſpeculators, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, muſt <hi>nominally belong to this State,</hi> but doubt not but they are in company, and ſhare profits with many who <hi>live out of it,</hi> and conſequently convey their wealth out of the State.</p>
            <p>And this is not the worſt of it, but I conceive that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, tho' they reſide in this State, are not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives

            <p>It is here to be noted in a manner which I think deſerves great attention, that however <hi>dirty, ragged, poor,</hi> and <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable</hi> an <hi>injured people</hi> may appear, they always have one <hi>ſpecies of revenge</hi> left to them, which they rarely fail to make the moſt of, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>power and privilege of curſing</hi> their oppreſſors; they curſe them in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate their curſes by their fire-ſides to their <hi>children,</hi> who are not commonly apt to have much defect of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and they <hi>mix</hi> their execrations with their <hi>prayers to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid that the <hi>curſe cauſeleſs will not come;</hi> but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve few States or individuals have reaſon to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very eaſy <hi>under thoſe curſes which are not cauſeleſs.</hi> There is moſt certainly a <hi>Providence</hi> which governs the world, which pays the utmoſt attention to <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> without the leaſt reſpect imaginable to the <hi>lace</hi> or <hi>rags</hi> of the ſuitors.</p>
            <p>Many more arguments might be adduced, but I deem the above fully ſufficient, to prove that the plan in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in its nature <hi>immoral</hi> and <hi>diſhoneſt;</hi> and, in a <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> view, extremely <hi>injurious</hi> to the State, and I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt add, <hi>fatally ruinous;</hi> and therefore is demonſtrated to be <hi>an extreme caſe,</hi> not at all <hi>within the reaſons</hi> of, and of courſe <hi>not juſtifiable</hi> by, the common <hi>law or rule of aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which, by long uſe, has been found to be both <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> and <hi>politically good</hi> and uſeful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Committee of Public Creditors,</hi> in their laſt petition to the Aſſembly, have introduced one propoſition, which pleaſes me very much, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>

this was written in <hi>letters of gold</hi> in the frontiſpiece of all our <hi>chambers of public council;</hi> and, what is more, might be engraved on the <hi>hearts</hi> of all our public men, as a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical principle <hi>too ſacred</hi> to yield to any <hi>views of intereſt,</hi> however <hi>gaudily dreſſed,</hi> or <hi>finely colored:</hi> and, by way of giving it my little mite of improvement and ſupport, I beg leave to add, that nothing which is both <hi>morally</hi> and <hi>politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally wrong,</hi> can ever be <hi>right</hi> in any ſenſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I have one argument againſt ſatisfying the demands of the ſpeculators, which I have not marked under either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or political arguments, becauſe it appears to me ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to partake of both, and therefore ought to be mentioned by itſelf. It is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>it gives public ſanction,</hi> ſupport, and even a kind of <hi>dignity,</hi> to a ſort of ſpeculation, which, if not wicked in itſelf, is of a nature very ruinous to the public, as it affords <hi>enormous profits without any earnings,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> eight-fold the principal, and 48 per cent. intereſt, which (were they to be freed from <hi>diſgrace and danger,</hi> and to be made <hi>reputable</hi> and ſafe by the <hi>ſanction and ſupport</hi> of the Legiſlature) would be enough to induce <hi>bad men</hi> of all profeſſions to <hi>withdraw their ſtock in buſineſs,</hi> from their uſual occupations, and <hi>veſt</hi> it in ſuch ſpeculations of high <hi>profit and honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my opinion, nothing ſcarcely can be worſe than <hi>public laws or inſtitutions,</hi> which tend to draw people from the <hi>honeſt and painful</hi> method of <hi>earning</hi> fortunes, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to purſue <hi>chimerical ways</hi> and <hi>means</hi> of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>wealth</hi> by <hi>ſleight of hand, without any earnings at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were theſe ſpeculators to gamble on <hi>each other's purſes</hi> only, I ſhould think leſs of it; but it becomes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly ruinous, when the <hi>public</hi> are to pay the <hi>loſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fatal experience of <hi>Europe</hi> might, methinks, be a warning to us. Ever ſince the bleſſed ſcheme of <hi>funding</hi> was firſt invented there, every nation has had a <hi>race of ſtock-jobbers</hi> and <hi>ſpeculators</hi> in the public ſecurities, who never fail to appear in plenty whenever a State gets <hi>into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,</hi> and the public ſaid <hi>faulters</hi> a little: they appear, to be ſure, with a mighty pretty grace, in aid of the <hi>public

credit,</hi> not indeed to keep it <hi>ſound and whole,</hi> but to evince that it is not <hi>quite dead;</hi> and for a practical proof of this, they will offer to give at leaſt <hi>ſomething</hi> for it.</p>

But our ſpeculators go far beyond this; they give 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, which is 8 for 1. But it is no wonder that our ſpeculators ſhould exceed thoſe of the moſt ingenious nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince the <hi>American genius</hi> ſets up to <hi>outdo all the world</hi> in every thing.</p>
            <p>A criſis of <hi>public diſtreſs</hi> is the proper time for this kind of vermin to ſwarm, like <hi>flies</hi> about a <hi>ſore,</hi> or <hi>crows</hi> round a <hi>carcaſs,</hi> not with any deſign to <hi>heal the ſore,</hi> or <hi>reſtore life,</hi> but to <hi>feed themſelves.</hi> This I admit to be a principle natural enough; but however excuſable it may be in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for theſe, like all other noxious animals, to purſue the means of their own preſervation, yet I cannot think they are entitled to the <hi>gratitude,</hi> or <hi>ſupport,</hi> or <hi>rewards,</hi> of the public.</p>
            <p>I beg the reader to note here very particularly, that I do not mean by any thing I write, to oppoſe any practicable and wiſe plan of funding or paying the <hi>real public debts;</hi> all I object to is, <hi>funding or paying the profits of the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however our public counſels may ſettle this queſtion, and whatever is to be done with our public monies, when we get them, I here beg my readers' attention a little, to the <hi>ways and means</hi> of raiſing them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, <hi>I do object as ſtrongly as I am able, to laying any conſiderable tax on polls and eſtates.</hi> This is tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the labor, cattle, and lands of our people, which are the <hi>embryo,</hi> the <hi>firſt principles,</hi> the very <hi>ſeed,</hi> the <hi>raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> of our wealth; and of courſe ought to be moſt carefully and tenderly <hi>nurſed, cultivated,</hi> and <hi>encouraged;</hi> but by no means to be <hi>burdened</hi> and <hi>diſcouraged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have <hi>imported luxuries</hi> enough, which are hurtful to the public; the neceſſary reſtraints of which <hi>require a tax</hi> ſufficiently large for the public uſe. It would be better for
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:023972_0299_0FC2A7BD454E1FB0"/>
our people to pay a tax of a dollar per gallon on rum and wines, 50 per cent. on ſilks, &amp;c. &amp;c. than to ſuffer their <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>lands</hi> to be taxed. But if this, with our uſual taxes on trade, &amp;c. is not ſufficient, I would rather tax our <hi>exported goods</hi> than our <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>lands;</hi> becauſe I think it manifeſtly better to tax our <hi>finiſhed goods,</hi> than our <hi>raw materials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, our paſt experience has ſufficiently taught us, that the collection of any conſiderable tax on polls and eſtates is impracticable; the vaſt arrears of moſt of our counties are a full proof of this; and to make our <hi>treaſury</hi> depend on revenues of <hi>uncertain product,</hi> is a ſure way to ſubject our finance to <hi>conſtant diſappointment,</hi> and of courſe to keep our <hi>public credit</hi> in a perpetual ſtate of <hi>depreſſion,</hi> and ſcandalous, as well as ruinous, <hi>deficiency.</hi> But I will not dwell longer here on this ſubject, having treated it more largely in my Sixth Eſſay on Free Trade and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to which I refer the reader, if he deſires to hear any more about it. <hi>[See p. 230.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>I object moſt ſeriouſly to iſſuing paper money, in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances,</hi> for the following reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We have already a full ſufficiency of circulating caſh.</hi> The labor of our people, and all the great ſtaple commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our country, produced by it, will and do bring not only immediate <hi>caſh,</hi> but a <hi>high price;</hi> and it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that money ſhould be <hi>too ſcarce</hi> in any country, where the <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> of it have <hi>quick ſale, good price,</hi> and command immediate <hi>caſh;</hi> whilſt this is the caſe, every natural and neceſſary <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of caſh is fully anſwered and ſatisfied; and, of courſe, if any body in ſuch caſe wants money, the want muſt ariſe, not from any <hi>ſcarcity of caſh,</hi> but from a want of ſomething that will <hi>purchaſe it, i. e.</hi> from poverty; which the introduction of an addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al quantity of circulating caſh will by no means remove, but muſt increaſe, becauſe it will directly tend to leſſen induſtry, and introduce luxury.</p>
            <p>It is no objection to this, that <hi>European</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> goods will not bring ready caſh; it is well known that the market is greatly glutted with thoſe articles; and when a
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:023972_0300_0FC2A7CD00125B38"/>
market is <hi>overſtocked with any articles,</hi> they will not bring <hi>quick</hi> ſale and <hi>ready</hi> caſh, let money be ever ſo plenty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our caſh for a year paſt has been not only fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the purpoſes of our trade, <hi>but has been in a very ſettled, ſteady ſtate, with very little fluctuation or variation in its value.</hi> This appears from the <hi>ſettled prices</hi> which our ſtaple commodities have born thro' the laſt year. The ſame thing appears from the <hi>negotiations of the Bank;</hi> from which it is manifeſt, that the ſtate and quantity of hard caſh is nearly the ſame with us now as it was a year ago; this proves that the quantity of circulating caſh is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for were it not ſo, it would undulate and vary; for caſh, like water, will always flow from the <hi>higher</hi> to the <hi>lower</hi> ſurface, and will never become <hi>fixed and ſteady</hi> till the true <hi>equilibrium</hi> is obtained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is admitted by every body, that caſh was plenty enough before the war; but it is plain we have now much more of it than we had then;</hi> becauſe the price of labor and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the country are much higher now than they were then. On an average, about 40 or 50 per cent. more can now be obtained for labor and country produce, than their current price was in 1774.</p>
            <p>It is no objection to this, that it is more difficult to <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row money on intereſt now</hi> than it was <hi>then;</hi> it is a want of public and private <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>diſtruſt</hi> of all ſecurity, and not a <hi>ſcarcity</hi> of caſh, which makes the difficulty. Beſides this, another cauſe may be aſſigned, <abbr>viz.</abbr> our monied men who uſed to diſpoſe of their money in that way, have, at leaſt many of them, <hi>loſt their money,</hi> loaned on either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or private ſecurities, by the <hi>defect of thoſe ſecurities,</hi> and of courſe the lenders of money are in this way reduced to a <hi>fewer</hi> number, whilſt at the ſame time, the ſame cauſe <hi>adds to the number</hi> of thoſe who have occaſion to <hi>bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi> each of which naturally increaſes the difficulty of borrowing.</p>
            <p>Striking paper money will <hi>leſſen</hi> none of theſe difficulties, but will <hi>increaſe</hi> them all; as it is evident that it will much leſſen all <hi>confidence in any ſecurities</hi> of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:023972_0301_0FC2A7CE31D1BD08"/>
and, in every view, <hi>diminiſh</hi> the number of lenders of money.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Making large and ſudden additions (of either pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or hard money) to our circulating caſh, will not increaſe our wealth:</hi> its effect will be an <hi>increaſe of the price</hi> of all articles of traffic, <hi>i. e.</hi> it will deſtroy the <hi>ſteady value</hi> of our money, by leſſening its worth in an <hi>inverſe ratio</hi> of the increaſe of its quantity, and ſo, without any benefit, will introduce the ruinous miſchiefs of a fluctuating currency, <hi>from which, good Lord, deliver us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>I do not apprehend that we have the leaſt chance of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the credit of paper money, if it ſhould be iſſued;</hi> and to expoſe our public credit to further <hi>diſgrace</hi> and <hi>inſult,</hi> and to waſte the public wealth in further <hi>ſtupid, abſurd,</hi> and <hi>iniquitous appreciations</hi> of depreciated paper, appears to me the height of political frenzy. The preſſure of a vaſt public debt, the low ſtate of the public credit, the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diffidence in that ſort of money which prevails among the people of all ranks, and the dreadful apprehenſions of its conſequences, which are expreſſed <hi>by the Bank,</hi> and by all <hi>our merchants</hi> (who are certainly the beſt judges of the matter) I ſay, all theſe put together appear to me to deſtroy every degree of probability of ſupporting the credit of any additional paper currency.</p>
            <p>And I cannot ſuppoſe any body diſtracted enough to think it <hi>proper to iſſue it,</hi> if every idea of the probability of <hi>ſupporting its credit</hi> muſt be given up. But I am apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that if our ſpeculators fail in their ſcheme of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their <hi>immenſe profits funded,</hi> the demand for <hi>that money</hi> will be greatly leſſened, and ſo, perhaps, the <hi>zeal</hi> for ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paper may <hi>cool away,</hi> and, of courſe, any further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt it, may not be neceſſary. But if nothing can hinder the attempt, I am of opinion it muſt die in the birth.—For,</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>I do not believe it poſſible to uſher paper money into gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral currency, either with or without a tender-act.</hi> Making it <hi>a tender</hi> is indeed too ſhocking to be admitted by any ſober man that I have heard of; and <hi>without it,</hi> it muſt, I think,
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:023972_0302_0FC2A7CF4F4706A8"/>
have the ſame effect, and ſhare the ſame fate, as the other paper which has recently gone before it.</p>
            <p>But after all, if it ſhould gain a <hi>general currency,</hi> and a <hi>credit</hi> but <hi>little inferior</hi> to hard money, the effect, I think, muſt plainly and evidently be, <hi>that it will ſoon drive all the hard money out of the country, or at leaſt out of circulation,</hi> as it will certainly be either hoarded or purchaſed up for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation; and then we ſhall have nothing before us, but to increaſe the <hi>quantity</hi> of our paper, and ſupply the <hi>defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of its <hi>value</hi> by <hi>additions</hi> to its <hi>quantity,</hi> and make the moſt of it, Continental like, as long as we can make it paſs at all.</p>
            <p n="7">7. With reſpect to the plan of opening a <hi>Loan-Office,</hi> and ſtriking a ſum of paper money to put into it, <hi>to be loan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out on private ſecurity</hi> to ſuch perſons as may want to borrow, I have to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all the objections which lie againſt ſtriking paper money at all, lie with equal weight againſt ſtriking any for this particular purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This will bring the borrowers into difficulty, inſtead of helping them;</hi> for if they give a <hi>good ſecurity</hi> for the money, and find, when they have got it, that it is not <hi>equal to good money,</hi> but muſt be paſſed at a <hi>diſcount</hi> or <hi>depreciated</hi> value, their purpoſes will not be anſwered, nor their <hi>neceſſities be relieved</hi> by it. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This inconvenience will fall heavieſt on the moſt diſtreſſed part of the community,</hi> for no others will give <hi>good ſecurity</hi> for <hi>bad money.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>If the money ſhould, by any ſtrange turn, prove equal to hard money, the ſum propoſed,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 50,000<hi>l. is by no means equal to this demand,</hi> and, of courſe, will be immediately ſnapped up by <hi>favorites,</hi> or ſuch who happen to ſtand <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> and of courſe it will by no means operate by way of <hi>public</hi> benefit, or <hi>general relief</hi> of the diſtreſs of our people, but will be engroſſed by a <hi>few ſharp-ſighted</hi> folks, with, perhaps, not the beſt title to public favors, or moſt likely to make the beſt uſe of them. I think that any ſcheme of this ſort had better be put off, till we are <hi>in a condition to</hi>
               <pb n="296" facs="unknown:023972_0303_0FC2A7D10DD75D90"/>
               <hi>make it operate</hi> in a way of <hi>effectual, impartial,</hi> and <hi>general</hi> utility.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, the great principle I go upon with reſpect to public ſecurities, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that all bills iſſued on the public credit, of every ſort, under whatever deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination they may appear, whether of certificates, paper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, annuities, &amp;c. &amp;c. take their value, not from the</hi> ſums ſpecified in the face <hi>of them, but from the</hi> price <hi>or</hi> exchange <hi>at which they generally paſs in market, and, of courſe, when they are redeemed by the public, it ought to be either at their original value, or at that price or exchange at which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally paſs at the time of redemption,</hi> EXCEPTING ONLY <hi>ſuch ſecurities as are in the hands of the original holder, and have never been alienated.</hi> Such ſecurities are <hi>evidences of</hi> full conſideration <hi>paid, and, of courſe, of a</hi> full debt <hi>due to ſuch holder: but ſecurities in the hands of a purchaſer cannot be</hi> ſuch evidence.</p>
            <p>When public ſecurities gain a currency, or become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of traffic, and depreciate in the hands of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, <hi>he doubtleſs ſuſtains loſs,</hi> and is really <hi>injured;</hi> and when the depreciation is great, ſay 8 for 1, or 200 for 1 (bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> which we have ſeen) the miſchief becomes <hi>very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and in its nature lies in the <hi>loſs which the poſſeſſor of the ſecurities ſuſtained, by their depreciation whilſt they were in his hands:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it appears clearly enough <hi>where the miſchief</hi> lies, and, of courſe, it is eaſy to ſee what muſt be the <hi>nature</hi> of the remedy it requires, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>ſuch a remedy as will make up the loſſes which every one has ſuſtained by the depreciation of the public ſecurities whilſt in their hands.</hi> This is manifeſtly impracticable, and perhaps the utmoſt power of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention cannot hit on any plan which will do this; what then ought the public to do? I anſwer, the ſame which any private man muſt do, who knows that he has had a <hi>valuable conſideration</hi> for money, and <hi>honeſtly owes</hi> it, but <hi>knows not to whom</hi> it is due, or cannot <hi>find his creditor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this view of the matter it appears very plain, that <hi>appreciating</hi> the ſecurities, and redeeming them at <hi>full va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,</hi> gives not the <hi>leaſt remedy</hi> to the <hi>ſufferers by the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="unknown:023972_0304_0FC2A7D6AA9A3830"/>
but is an <hi>additional injury</hi> to them; becauſe the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>at the time of redemption, will not be in the</hi> ſame <hi>hands in which they depreciated,</hi> and, of courſe, the ſufferers will find <hi>themſelves taxed</hi> to make up the money, which <hi>they loſt</hi> by the depreciation, that it may be paid to the preſent holders of the ſecurities, who <hi>never loſt</hi> any thing. But if any one wiſhes to ſee this ſubject further diſcuſſed, I refer him to my <hi>Fifth Eſſay on Free Trade and Finance,</hi> where this matter is fully conſidered, with reſpect to Continental money. [<hi>See p.</hi> 97.]</p>
            <p>I will conclude here by obſerving, that not one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be adduced for redeeming the public ſecurities at full value, which will not apply to the <hi>Continental</hi> and <hi>old State money,</hi> and prove that both ought to be redeemed at <hi>full nominal value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take it that the public accounts are nearly all adjuſted, and the public creditors have received certificates or public ſecurities for their reſpective balances. But as thoſe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are moſtly Continental, it will lie with <hi>Congreſs,</hi> and not with any <hi>particular State,</hi> to preſcribe the time, mode, and value of their redemption.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I think we may do much for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent relief of our own diſtreſſed citizens, who ſuffer greatly by the <hi>delays</hi> of Continental payment; and I eſteem the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>our Aſſembly</hi> very <hi>laudable</hi> in their <hi>principle.</hi> What I complain of is an <hi>error</hi> in the <hi>application.</hi> It is certainly very good in them to ſtrain every nerve to raiſe money for the <hi>relief of our widows, orphans, ſoldiers,</hi> and <hi>other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and diſtreſſed public creditors;</hi> but I think it <hi>a miſtake</hi> to plan the matter ſo, that when the money is raiſed, it <hi>ſhall not be applied</hi> to the relief of thoſe <hi>worthy, diſtreſſed citizens,</hi> but ſhall go, at leaſt a very conſiderable part of it, to a <hi>parcel of ſpeculators,</hi> who neither ever <hi>earned</hi> it, nor are in any <hi>diſtreſs</hi> for want of it; for they are generally rich, and can command plenty of caſh.</p>
            <p>With the good leave of the public, I will ſum up the matter, and humbly offer ſome propoſitions, which appear to me worthy of conſideration.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>I propoſe to ſet about raiſing all the money we can, not by a</hi> tax on polls and eſtates, <hi>which will be very burdenſome
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:023972_0305_0FC2A7DE82C551F0"/>
to our people, hurtful to the capital intereſt of the State, and of very</hi> uncertain product; <hi>but by continuing our preſent</hi> duties on trade, <hi>with ſuch further</hi> additional duties on LUXU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES, <hi>as will be neceſſary to</hi> reſtrain the exceſſive <hi>uſe of them:</hi> and this, I conceive, will require duties <hi>ſo high,</hi> as will be ſufficient for the <hi>exigencies</hi> of the State, and will be of <hi>certain product.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>I propoſe to pay all the intereſt which is now due to the inhabitants of this State, on all ſuch public ſecurities as are in the hands of the</hi> original holders, <hi>and have</hi> not been alienat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (to be aſcertained by <hi>affidavit</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> ſufficient proof) and alſo to <hi>ſtop payment</hi> of all intereſt on any certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates which are <hi>not in the hands of the original holders;</hi> for I do not know that among citizens of equal merit, we can with juſtice make fiſh of one, and fleſh of another.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>I propoſe that commiſſioners be appointed to</hi> purchaſe up <hi>ſuch public ſecurities as were originally given to the citizens of this State, but have</hi> been alienated <hi>by the original holders, and are now in currency as objects of traffic or exchange: to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſuch ſecurities, I ſay, at the</hi> current exchange, <hi>or as low as they can be bought.</hi> It is certainly as right for <hi>the State</hi> to buy up theſe ſecurities, which are become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon object of traffic, as it is for <hi>any individual.</hi> Two great advantages will reſult from this:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The preſent holders will have the value of them paid in money:</hi> and,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The State will have them to produce to Congreſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our quota ſhall be demanded for the redemption of them;</hi> for the ſecurities themſelves will doubtleſs be accepted as good payment of our quota, both of principal and intereſt; and it will then be indifferent to us <hi>at what exchange,</hi> or in <hi>what manner</hi> or <hi>time,</hi> Congreſs may direct their redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>I propoſe that all thoſe original holders of public ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who have alienated them, ſhall be debited on the public books, with the certificates they received, at the</hi> value <hi>(and no more) at which they could be</hi> ſold at the time they received <hi>them, or the</hi> time of their date, <hi>and that the reſidue of their balance may be paid, together with the principal of the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="unknown:023972_0306_0FC2A7DFD063B978"/>
               <hi>which are now in the hands of the original holders, and have not been alienated.</hi> I ſay, that both theſe <hi>be paid as ſoon as money ſufficient can be raiſed by the State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will require, I know, a heavy ſum of money to do this, but we ſhall have this ſatisfaction to animate our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, that we are doing <hi>an act of juſtice in favor of thoſe to whom the money is juſtly due,</hi> and ſhall have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of paying it to people who are ſcattered thro' the State, and will immediately circulate the money among our citizens, in every part of the State, which, if the juſtice was equal, will be much <hi>preferable to paying the ſame money</hi> to people who would carry it all <hi>away to diſtant parts,</hi> from whence it would have little chance of returning into circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to the places where it was collected.</p>
            <p>V. As the preſſures of the State are very heavy, I think we ought to make all the ſavings we can; I therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>to leſſen the Houſe of Aſſembly, by taking away two-thirds of the members, and limiting the ſeſſions of the Council</hi> to the Aſſembly's ſeſſions, unleſs the Preſident ſhould, on emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions, ſummon them. I think <hi>one-third</hi> of our Aſſembly would do the buſineſs much <hi>better</hi> than all of them; and the Preſident, with a good Secretary, would be ſufficient for the common and uſual buſineſs of the Council. I know of no advantage ariſing from <hi>over-nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Legiſlatures,</hi> or <hi>Councils</hi> that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it too long. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of democratical government tend to anarchy, or deſpotiſm, or ruin.</p>
            <p>An idle, uſeleſs, or corrupt member is leſs noticed and eaſier loſt in the crowd, in a <hi>large</hi> Aſſembly, than in a <hi>ſmall</hi> one. <hi>Virtue and merit</hi> are, for the ſame reaſon, <hi>leſs</hi> conſpicuous in a large than ſmall Aſſembly; <hi>cabals, party-ſchemes,</hi> and <hi>intereſted plans,</hi> are eaſier formed in a <hi>large</hi> than in a <hi>ſmall</hi> houſe, and the <hi>guilt</hi> or <hi>folly</hi> of an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual is more eaſily ſheltered or concealed in <hi>great</hi> than in <hi>ſmall</hi> numbers.</p>
            <p>For when Aſſemblies are large, the buſineſs is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly done by a few, under the umbrage of the whole; the major part are not commonly <hi>in the ſecret.</hi> The <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Congreſs</hi> rarely conſiſts of more than thirty members
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:023972_0307_0FC2A7E49D8A8BB8"/>
preſent, yet no complaint has been made that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is too ſmall. The <hi>Britiſh Houſe of Commons</hi> conſiſts of more than five hundred members, not very famous for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, wiſdom, or order. Their proceedings are commonly directed by the <hi>Premier,</hi> and a few <hi>leading members;</hi> yet if you aſk Lord <hi>North,</hi> why he puſhed the <hi>American</hi> war, he will tell you with great compoſure, that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>his war, but the war of the Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>more people</hi> are employed about any buſineſs than are neceſſary to do it, the conſequence has ever been found to be, that the buſineſs is not <hi>done ſo well,</hi> is clogged with <hi>more delays,</hi> is leſs <hi>conſiſtent</hi> in its ſeveral parts, and not ſo <hi>well methodized.</hi> The people who are intereſted in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and have occaſion to attend upon it, are not ſo <hi>well-ſerved,</hi> and a <hi>greater expenſe</hi> is incurred, than would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, if people <hi>juſt enough</hi> for the buſineſs, and <hi>no more,</hi> had been employed.</p>
            <p>This, one would think, was grounded on natural fitneſs; for we find it holds true in all human affairs, from a houſe too full of <hi>ſervants,</hi> a field with too many <hi>reapers,</hi> a town-meeting of too many <hi>people,</hi> a kitchen with too many <hi>cooks,</hi> a committee of too many <hi>members,</hi> a church with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>deacons</hi> or too large a veſtry, a court with too many <hi>judges,</hi> and ſo on, up to an aſſembly of the firſt dignity, with too many <hi>repreſentatives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to admit any principle or circumſtance into our graveſt and moſt important councils, which has ever been found hurtful in all caſes where it has been adopted, is highly imprudent and dangerous, and tends to ruin. The fatal experience of many great nations proves this in a manner very forcible and convincing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> loſt their liberties by over-numerous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, &amp;c. and <hi>Poland</hi> is now in deſolation from the ſame cauſe; their <hi>Poſpolite,</hi> which was inſtituted for the great defence of their nation, and their <hi>liberum veto,</hi> which they hugged with enthuſiaſm, as the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of their liberty, together with their <hi>over-numerous Diets,</hi> have completely ruined them. But whether theſe obſervations are proper
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:023972_0308_0FC2A7E5E583D220"/>
or not, we ſhall, by this propoſition, at leaſt ſave a <hi>vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe,</hi> at a time when the utmoſt economy is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>VI. At all times, but eſpecially i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> times of public preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the <hi>peace and quiet</hi> of the State ſhould be conſulted, and the general <hi>confidence</hi> of the people in the government ſhould be as far as poſſible <hi>ſecured,</hi> it order to its firm eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and the great <hi>principles</hi> of our civil policy ſhould be <hi>ſtrictly regarded.</hi> I therefore humbly propoſe <hi>the repeal of the teſt-act;</hi> for we can no how expect the internal peace and quiet of our people, and their confidence in our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſo long as we exclude <hi>one-third</hi> our citizens from any ſhare in it.</p>
            <p>Nor can we any how call our civil policy a government <hi>of the people,</hi> or reap the advantage of ſuch a government, as long as ſo <hi>large a proportion</hi> of our citizens (if reckoned by numbers, influence, wiſdom, or eſtate) are <hi>ſhut out</hi> and <hi>disfranchiſed.</hi> We need the <hi>counſels</hi> as well as the <hi>wealth</hi> of <hi>all</hi> our people, and our conſtitution gives <hi>equal right,</hi> as well as preſcribes <hi>equal duty,</hi> to them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the major muſt rule the minor,</hi> is undoubtedly a maxim eſſential to a democratical or republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is equally manifeſt, that the <hi>extremes</hi> of this maxim will deſtroy the very <hi>nature,</hi> as well as <hi>uſes,</hi> of ſuch governments. For if <hi>two-thirds</hi> can disfranchiſe the <hi>minor</hi> third, a <hi>majority</hi> of the remaining two-thirds may disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe the <hi>minority</hi> of them, and ſo on <hi>toties quoties,</hi> till there will be but <hi>two</hi> left undisfranchiſed, to govern the whole; which, I ſuppoſe, every body will allow to be ſomewhat <hi>worſe</hi> than to have <hi>but one</hi> ſovereign deſpot; for the two might quarrel, and each form his party, and ſo the State might be involved in a civil war, which could not happen, if there was but <hi>one</hi> deſpot, and nobody elſe left capable of forming a party.</p>
            <p>It is doubtleſs neceſſary to adopt good maxims of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but it is equally neceſſary to exerciſe ſome <hi>prudence and diſcretion</hi> in the uſe of them; for we may be ruined by the <hi>extremes</hi> of thoſe very maxims, which, in their <hi>mean,</hi> are very ſalutary and uſeful.</p>
            <p>

It has been ſuggeſted by ſome ill-minded people (but for the honor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> I muſt think, without the leaſt reaſon) that ſome Members of our General Aſſembly are <hi>deeply intereſted</hi> in <hi>ſtock-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I think it neceſſary that the honorable Aſſembly ſhould take proper meaſures to vindicate themſelves from ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous aſperſions; and if there are any ſuch members, to take the neceſſary care that one <hi>ſcabby ſheep</hi> ſhall not ſpoil the <hi>whole flock.</hi> There can certainly be no more reaſon or fitneſs, that a Member of Aſſembly, under the ſacred ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his public character, ſhould vote the money of the State into his <hi>own pocket,</hi> than that a <hi>judge</hi> or <hi>juryman</hi> ſhould ſit in judgment in a cauſe, in the event of which he is <hi>perſonally intereſted.</hi>

            <p>We are told by ſome folks of delicate feelings, that <q>

               </q> and we all know that the wife of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ought not to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; it will therefore follow, by conſent of every body, that every cauſe of ſuſpicion of the integrity and diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedneſs of our honorable Aſſembly ſhould be removed as far as poſſible; and this is the more neceſſary, as our Aſſembly is a <hi>ſingle Legiſlature,</hi> whoſe acts are not ſubject to a <hi>reviſion,</hi> or require the concurrence of <hi>another</hi> houſe; and of courſe, if <hi>they err,</hi> the ſubject is <hi>without remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On theſe conſiderations there can be no doubt but our Aſſembly, and every body elſe, will be thoroughly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated with the neceſſity of having every member of that auguſt body moſt effectually acquitted from all <hi>ſuſpicion of intereſtedneſs,</hi> when they come to decide a queſtion, which demands 3 or 4,000,000 of dollars from the State.</p>

I am informed, that theſe will be the firſt great objects of attention in Congreſs, on the opening of the enſuing ſeſſion.</p>
            <p>My preſent deſign is, to ſtate and advocate the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>claims</hi> of a great and very reſpectable claſs of our citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whoſe <hi>diſtinguiſhed merit</hi> entitles them to the <hi>juſtice,</hi> and, indeed, to the <hi>gratitude</hi> alſo, <hi>of their country,</hi> but who are, I fear, at leaſt many of them, in danger of being <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected</hi> and <hi>loſing the reward</hi> due to them, for the ſupplies and ſervices which they rendered their country in the greateſt public diſtreſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>worthy patriots I allude to, are thoſe who, during the war,</hi> when our country was overwhelmed with infinite diſtreſs and danger, <hi>rendered their ſervices, ſupplies, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in its defence,</hi> but who, on the adjuſtment of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>could not be paid,</hi> by reaſon of the deficiency of the public finances of the States, and, therefore, were <hi>obliged to accept</hi> certificates of the balances <hi>due</hi> to them, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of intereſt and payment in future time.</p>
            <p>Theſe certificates were made <hi>payable to the bearer,</hi> and of courſe were negotiable, and were worth about 2<hi>s.</hi> or 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, their value being eſtimated by the current or <hi>common price,</hi> at which they were generally <hi>bought</hi> and <hi>ſold</hi> in the public market; for the value of certificates, as well as of every thing elſe that becomes an object of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exchange or transfer, <hi>muſt, and ever will, be eſtimated by the current or common price it will bring in market.</hi>

            <p>And, to ſatisfy the grateful wiſhes of all our citizens, and to eſtabliſh our national character of honor and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:023972_0316_0FC2A80B8225CE00"/>
both at home and abroad, That <hi>they muſt be paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, I beg the candid attention of my reader to the following propoſitions:</p>
            <p>I. <hi>No public creditor who receives a certificate, is thereby paid any more than the value of the certificate at the time of delivery, i. e.</hi> it is not the <hi>nominal value</hi> but the <hi>real value</hi> only, <hi>i. e.</hi> the current price of it, which is to be regarded in eſtimating the quantity of payment made by it.</p>
            <p>When any body propoſes to pay a debt in bills of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, bills of paper money, certificates, or any bills of public or private credit (if the creditor agrees to accept ſuch payment) the firſt queſtion that invariably occurs is, <hi>what is the exchange?</hi> i. e. <hi>no regard</hi> at all is paid to the <hi>nominal</hi> value, but reference is conſtantly had to <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> or <hi>current price</hi> in market, in order to determine what amount of ſuch bills ſhall be given to ſatisfy the debt. This practice is ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> among all men, and grounded on ſuch <hi>manifeſt principles of right,</hi> that I cannot conceive that any man can be found, who will diſpute either the reality or propriety of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The practice of Congreſs,</hi> the ſupreme council of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>affords a precedent of this ſame principle,</hi> adopted by them, reſpecting their <hi>loan-office certificates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They publiſhed by their authority a <hi>ſcale of depreciation,</hi> by which the value of thoſe certificates was eſtimated at the <hi>real exchange</hi> they had at the <hi>time of their dates,</hi> and the rate of their <hi>final redemption</hi> was fixed on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All the States adopted the ſame principle,</hi> either by making uſe of the ſcale of Congreſs, or eſtabliſhing ſcales of their own, by which the value of Continental money was eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated thro' all the ſtages of its depreciation.</p>
            <p>This practice of Congreſs and of all the States was founded not only on abſolute neceſſity, but on the plaineſt principles of right; and if they made any deviation from juſtice, in the adjuſtment of any of their ſcales, this was no error in the principle, but merely a fault in the practice or uſe of it. And ſurely there can be <hi>no reaſon why</hi> the
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:023972_0317_0FC2A8160FDFA110"/>
ſame rule (if a good one) of eſtimating the real value of certificates iſſued in 1777 and the ſubſequent years, ſhould not be applied to the certificates which were iſſued at the cloſe of the war.</p>
            <p>But there is certainly <hi>great reaſon why</hi> our moſt virtuous citizens, who, by their patriotic efforts, ſervices, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>ſupported the war,</hi> and <hi>ſaved our country,</hi> ſhould not be ſubjected to the loſs of <hi>ſeven-eighths</hi> of their juſt dues, for want of ſuch a rule, or ſome other means of ſaving them from ſuch ruinous and <hi>ſhameful injuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, let us appeal to <hi>plain, common ſenſe</hi> on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. When the public accounts were ſettled at the cloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the war, the public creditors were entitled to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral balances due to them from the States, <hi>in good hard money.</hi> Now can any poſſible reaſon be given, why a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate worth but 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> ſhould be good payment to them, of 20<hi>s. at that time,</hi> any more than <hi>now at this time?</hi> I believe it will be readily admitted, that if any body (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal or aggregate) ſhould, at this time, ſeriouſly propoſe <hi>to pay a debt of</hi> 20<hi>s.</hi> with a certificate or any thing elſe, which <hi>was worth but</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> the offer would be rejected with every degree of <hi>contempt,</hi> as a moſt <hi>villainous</hi> and <hi>raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally inſult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there one Member of Congreſs, who would not think himſelf abuſed by the offer of a certificate worth 3-5<hi>ths of a dollar,</hi> in full ſatisfaction of <hi>ſix dollars,</hi> which he expects for one day's attendance in the houſe? but how aggravated and keen, would be his feelings and chagrin, if he ſhould neglect his family and private concerns, and attend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſeven years, and, at the end of the term, ſhould be paid off in <hi>certificates of the ſame depreciated value!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, do you think his vexation would be <hi>ſoftened</hi> any, by being told, that tho' his certificates were really worth at preſent <hi>but</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. in the pound,</hi> yet the ſum <hi>expreſſed on the face</hi> of them was 20<hi>s.</hi> in the pound, and therefore he muſt be ſatisfied with them as good and <hi>full payment,</hi> and if he would have patience to keep them <hi>long enough,</hi> they might perhaps bring him the full, real value expreſſed in them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="unknown:023972_0318_0FC2A82920D964B0"/>
I believe every Member of Congreſs will readily allow, that I have hit on what would be the <hi>true feelings</hi> of any of his brethren, and even of himſelf, in ſuch a ſuppoſed caſe. If ſo, gentlemen, pleaſe to <hi>do as you would be done by;</hi> this <hi>rule of conduct</hi> is enjoined upon you by an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity much ſuperior, and far paramount, to any you can lay the leaſt claim to, in your utmoſt dignity, and fulleſt poſſeſſion of ſovereign power.</p>
            <p>From all this it appears evident, that the public creditors, who have received certificates in payment, were paid <hi>no more than the current value or exchange</hi> of the certificates, at the time they received them. <hi>So much is paid and no more,</hi> and ſo much and no more they ought to be <hi>debited,</hi> and the <hi>reſidue of the debt,</hi> not having been paid, is ſtill <hi>due to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It farther appears, that the certificates which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the <hi>ſoldiers</hi> and <hi>other public creditors,</hi> on the final ſettlement of their accounts, after the cloſe of the war, were worth <hi>not more than</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, which ought to be <hi>debited</hi> to them, and the <hi>remaining</hi> 17<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. in the pound,</hi> being unpaid, ſtill <hi>remains due</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Theſe balances which remain unpaid to the public credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ought to be paid as ſoon as poſſible.</hi> The ſums due to them are their <hi>dear, their painful earnings;</hi> theſe claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are the <hi>ſoldiers who fought,</hi> and the <hi>citizens who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied</hi> them, when the <hi>ſalvation of our country</hi> was the great <hi>prize contended for;</hi> it is owing to their virtuous and ſtrong exertions, that we have <hi>any thing left,</hi> either for our <hi>own enjoyment,</hi> or the <hi>payment of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have no inſtance in hiſtory, of an army who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and practiſed more ſpirit, firmneſs, patience, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, fortitude, and zeal, either under the inſtant preſſure of the greateſt <hi>hardſhips and ſufferings,</hi> or in the ſolemn and awful <hi>march to the moſt dangerous enterpriſes,</hi> or in the arduous <hi>moments of battle,</hi> than were found in our troops.</p>
            <p>Nor did they heſitate or faulter in the leaſt, till they had <hi>completed their great work,</hi> raiſed their <hi>own,</hi> their <hi>general's,</hi> and their <hi>country's</hi> honor and character to the utmoſt height, and reached the arduous goal which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:023972_0319_0FC2A82A037FD408"/>
in view, thro' every ſtage of their fatigue and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; this <hi>glorious goal</hi> was the <hi>complete liberation of one of the greateſt empires</hi> of the earth, which <hi>empire we are,</hi> who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it clothed in all the majeſty of empire, wealth, and power, ſolemnly deliberating, <hi>whether we ſhall pay theſe our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers, or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That "the <hi>laborer</hi> is worthy of his <hi>hire,</hi>" is the great doctrine of COMMUTATIVE JUSTICE, that <hi>divine law</hi> of nature, and <hi>nature's God,</hi> which, in the utmoſt <hi>majeſty</hi> of command, connects the <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> that auguſt principle on which alone all <hi>thrones</hi> and <hi>governments</hi> can acquire and fix a <hi>permanent eſtabliſhment;</hi> this ſacred principle, I ſay, requires that theſe worthy claimants ſhould be paid the money due to them, becauſe they have <hi>dearly, nobly, and faithfully earned</hi> it.</p>
            <p>There is in every human heart, a <hi>principle of right,</hi> a principle planted by the <hi>great Creator,</hi> ever approving the things which are moſt excellent; how far ſoever this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred principle may become <hi>generally practical, emanate</hi> and <hi>ſpread</hi> in ſociety, and <hi>govern and direct the general mind;</hi> yet the <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of public juſtice and right, lies <hi>in the power,</hi> and becomes the <hi>peculiar duty, of a few men,</hi> the choſen and dignified <hi>few,</hi> to whom the adminiſtration of the great affairs and intereſts of the nation are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Theſe dignified perſonages are ſometimes called <hi>gods;</hi> they certainly ſit in the place of God, and whether given to the people in <hi>wrath</hi> or <hi>mercy,</hi> are certainly appointed by him, and the ſacred <hi>charge and duty</hi> of imitating his government lies on them; <hi>judgment and juſtice</hi> are the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his throne; and theſe ſacred virtues ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be found in our ſupreme council, not as <hi>tranſient perſons</hi> who may be called in on favorite occaſions, where their preſence may be pretty well admitted, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection may be tolerable, but as <hi>conſtant reſidents,</hi> who take up their dwelling there, as the place of their <hi>uniform habitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With a heart melted in ſympathy with the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of my country's <hi>deliverers,</hi> with a ſublimated ſenſe of the
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:023972_0320_0FC2A82F8C835E80"/>
               <hi>importance,</hi> as well as <hi>ſacred nature,</hi> of the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our nation, I moſt devoutly implore (and doubt not the concurrence of every honeſt <hi>American</hi>) that theſe <hi>ſovereign and ſacred virtues</hi> may <hi>dwell,</hi> not only in our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>councils,</hi> but in the heart of every <hi>member who ſhall give his vote</hi> in the deciſion of this moſt capital and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting cauſe which I am pleading.</p>
            <p>Another thing which ought to induce us to pay theſe worthy citizens is, <hi>their brilliant ſucceſs, and the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant benefits we derive from their exertions.</hi> I do not ſay that <hi>ſucceſs</hi> ſimply is a <hi>virtue,</hi> but it is a very great <hi>proof</hi> of it, in as much as ſucceſs generally follows <hi>prudent, ſpirited,</hi> and <hi>perſevering</hi> conduct; nor do I ſay that <hi>rewards</hi> ought to be proportioned to the <hi>benefits</hi> received; for by this rule we can never <hi>pay enough</hi> to our deliverers; but where the benefits accruing from virtuous exertions are very great, they at leaſt become entitled to a <hi>full compenſation,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps liberal minds will think <hi>a generous one</hi> might with great propriety be allowed.</p>
            <p>We call general <hi>Waſhington,</hi> the <hi>father</hi> and <hi>ſaviour</hi> of his country, and with great propriety; the virtues <hi>of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> he might have poſſeſſed <hi>alone,</hi> but <hi>the ſaviour</hi> of his country he <hi>could not have been without his army.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſigned with <hi>diſcernment,</hi> commanded with <hi>prudence,</hi> and led on his troops with <hi>fortitude;</hi> but altho' theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were carried by him beyond the power of imitation, the ſucceſs muſt have failed, had not his <hi>army co-operated</hi> with his deſigns effectually, <hi>obeyed</hi> his orders cheerfully, and <hi>followed</hi> him with firmneſs; without theſe, neither his laurels could have been obtained, nor our deliverance have been completed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They were his faithful companions</hi> in <hi>diſtreſſes,</hi> in <hi>dangers,</hi> in <hi>battles,</hi> in <hi>victories;</hi> they ſhared his <hi>fortunes,</hi> they ſhared his <hi>merits,</hi> and they perſevered with him, till they alſo ſhared his <hi>final ſucceſſes,</hi> which put a period to <hi>their</hi> long and patient <hi>labors,</hi> and our <hi>country's calamities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How would all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine feelings of the human mind have <hi>glowed in the breaſt</hi> of that exalted general, if, in that period of <hi>triumphant and final ſucceſs,</hi> he could have
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:023972_0321_0FC2A836D94EC280"/>
called theſe his <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>worthy fellow-laborers</hi> and <hi>fellow-ſufferers</hi> together, met their brightened countenances with the warmeſt <hi>mutual congratulations, thanked</hi> them for their ſervices, and <hi>diſmiſſed</hi> them with <hi>ſuch rewards,</hi> as would have enabled them to return to their families with ſome degree of <hi>advantage,</hi> as well as <hi>honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will draw a veil over the reſt, and only ſay, the <hi>hard neceſſity</hi> of the times prevented this; the general knew it, the ſoldiers knew it, and ſubmitted with <hi>patience</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their diſcharge, and find their way home as they could, with <hi>empty hands</hi> and dry lips.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible that the <hi>great councils of America ſhall ſuffer ſuch perſevering fortitude, diſcipline, and patience to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their reward? Generous allowances</hi> are not demanded; <hi>liberal appointments</hi> are not ſolicited; no more is required than the <hi>ſimple pay</hi> which was <hi>promiſed</hi> them by Congreſs; all they aſk for, is the fulfilment of that <hi>ſacred contract,</hi> which is grounded on the <hi>public faith and honor of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, I think that the <hi>patient and quiet behaviour</hi> of the <hi>real</hi> public creditors, both at the cloſe of the war and ſince, entitles them to the <hi>higheſt eſteem</hi> and reſpect of all our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and ſhould excite a very ſtrong zeal, to make the moſt powerful efforts <hi>to do them right;</hi> it is certainly <hi>mean, baſe,</hi> and <hi>ſhameful,</hi> it is <hi>below</hi> the <hi>dignity</hi> of a nation, to <hi>deny</hi> or <hi>delay that juſtice</hi> to virtuous, <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>well-behaved citizens,</hi> which would be granted to <hi>tumult, uproar,</hi> and <hi>inſurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will any man preſume to ſay they are <hi>quiet,</hi> becauſe it is not in their power to make <hi>diſturbance?</hi> This is very ill-natured; but were it really the caſe, it would bring them into the rank of <hi>helpleſs perſons,</hi> like the widows and fatherleſs, who have <hi>rights which they are not able to aſſert</hi> and ſupport; theſe are entitled to the moſt <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>tender protections</hi> of the government; the <hi>wrongs</hi> and <hi>oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of ſuch as theſe, are always ranked among the <hi>moſt horrid</hi> and <hi>cruel acts</hi> of injuſtice.</p>
            <p>But I do not conceive this to be the <hi>real fact;</hi> all States have found that there may be as great force and ſtrength
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:023972_0322_0FC2A838381E5D10"/>
in the <hi>ſtill, ſmall voice,</hi> as in the <hi>exploſions</hi> that break the cedars of <hi>Lebanon;</hi> it is not commonly <hi>a fretfulneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> in the people, but the <hi>cauſe of complaint,</hi> which breeds diſturbances in a State; it is rare that people can be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into general inſurrection, without ſome <hi>great and general cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wrongs</hi> and <hi>oppreſſions</hi> diffuſed over a State will always <hi>ſow the ſeeds</hi> of diſcontent; theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it <hi>eaſy on nobody;</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways operate by way of fret and reſentment, and are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the <hi>cauſes of ſerious inſurrections,</hi> and ſometimes of moſt <hi>capital</hi> revolutions, in government; I know of <hi>but one ſure way</hi> to keep the people quiet and eaſy in any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that is, to cauſe <hi>'juſtice</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> to run down its ſtreets, and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> to cover it.'</p>
            <p>But it ought to be noted here, that tho' the proper way to keep the ſubjects of any State in <hi>quietneſs,</hi> is to do them <hi>juſtice,</hi> yet it does not follow, that no men will be <hi>quiet</hi> under wrongs; many virtuous and good citizens will put up with injuries, and bear them with patience, rather than engage in purſuits for redreſs, which may make the <hi>remedy worſe than the diſeaſe;</hi> few men would be willing to foment public diſturbances, and make the land of their nativity a <hi>ſcene of deſolation</hi> and horror, to gain <hi>redreſs</hi> of perſonal wrongs, or to gratify a <hi>ſpirit of revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many good men would patiently ſuffer injuries, rather than even give <hi>uneaſineſs</hi> to their oppreſſors, eſpecially where the wrong happens to proceed from ſome <hi>near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection,</hi> a <hi>brother,</hi> a <hi>father,</hi> or perhaps the <hi>fathers</hi> of their country; but this virtuous patience under injury I deem highly <hi>meritorious,</hi> and deſerving the utmoſt <hi>attention</hi> to their <hi>rights,</hi> and the <hi>redreſs</hi> of their <hi>wrongs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the very people from whom redreſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, begin to take advantage of the peaceable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a citizen, to think him <hi>void of ſpirit,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to <hi>inſult</hi> his wrongs, <hi>trifle</hi> with his demands, <hi>ridicule</hi> his pretenſions, and plead <hi>abſurd arguments</hi> in avoidance of his claims, <hi>arguments</hi> which are a <hi>burleſque of common ſenſe,</hi> and which cannot meet the approbation of that <hi>diſcerning power,</hi> which the all-wiſe Creator has <hi>planted</hi> in every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:023972_0323_0FC2A847130A7B30"/>
mind, as the great <hi>index of right and wrong;</hi> I ſay, when inſults of this ſort are added to injuries, there is a <hi>point, a bound, beyond which</hi> human patience will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and, of courſe, ſuch injuries never will be <hi>offered</hi> to any perſon who is ſuppoſed to be in condition to <hi>aſſert and vindicate his own rights,</hi> or to <hi>reſent properly the inſults offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For example, let us ſuppoſe that the <hi>Continental army,</hi> officers and men, with <hi>thoſe who, by their contributions, fed and clothed them,</hi> were all <hi>met together,</hi> with their auguſt general at the head of them,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </hi> had appeared, their <hi>general</hi> would have cheerfully put himſelf at their <hi>head,</hi> and have <hi>ſupported their ſuit</hi> with all his power and influence.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo very manifeſt, that both <hi>they</hi> and their <hi>rights</hi> are all, at this time, in <hi>real exiſtence and full life,</hi> tho' not all <hi>met</hi> together in condition to <hi>aſſert and demand</hi> the juſtice which is due to them.</p>
                  <p>It is further certain, that the <hi>known rights</hi> of an <hi>abſent man</hi> ought not to be neglected, becauſe he is <hi>not pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               <p> I obſerve, gentlemen, you grow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what warm; I wiſh to avoid all ill-humor and hard lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; you have <hi>deſerved nobly;</hi> you have gained <hi>great honor;</hi> you have <hi>ſaved your country;</hi> and I hope, after all this merit, you will neither <hi>tarniſh</hi> your own <hi>honors,</hi> nor <hi>diſturb</hi> your country's <hi>peace,</hi> by your uneaſineſs and <hi>diſcontent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is done is paſſed and cannot be recalled; I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommend to you, my dear and honored fellow-citizens, to <hi>return home peaceably and quietly</hi> like virtuous and good chriſtians, and <hi>go to work double tides,</hi> to raiſe money to pay the <hi>preſent holders</hi> of your certificates; for however fooliſhly you parted with them <hi>under value,</hi> yet the <hi>public faith</hi> is annexed to them, and muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I appeal to every man in the Union, whether this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, or rather dialogue, does not ſtate <hi>every fact</hi> and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry argument, truly</hi> and <hi>fairly;</hi> and whether ſuch a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of facts and arguments would be likely to <hi>ſend the hearers home</hi> contented and quiet, without their pay; I trow not. If the above ſtatement is <hi>not right,</hi> I challenge <hi>any body that can, to mend it;</hi> for my part, I freely own my opinion, that the whole harangue, tho' ever ſo <hi>well-dreſſed and poliſhed,</hi> is, and muſt be, from the <hi>nature of the facts,</hi> an <hi>inſult</hi> not only on theſe worthy <hi>citizens,</hi> who rendered their ſupplies and ſervices to their country during the war, but on <hi>common ſenſe itſelf,</hi> and muſt <hi>wound</hi> the <hi>natural feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the humane mind, and which no man of honeſty and candor could ever make in the <hi>abſence</hi> of the parties, and which no man, who had any regard to <hi>perſonal ſafety,</hi> would dare to make in the <hi>preſence</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>The Orator's plan is, to conſider the certificates deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the public creditors, on the ſettlement of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, for ſupplies and ſervices rendered during the war, to conſider theſe certificates, I ſay, as <hi>full payment of the ſum due to them,</hi> and to <hi>redeem</hi> the certificates at full <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> value, by <hi>payments</hi> made to the <hi>bearers</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>It is farther a moſt plain fact, that the certificates were not worth <hi>more than</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. in the pound,</hi> at the time they
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:023972_0327_0FC2A84C9BA93CE0"/>
were <hi>delivered to the real public creditors,</hi> on the final ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their accounts, after the cloſe of the war.</p>
            <p>And it is a farther plain fact, that by far the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of theſe certificates have been ſold by the original holders, in their neceſſities and diſtreſſes, to perſons who are <hi>now poſſeſſed</hi> of them, <hi>at</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. in the pound,</hi> or at moſt for ſome <hi>trifle</hi> which bears but ſmall proportion to the <hi>nominal value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this plan, <hi>dreſs</hi> it, and <hi>cook</hi> it, and <hi>ſeaſon</hi> it, and <hi>color</hi> it in <hi>any</hi> and <hi>every</hi> way you poſſibly can, if carried into execution, will moſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> draw after it theſe two conſequences:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a ſum of <hi>many millions</hi> of money muſt be levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and collected from the <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>painful earnings</hi> of the citizens of the States, <hi>not to be paid</hi> to the <hi>worthy citizens,</hi> who, by their <hi>ſupplies</hi> and <hi>ſervices,</hi> during their country's <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> have <hi>merited</hi> and <hi>earned</hi> it, but to be paid to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of rich <hi>ſpeculators,</hi> who have <hi>no pretence</hi> of having <hi>merited</hi> or <hi>earned</hi> any of it, and who will, upon the <hi>earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe others,</hi> make a <hi>profit immenſe,</hi> not leſs in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of inſtances than 1000 <hi>per cent.</hi> Whilſt,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The great bulk of the worthy citizens, who, by their ſupplies and ſervices, <hi>really</hi> and <hi>dearly merited</hi> and <hi>earned</hi> the money, but who <hi>have ſold</hi> their certificates (which is the caſe of by far the greateſt part of them) muſt and will <hi>abſolutely and finally loſe</hi> 7-8<hi>ths,</hi> and very many <hi>even eleven parts out of twelve,</hi> of their <hi>real merits</hi> and <hi>painful earnings,</hi> from which <hi>ſhameful</hi> injuſtice, <hi>Good Lord, deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beg leave here to aſk the gentlemen who compoſe our ſupreme adminiſtration, legiſlative, executive, and official,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether they can poſſibly reconcile their own minds <hi>to any plan</hi> which involves ſuch <hi>groſs injuſtice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether any of them could be prevailed on, at any time of their lives, on any conſideration, to pay <hi>a private debt of their own of</hi> 20<hi>s.</hi> with a <hi>certificate,</hi> or any other <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated paper, worth but</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether in heaven or earth (and farther we need not go) I ſay, whether in heaven or earth, there can be
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:023972_0328_0FC2A84E158B4A10"/>
found a <hi>reaſon</hi> which can <hi>juſtify</hi> a <hi>miniſter of State,</hi> or any <hi>public man,</hi> employed in the diſpenſation of the <hi>juſtice and judgment</hi> of a nation, in <hi>deviſing or doing</hi> any thing, which, in his <hi>perſonal</hi> capacity, would <hi>wound his honor</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> and <hi>damn</hi> him to <hi>eternal infamy and contempt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is known to every body, that at the cloſe of the war, our nation was <hi>bankrupt;</hi> at leaſt they <hi>ſtopped payment,</hi> could not, and did not, <hi>do juſtice</hi> to thoſe to whom they were <hi>juſtly indebted;</hi> and if we could not pay them <hi>when we ought,</hi> the only way to heal and remedy the matter, is <hi>to pay them when we can;</hi> and it is mighty plain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> if we <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly mean</hi> to pay our debts, we muſt not only pay the <hi>whole money we owe,</hi> but muſt pay it to thoſe <hi>to whom we owe it;</hi> for paying it to any <hi>body elſe</hi> can be no ſatisfaction of the debt.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more abſurd than to apply the <hi>common rule of aſſignments</hi> of negotiable notes, bills of exchange, &amp;c. to the public certificates; the exchange of the one rarely riſes or falls more than 4 <hi>or</hi> 5 <hi>per cent.;</hi> the depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the other is 15 <hi>or</hi> 20 <hi>times as much,</hi> and is ſo enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that the <hi>principal value</hi> is abſorbed by it, and not more than 1-8<hi>th or</hi> 1-10<hi>th part of the nominal value in reality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains;</hi> here is an <hi>extreme caſe</hi> indeed, and it is well known that every <hi>law, right,</hi> or <hi>rule of morality</hi> is <hi>limited to its mean or reaſonable application;</hi> the moment it diverges there-from, and flies into <hi>its extreme,</hi> it loſes its <hi>rectitude</hi> and <hi>equity,</hi> and becomes <hi>injurious and wrong;</hi> and the ſure and infallible <hi>criterion</hi> of ſuch extreme, is when ſuch applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on operates by way of <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>deſtruction of right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the caſe in point before us, the application of the common rule of aſſignments, to the certificates, has a neceſſary operation, moſt <hi>cruel, injurious,</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> in two reſpects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It takes an immenſe <hi>ſum</hi> of money from <hi>virtuous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, who dearly merited</hi> and <hi>earned it,</hi> and ſubjects them to a <hi>total</hi> and <hi>ruinous</hi> loſs; whilſt,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It conveys the ſame <hi>immenſe ſum</hi> to <hi>other men, who never merited or earned it all,</hi> and gives them an <hi>enormous</hi>
               <pb n="322" facs="unknown:023972_0329_0FC2A84FB7987BA0"/>
               <hi>profit</hi> of 1000 per cent. on the <hi>merits and earnings</hi> of the loſers.</p>
            <p>This whole doctrine is ſo perfectly known and familiar to all doctors in <hi>law</hi> and <hi>morality,</hi> that they have adopted it for a proverb or maxim, <hi>ſummum jus, ſumma injuria, i. e. right in extreme</hi> becomes <hi>extreme wrong;</hi> and nobody ever pretended to diſpute this maxim, who was not either moſt poignantly preſſed with argument (in which caſe the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will make any ſhifts) or hurried and impelled <hi>by ſome favorite ſcheme or intereſt,</hi> out of all their <hi>philoſophy, decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and common ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another plan or method of doing this buſineſs, which appears to me much more <hi>juſt and equitable,</hi> and quite <hi>as eaſy</hi> as the one I have been exploding, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Let <hi>every certificate be eſtimated by a ſcale of value, grounded on the current price or exchange of it at its date, and at this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue let it be debited to every public creditor who received it, and at the ſame value,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I apprehend that certificates ſhould never be redeemed at a higher rate than their value or current exchange was at the time of iſſuing them; for the public never received a valuable conſideration for any more than was paid; and to demand their redemption at a higher value would be charging the public with <hi>uſurious intereſt,</hi> which would be as wrong between <hi>public,</hi> as between <hi>private, contractors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be objected, perhaps, that the public do not <hi>literally receive</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> and give their bond or certificate for 20<hi>s.:</hi> but I anſwer, they <hi>really</hi> do this; for it is very plain, that the certificate, when iſſued, was worth <hi>no more than its current exchange</hi> at that time, <hi>ſay</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.:</hi> the public creditor received <hi>no more,</hi> and ought to be <hi>debited with no more;</hi> but the certificate is made payable to the <hi>bearer, who is a ſtranger,</hi> at 20<hi>s.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For it is plain, that if a private man ſhould receive 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> and give his bond for 20<hi>s.</hi> the bond would be uſurious, and of courſe void.</p>
                  <p>My propoſition is plainly juſt, and acknowledged by Congreſs and every body elſe, and has the ſanction of general practice with reſpect to <hi>loan-office certificates, Continental money,</hi> &amp;c. and I challenge any man to give a ſhadow of reaſon, why all ſubſequent <hi>certificates,</hi> or <hi>paper of public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> ſhould not be eſtimated, and in every reſpect be governed, by the ſame rule.</p>
                  <p>But if the certificate depreciates <hi>below its original value,</hi> the aggregate public <hi>ſuſtains the loſs.</hi> This is manifeſtly the caſe with reſpect to all paper money, certificates, and other public ſecurities of every kind, which gain a general currency, or become objects of common exchange and negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro' the community, and happen to depreciate during ſuch currency.</p>
                  <p>The loſs by depreciation becomes divided into <hi>innumerable parts,</hi> every <hi>ſingle one</hi> of which conſiſts of the <hi>loſs</hi> each individual ſeverally <hi>ſuſtained</hi> by the depreciation of the paper, whilſt <hi>it was in his bands,</hi> and the aggregate ſum of all <hi>theſe parts</hi> or loſſes, makes up the <hi>whole ſum</hi> of the depreciation, or the <hi>difference</hi> between the <hi>current value</hi> of the paper at the time, and the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal value</hi> of it when it firſt iſſued.</p>
                  <p>By this it appears, that the aggregate public has ſuſtained the whole loſs, not in a way of perfect equality indeed (and perhaps no public aſſeſſment ever did or can do this) but by way of general tax, of which innumerable individuals (tho' not ſtrictly every one) has ſuſtained or paid his ſhare, and, of courſe, it would be very unjuſt to tax the ſame public over again for ſuch ſum, not to pay it to the <hi>perſons who have ſuffered</hi> by the depreciation, but to <hi>other</hi> people, who have <hi>loſt nothing,</hi> nor have any <hi>claim of merit</hi> to it.</p>
               </note> 
               <hi>or at the current value (as the caſe may</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="unknown:023972_0330_0FC2A8678AA20BC0"/>
               <hi>require) let it be redeemed, with intereſt from its date to the time of its redemption,</hi> and let <hi>the remainder of the balances due to the public creditors, who have received certificates, be paid them in money with intereſt, as ſoon as that can be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no reaſon why the real or current value of the certificates in queſtion ſhould not be fixed by a ſcale, as well as the loan-office certificates, and other depreciated public paper, during the war; this principle, as I before obſerved, was adopted not only by Congreſs, but by all the States, as a matter of both juſtice and neceſſity, and the tender-acts and other infringements of this plan, were found totally wrongful, and, of courſe, were repealed.</p>
            <p>No human plan of diſpenſing commutative juſtice to a nation, can ever be perfect and wholly free from error; all that human wiſdom and human virtue can do, is to adopt that plan, which, in its operation, ſhall produce <hi>the moſt juſtice and right,</hi> and the <hi>leaſt injury and wrong,</hi> of any that can be deviſed, and carry the plan into effect by the moſt equitable <hi>adminiſtration</hi> which can be practiſed.</p>
            <p>If this then is a good rule or criterion of a good plan (which certainly no man can ſeriouſly deny) let us try the two plans by this infallible touchſtone, <abbr>viz.</abbr> which of them, in its operation, will produce the <hi>moſt juſtice and utility,</hi> and avoid the <hi>greateſt injury and wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The juſtice and utility of the one is reduced by its operation <hi>to almoſt nothing,</hi> whilſt the <hi>injuries</hi> and <hi>wrongs</hi> it
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:023972_0331_0FC2A86904EC1220"/>
produces are <hi>enormous, deteſtable,</hi> and <hi>almoſt infinite;</hi> no leſs than depriving numberleſs citizens of 9-10<hi>ths</hi> of the reward due to their great <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>ſervices,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them to a <hi>final</hi> and <hi>total loſs</hi> of the ſame, whilſt it heaps the <hi>immenſe wealth</hi> (which is <hi>their due,</hi> and <hi>which they loſe</hi>) on <hi>another claſs</hi> of men, who have <hi>no pretence to any merit</hi> at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other plan gives to thoſe <hi>meritorious citizens all the rewards</hi> to which they are entitled, and if any injuſtice has been done them by the long delay, it is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure made up to them by the intereſt it propoſes to give them, whilſt it gives to the <hi>purchaſers</hi> of alienated certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, the <hi>ſame price</hi> for them which they were <hi>worth when firſt iſſued,</hi> with <hi>intereſt</hi> from <hi>that</hi> time till their <hi>redemption;</hi> and I think this is all they have a right to expect, and we may very well ſay to each of them, <hi>Take what is thine own with uſury, and more we will not give thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this claſs of men ſuſtain any loſs, it muſt ariſe from their having purchaſed certificates at a <hi>higher exchange</hi> or <hi>price</hi> than they bore when they were <hi>firſt iſſued,</hi> and this is a loſs to which ſpeculations of that ſort are <hi>always expoſed;</hi> if any of our rich and enterpriſing citizens are diſpoſed to <hi>deal in ſtocks, gamble in the funds,</hi> or to be concerned in any <hi>negotiations of hazard</hi> whatever, they all expect to be liable to a <hi>run of ill luck,</hi> as well as to <hi>good fortune;</hi> and I do not know that the public have much occaſion to trouble themſelves about either their profit or loſs.</p>
            <p>But if the loſſes of theſe men ſhould be thought pitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they certainly, in either <hi>magnitude</hi> or <hi>diſtreſs,</hi> bear not the leaſt proportion to the <hi>heavy, ruinous loſſes,</hi> which our moſt <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>meritorious citizens</hi> muſt ſuſtain on <hi>the other plan;</hi> much leſs can they juſtify the adoption of a plan in their favor, which will <hi>deprive</hi> our moſt reſpectable citizens of the <hi>immenſe ſums</hi> due to their painful <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>ſervices,</hi> in order to <hi>laviſh</hi> the ſame away on theſe adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous <hi>ſpeculators,</hi> and thereby accumulate the <hi>fortunes of the one,</hi> and the <hi>diſtreſſes of the other,</hi> to a degree almoſt infinite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="unknown:023972_0332_0FC2A86A8765C4B0"/>
But after all, if the loſſes of theſe ſpeculating gentry muſt be thought to require compenſation, I beg it may be made by <hi>the public,</hi> but by no means let it be <hi>carved out of the dear merits and earnings</hi> of the <hi>nobleſt patriots</hi> of our country.</p>
            <p>But the ſacred duty of paying theſe worthy citizens, who have <hi>done and ſuffered</hi> ſo much for our country, and from whoſe <hi>noble exertions</hi> we actually derive and enjoy moſt <hi>ineſtimable benefits,</hi> is not only enforced on us by every <hi>principle of juſtice, honor,</hi> and <hi>gratitude;</hi> but it is farther recommended by many <hi>advantages</hi> and great <hi>inducements of intereſt,</hi> which are either involved in it, connected with it, or conſequential from it. It may be proper here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome of theſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>reverence and reſpect which we owe to general</hi> Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, <hi>ought to induce us to pay with punctilious honor and juſtice, theſe his faithful followers and fellow-laborers;</hi> it is known only to God, and the humane heart of that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt commander, what <hi>anguiſh of mind,</hi> what <hi>poignant ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of regret</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> occupied his breaſt, at the cloſe of the war, when the exhauſted finances of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try reduced him to the <hi>dreadful neceſſity</hi> of diſmiſſing his faithful followers <hi>without their pay,</hi> and leaving them to find their way home as they could, without a ſhilling, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>relieve the diſtreſſes of their families</hi> on their return, or even to buy a cup of good liquor <hi>to recruit their exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits,</hi> or make their <hi>meeting cheerful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is known only to <hi>God,</hi> and to the <hi>humane heart</hi> of that auguſt commander, how animated, how alive would be every <hi>fine ſenſibility</hi> of that great man, how dilated his <hi>whole heart,</hi> could he be informed that the <hi>juſtice and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of his country would furniſh the <hi>reward</hi> due to the virtues and merits of theſe <hi>his worthy followers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With what a <hi>ſuffuſion of pleaſure</hi> would he <hi>haſten</hi> to find out theſe <hi>noble ſpirits</hi> in their retreats of <hi>obſcurity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,</hi> extend to them the <hi>welcome relief,</hi> and ſympathize in their <hi>joy and gladneſs;</hi> is it poſſible we ſhould heſitate to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge <hi>a man we reverence and eſteem</hi> ſo highly, with this

gratification, in which every <hi>good heart</hi> in our nation would ſympathize, and which every <hi>feeling of honor and compaſſion</hi> ſtrongly requires of us?</p>
            <p>On the other hand, do you think he could bear a <hi>diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in his,</hi> with his uſual equanimity? He can bear <hi>hardſhips and dangers,</hi> he can bear a <hi>retreat</hi> before his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he can bear the <hi>horrors of war,</hi> and the <hi>dreadful col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſions of a battle,</hi> he can bear the <hi>joys and triumphs of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> he can bear <hi>final and decided ſucceſſes,</hi> and he can bear the univerſal <hi>applauſe, gratitude, and melting hearts</hi> of his fellow-citizens; I ſay, he can bear all theſe with that <hi>heroic ſtrength of mind,</hi> which, indeed, feels <hi>every incident,</hi> but can control <hi>every paſſion into calmneſs and decency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But were he to ſee the <hi>immenſe ſum</hi> of money due to his <hi>companions and ſupporters, twice earned,</hi> firſt by <hi>their</hi> toils and ſupplies, and then again by the <hi>citizens at large,</hi> out of whoſe <hi>labor</hi> the money was <hi>carved and collected,</hi> were he to ſee, I ſay, this <hi>immenſe ſum</hi> all <hi>ſwept away</hi> into the coffers of thoſe who never <hi>earned any of it,</hi> whilſt his dear <hi>companions</hi> were left to lament, in <hi>remedileſs deſpair,</hi> the ſavage <hi>injuries</hi> of their country, the <hi>diſappointment of all their laſt expectations,</hi> and the <hi>hopeleſs ruin</hi> of their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and families;</hi> this, I think, would be too much for his <hi>mighty fortitude</hi> to ſuſtain, would ſhake that FIRMNESS OF MIND, that great POWER OF SELF-COMMAND, which perhaps forms the moſt <hi>inimitable part of his character;</hi> and <hi>what has he done,</hi> that you ſhould ſubject him to this <hi>inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable mortification,</hi> this <hi>agony</hi> of ſympathizing wo?<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>When this Eſſay was written, I had not the leaſt idea that any poſſible conſideration could have induced general <hi>Waſhington</hi> to ſign any act, which, in its operation, would cut his ſoldiers out of their pay, and leave thoſe without compenſation, who, by their advance of money and ſupplies, had fed and furniſhed his army; nor do I apprehend, that when he ſigned the funding bill, he conceived theſe effects would follow its operation: but I ſee two ways only, in which theſe effects can be avoided:</p>
                  <p>One is by <hi>paying both</hi> original creditors and ſpeculators; which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will be conſidered either extremely difficult or deſperate, for want of caſh.</p>
                  <p>The other is by a <hi>repeal</hi> of the funding act, or, which amounts to the ſame thing, by an <hi>explanatory declaration</hi> that by <hi>public creditors,</hi> in the act, is meant the <hi>real, original creditors,</hi> and not the <hi>ſpeculators.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e this as it will. I conceived it impoſſible for the general to ſign ſuch an act, and, of courſe, thought it would be great cruelty, and even inſult, to offer ſuch an one to him.</p>

               <pb n="327" facs="unknown:023972_0334_0FC2A87968845080"/>
I do not mean by all this, to ſuggeſt that the <hi>ſimple hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or caprice</hi> of any individual, however dignified, ought to be the baſis of any <hi>public meaſure,</hi> in which <hi>national in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts</hi> are concerned; but where any man exiſts in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe long practice and example have demonſtrated that all his <hi>powers</hi> are directed by <hi>wiſdom,</hi> all his <hi>paſſions</hi> are controlled and governed by <hi>diſcretion,</hi> and every <hi>action</hi> excited and animated by <hi>virtue and patriotiſm,</hi> I ſay, to form public acts <hi>agreeable to the wiſhes</hi> of ſuch a citizen, is paying court <hi>to virtue itſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt, at the ſame time, the government makes a very <hi>high compliment</hi> to the great body of the people, in ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>their minds</hi> are all under the influence of a <hi>ſimilar virtue and patriotiſm,</hi> and, of courſe, that it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to propoſe ſuch an act to their <hi>approbation, on full pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> that a <hi>public act,</hi> dictated by the <hi>wiſhes of ſuch an illuſtrious citizen,</hi> would certainly meet with a <hi>co-incidence of ſentiment in the people at large,</hi> and, of courſe, muſt be equally <hi>grateful to their wiſhes alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not offer this as <hi>an airy compliment</hi> to the citizens of the States; but I do <hi>moſt ſeriouſly believe,</hi> that the wiſhes of our auguſt <hi>general,</hi> in the caſe before us, and thoſe of <hi>the great body</hi> of our people, are the <hi>ſame,</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>ſimilar;</hi> the operations of the war being under the <hi>direction</hi> of the general, and the more important parts, both of <hi>action and events,</hi> happening under the <hi>inſpection of his own eye,</hi> will doubtleſs excite in his mind more <hi>lively ſentiments</hi> of <hi>many things and circumſtances,</hi> than the people at large can have; yet I think the conduct of thoſe worthy patriots who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the war by their ſupplies and ſervices, <hi>meets the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the people</hi> in ſo univerſal a manner, that very few can be found, who would not ſincerely join <hi>their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt general,</hi> in wiſhes that they may be paid. This leads me to obſerve,</p>
            <p>III. That <hi>the patriots who ſupported the war</hi> by their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and ſervices, not only <hi>ought to be, but</hi> in fact <hi>can be,</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="unknown:023972_0335_0FC2A87A342A2428"/>
               <hi>paid.</hi> Let their <hi>merits</hi> be ever ſo great, and our <hi>obligations</hi> to do them juſtice be ever ſo ſacred, yet if our caſe was ſuch that we <hi>could not</hi> pay them, no more need be ſaid on the ſubject; but if we <hi>can</hi> pay them, and <hi>do not,</hi> one would think that <hi>heaven and earth</hi> would riſe in their favor, and <hi>revenge their wrongs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove that they can be paid, the following facts may, and doubtleſs will, be admitted to be <hi>true and convincing evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>country is rich enough</hi> to pay them: 2. That the <hi>people are generally convinced,</hi> that <hi>the debt</hi> demanded is <hi>juſtly due to their merits and earnings;</hi> 3. That they are <hi>willing</hi> to pay them: and, 4. That our <hi>government, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme council, is alſo willing to pay them, and vigorouſly</hi> to ſet on foot and purſue the <hi>ways and means proper to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the country is <hi>rich enough</hi> to pay their deliverers, is too manifeſt to admit a doubt, or need any proof. It is eaſily demonſtrated, that an additional impoſt on <hi>imported luxuries</hi> (ſuch as ſpirits, wines, ſilks, jewellery, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>) but <hi>barely high enough to reduce the conſumption down to that moderate degree,</hi> which is really neceſſary to the <hi>health, wealth, and morality</hi> of the inhabitants, would make our finances amply <hi>ſufficient</hi> to pay every ſhilling we owe <hi>to theſe worthy citizens,</hi> and not this only, but alſo <hi>to diſcharge every other debt which either honor, juſtice, or gratitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That our people are generally <hi>convinced</hi> that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney demanded by theſe worthy citizens is <hi>juſtly due to them,</hi> is abundantly manifeſt from many conſiderations: 1ſt. They have <hi>diſcernment enough to know</hi> that a <hi>debt juſtly due</hi> will always be due <hi>until it is paid.</hi> That <hi>long delay of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is no <hi>extinguiſhment of a debt.</hi> 2d. I believe their <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> riſes high enough to comprehend, that a <hi>debt of</hi> 20<hi>s. cannot be paid and ſatisfied by a payment of</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> or, which amounts to the ſame thing, that <hi>the whole is greater than a part,</hi> or that 20 of any thing cannot be balanced or equaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>an eighth part</hi> of the ſame thing.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="329" facs="unknown:023972_0336_0FC2A88AA71CE4C8"/>
3. That our people at large are <hi>univerſally willing</hi> to pay theſe worthy citizens, is alſo very manifeſt.</p>
            <p>1ſt. <hi>The habits of morality are ſtrongly impreſſed on our people in general.</hi> The country is not old enough to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh <hi>vice, oppreſſion, and injury,</hi> or to obliterate the natural <hi>index of right and wrong,</hi> in the human mind: in the old countries, the <hi>luxury</hi> of an <hi>individual</hi> may conſume the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> of <hi>thouſands;</hi> a <hi>nation</hi> may be taxed and oppreſſed to ſupport the <hi>luſt, pride, and haughty grandeur of a few;</hi> a court of inquiſition may be inſtituted to <hi>force the mind,</hi> and <hi>infringe the rights of conſcience,</hi> and <hi>the people will bear it;</hi> but with us <hi>it is otherwiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>America, oppreſſors</hi> have not loſt their <hi>ſhame,</hi> nor the <hi>oppreſſed</hi> their <hi>reſentment,</hi> nor <hi>the people</hi> their natural <hi>ſenſe of good and evil;</hi> when theſe worthy citizens exhibit their <hi>merits and ſervices,</hi> ſhow their <hi>wounds,</hi> and plead their <hi>conſtitutions and fortunes broken in the cauſe of their country,</hi> and <hi>cry for their pay,</hi> the general mind is inſtantly affected, a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of both juſtice and compaſſion is ſtrongly <hi>excited,</hi> and the univerſal <hi>wiſh and murmur</hi> is, <hi>'let right be done,'</hi> and, 'why has it been ſo long <hi>neglected and delayed?'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2d. For the truth of the fact, I appeal to every man in the States, whether, within the circle of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, there does not prevail a <hi>general pity</hi> for the ſoldiers and other liberal ſupporters of the war; <hi>a decided opinion and high ſenſe</hi> that they have been <hi>injured and ill uſed;</hi> and a ſtrong and ſincere <hi>wiſh</hi> that they may be <hi>paid:</hi> as far as my acquaintance with my countrymen extends, this wiſh is almoſt univerſal, and if any exception can be found, I conceive it muſt be among <hi>two claſſes</hi> of people. 1. The <hi>preſent holders of alienated certificates,</hi> ſome of whom, I ſuppoſe, wiſh to <hi>grab and ſecure</hi> to themſelves, the <hi>rewards</hi> due to the <hi>merits and ſervices</hi> of theſe worthy patriots. 2. The other claſs are thoſe who always <hi>abhorred</hi> both the <hi>war</hi> and <hi>Revolution,</hi> and are therefore well enough pleaſed to ſee all thoſe who were concerned in <hi>promoting both the one and the other,</hi> moſt effectually <hi>mortified and diſappointed.</hi> This leads us to conſider,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="330" facs="unknown:023972_0337_0FC2A88C8943A0B8"/>
4. The <hi>happy facility and eaſe with which our ſupreme council can adopt the meaſure of paying theſe worthy, injured citizens,</hi> and put into moſt effectual operation the <hi>ways and means</hi> neceſſary to accompliſh it; nobody doubts that this is the ardent <hi>wiſh of their hearts,</hi> or that they will <hi>ſpeedily adopt</hi> the favorite meaſure, and vigorouſly ſupport and puſh it to its <hi>final effect,</hi> and thereby demonſtrate to the world, how ſtrongly they are <hi>animated and gratified with the pleaſing taſk</hi> of repairing the <hi>wrongs of our injured citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi> and reſtoring the <hi>juſtice, honor, and dignity of our country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By large and repeated trials of the temper of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we find that they will <hi>bear great preſſures and burdens,</hi> and will freely devote their <hi>ſervices and fortunes</hi> for what they deem to be the <hi>good</hi> of their country, for <hi>objects</hi> which fall in with their <hi>wiſhes,</hi> and meet their <hi>approbation;</hi> this temper will enable government to inſtitute any <hi>proper modes of ſupply,</hi> for the payment of our worthy patriots, when that very payment is the <hi>favorite wiſh</hi> of the people who are to pay the tax which is collected for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Two different bodies of claimants now preſent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on government; theſe <hi>worthy patriots</hi> are one of them; and the <hi>preſent holders</hi> of alienated certificates are the other; it will require <hi>equal ſums</hi> of money to pay ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; the only queſtion is, <hi>which of them</hi> ſhall have it? but I conceive, that the <hi>difficulty</hi> of raiſing the money for the payment of each of theſe, will not be by any means <hi>equal,</hi> but <hi>extremely different.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This brings into view another conſideration, which, in the preſent ſtate of our finances, appears to me of great moment; our revenue ſyſtem is <hi>young and tender,</hi> and it is of great importance to introduce the <hi>practice</hi> of it, and get it formed into a ſort of <hi>habit</hi> in the States as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and this may require <hi>delicate management;</hi> if taxes are called for in <hi>ways,</hi> and for <hi>purpoſes,</hi> which are generally <hi>approved,</hi> the collection may be made with <hi>little difficulty and few murmurs;</hi> but if <hi>immenſe ſums</hi> of money are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in ways that are <hi>diſguſting,</hi> and for <hi>purpoſes not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally approved,</hi> and perhaps <hi>abhorred,</hi> the difficulties of

collection will be <hi>great,</hi> and the <hi>murmurs, infinite;</hi> this may bring <hi>embarraſſments</hi> on the revenue, which we may <hi>long</hi> feel very ſad effects of. To apply this to the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us—</p>
            <p>A large impoſt laid purpoſely for the payment of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſupporters of the war,</hi> will meet the <hi>approbation,</hi> and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incide with the <hi>wiſhes,</hi> of the <hi>great body</hi> of our people, and, of courſe, the <hi>collection</hi> will be made with <hi>eaſe and good humor;</hi> but let our people be told that this <hi>immenſe ſum,</hi> which is levied for that favorite purpoſe, when <hi>carried</hi> into the treaſury, is not to be <hi>given to thoſe favorite patriots,</hi> but is to be <hi>grabbed</hi> up by another claſs of men who have no pretence to either <hi>ſervice or merit,</hi> but claim only what is due to the <hi>merits and the ſervices of the others,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, in this caſe, that all <hi>good humor</hi> will take its flight in an inſtant, and <hi>murmurs plenty and ſour</hi> enough will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
            <p>What effect ſuch general murmurs, complaints, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents may have on the <hi>revenue,</hi> may be eaſily foreſeen, and I ſhould be glad to know, that theſe miſchiefs would <hi>end</hi> with the revenue, without <hi>extending</hi> farther to diſturb and derange the <hi>general police</hi> of the nation; the leaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which can be expected from this general diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be, that it will furniſh a plauſible <hi>excuſe or plea for ſmugglers and thoſe who wiſh</hi> to <hi>defraud</hi> the revenue, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that there cannot be much harm in <hi>eluding a tax</hi> which is levied for the very purpoſe of <hi>ſatisfying claims,</hi> which are, in their nature, <hi>wrongful,</hi> and not grounded on any ſuch <hi>valuable conſiderations,</hi> as the <hi>laws of commutative juſtice</hi> make eſſentially neceſſary to the exiſtence of any <hi>rightful transfer of property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I imagine it would be pretty much in vain for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attempt to compoſe all this confuſion, and pacify the general ill humor, by holding out an <hi>old law of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In the original publication of this Eſſay, the following ſhort account, of the <hi>South-Sea ſcheme</hi> in <hi>England</hi> was inſerted by way of preface, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

                     <p>THE <hi>South-Sea ſcheme</hi> in <hi>England</hi> affords us the only inſtance I ever heard of in that country, of any national ſtocks or funds, whoſe fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or exchange ever varied, <hi>i. e.</hi> roſe or fell, ſo much as from par to 8 for 1, or vice verſa, form 8 for 1 to par.</p>
                     <p>National ſtocks or funds I call them, not becauſe thoſe ſtocks were properly <hi>public money,</hi> but becauſe they were of ſuch <hi>magnitude and extent</hi> as to affect the <hi>trade and credit</hi> of the nation, and were managed under the <hi>ſanction and protection of national authority,</hi> and controlled by the <hi>inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>South-Sea Company</hi> was <hi>incorporated</hi> by act of Parliament, <hi>in</hi> 1711 <hi>i. e.</hi> a great number of proprietors of <hi>navy bills, debentures, and other public ſecurities,</hi> were incorporated into a Company, to which was given a great variety of <hi>duties on wines, tobacco,</hi> India <hi>goods, &amp;c.</hi> to pay the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual intereſt</hi> due to them, amounting to above <hi>half a million</hi> ſterling; and alſo, with this grant was joined a grant of a monopoly of the trade to <hi>Spaniſh South-America,</hi> grounded on the <hi>Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>This Company ſoon grew amazingly rich, had the King and moſt other capital perſonage for ſtock-holders, and in 1718, <hi>his Majeſty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> was choſen their <hi>Governor;</hi> at which time, the Company was become the great favorite of the court and nation, and, in 1720, were in ſuch good condition, that 100<hi>l.</hi> ſhare <hi>of their ſtock</hi> was worth 130<hi>l. i. e.</hi> 30 <hi>per cent. above par.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time, <hi>i. e.</hi> in 1720, the ſcheme of reducing all the <hi>public funds into one,</hi> for diſcharging the national debt (which, by the by, at that time was alarming enough) <hi>was ſet</hi> on foot.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>South-Sea Company</hi> and <hi>Bank of England</hi> were competitors, and bid on one another for the privilege of taking in the <hi>national debts,</hi> and thereby increaſing their <hi>capital ſtock</hi> and <hi>yearly fund.</hi> The offer of the Company to Parliament for this privilege, was above 7,000,000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling, &amp;c. which was more than the Bank would give, and, of courſe, was accepted and ratified by an act of Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Having thus carried their point, the next thing was <hi>to go to work,</hi> and make the moſt of their privilege, which was generally thought <hi>ſo great,</hi> that their ſtocks roſe from 130 to 300<hi>l.</hi> for a ſhare of 100<hi>l.</hi> by the time their contract with Parliament was completed.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing they had to do, was to purchaſe in <hi>the public ſecurities,</hi> which they were able to do on pretty favorable terms; for the <hi>Revolution,</hi> and the <hi>wars</hi> of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> had raiſed the national debt to about 40,000,000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling (if I remember right) which was in thoſe days thought a very alarming ſum (tho' the nation have learned better ſince) of courſe, the credit of the public debts was ſomewhat <hi>doubtful;</hi> and as the ſtock of the <hi>South-Sea Bank</hi> or <hi>Company</hi> was <hi>in the firſt credit,</hi> the proprietors of the public ſecurities thought themſelves <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to carry in and ſell</hi> their public ſecurities, on ſuch terms as they and the Company could agree on. Above 26,000,000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling was ſubſcribed into the <hi>South-Sea</hi> ſtock, in this manner.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the Company opened their books and ſold out ſtock to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe amount, and to a profit from 300 to 1000 per cent. Their firſt ſubſcription was for 1,000,000 at 300<hi>l. April</hi> 12, 1720; and the ſtock roſe ſo faſt, that on the 24th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the books were opened for a ſubſcription of 1,000,000 capital ſtock, at 1000<hi>l.</hi> for every 100<hi>l.</hi> capital ſtock, which was filled in <hi>three hours;</hi> ſuch was <hi>the rage</hi> for that ſort of ſpeculating, at that time. And, what is <hi>more amazing,</hi> after the books were cloſed, in the afternoon of the ſame day, this <hi>ſame ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was ſold in <hi>Change-Alley at</hi> 30 <hi>or</hi> 40 <hi>per cent. advance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The caſh and credits of the Company were vaſtly accumulated by this time; and as they lent millions on intereſt, and ſold moſt of their ſtocks for about 1-5th caſh in hand, the reſt on credit at ſeveral future payments, the debts due to them were immenſe.</p>
                     <p>When the bubble burſt, as it did in leſs than ſix months after, and the ſtock the ſubſcribers had purchaſed at 1000 per cent, was reduced down to about 150, and, of courſe, the loſs of ever ſuch ſubſcriber was 850<hi>l.</hi> out of every 1000<hi>l.</hi> ſubſcribed; I ſay, when this happened, legal ſuits (of which very many were commenced) for theſe debts due to the Company, would have reduced moſt of the monied men in the kingdom to a ſtate of remedileſs bankruptcy, and the Company muſt have loſt moſt of their money in the bargain. The public creditors had loſt moſt of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſecurities, which they had ſubſcribed into that fund. And infinite other miſchiefs of a like nature muſt have accrued, of a kind moſt ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wrong, and of an amount ſo great as to affect national intereſt, honor, and credit, and of ſuch an extreme and extraordinary nature, that no ordinary rules of law could be applied in any ſuch manner as to afford the leaſt remedy, but would rather increaſe the evil, and give the wrong a kind of ſanction of law.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>this extreme caſe,</hi> the Parliament found themſelves under an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of aſſuming the powers of <hi>ſovereign equity,</hi> and, as <hi>ſupreme chancellors</hi> of the kingdom, to ſuperſede the ordinary <hi>rules of the law,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol its <hi>force,</hi> ſoften its <hi>rigor,</hi> and adopt ſuch <hi>equitable principles,</hi> as would afford <hi>ſome remedy of an evil, an injury, a wrong,</hi> of ſuch magnitude, as brought the <hi>juſtice, credit,</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of the nation into danger.</p>
                     <p>On this principle they <hi>ſuſpended law-ſuits;</hi> annulled <hi>ſpecial bails;</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged numberleſs <hi>debtors who owed for ſtock,</hi> on paying 10 <hi>per cent. of their debts;</hi> compelled <hi>compenſations</hi> in favor of the ſufferers; forced <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends and appropriations</hi> of the ſtock of the Company; and even <hi>puniſhed</hi> many for miſmanagement, who ſeemed to have conformed themſelves to the letter of the law, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

of it; were the <hi>channels</hi> thro' which the <hi>public monies</hi> were circulated; and the <hi>final accounts of both</hi> were ſettled and adjuſted under the <hi>direction and authority</hi> of the ſame <hi>ſupreme power</hi> of the reſpective nations. Theſe ſchemes were ſo extenſive as to affect national intereſt; moſt of the monied men in both nations were deeply concerned in them, and when the <hi>enormous and ruinous effects</hi> of that great <hi>variation of exchange,</hi> which theſe ſtocks ſuffered, came to be <hi>he generally felt,</hi> applications without number were made to government for relief.</p>
            <p>Very ſtrong remonſtrances were made againſt the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the legiſlature, and that the matter ſhould be left to the courſe of common law, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be decided ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common rule of aſſignments of all negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble notes, bonds, &amp;c. But on a cloſe inſpection of the matter, it was ſoon clearly ſeen, that the variation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of theſe ſtocks (or their depreciation, as we call it) was ſo <hi>enormous and extreme,</hi> that any application of the <hi>ordinary rules of law and practice</hi> to them, would produce the moſt <hi>ruinous injuſtice and wrongs,</hi> and, of courſe, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idea of <hi>that mode of ſettlement and adjuſtment</hi> was inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given up.</p>
            <p>Their great principle was, that juſtice and right was the <hi>grand end</hi> of law, and paramount to any <hi>particular rules or eſtabliſhed practice,</hi> and, of courſe, ought to <hi>control them</hi> in all caſes of ſo <hi>extreme</hi> and <hi>extraordinary a kind,</hi> as could not fall within <hi>the reaſon on which thoſe rules were founded,</hi> but ſo circumſtanced, as that an application of theſe <hi>common rules</hi> would <hi>unavoidably</hi> produce ſuch <hi>injury and wrong,</hi> as was totally <hi>deſtructive of all that right</hi> which was the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>principle and end</hi> of all law.</p>
            <p>Upon full conſideration of all this, by an act of <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty</hi> they adopted the moſt <hi>equitable principles,</hi> which they could deviſe in thoſe great confuſions, which would apply to the <hi>particular caſes</hi> that lay before them, and which would, in their operation, produce the <hi>moſt right and avoid all wrong,</hi> in the beſt manner they could think of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſe of Commons went ſo far as to <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend all judgments and executions</hi> recovered upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:023972_0342_0FC2A89322C3A0B0"/>
for <hi>ſale or purchaſe of any ſtock</hi> or ſubſcription, and alſo ordered that all perſons, who had become <hi>indebted</hi> to the Company for South-Sea <hi>ſtock, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould, on <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> 10 <hi>per cent. be diſcharged</hi> from any farther demands. They made many other reſolutions (which were afterwards made acts of parliament) totally <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>common rules of law and practice,</hi> but abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be adopted in thoſe <hi>extreme caſes,</hi> to which theſe common <hi>rules</hi> could not be <hi>applied</hi> without the moſt manifeſt and ruinous <hi>wrongs</hi> and <hi>injuſtice;</hi> wrongs of ſuch magnitude as to affect the <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>credit of the nation,</hi> as well as to bring remedileſs <hi>ruin on</hi> thouſands of <hi>individuals,</hi> and, at the ſame time, heap <hi>immenſe fortunes</hi> on others who had never <hi>deſerved them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well that great pains were taken in <hi>France,</hi> to throw much <hi>odium and blame on mr.</hi> Law, and to make him chargeable with the great and ruinous miſchiefs of the <hi>Miſſiſſippi ſcheme;</hi> and the ſame induſtry was uſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to caſt <hi>blame on the directors of the South-Sea Company,</hi> and to father the pernicious conſequences of that ſcheme on their corruption and miſmanagement.</p>
            <p>But tho' it may be probable enough, that in ſchemes of that vaſt magnitude and national intereſt, <hi>faults in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement</hi> might be found, which are always made to reſt on the <hi>prime movers and directors</hi> of them, yet the <hi>moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital and deſtructive miſchiefs ſprung from the nature of the ſchemes themſelves,</hi> and would neceſſarily happen (tho', per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, not in every poſſible exceſs and aggravation) if the <hi>ſame plans were to be ſet on foot a thouſand times</hi> over.</p>
            <p>But as theſe ſchemes were eſtabliſhed under the <hi>ſanction of the Legiſlature,</hi> in the fulleſt manner that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, it was not <hi>quite decent to admit</hi> in the national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, that their <hi>miſchiefs flowed from their nature,</hi> but the blame muſt be thrown on ſomebody, as ſome <hi>ſtupid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,</hi> in the late times, attributed the <hi>depreciation</hi> of the Continental money <hi>to the merchants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, to be ſure, in <hi>England,</hi> was natural enough, where they adopt this principle, that when popular diſcontents riſe very high, <hi>one man muſt die for the people, i. e.</hi> one or
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:023972_0343_0FC2A8A6EB02FC80"/>
more victims muſt be ſacrificed, like ſcape-goats, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the people, and thereby <hi>parry the reſentment</hi> due to the <hi>miniſter,</hi> or <hi>prince,</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>other principal,</hi> from whoſe <hi>folly</hi> or <hi>miſconduct</hi> the miſchief originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; witneſs, admiral <hi>Byng,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>But let the miſchief originate wherever it might, the grand object of attention was <hi>a remedy,</hi> and this, doubtleſs, engroſſed and occupied the whole wiſdom of the legiſlatures and the reſpective nations, at the time; for whilſt their great intereſt, both <hi>national</hi> and <hi>individual,</hi> were rapidly melting down under the fatal influence of theſe <hi>deſtructive ſchemes,</hi> even <hi>ſupreme councils</hi> were willing to <hi>hearken to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi> and, therefore, we may well preſume that we have an <hi>example of the moſt conſummate national wiſdom</hi> that could be collected, in the <hi>modes of remedy</hi> which they adopted.</p>
            <p>Nor does any body ſuppoſe that one man in <hi>England</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that <hi>their national debt</hi> will ever be paid <hi>at par,</hi> tho' the preſent diſcount or depreciation is but <hi>about 25 per cent.;</hi> or that <hi>more intereſt</hi> will be paid than the <hi>real value</hi> of theſe ſtocks or certificates require; the <hi>preſent intereſt</hi> paid on them being 3 or 3½ <hi>per cent.</hi> whilſt the <hi>common intereſt</hi> of that country is 5 per cent.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to refer to any thing, which might be done in the old days of barbarity and ignorance; but I do not recollect having ever heard of one modern prince or State in <hi>Europe,</hi> who ever attempted to pay <hi>his ſoldiers or other public creditors,</hi> in <hi>certificates,</hi> or ſtocks, or negotiable ſecurities of any ſort; except when ſuch payment made <hi>a part of the original contract,</hi> as the contracts for navy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies are payable in navy bills, &amp;c. All that I know, which is at all like it, is paying armies, &amp;c. with <hi>baſe coin,</hi> which ſome princes have done; but this was a <hi>State-cheat</hi> univerſally deteſted; nor could all the authority of ſuch prince ever give ſuch baſe coin a currency beyond its <hi>real value;</hi> nor did I ever hear of much it being called in and <hi>redeemed at full nominal value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I take to be the practice of the nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> in caſes ſimilar to the one I am pleading; and, I think, a very little diſcretion on our part might induce us to imitate
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:023972_0344_0FC2A8AC96C65E38"/>
their prudence and virtue, profit by their example, and avoid their errors.</p>
            <p>But it may, perhaps, be more important to our internal quiet, to advert to what has been the practice of our own States in ſimilar caſes; for <hi>any innovations,</hi> or <hi>departure from known uſage, and cuſtoms among ourſelves,</hi> may give more diſſatisfaction to our people, than any deviation from <hi>European</hi> practices, which, tho' perhaps <hi>equally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>loan-office certificates</hi> iſſued by our own ſupreme council during the war, are all <hi>eſtimated by a ſcale,</hi> the principle of which is the value of them at the time of their dates; the <hi>value of our Continental and States money</hi> has been eſtimated by either the general <hi>ſcale of Congreſs,</hi> or that of <hi>particular States;</hi> this method was indeed neglected too long, but was at laſt fully adopted, upon the plaineſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and moſt urgent neceſſity; and when our <hi>Continental</hi> and <hi>State</hi> money depreciated down to nothing, <hi>it all died where it was;</hi> nobody ever thought of <hi>appreciating it</hi> again, by a redemption at its <hi>original value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Old Tenor and other bills</hi> which had a currency in many of the States long before the Revolution, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed at their <hi>current exchange,</hi> without the leaſt regard to their <hi>nominal value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And can any poſſible reaſon be given, why we ſhould adopt <hi>an innovation</hi> (propoſed and urged by many) reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the certificates in queſtion,</hi> which is a <hi>total departure</hi> from the conſtant practice of all the States <hi>before, at, and ſince the Revolution,</hi> in all caſes of <hi>ſimilar reaſon; an innovation,</hi> which, by its natural and neceſſary operation, muſt and will not only produce <hi>immenſe and ruinous wrong</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs individuals of moſt <hi>deſerving citizens,</hi> but will alſo diſgrace and diſparage our <hi>public credit,</hi> honor, and dignity, and diſcourage the <hi>confidence</hi> of our <hi>own citizens and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners</hi> in our <hi>national juſtice and morality?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the <hi>ordinary rules</hi> of law would do infinite <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and injuſtice,</hi> were not the <hi>rigor</hi> of them to be <hi>ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and corrected by chancery;</hi> the powers of chancery ought always to <hi>control the common law,</hi> whenever, in any caſe,
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:023972_0345_0FC2A8B71BE47120"/>
the application of the ordinary rules of law will manifeſtly deſtroy <hi>right and juſtice,</hi> or work <hi>a wrong;</hi> for law is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>perverted and needs correction,</hi> whenever it deſtroys <hi>right,</hi> or does <hi>wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſupreme power of every State is the <hi>ſupreme chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> of it, and always hath, and muſt have, <hi>ſovereign au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to <hi>repeal,</hi> to <hi>limit,</hi> or <hi>control</hi> every rule of law; and <hi>

                  </gap>ay, and ought</hi> to, do it, whenever that rule operates by way of <hi>deſtruction</hi> or <hi>defalcation of right,</hi> or producing of <hi>wrong,</hi> for <hi>juſtice and ſecurity of right</hi> can never be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> or even <hi>tolerable,</hi> in any State. without the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of this power, and the <hi>prudent exerciſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>When all the foregoing <hi>reaſons,</hi> the <hi>practice</hi> of all our own <hi>particular States,</hi> and alſo, that of our own <hi>ſupreme council,</hi> as well as that of all the <hi>States of Europe,</hi> in ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, as far as their practice is known to us; I ſay, when all theſe things are duly conſidered, I think my great concluſion will be admitted very readily, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That our moſt deſerving and patriotic citizens</hi> (whoſe cauſe I have been advocating) <hi>muſt be paid;</hi> that the <hi>wiſhes</hi> of our own citizens require it; that our <hi>character</hi> of honor and juſtice, both at home and abroad, requires it; and that we ſhall be deemed by the nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>novices</hi> in policy and finance, as well as <hi>knaves</hi> in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, if we do not do it.</p>
            <p>I will ſubjoin one ſhort obſervation here, becauſe I think it of great importance, <abbr>viz.</abbr> it is the great intereſt, duty, and honor of every government, not only <hi>to pay their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> honeſtly and in good ſeaſon, but alſo to grant <hi>proper compenſations</hi> to all their citizens, who, by <hi>patriotic exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> deſerve the <hi>notice</hi> and <hi>rewards</hi> of their country; this will enable government at all times to command every <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible exertion</hi> of their people, either in the way of <hi>ſervices or ſupplies,</hi> and will induce them to haſten with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pride, to <hi>offer to government any thing they have or can produce,</hi> which the public ſervice ſtands in need of.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if theſe noble ſpirits find themſelves <hi>neglected and forgotten,</hi> and that in their country's ſervice they have
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:023972_0346_0FC2A8B89C6AB820"/>
               <hi>labored in vain,</hi> and <hi>ſpent their ſtrength for, nought,</hi> their zeal for the public ſervice will become <hi>very languid,</hi> and not only ſo, but the <hi>example of their diſappointment</hi> will operate by way of <hi>great diſcouragement</hi> of their neighbours. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing animates and keeps up the ſpirit and good-humor</hi> of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo effectually, as a <hi>full confidence</hi> in the <hi>juſtice and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of its government; and this is the <hi>deepeſt and firmeſt</hi> foundation on which the <hi>wealth,</hi> the <hi>peace,</hi> the <hi>honor,</hi> and the <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> of a nation can be built.</p>
            <p>For this great purpoſe, <hi>exceſſive and extravagant allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> are by no means neceſſary, but are <hi>even criminal,</hi> when the finances are <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ſtraitened,</hi> for we ought, at leaſt, to be <hi>juſt</hi> before we are <hi>generous;</hi> the <hi>honor</hi> of the ſervice and the <hi>acceptance</hi> of government, are the grand <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to noble, patriotic actions; and moderate compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> adequate to the ſervices and merits, will be perfectly ſatisfactory; <hi>more than enough</hi> need not be given to any one, for that will make it neceſſary to give <hi>leſs than enough</hi> to ſome other.</p>
            <p>On the whole, raiſing the great ſums of money neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſatisfy all the <hi>real public creditors,</hi> will, under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>management,</hi> be no <hi>great burden</hi> to the States; the levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as faſt as the honor and juſtice of the States re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, will <hi>not impoveriſh</hi> them. Large ſums <hi>collected</hi> from the body of the nation, if they are <hi>paid out</hi> again and <hi>diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted</hi> over the ſame nation, eſpecially if the collection is principally made from the <hi>richer ſort,</hi> and the payments made to the <hi>poorer ſort</hi> (which will be the caſe, on the plan I propoſe) this tax, I ſay, will rather prove a <hi>benefit</hi> than a <hi>burden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will increaſe the <hi>circulation</hi> of caſh; it will ſtimulate <hi>induſtry;</hi> it will enable thouſands <hi>to pay their debts,</hi> who otherwiſe could not do it; and, of courſe, it will enable thouſands <hi>to receive the debts due to them,</hi> who muſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe loſe them; it will enable very many <hi>poor</hi> to ſupport themſelves, who otherwiſe would be a <hi>burden on the public or private charity;</hi> it would tend to <hi>equalize</hi> the wealth of the community, by giving every one his due portion of it;
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:023972_0347_0FC2A8BE8F375708"/>
and thereby prevent the riches of the country from <hi>accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in few hands, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It is here very worthy of notice, that theſe ſalutary effects will <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſurely</hi> flow from MY <hi>plan</hi> of paying the public monies to the real, original creditors, who are ſcattered over all the States; and payment to <hi>them</hi> will, of courſe, not only afford ſuch relief as will be highly convenient to them and their neighbours, but will alſo produce ſuch a briſk circulation of the money ſo paid, as will be greatly beneficial to the whole nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Not ſo,</hi> but in a manner <hi>widely different,</hi> will be the operation of the <hi>ſcheme</hi> of paying theſe monies to the <hi>ſpeculators;</hi> about one-third of whom, I am told, are <hi>foreigners,</hi> who will carry their ſhare of the money <hi>out of the country, never to return again;</hi> and the other two-thirds, if paid to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators here, will not probably produce any general increaſe of <hi>circulation</hi> of money, or <hi>other benefit</hi> to the public.</p>
                  <p>For money obtained by <hi>ſudden acquirement,</hi> without <hi>induſtry, merit,</hi> or <hi>earnings,</hi> ſeldom proves any <hi>benefit</hi> either to the <hi>poſſeſſors</hi> or to the <hi>public,</hi> but generally produces <hi>luxury, vanity, pride,</hi> and hurtful example of <hi>prodigality and waſte,</hi> till the whole is <hi>expended,</hi> and then the poor <hi>objects</hi> and <hi>their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> are loſt much <hi>more forlorn and diſtreſſed</hi> than they would probably have been had the money never have come into their hands.</p>
                  <p>I think any body may obſerve the very <hi>different effects and operations</hi> of theſe two plans, and it appears to me, that <hi>little penetration</hi> will be neceſſary to diſcern that the <hi>gain</hi> lies on the ſide of <hi>godlineſs;</hi> and, of courſe, if we <hi>reject the right,</hi> with ſo <hi>many benefits</hi> annexed, and <hi>adopt the wrong,</hi> with ſuch a train of <hi>miſchiefs</hi> at the heels of it, however our <hi>integrity</hi> may be unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <hi>peached,</hi> our <hi>wiſdom</hi> will be <hi>doubted,</hi> and will appear to many people altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>inadequate</hi> to the management of the finances of a nation.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are no ſmall advantages reſulting from taxation; and, I think, <hi>their effects</hi> on the nation at large will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate <hi>the burden</hi> of it, and probably yield a <hi>balance of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;</hi> eſpecially if the tax ſhould be levied by an <hi>impoſt on imported luxuries,</hi> and thereby <hi>leſſen the conſumption</hi> of uſeleſs and hurtful articles; which would operate to the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> of the community, even if the <hi>money</hi> produced by the tax was all <hi>thrown into the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mode of taxation may eaſily be made adequate to all the exigencies of the State, and leave no occaſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to either an <hi>exciſe</hi> or <hi>direct taxation,</hi> both of which will be much more <hi>difficult</hi> in their aſſeſſment, more <hi>expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> in the collection, more <hi>diſguſting</hi> in the mode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, more <hi>burdenſome</hi> to the ſubject, leſs <hi>equable</hi> in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and much more <hi>uncertain</hi> in the product.</p>
            <p>I now, with the utmoſt confidence, ſubmit it to the <hi>heart,</hi> to the <hi>feelings,</hi> and to the <hi>conſcience,</hi> of every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the States, that I have exhibited proofs, not barely
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:023972_0348_0FC2A8CCADA6B8C8"/>
ſufficient for full conviction, but ſo plain, that any perſon muſt put violence on himſelf, who will not be convinced,</p>
            <p>I. That the real public creditors, whoſe cauſe I am pleading, <hi>have not yet been paid;</hi> this is as plain as that 20<hi>s. is more than</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. That <hi>they ought to be paid,</hi> with the firſt monies we can get; this is as plain as that "the laborer is worthy of his hire," or, that contracts made on valuable conſideration given, ought to be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>III. That I have exhibited ſuch a ſtatement of our finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or reſources of ſupply, as demonſtrates that <hi>they can be paid;</hi> that the payment of them would not be <hi>a burden or diſtreſs</hi> on the country, but rather a <hi>benefit,</hi> a manifeſt <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> to our people at large: and,</p>
            <p>IV. That from moſt eſſential conſiderations of public juſtice and honor, of national character, both abroad and at home, and of the internal peace and eſtabliſhment of our nation, it follows moſt clearly, that <hi>they muſt be paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not know any thing farther neceſſary or that can be done, but to give this Eſſay ſome inſcription, which may direct it to ſome <hi>particular attention;</hi> for that which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the <hi>public at large,</hi> is generally conſidered as <hi>every body's buſineſs,</hi> and ſo is apt to be in fact <hi>nobody's</hi> and, of courſe, becomes <hi>neglected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I mean, in this Eſſay, to plead the cauſe of national juſtice, I wiſh to addreſs it to Congreſs, and beg the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of that auguſt body;</p>
            <p>Not merely becauſe they are the <hi>fountain of national juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> and their deciſions alone can adminiſter <hi>the remedy</hi> which I ſolicit; but alſo,</p>
            <p>Becauſe many very reſpectable perſonages, who now compoſe that ſupreme council, were, during the war, either concerned in the <hi>moſt capital public tranſactions</hi> in the cabinet, or were <hi>officers of moſt diſtinguiſhed rank in the army;</hi> and therefore, by near inſpection, were enabled to <hi>judge in the beſt manner,</hi> not only of the <hi>importance</hi> of the <hi>merits and ſervices</hi> herein urged; but alſo of the <hi>ſpirit, fidelity, and patriotiſm,</hi> with which they were rendered to the public; and alſo,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="342" facs="unknown:023972_0349_0FC2A8CDC432C0B8"/>
Becauſe I wiſh to ſet up the <hi>claim</hi> of theſe <hi>worthy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving patriots,</hi> along ſide of <hi>that</hi> of the preſent <hi>holders of certificates,</hi> who (I am told) have preſented their <hi>petition to Congreſs,</hi> in which they count very largely on the <hi>merits, ſervices, and ſufferings</hi> of theſe worthy citizens, of which they exhibit <hi>pathetic and very moving deſcriptions,</hi> but after all, very <hi>modeſtly</hi> requeſt, that <hi>the money due</hi> to theſe very meritorious <hi>citizens,</hi> may be paid <hi>to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think, I can introduce my friends at leaſt under the advantage of <hi>old acquaintances;</hi> whereas the others, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, are moſtly <hi>new faces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have great confidence, that my plea for citizens of ſuch merit and reſpectability, will meet at leaſt the <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if not the <hi>approbation and patronage,</hi> of Congreſs.</p>
            <p>But after all, if it ſhould be the final determination (which I cannot ſuppoſe) that the certificates ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>as full payment</hi> to thoſe who received them, and that nothing is now due <hi>to any</hi> but to the <hi>poſſeſſors of thoſe certificates,</hi> I have one more motion to make, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the <hi>original holders</hi> of theſe certificates ſhould be <hi>preferred and firſt paid,</hi> as claiming payment of debts of an <hi>higher nature,</hi> and grounded on <hi>greater merit,</hi> than the others can pretend to.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Congreſs, in their laſt ſeſſion, after long debate, <hi>rejected the whole plan of diſcrimination</hi> between the <hi>original creditors</hi> or holders of certificates, and the <hi>ſpeculators</hi> or the holders of <hi>alienated certificates,</hi> and, without <hi>any diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> admitted alike the claims of all the preſent poſſeſſors, and, by their funding act of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4, 1790, funded all the certificates at full value, or 20<hi>s.</hi> in the pound, with intereſt payable quarterly on two-thirds of their amount, from the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> 1791; and the other third, with intereſt to commence the firſt of the year 1801, or ten years from ſaid <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The certificates for intereſt, called <hi>indents,</hi> are excepted, out of this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and are funded at an intereſt of 3 per cent. only.</p>
                  <p>By this act, an <hi>enormous ſum of the public money</hi> is appropriated for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpeculators, who never <hi>earned</hi> it, nor pretend to hold out any ſort of <hi>right</hi> to it, which is founded on <hi>their merits,</hi> or <hi>earnings,</hi> or <hi>valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration paid,</hi> but claim it entirely in <hi>right of others,</hi> to whoſe <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> the money was righteouſly due, and which they make title to merely by force of the <hi>common rule of aſſignments,</hi> which, it appears to me, cannot admit any <hi>reaſonable application</hi> to this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Whether it is the deſign of Congreſs, by this ſtatute, to <hi>cut the real, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal creditors off</hi> from their pay of <hi>that part</hi> of the balances which they have never yet received (and which, I ſuppoſe, is yet <hi>juſtly due</hi> to them) I know not; but I take it, that this is the light in which it is <hi>generally underſtood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this is really the caſe (which I cannot yet believe) I have only to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that all the <hi>arguments</hi> I have publiſhed, which appear to me to be very <hi>ſtrong, clear, and concluſive,</hi> and all the <hi>concern</hi> I have felt for this great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, are vain and fruitleſs, and I ſuppoſe I ought to ſet myſelf down as an <hi>idiot,</hi> ſtupid as a poſt, becauſe I cannot perceive an iota of <hi>reaſon or juſtice</hi> in a meaſure, which appeared to Congreſs ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> as to induce them to adopt it in a <hi>ſolemn, public act:</hi> or may I rather be indulged in the thought that a <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>Diet,</hi> a <hi>Parliament,</hi> a <hi>Congreſs,</hi> an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>high in dignity,</hi> and however <hi>important</hi> to mankind their <hi>deciſions</hi> are, may err, and, what is more, may, on reviſion, be convinced of their error, and—correct it?</p>

I know that Congreſs, like all other ſimilar bodies of ſupreme authority, muſt neceſſarily have a great variety of important, different, and ſometimes, contending intereſts, referred to their deciſion; and, of courſe, the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will uſe all poſſible <hi>arts, addreſs, and influence</hi> in their power, to <hi>bend</hi> the mind of that auguſt body to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wiſhes.</p>

            <head>A REVIEW OF THE PRINCIPLES AND ARGUMENTS Of the two foregoing ESSAYS, <abbr>viz.</abbr> The Seventh Eſſay on Finance, and The Plea for the Poor Soldiers; WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE FINANCES of the UNION.</head>
            <p>I. THE <hi>finances</hi> or <hi>management of the ſtock or revenue</hi> of every State or individual, from the <hi>greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> down to the <hi>leaſt Republic,</hi> from the higheſt <hi>company</hi> to the loweſt <hi>partnerſhip,</hi> from the richeſt <hi>landholder</hi> or <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> to the pooreſt <hi>peaſant</hi> or <hi>pedlar,</hi> determines their <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or fate,</hi> is the <hi>great principle</hi> out of which their <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>plenty,</hi> or their <hi>embarraſſment</hi> and <hi>ſtraits,</hi> muſt grow, and from which muſt proceed their <hi>final honors</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> or their <hi>diſgrace</hi> and <hi>ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſubject, of courſe, becomes an object of moſt <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital concern,</hi> and ought to be an object of <hi>firſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> both of every community and alſo of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="345" facs="unknown:023972_0352_0FC2A8E35A4AD1D8"/>
Therefore, when any plan, either of political manoeuvre in a nation, or buſineſs in leſſer communities or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, is in contemplation, <hi>to count the coſt</hi> becomes an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable part of the deliberations.</p>
            <p>And when the coſt is properly computed or counted, the next thing is, to look out for and find <hi>revenues or incomes ſufficient to pay it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>error</hi> in either of theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> a <hi>wild calculation of the expenſe</hi> of any propoſed plan, or a wild and deficient <hi>eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> of the income or revenue ſufficient to pay it, is the common and uſual <hi>cauſe of bankruptcy, breach of faith,</hi> and <hi>loſs of credit,</hi> in both the one and the other, and of all the diſgraces, embarraſſments, and other ruinous conſequences which muſt flow therefrom.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>capital ſtock</hi> of a nation or individual <hi>is the wealth each poſſeſſes,</hi> and the <hi>reſources</hi> which are with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>within their power;</hi> but the more proper and ſafe way of computing the ſtock is rather by the <hi>yearly income</hi> or <hi>revenue,</hi> than by the <hi>capital;</hi> becauſe if the annual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures exceed the annual incomes, the <hi>capital ſtock</hi> muſt be <hi>left in debt</hi> at the end of the year, which, if continued, muſt ſoon produce <hi>embarraſſments</hi> and <hi>ſtraits,</hi> and even <hi>bankruptcy</hi> in the end.</p>
            <p>It often happens that much valuable property is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned, that it will not produce any <hi>yearly income,</hi> or, at moſt, not any that is adequate to the intereſt of its value; therefore, it would be very imprudent for a nation or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual to make calculations of <hi>yearly expenditures,</hi> grounded on <hi>ſuch eſtates,</hi> for they will fail of ſupply otherwiſe than <hi>by way of mortgage,</hi> which ought to be avoided as a <hi>laſt,</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>fatal, reſort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. But let the ſtock or finance of a nation or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al be ever ſo good and affluent, yet <hi>every advantage</hi> of it muſt and ever will <hi>ariſe</hi> from, and be <hi>limited</hi> by, the <hi>juſtice, honeſty,</hi> and <hi>truth, with which it is negotiated or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered. Honeſt payment</hi> of <hi>juſt debts,</hi> and <hi>fulfilment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts,</hi> are moſt eſſentially neceſſary to give either a nation or individual the <hi>command and control of all the ſupplies and</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="unknown:023972_0353_0FC2A8E4ED2C6078"/>
               <hi>ſervices,</hi> which can be furniſhed within the circle of their influence.</p>
            <p>For all perſons will <hi>haſten with eagerneſs</hi> to render all ſupplies and ſervices in their power to an <hi>honeſt, grateful paymaſter,</hi> and will <hi>avoid, with a proportionate reluctance,</hi> furniſhing either the one or the other to a <hi>diſhoneſt, dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or trickiſh</hi> paymaſter.</p>
            <p>And, of courſe, all ſupplies and ſervices, in the <hi>one caſe,</hi> will be obtained in the <hi>eaſieſt, quickeſt</hi> manner, and will be executed and rendered in the <hi>higheſt perfection</hi> (as there will be <hi>choice</hi> of materials, ſtores, and workmen) and in the <hi>cheapeſt way,</hi> and at the <hi>loweſt rates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, in the <hi>other caſe,</hi> both the ſupplies and ſervices will be <hi>embarraſſed</hi> in their <hi>acquirement,</hi> will be executed and rendered in <hi>deficient manner,</hi> and at very <hi>high prices;</hi> for every one is loth to deal with a <hi>bad paymaſter,</hi> nor will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be <hi>engaged</hi> or <hi>employed</hi> by him, unleſs he is impelled by <hi>ſome urgent neceſſity,</hi> or <hi>induced</hi> by the <hi>offer of very high price,</hi> or <hi>great emoluments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Economy and prudence in expenditures</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to the obtainment of the great <hi>advantages and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> of the <hi>revenue or national ſtock;</hi> without this, that <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and honeſty</hi> in the management of the revenue can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be practiſed, which is eſſentially neceſſary to its ends and uſes: for if the revenue or ſtock is <hi>waſted</hi> by <hi>needleſs expenſes,</hi> thoſe which are <hi>neceſſary</hi> muſt be <hi>unprovided</hi> for; if large, <hi>fictitious,</hi> and <hi>groundleſs demands</hi> are <hi>accepted</hi> and <hi>paid,</hi> debts which are by <hi>honor, contract,</hi> and <hi>real merits, juſtly due,</hi> muſt lie <hi>unpaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This operates not only to the <hi>great injury</hi> of the <hi>real creditors,</hi> but alſo to the <hi>embarraſſment</hi> of the <hi>whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> for <hi>every branch</hi> of buſineſs in the nation <hi>ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected</hi> with the <hi>public finance,</hi> as the <hi>public debts</hi> are great and extenſive objects of <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>exchange,</hi> and, of courſe, any <hi>diſappointment</hi> in theſe will generate <hi>innumerable diſappointments</hi> in the courſe of currency thro' which they ought to paſs, and, of courſe, will either <hi>directly or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely affect</hi> every branch of buſineſs.</p>

We have had late and large proof of this kind of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the numberleſs inſtances of perſons who could not carry on their buſineſs, or pay their debts, becauſe they were diſappointed of receiving monies due to them by the public: ſuch a mode of financiering as this will ruin any nation in the world.</p>
            <p>The foregoing propoſitions and remarks I conſider as <hi>maxims</hi> or <hi>firſt principles,</hi> which force the aſſent of the mind <hi>at firſt ſight,</hi> by a kind of <hi>intuitive proof</hi> or <hi>inſtant perception,</hi> and which nobody will ever think of <hi>diſputing,</hi> much leſs of <hi>denying;</hi> I therefore premiſe them like <hi>axioms,</hi> on which I may ſafely proceed to build <hi>any doctrines or plans</hi> which really reſt on theſe foundations, or come within their eſſential principles and reaſons.—I go on now with my Review of the Principles and Arguments of the two foregoing Eſſays.</p>
            <p>The great principles of the two foregoing Eſſays are compriſed in the following propoſitions:</p>
            <p>I. <hi>That all certificates delivered to the public creditors, ought to be placed to the debit of their account, at the value or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of them at the time they received them,</hi> and the <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or reſidue of the debt due to them, ought to be paid to them with intereſt:</hi> and that <hi>all certificates,</hi> when brought into the treaſury, <hi>ought to be paid to the bearer,</hi> whether an <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal holder or alienee,</hi> at the <hi>value or exchange, which each of them bore at the time of its date,</hi> or at the <hi>current exchange at the time of redemption,</hi> as the caſe may require. If this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be admitted, my ſecond propoſition is,</p>
            <p>II. To pay <hi>all certificates brought in by the original holders,</hi> at <hi>full nominal value, with intereſt;</hi> and to pay <hi>all the alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated certificates</hi> at the <hi>value or exchange they bore at their dates,</hi> or at the <hi>time of redemption,</hi> as the caſe may require. If this cannot be admitted, I propoſe,</p>
            <p>III. That the <hi>original holders be firſt paid,</hi> and the <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, laſt of all,</hi> if they muſt be paid at all.</p>
            <p>The great principle or ſubſtance of my argument is, that <hi>the public money ought to be paid to the real, original creditors,</hi> who, by rendering <hi>ſupplies and ſervices</hi> to the country, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>really, meritoriouſly, and painfully earned it:</hi> for,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="348" facs="unknown:023972_0355_0FC2A8E7CFDF00E8"/>
1. Their demand is founded on the <hi>moſt ſolemn contract of Congreſs,</hi> who had <hi>good right to make ſuch contract,</hi> which <hi>binds the honor, the morality, and juſtice of the country,</hi> and nothing but <hi>payment</hi> can diſcharge the country from the <hi>guilt of injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>violation of faith</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> moſt <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly</hi> plighted to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They <hi>fulfilled</hi> the whole of ſaid ſolemn contract vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, honeſtly, and very painfully <hi>on their parts,</hi> and therefore, on every principle of <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>earning, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled</hi> to their <hi>pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>infinite benefits</hi> we derive from that <hi>contract</hi> and their faithful <hi>fulfilment</hi> of it, afford <hi>another argument</hi> why we ſhould pay them: we cannot <hi>honeſtly</hi> enjoy the <hi>benefit</hi> of any <hi>man's labor,</hi> without paying him his <hi>hire;</hi> it is to the ſupplies and ſervices of theſe men, that we are indebted for <hi>our country, our lives, our eſtates, our liberty,</hi> and <hi>our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence,</hi> and all the bleſſings of a <hi>free government,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled and unbiaſſed by any <hi>foreign</hi> power or influence; and it ought not to be thought <hi>poſſible,</hi> that ſuch an <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican government,</hi> which derives its <hi>exiſtence</hi> from the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> the <hi>travails,</hi> and <hi>perſevering virtue</hi> of theſe <hi>patriots,</hi> ſhould, by a public act, <hi>deny</hi> them their <hi>pay,</hi> their <hi>hire,</hi> their <hi>reward,</hi> for merits which have been ſo <hi>beneficial</hi> to us, and <hi>painful</hi> to them; or ſhould ſuffer <hi>any how</hi> the <hi>public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> carved out of the wealth and earnings of our citizens for the <hi>very purpoſe</hi> of paying theſe worthy patriots, to be <hi>diverted</hi> from this deſirable object, or to be <hi>applied</hi> to any <hi>other</hi> purpoſe whatever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The heart-moving and unparallelled diſtreſſes of very <hi>many thouſands</hi> of theſe worthy patriots for <hi>want of their pay,</hi> is another cogent reaſon why they ſhould <hi>be paid:</hi> I do not ſay, that the <hi>benefits</hi> we receive from their merits, or the <hi>diſtreſſes</hi> they ſuffer from our breach of faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in denying them their pay, <hi>increaſe</hi> or <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their contract;</hi> but both have a <hi>ſtrong effect</hi> on the <hi>gratitude,</hi> the <hi>benevolence,</hi> and <hi>compaſſion</hi> of the human mind, which are virtues of ſuch <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>primary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in ſociety, that, I think, no government ought to be <hi>callous</hi> to their <hi>influence,</hi> or <hi>hardened</hi> into an <hi>inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
               <pb n="349" facs="unknown:023972_0356_0FC2A8E998F5D0F8"/>
               <hi>of their force.</hi> We all think it worſe to refuſe a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer his hire, when he and his family muſt <hi>ſtarve and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> for want of it, than to deny payment of an equal ſum to a rich man, who had an <hi>equally juſt demand,</hi> but whoſe fortune would enable him to bear the loſs <hi>without pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Theſe original creditors have <hi>not yet been paid,</hi> but in <hi>ſmall</hi> part, and therefore the <hi>remaining balance</hi> is ſtill due to them, and <hi>ought</hi> to be paid. Nobody pretends they have ever received <hi>any payment</hi> but <hi>negotiable certificates</hi> made payable to the <hi>bearer,</hi> and worth on average, when they received them, about 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. in the pound;</hi> theſe certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, I ſay, ought to be debited to them at <hi>their value or current exchange</hi> when they <hi>received</hi> them; <hi>ſo much</hi> they have received, and <hi>no more;</hi> and the reſidue of balance due to them ought to be paid to them.</p>
            <p>I have attended to all the debates on this great ſubject, both public and private, which have fell in my way, but I do not recollect one perſon who ever ſeriouſly inſiſted, that the certificates delivered to the public creditors were <hi>full payment of the debt due to them;</hi> but this notwithſtanding, I have heard <hi>many objections,</hi> ſilly and nugatory enough, ſtrongly urged againſt making any further payment to thoſe who had ſold their certificates.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One was, that if they had not ſold their <hi>debt,</hi> they had ſold the <hi>evidence of it,</hi> and ſo could have <hi>no further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;</hi> this is <hi>not true;</hi> the <hi>evidence</hi> of the debt is <hi>the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic books,</hi> where their accounts are <hi>adjuſted,</hi> and the <hi>balance</hi> due to them is <hi>entered;</hi> and nothing can juſtly be objected to this but ſome evidence that the debt <hi>has been paid;</hi> which evidence, the <hi>certificate,</hi> if produced, could not ſupply. Further, the <hi>certificate,</hi> if produced, could not be ſo <hi>good</hi> evidence as the <hi>public books,</hi> for the one might be <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,</hi> the other <hi>could not be:</hi> ſuppoſe a man brings ſuit on a <hi>record,</hi> of which he has ſome time or other taken a copy, and produces the <hi>record</hi> in court; can it be objected to his recovery, that he has <hi>not produced the copy?</hi> Or, if a man brings ſuit on a contract, and has <hi>three</hi> witneſſes to it, <hi>two</hi> of which he produces, who fully verify the fact; ſhall he
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:023972_0357_0FC2A8F7CC22F6D0"/>
loſe his cauſe, becauſe he did not call in the <hi>third wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The public creditor who demands his pay, muſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bring <hi>evidence ſufficient</hi> to ſupport his ſuit, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>proof will lie upon him,</hi> and if he can, in any way, <hi>verify the facts,</hi> and <hi>ſupport his right,</hi> he doubtleſs <hi>ought to be paid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another objection has been made, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that <hi>all</hi> the original creditors who ſold their certificates, were not <hi>dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by neceſſity</hi> to do this; and what if they were not? can there be any <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>diſqualification</hi> in ſelling a negotiable certificate, made payable to the <hi>bearer,</hi> and purpoſely <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,</hi> like bills of money, for <hi>negotiation</hi> and <hi>currency</hi> thro' <hi>any</hi> and <hi>every</hi> hand?</p>
            <p n="3">3. It has been objected, that <hi>ſome</hi> original creditors ſold their certificates thro' <hi>diffidence of the public faith.</hi> And what if they did? Do you think they were <hi>ſingular</hi> in their diffidence? Suppoſe any man wants confidence in his debtor, and <hi>fears or doubts</hi> that he ſhall loſe his debt; Can that affect the <hi>juſtice</hi> of his demand, or his <hi>right to payment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another objects to <hi>any further payment,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſome</hi> of the creditors who ſold their certificates for 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, had <hi>managed their</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d. ſo well</hi> by a ſeven years' negotiation, as <hi>to make</hi> 20<hi>s. out of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Another objects, that <hi>many</hi> of the public creditors were of ſuch a <hi>diſſipating turn,</hi> that if they were paid the whole 20<hi>s.</hi> due to them, they would ſoon <hi>ſpend</hi> it, and, of courſe, would be <hi>no better</hi> but rather <hi>worſe</hi> off, than if they had never been paid.</p>
            <p>Now, gentlemen-readers, ſuppoſe any private debtor ſhould be ſummoned into court, at the ſuit of his creditor, for a debt of 20<hi>s.</hi> and he ſhould ſhow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he had, ſeven years ago, paid his creditor 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> of the debt of 20<hi>s.</hi> and plead <hi>any or all the foregoing objections</hi> againſt any further payment of the 17<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> which remained due; can you imagine that the court would allow ſuch plea to be good in <hi>law or equity,</hi> and <hi>ſufficient to diſcharge</hi> the debtor from any <hi>further payment?</hi> And if theſe <hi>pleas</hi> and <hi>objections</hi> ſhould
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:023972_0358_0FC2A8FF863055D8"/>
appear trifling and ridiculous in a <hi>private concern,</hi> can you bring yourſelves to believe they would receive any addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al weight or dignity from being introduced by any moſt dignified perſonage, and urged in the moſt auguſt aſſembly on earth, againſt paying <hi>public creditors</hi> circumſtanced in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>great objection</hi> ſtill remains, the <hi>clincher</hi> that is to ſupport the whole plan, and ſo connect the parts together, as to make the whole conſiſtent with <hi>law, reaſon, right,</hi> and <hi>juſtice;</hi> for certainly no plan can be juſtified, which has not all theſe qualities. This capital objection to pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original creditors, who have ſold their certificates, the balance of the debt, which has never been paid to them, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>They have <hi>ſold their certificates,</hi> and thereby <hi>conveyed to the purchaſer all their right</hi> to their demand or debt due to them. As much ſtreſs is laid on this objection, it requires a particular conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the public promiſe or faith is <hi>ſuppoſed to be given</hi> in the certificate, it was <hi>broken the inſtant it was made;</hi> it was <hi>violated in the very birth of it;</hi> it was <hi>verbal</hi> only, not <hi>real;</hi> the <hi>words</hi> expreſſed the <hi>nominal</hi> value, but the <hi>reality</hi> or <hi>meaning</hi> ſunk down inſtantly to the <hi>current value,</hi> by the very <hi>conſtruction</hi> which Congreſs itſelf fixed, by their ſcale, on like words in the loan-office certificates, and under this conſtruction they paſſed, by univerſal conſent of buyer and ſeller, from hand to hand.</p>
            <p>The <hi>wrong</hi> was <hi>inſtantly</hi> done to the original creditor, and he inſtantly ſuſtained the <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>damage,</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, if any thing is to be done in future time to compenſate or repair that damage, it ought <hi>ſo to be done,</hi> that he who <hi>ſuffered</hi> the <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>damage,</hi> may receive the <hi>benefit</hi> of it; making this compenſation to a <hi>ſtranger,</hi> who ſuffered nothing, is no <hi>repair of the wrong done,</hi> is no ſort of <hi>reſtoration</hi> of injured right, and is, of courſe, nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and ridiculous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, in real truth, if the public faith was deſigned to be really plighted at all, it was annexed to the <hi>debt,</hi> not to the <hi>certificate;</hi> the debt was founded on the <hi>merits or</hi>

               <hi>valuable conſiderations out of which it grew,</hi> and to theſe it adheres, and carries with it the promiſe or public faith which is annexed to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>certificates</hi> and theſe <hi>merits</hi> are very widely different things; the one <hi>depreciated to</hi> 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound; the other <hi>kept their value</hi> without the leaſt diminution; the one was <hi>transferred;</hi> the other <hi>was not.</hi> The ſpeculators can produce the <hi>certificates,</hi> but they cannot produce the <hi>merits,</hi> of the original creditors: theſe they never bought or paid for, and, therefore, can have no right or claim to them, or the rewards of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the debt annexed to them; for it is impoſſible that one man ſhould have a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>labor</hi> or <hi>hire</hi> of another, without paying a <hi>valuable conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for it; if it was even <hi>agreed to be transferred without this,</hi> the transfer would be <hi>void</hi> as a <hi>nudum pactum,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>laws of the land,</hi> but by the immutable <hi>laws of commutative juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The certificate was never either delivered to, or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, the original creditor, as <hi>full payment of the debt</hi> due to him, and therefore never <hi>compriſed or carried in it that debt;</hi> nor is it pretended or pleaded by any body as any thing more than the <hi>evidence</hi> of that debt; and, of courſe, if the debt can be ſufficiently <hi>proved by the public books,</hi> or any other evidence, the want or abſence of the certificate can be no objection to the claim of the original creditor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The certificate, when firſt delivered to the public creditor, being made payable to the bearer, and expreſsly fitted and calculated for circulation or exchange, like other bills of public credit, compriſed and carried in it <hi>ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> as long as it could be ſold, but, like all other articles of negotiation or exchange, that value was <hi>liable to varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> according to the <hi>riſe</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> of the market.</p>
            <p>From the two laſt propoſitions it clearly follows, that when the certificate was ſold, all the <hi>value</hi> which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed or carried in it was ſold and transferred with it, and <hi>no more;</hi> and of courſe, the purchaſer, by the ſale, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came entitled to that <hi>value,</hi> and <hi>no more:</hi> the reſt of the debt ſtaid behind, and ſtuck faſt to the original merits out of which it originally grew, and in the place where it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:023972_0360_0FC2A90CCD7501E0"/>
belonged, <hi>i. e.</hi> the original creditor, by the ſale of his certificate, ſold and granted all that he received, and no more; and that part which he had not received, he retained, and has a right to call for and receive, whenever he pleaſes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A reference to the <hi>real deſign of Congreſs</hi> in iſſuing the certificates, eſpecially at the cloſe of the war, may caſt ſome light on this affair. We are not to ſuppoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs iſſued negotiable certificates <hi>for</hi> 40,000,000 <hi>of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> worth but 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> or ſome ſuch trifle, in the pound, with <hi>real, ſerious deſign</hi> to load the nation with the immenſe burden of redeeming them at 20<hi>s. in the pound,</hi> wholly for the benefit of the <hi>bearers;</hi> by far the greateſt part of whom, they had every reaſon to ſuppoſe, would be <hi>ſtrangers</hi> not only to the <hi>merits,</hi> out of which the debt certified original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grew, but to <hi>any ſuch ſervices,</hi> or even <hi>kind wiſhes,</hi> for our country, as could deſerve the public notice; and many of them <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to the country itſelf.</p>
            <p>We never ought to impute bad intentions, eſpecially to public bodies of dignity, where their actions will equally well bear a favorable conſtruction. I think, we are rather bound in charity to ſuppoſe, that, as Congreſs found the public treaſury ſo exhauſted that it was impracticable to make even a ſmall, partial payment to the public creditors, they might think that negotiable certificates would ſell for <hi>ſomething,</hi> which, tho' little, might be better than <hi>nothing,</hi> and afford <hi>ſome relief,</hi> till the country could recover a little from the ruins of the war, and arrange the finances into ſome productive ſtate, which would ſupply funds ſufficient for full payment; and that, in the mean time, they might ſafely truſt to the wiſdom of a future Congreſs, to adopt modes of redemption of ſuch certificates, either ſimilar to their own ſcales then in eſtabliſhed practice, or ſome other which might do <hi>juſtice to all,</hi> or at leaſt ſomething near it, and bring <hi>ruin on nobody,</hi> nor even diſappoinment; for ſuch a limited redemption was expected by every body at that time.</p>
            <p>They had been long accuſtomed to iſſue public paper with the public faith plighted in <hi>words expreſſive and ſolemn enough,</hi> which yet, by their own ſcales and by general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, were reduced, <hi>in conſtruction</hi> or <hi>meaning,</hi> down
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:023972_0361_0FC2A90E10661EC0"/>
to the <hi>current value</hi> or <hi>exchange</hi> which their paper obtained; and when they iſſued the certificates in queſtion, I have no doubt but they conſidered themſelves merely <hi>purſuing their long uſage or practice,</hi> and conceived that the <hi>public paper they then iſſued,</hi> with all the <hi>reſt</hi> that preceded it, would, in time, find and meet ſome reaſonable mode of liquidation and final redemption, <hi>tolerable to all,</hi> and <hi>ruinous to none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this view of the matter, tho' the means they adopted may not be deemed <hi>altogether proper</hi> (and perhaps, under the public preſſures and neceſſities which then exiſted, no means could be hit on <hi>wholly free</hi> from exception) yet their <hi>intentions</hi> may be admitted to be <hi>juſt, ſalutary, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent,</hi> and agreeable to the <hi>general expectation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas, on the other hand, to ſuppoſe them <hi>deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> loading the States with a debt of 40,000,000 of dollars, for only 5,000,000 which they received and had the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of, is <hi>monſtrous,</hi> which becomes ſtill more <hi>hideous,</hi> if this horrible plan was <hi>deſignedly</hi> ſo formed that, by its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural operation, it would, in the end, cut all ſuch of the original creditors who took benefit of it, off from 7-8<hi>ths</hi> of their <hi>pay or the debt certified</hi> to be due to them. But,</p>
            <p n="6">6. To ſuppoſe that the whole debt due to the original creditors is compriſed in their certificates, and transferred by the ſale of them to the purchaſers, by the common rule of aſſignments, I ſay, this ſuppoſition will demonſtrably prove either that the common rule of aſſignments is <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> in itſelf, or <hi>wrongly applied</hi> to this caſe: but <hi>wrong in itſelf</hi> it is not; for it is plainly enough very good and uſeful <hi>in its place, i. e.</hi> within its due <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>reaſon;</hi> therefore, in the caſe in queſtion, the application is <hi>wrongful, i. e.</hi> the rule will not admit a reaſonable <hi>application to the facts,</hi> on which its operation is demanded.</p>
            <p>For <hi>every law divine and human,</hi> every practicable <hi>rule of morality or ſound policy,</hi> is and muſt moſt neceſſarily be <hi>founded on juſtice and right,</hi> and, in its application, muſt <hi>produce juſtice and right,</hi> and <hi>avoid injury and wrong;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whenever any law or rule, however <hi>ſacred in itſelf,</hi> is applied <hi>to any facts or caſe</hi> to which it ſo <hi>ill ſuits,</hi> that its neceſſary and unavoidable operation will be to <hi>deſtroy</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="unknown:023972_0362_0FC2A90F93B1E690"/>
               <hi>right</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> and to produce <hi>wrong and injury,</hi> the application is certainly wrongful: in ſuch caſe, the true uſe and meaning of the rule is <hi>miſtaken</hi> or <hi>perverted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All laws of every country are ſo capable of application to caſes which are out of their reaſon, that a Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> makes a part of every judiciary ſyſtem; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and duty of which is to <hi>control and ſoften</hi> the <hi>extreme rigor</hi> of the law; and when any ſtatute or other rule is of ſo high authority that the powers of the court, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend far enough to give relief, application is and ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be made to the <hi>ſupreme authority, which is ever the ſupreme chancery of the State,</hi> to <hi>repeal</hi> ſuch law, or <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>limit</hi> its true meaning, and <hi>correct</hi> the errors and wrongs of it.</p>
            <p>Now to apply the foregoing poſition (which certainly no man will controvert) to the caſe before us—The opinion in diſpute, 'that the ſale of a certificate transfers the whole debt certified, to the purchaſer, by the <hi>common rule of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments,' cannot be true,</hi> becauſe this would neceſſarily involve and imply <hi>great wrong</hi> and <hi>injuſtice,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> it would take away the <hi>rewards due to the merits</hi> and <hi>earnings</hi> of our moſt meritorious citizens, and give the monies <hi>due to them</hi> to <hi>another claſs</hi> of people, who are not entitled to any of it <hi>by any kind of valuable conſiderations, merits,</hi> or <hi>earnings</hi> whatever, <hi>i. e.</hi> it would cut the original public creditors, who, by their merits and ſervices, <hi>ſupported the war and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their country,</hi> off from the <hi>rewards,</hi> the <hi>pay,</hi> the <hi>hire</hi> due to them, and <hi>give the ſame to the ſpeculators,</hi> who never <hi>ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>ſaved</hi> the country, and to whom <hi>we owe</hi> nothing.</p>
            <p>This takes the <hi>public money to an immenſe amount,</hi> from a vaſt number of moſt deſerving citizens, ſcattered thro' eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the Empire, who have <hi>dearly and moſt virtuouſly earned</hi> it, and have <hi>never been paid,</hi> and many of whom, with their families, for want of their pay, are now ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>pangs of ruin and extreme diſtreſs,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> ſuffer <hi>great</hi> inconvenience and diſappointment; I ſay, from theſe worthy, unhappy objects it takes the <hi>public money due to their earnings,</hi> and gives it to <hi>ſpeculators,</hi> who have never <hi>earned any of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="unknown:023972_0363_0FC2A910F9C7B7B0"/>
Theſe effects are unavoidable. Turn, and twiſt, and cook the matter into all ſhapes poſſible, and theſe effects will be found. 'They muſt and will exiſt, if that plan is carried into effect; the great injuſtice of which ſtrikes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one with a force which the mind cannot reſiſt. No man ever adopted that plan, but he found the <hi>groſs, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, final injuſtice</hi> of it a great difficulty, <hi>hard to be got over;</hi> and this final injuſtice proves as plainly that the plan which involves it, is <hi>wrong,</hi> as that any effect indicates the nature of its cauſe, or that that which <hi>does or works wrong,</hi> is <hi>wrong:</hi> of courſe, there is an <hi>error in the matter</hi> ſo very groſs and important as to be <hi>fatal in ſociety.</hi> Society can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt, if the laws of it will not ſecure <hi>to the laborer his hire,</hi> or to the <hi>virtuous the rewards of his virtue,</hi> or to the <hi>induſtrious the fruits of his induſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, the facts under that plan ſtand glaring thus: the original creditors claim their pay by <hi>ſolemn, public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> by <hi>dear earnings,</hi> and <hi>moſt virtuous merits;</hi> they have <hi>not been paid;</hi> the <hi>money due</hi> to them is carved out of the <hi>labors of the nation,</hi> in order to <hi>pay them;</hi> they can get <hi>none of it,</hi> are finally <hi>cut off from it,</hi> and the <hi>ſpeculators</hi> are to <hi>get it all,</hi> without the leaſt <hi>claim</hi> of <hi>merit, ſervices,</hi> or <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration paid</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Theſe facts muſt be either <hi>diſproved</hi> or <hi>avoided</hi> (which cannot be; they are of the moſt public <hi>notoriety</hi>) or the <hi>abſurdities</hi> and <hi>injuries</hi> reſulting from them muſt be <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi> and <hi>digeſted</hi> (Good Heaven! what throats and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs men muſt have to do this!) or the <hi>plan</hi> muſt be <hi>given up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many people puzzle themſelves to find where the error or wrong lies: ſome ſay, <hi>in the breach of the public faith;</hi> ſome ſay, <hi>in the original iſſuing the negotiable certificates;</hi> others ſay, <hi>in the folly of the ſeller, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> but I ſhould think it very eaſy to ſee that the error lies in ſuppoſing that <hi>property can be transferred by implication,</hi> without any <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the ſeller, and without any <hi>valuable conſideration</hi> paid for it.</p>
            <p>But it matters little <hi>where</hi> the error or wrong lies; it is quite enough to know that <hi>it really exiſts,</hi> and will <hi>produce</hi>
               <pb n="357" facs="unknown:023972_0364_0FC2A912CC41AE18"/>
               <hi>its baneful effects,</hi> and is of ſuch <hi>magnitude</hi> as to affect the <hi>eſſential intereſts of the nation,</hi> and will do ſo for <hi>ages to come;</hi> and, therefore, as ſoon as the error is diſcovered, it ought immediately to be <hi>corrected or remedied:</hi> the <hi>national ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, peace,</hi> and <hi>proſperity</hi> require this.</p>
            <p>If we <hi>ſow</hi> all over the nation <hi>errors and wrongs,</hi> they may be <hi>unnoticed</hi> at firſt, but will ſoon <hi>ſpring up</hi> and <hi>grow</hi> into a <hi>foreſt of chagrin</hi> and <hi>diſcontent,</hi> of <hi>wretchedneſs</hi> and <hi>ruin.</hi> Nothing can give peace and eſtabliſhment to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, equal to <hi>'judgment</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> running down its ſtreets, and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> overflowing it.'</p>
            <p>It is not uncommon for men of <hi>lively genius</hi> and <hi>eager reaſonings,</hi> and perhaps <hi>honeſty</hi> too, to purſue their <hi>fine-ſpun arguments</hi> into concluſions that meet <hi>obſtinate facts,</hi> which, like an impregnable <hi>wall,</hi> muſt and will ſtop their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; but if <hi>their obſtinacy</hi> happens to be equal to that of the <hi>wall,</hi> they will not be willing to turn about, or even ſtop, but will go on and beat and bruſe their heads till their ſkulls are broken, and ſome <hi>crevice</hi> is opened, thro' which their <hi>chimerical ideas can fly out;</hi> then, indeed, they will ſoften into <hi>calmneſs</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> and grow wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hearken to ſome plan that is <hi>admiſſible by the hard facts which ſtand round them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I heard once of a doctor who was called to a ſick pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; he felt his pulſe, ſoon thought he found his diſorder, and preſcribed a doſe <hi>which killed him.</hi> When the doctor was told his patient was <hi>dead;</hi> he anſwered with ſome emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he had <hi>no buſineſs to die;</hi> for he could demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate by <hi>the moſt approved rules of phyſic and medicine,</hi> that he ought not only to have <hi>lived,</hi> but to have <hi>got well</hi> by this time.</p>
            <p>Now, if you pleaſe, we will ſeriouſly compare <hi>this plan</hi> in queſtion with <hi>mine,</hi> which is compriſed in my firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>to debit the original creditors with the certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates they received,</hi> at the <hi>value</hi> or <hi>exchange</hi> they bore at the <hi>time of their dates,</hi> and to pay the <hi>reſidue</hi> of the balance due to them with intereſt, and to pay the certificates at the ſame value or their current exchange (as the caſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire) to the <hi>bearers of them,</hi> whether <hi>original holders</hi> or

               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>which of them</hi> will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally operate by way of <hi>moſt juſtice</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> and <hi>leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> and <hi>wrong?</hi> for no practicable plan that can be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, every one will allow, will operate by way of <hi>perfect right</hi> and <hi>no wrong at all;</hi> no public plan that ever was adopted ever came or can come up to <hi>this degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all that <hi>is</hi> or <hi>can be in the power</hi> of human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and weakneſs is to adopt that plan, which, in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, naturally produces <hi>moſt right</hi> and <hi>leaſt wrong.</hi> By this <hi>criterion</hi> then we will judge of the two plans before us, which <hi>criterion</hi> is (all <hi>ſubtilties</hi> of reaſoning aſide) the only <hi>ſafe one</hi> which is <hi>practicable</hi> within the extent of human power.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The plan I <hi>oppoſe</hi> pays the immenſe ſum of public mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney given by the nation purpoſely to <hi>reward the ſaviours</hi> of their country, pays this money, I ſay, to the <hi>ſpeculators,</hi> who never <hi>earned any of it,</hi> who do not pretend to found their claim to it on any <hi>merits,</hi> or <hi>ſervices,</hi> or <hi>valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,</hi> which they ever rendered to the <hi>nation</hi> or <hi>any body elſe,</hi> but demand the compenſations and rewards <hi>due to the original creditors,</hi> without <hi>pretending</hi> to have paid any <hi>valuable conſideration</hi> therefor to them; and at the ſame time, the plan denies thoſe immenſe rewards to thoſe <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy citizens,</hi> who found their claim thereto on <hi>the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred contract of Congreſs</hi> to them, under <hi>ſanction</hi> of the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic faith,</hi> which <hi>binds the country "by the laws of</hi> GOD <hi>and man;"</hi> on the moſt <hi>punctual fulfilment</hi> of ſaid contract, on <hi>their part;</hi> and on <hi>their great virtue and merit,</hi> in <hi>ſaving their country</hi> in its moſt <hi>dreadful danger</hi> and <hi>diſtreſs:</hi> if any body thinks there is any <hi>honor, juſtice,</hi> or <hi>right</hi> in this plan, let him look for it, and I believe he will eaſily find all that <hi>is there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The plan I <hi>propoſe</hi> is, to <hi>debit the original creditors</hi> with all the <hi>certificates they received,</hi> at <hi>their current value</hi> at the time of their <hi>dates,</hi> and pay the <hi>remaining balance</hi> due to them <hi>with intereſt;</hi> and to redeem the <hi>certificates</hi> by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>bearer,</hi> let him be either <hi>original holder</hi> or <hi>alienee,</hi>
               <pb n="359" facs="unknown:023972_0366_0FC2A923CA2D1A40"/>
at the <hi>ſame rate,</hi> or at their <hi>current exchange</hi> at the time of redemption, as the caſe may require.</p>
            <p>This plan pays the immenſe public monies to the people who <hi>earned</hi> them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to thoſe who, by ſolemn, <hi>public contract,</hi> and by their <hi>real ſupplies</hi> and <hi>ſervices</hi> rendered as the <hi>conditions</hi> of that contract on <hi>their part,</hi> are moſt <hi>juſtly</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantially entitled</hi> to them; and, at the ſame time, pays to the <hi>ſpeculators</hi> the <hi>proper value</hi> of the certificates which they have purchaſed.</p>
            <p>This plan, I think, will do the <hi>moſt general juſtice</hi> to the citizens at large, which can be done by imperfect human wiſdom, in the preſent circumſtances of the matter. This will <hi>place</hi> the public monies <hi>where they belong,</hi> will give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one <hi>his due,</hi> and <hi>no more than his due.</hi> This will bring, on one ſide, <hi>wrong and ruinous diſtreſs on nobody;</hi> nor will it, on the other, heap <hi>unmerited, unearned fortunes on any body.</hi> This will, <hi>in the end, do manifeſt juſtice and right to every one.</hi> This ought ever to be our goal, whatever <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, doubt,</hi> and <hi>darkneſs</hi> may ariſe from the chaos of <hi>ſubtile arguments, dexterity</hi> of management, and <hi>artful diſguiſing</hi> and <hi>twiſting of facts,</hi> thro' which we may be forced to make our way in our paſſage on to this realm of <hi>juſtice, truth, and light:</hi> for whatever dark and gloomy paſſages we may have occaſion to paſs thro', in the deliberation and adjuſtment of human concerns and diſputes, <hi>final juſtice</hi> and <hi>right</hi> ought ever to be the ſtar that <hi>directs</hi> our ſteps, and which will certainly <hi>guide</hi> us to the <hi>rightful iſſue</hi> at laſt.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee that this plan will bear hard on more than <hi>two</hi> ſorts or deſcriptions of men, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Such public creditors who have <hi>real merits</hi> and <hi>juſt right</hi> to a claim, but, by ſome means, may not be able to <hi>prove</hi> their right; and probably, among the infinite number of real public creditors, there may be <hi>ſome</hi> of this ſort, and perhaps <hi>many,</hi> who muſt ſuffer without remedy; for what <hi>cannot be proved,</hi> cannot be <hi>admitted</hi> in any court in the world; but then it is to be noted, that the <hi>plan I oppoſe</hi> leaves theſe ſufferers as <hi>much unprovided for,</hi> and as much <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and without remedy,</hi> as the plan I <hi>propoſe,</hi> and, of

The ſecond ſort of men who may think my plan impoſes hardſhip on them, are ſuch ſpeculators as have purchaſed their certificates at a <hi>higher exchange</hi> than that at which I propoſe to redeem them; but this loſs or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (if it is any) is and always muſt be <hi>incident</hi> to ſuch ſpeculations, which, at beſt, are but <hi>games at hazard,</hi> alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> barely <hi>tolerable,</hi> and often very <hi>hurtful</hi> to the public: I do not, therefore, conceive their loſs or gain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves any conſideration in the public deliberations or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of this great queſtion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>what rate or ſcale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> of certificates, <hi>Continental money, or any other public paper,</hi> does the <hi>general juſtice,</hi> and <hi>national honor,</hi> and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our country, <hi>require?</hi> But if we were to allow that the loſſes and hardſhips of theſe men were <hi>real</hi> and <hi>pitiful,</hi> they bear not the <hi>leaſt proportion</hi> to the infinite <hi>hardſhip</hi> and <hi>ruinous diſtreſſes,</hi> to which the plan I oppoſe ſubjects countleſs <hi>thouſands</hi> of our moſt <hi>deſerving</hi> citizens; even if the calculation is made on either the <hi>numbers, amount of loſs,</hi> or the <hi>merits,</hi> of the ſufferers.</p>
            <p>If this alternative cannot be avoided, it can admit no doubt but the <hi>leſſer</hi> muſt yield to the <hi>greater;</hi> for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a leſs evil to incur the loſs of a <hi>penny</hi> than a <hi>pound,</hi> or even to do <hi>injuſtice</hi> to <hi>one</hi> man than to a <hi>thouſand;</hi> and of two evils we ought to chooſe the leaſt.</p>
            <p>But the morality of the two plans, <hi>i. e.</hi> the degree of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> or of <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>wrong,</hi> which their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will naturally produce, is not the only thing which ought to govern our choice of them; there is a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>difference</hi> both of <hi>facility of collection</hi> and <hi>utility of payment,</hi> under them. For,</p>
            <p>I. Under the plan I propoſe, the public money paid will be <hi>ſcattered</hi> over the <hi>whole nation,</hi> thro' every part where the real public creditors will be found; and the money ſo paid will,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Do an act of <hi>juſtice</hi> long due to the receiver:</p>
            <p n="2">2. Will increaſe the <hi>buſineſs</hi> of the country; as moſt of the creditors will be thereby enabled to go into or increaſe
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:023972_0368_0FC2A92C0E277D48"/>
their buſineſs, who are now <hi>reſtrained</hi> and <hi>held back,</hi> thro' want of their ſtock withheld from them by the public.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This money will immediately ſpread thro' every part of the nation, and cauſe a great increaſe of <hi>circulation,</hi> which will give <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>facility</hi> to the general induſtry and wealth of our people at large; and as the taxes are all ultimately paid by the conſumers, who are ſpread over every part of the country,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>facility of collection</hi> of the ſecond tax will grow out of the <hi>operation of the firſt,</hi> as the payments will be made more <hi>eaſy</hi> and <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> thereby; for the people will naturally grow <hi>contented</hi> under a tax, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>advantages ariſing</hi> out of the <hi>increaſed circulation</hi> of caſh produced by it, enough to compenſate the <hi>burden</hi> of the tax.</p>
            <p>II. But under the plan I oppoſe, the caſe will be <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly otherwiſe;</hi> for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. One <hi>third</hi> of the ſpeculators are ſuppoſed to be <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,</hi> and, of courſe, their third of the money paid (ſay, 7 or 8,000,000 of dollars) will be <hi>ſent</hi> directly <hi>out of the country, never to return</hi> again; <hi>this drain</hi> of caſh by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual intereſt (for nobody thinks of paying the principal) when added to <hi>that</hi> of the foreign debt, is enough (if we had no other drains) to keep the country <hi>poor, diſtreſſed,</hi> and <hi>behind hand</hi> for ages to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other two-thirds paid to the ſpeculators here, will not be ſcattered over the country, and increaſe the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral circulation,</hi> but will be <hi>accumulated in few hands,</hi> moſt of which, according to the common courſe of human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, will be applied to make and ſupport <hi>nurſeries of vice, luxury, pride, vanity, diſſipation,</hi> and <hi>bad example:</hi> for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes obtained by <hi>ſudden</hi> acquirement, without any <hi>merits</hi> or <hi>earnings,</hi> are uſually ſpent in this way; and if a few of them ſhould happen to employ their money prudently, it will <hi>ſo far</hi> contribute to <hi>accumulating the national wealth into few hands,</hi> which is one of the worſt things that can happen to a nation.</p>
            <p>III. Another difference of the operation of the two plans will have great effect on the <hi>revenue.</hi> When the
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:023972_0369_0FC2A936EC5D8F28"/>
public money is paid for purpoſes of <hi>acknowledged juſtice, utility,</hi> and <hi>general advantage,</hi> the payment of taxes will be made without <hi>murmur,</hi> and the collection, of courſe, will be <hi>eaſy</hi> and <hi>without diſturbance.</hi> Paying to the original cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors the <hi>hire of their labors,</hi> the <hi>debt</hi> due to them for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions that <hi>ſaved their country,</hi> is a method of employing the public money of moſt <hi>acknowledged propriety</hi> thro' the nation; but the payment of ſpeculators is not ſo popular; it is <hi>hard</hi> for people to ſee the fruits of their labor taken from them, and given to ſpeculators who never earned any of it.</p>
            <p>This will naturally make the taxes <hi>odious;</hi> and, of courſe, the <hi>burden</hi> of the <hi>old</hi> taxes, the <hi>inſtituting of new ones,</hi> and the <hi>collection of both,</hi> will ſoon become objects of general <hi>uneaſineſs, murmur,</hi> and <hi>ill-humor;</hi> which, when <hi>general,</hi> will be eaſily blowed up into <hi>tumults, inſurrections,</hi> and a general <hi>derangement</hi> of the peace and political order of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; ſmuggling and other avoidances of the taxes may not be the moſt alarming of theſe national frets.</p>
            <p>In a nation thus tempered, a few m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of ſpirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, who may happen to be <hi>diſguſted, ſoured with male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,</hi> and <hi>fired with thirſt of revenge,</hi> may do infinite miſchief.</p>
            <p>Without the aid of any ſuch incendiaries, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond a doubt, that any tax to <hi>pay the ſpeculators</hi> will ſit <hi>very uneaſy</hi> on the moſt <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> citizens that can be found among us.</p>
            <p>I was lately in converſation with a gentleman of <hi>great fortune,</hi> and noted for a very <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>peaceful temper,</hi> who told me he had juſt been paying an impoſt of about 30 dollars for wines he imported for his own uſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <q>had it been to pay <hi>our ſoldiers</hi> and <hi>other ſupporters of the war,</hi> I ſhould not have begrudged it, had it been <hi>three times</hi> as much; but the thought that it muſt <hi>go to the idle ſpeculators,</hi> makes my <hi>blood boil</hi> in my veins:</q>—and I conceive, every honeſt <hi>American</hi> that earns his own money, feels juſt ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Taxes</hi> are ever ranked among the moſt <hi>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hy articles of civil police,</hi> and require very <hi>delicate</hi> management; and our
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:023972_0370_0FC2A93C8A903170"/>
revenue-ſyſtem is <hi>very young, tender,</hi> and not ripened enough into <hi>firm, general habit;</hi> and, tho' in its infancy, it is preſſed with a much <hi>heavier load</hi> than the country ever felt before; I therefore conclude, that any plan that <hi>tends to embroil the finances,</hi> and furniſh <hi>objections</hi> and <hi>murmurs</hi> againſt the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,</hi> ought to be <hi>reprobated</hi> as the moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> meaſure that can be deviſed.</p>
            <p>IV. There is another objection to the plan I <hi>oppoſe,</hi> which I conſider very great, and which, I think, is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the one I <hi>propoſe,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> it encourages and ſupports <hi>idle and hurtful arts and contrivances</hi> to procure <hi>fortunes</hi> by <hi>dexterity</hi> and <hi>ſleight of hand,</hi> rather than by the <hi>old, painful methods of induſtry, economy,</hi> and <hi>care.</hi> Theſe ſpeculators all have for their <hi>object,</hi> the <hi>acquirement</hi> of wealth without <hi>earning</hi> it, <hi>i. e.</hi> of getting the <hi>hire</hi> and <hi>rewards</hi> due to the <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>merits of another,</hi> into their own <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, without any retribution:</hi> this therefore is, in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and principle, wrongful; and people of this caſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſpend their <hi>ſtock and time</hi> in theſe purſuits, which, otherwiſe, they would employ in <hi>uſeful occupations</hi> of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, manufactures, or trade; and, of courſe, ſo much good <hi>ſtock and time is loſt</hi> to the public.</p>
            <p>I think, this ſort of ſpeculations ought not to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>merely uſeleſs,</hi> but <hi>hurtful alſo,</hi> and, therefore, ought by no means to be <hi>encouraged and ſupported</hi> by any meaſures of government; eſpecially when their <hi>exceſs</hi> has been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch an <hi>enormous pitch,</hi> as to draw after it the <hi>ruinous conſequences</hi> deſcribed above, and obvious to every diſcerning eye.</p>
            <p>V. My next objection to the plan I oppoſe, ariſes from <hi>the general ſtate of the finances of the nation,</hi> which I beg leave to introduce, with ſome previous obſervations by way of preface.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am not <hi>alarmed at a heavy national debt;</hi> much leſs do I apprehend any <hi>deſtruction</hi> or <hi>ruin</hi> from it, if not too enormous; nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Am I under <hi>any doubt or diffidence</hi> of either the <hi>ſtrength</hi> or <hi>patience</hi> of our people to bear it, if the following <hi>limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi> of it are attended to:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="unknown:023972_0371_0FC2A94C46824668"/>
1ſt. If the <hi>debt contracted,</hi> or the public monies to be paid, are for <hi>neceſſary public purpoſes, i. e.</hi> to ſupport and maintain the <hi>real juſtice, honor, ſafety, convenience,</hi> and <hi>well-being</hi> of the nation, <hi>e. g.</hi> to pay the civil liſt and <hi>juſt</hi> debts, for defence againſt enemies or pirates, for public roads, inland navigation, encouragement of gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arts, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2d. That the debt or annual demand for money does not <hi>exceed</hi> the <hi>product of an impoſt on imported luxuries,</hi> no higher than is neceſſary to <hi>reduce uſeleſs, luxurious,</hi> and <hi>hurtful conſumptions</hi> down to that <hi>moderation</hi> that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the <hi>health, morality,</hi> and <hi>wealth</hi> of our people; and,</p>
            <p>3d. That the money collected by the tax ſhall be ſo paid out, that it may revert in its circulation to, and diffuſe it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf over, the <hi>ſame States and places out of which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſo collected was originally drawn, i. e.</hi> that the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or payments of the money raiſed by the tax, ſhall be <hi>ſo made,</hi> that it ſhall revert to and circulate thro' the <hi>ſame countries</hi> and <hi>places that paid it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under theſe limitations and reſtrictions, <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly</hi> adhered to, no national debt can <hi>hurt,</hi> much leſs <hi>ruin,</hi> a nation; it would, in my opinion, operate like a ſumptuary law, and would be rather an <hi>advantage</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> on the whole, than a <hi>detriment.</hi> But this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I ſhould chooſe to have the calculations made ſo, that the <hi>annual incomes</hi> might a <hi>little exceed</hi> the <hi>expenditures,</hi> that there might be a <hi>ſmall ſurplus</hi> left to ſupport ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, or contingencies, or, as the country proverb is, that ſomething might be laid up for a rainy day; but I would not wiſh to have ſuch ſurplus <hi>very great,</hi> for if it was ſo, I ſhould expect that moſt adminiſtrations would find <hi>plenty of contingencies,</hi> enough to conſume it all—I will now go on to conſider the preſent ſtate of the public debt, as it is exhibited in eſtimates calculated up to the laſt of the year 1790.</p>
            <p>The <hi>certificates</hi> of all ſorts, now in circulation and to be provided for, amount, by the public eſtimates, <hi>principal,</hi> to 27,000,000 <hi>dollars: intereſt</hi> due laſt of the year 1790, to 13,000,000; whole amount, 40,000,000 <hi>dollars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="unknown:023972_0372_0FC2A94CF457E700"/>
By a <hi>moderate</hi> eſtimate, and much <hi>below</hi> what is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed to be the real fact, <hi>three-fourths</hi> of theſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> 30,000,000 <hi>dollars,</hi> are <hi>in the hands of the ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;</hi> the original value of which, when iſſued by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, at an average of 2<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> in the pound, amounts to 3,750,000 dollars; this ſum, of courſe, was paid by the ſpeculators to the real creditors, at the firſt purchaſe of them, and, therefore, ought to be placed to the debit of their account; the remainder of the 30,000,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 26,250,000 is the clear gain of the ſpeculators, which they never <hi>paid any thing for,</hi> either to the nation, to the original creditors, or to any body elſe; therefore, that ſum, having never been paid by any body, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains due to the original creditors, and ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, and, of courſe, ought to be added to the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the national debt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 26,250,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>The national debt then, in round numbers (for my cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation does not require accuracy enough to make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inſert the broken or fractional quantities) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional debt, I ſay, as calculated up to the end of the year 1790, will then ſtand, in round numbers, nearly as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

               <pb n="367" facs="unknown:023972_0374_0FC2A95001EA0168"/>
I do not at preſent advert to any but the following queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that can ariſe on this ſtatement of the public debt and the exiſting revenue.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion to be conſidered is,—whether this ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>ideal</hi> only, or <hi>really true</hi> and grounded on <hi>ſuch facts as will ſupport it?</hi> For my part, I have not any particular knowledge of the facts on which it is grounded, and, of courſe, do not object to any of it, except that part which <hi>adopts the clear gains of the ſpeculators</hi> into the public debt, and <hi>loads</hi> the nation with the <hi>burden of</hi> 26,000,000 <hi>dollars</hi> to pay them, and <hi>of</hi> 800,000 <hi>more,</hi> to raiſe the old Continental money out of the <hi>grave</hi> where it has quietly <hi>ſlept</hi> more than ſeven years.</p>
            <p>The ſecond queſtion which offers itſelf is,—whether any part of the public debt, included in the above ſtatement, can be <hi>reduced, docked off,</hi> or <hi>thrown out?</hi> There are but two items which, I conceive, can admit a doubt in this queſtion:</p>
            <p>The firſt is,—<hi>the</hi> 26,000,000 <hi>dollars</hi> appropriated to the payment of the <hi>clear gains</hi> of the ſpeculators. This, I think, ought to be <hi>rejected</hi> for all the reaſons aſſigned above.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is,—the balance of the, ſame ſum due to the original creditors. I think (whatever may be decided as to <hi>paying</hi> or <hi>rejecting</hi> the clear gains of the ſpeculators) this item of the ſtatement ought <hi>to be admitted and paid,</hi> for all the reaſons above urged, and this additional one, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>character</hi> of the <hi>nation abroad</hi> for <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>honor,</hi> requires this.</p>
            <p>For let us ſuppoſe that one of our embaſſadors at a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign court ſhould, in ſome grand circle, happen to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue a little on the <hi>juſtice, honor,</hi> political conſtitution, ſtrength, riches, and bleſſings of his country, and ſome grave man, with much meaning in his countenance, ſhould reply to him—<q>Sir, all you ſay of the <hi>bleſſings</hi> of your country, may be true for any thing I know; but it ſeems to me, the <hi>juſtice and honor of it are not quite ſo clear,</hi> for I think I have heard that your Congreſs <hi>refuſed to pay to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe noble and patriotic citizens,</hi> who, with their <hi>blood</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="unknown:023972_0375_0FC2A95175CAA910"/>
and <hi>travail, purchaſed</hi> for you <hi>all theſe bleſſings</hi> you beaſt of, the <hi>rewards,</hi> the <hi>ſimple hire</hi> due to them by the moſt <hi>ſacred, public contract</hi> that could be made, and <hi>faithfully fulfilled on their part,</hi> by exertions and ſervices, the moſt <hi>noble, arduous, painful,</hi> and <hi>perſevering,</hi> of which we have any example in hiſtory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, in ſuch a caſe, you would not wiſh to ſee our embaſſador <hi>daſhed out of countenance, pocket the affront,</hi> and <hi>ſlink into a corner:</hi> but if you think ſome reply neceſſary to <hi>bring him off,</hi> and as he may not have one ready cut and dried at hand, I wiſh any of you who oppoſe this payment, would make a <hi>ſuitable one for him,</hi> that he may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed at all points to defend the <hi>honor</hi> of this country, whenever it may be <hi>inſulted or attacked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Third queſtion. As the preſent revenue amounts to leſs than two-fifths of the yearly expenditures, according to the above ſtatement, the next queſtion is,—can the <hi>revenues be increaſed up to the amount of the neceſſary annual expenditures? i. e.</hi> can the <hi>duties</hi> or <hi>taxes</hi> be <hi>raiſed</hi> up to <hi>three-fifths higher</hi> than they <hi>now are?</hi> I conceive this will be <hi>difficult</hi> in the <hi>aſſeſſment,</hi> and more ſo in the <hi>collection;</hi> indeed, it appears to me <hi>totally impracticable,</hi> as things ſtand at preſent; and the idea of <hi>deferring</hi> payment, and <hi>loading</hi> the nation with an inſtalment to be paid <hi>ten years hence,</hi> brings to my mind a young rake, who bought a horſe, and agreed to pay for it <hi>"at the next election,"</hi> but ſurreptitiouſly drew the note payable <hi>"at the reſurrection;"</hi> the creditor applied for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the rake plead that the time was not come; on which the creditor applied to his <hi>father,</hi> who was a grave, ſerious man; he called his ſon, and aſked why he did not pay the debt; the ſon replied, that it was not yet due, as he would ſee by the note; the father replied, <q>Ah! young man, pay the debt inſtantly; I fear, at the rate you go on, you will have enough to anſwer for <hi>at the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> without this note againſt you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Fourth queſtion. If the revenue is not adequate to full payment, ought not the <hi>actual payments</hi> to be made by <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends,</hi> payable to every creditor in <hi>equal proportions</hi> of the debt due? In ſuch caſe, to pay <hi>part</hi> of the creditors <hi>half</hi>
               <pb n="369" facs="unknown:023972_0376_0FC2A9699210BD98"/>
               <hi>or two-thirds</hi> of their demand, and <hi>nothing</hi> to the <hi>reſt,</hi> is contrary to the moſt received <hi>rule of diſtributive juſtice,</hi> in all caſes of private <hi>bankruptcies</hi> or <hi>ſtoppages of payment,</hi> and I can ſee no reaſon why the ſame rule ſhould not extend to the <hi>deficiencies</hi> of the <hi>public revenue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifth queſtion. If the public revenues are deficient, ought <hi>any creditor at all to be paid any thing,</hi> till the whole debt is <hi>liquidated</hi> and reduced to a <hi>certainty,</hi> without which it is impoſſible to make the requiſite dividends? A <hi>negative</hi> anſwer to this queſtion ſeems to be ſo clearly juſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that I cannot conceive that it will be diſputed.</p>
            <p>But after all, if the firſt propoſition of my plan above urged cannot be admitted, and the <hi>final deciſion</hi> muſt be, that the original creditors who have <hi>ſold</hi> their certificates, have, by the ſale, <hi>extinguiſhed their demand</hi> for any <hi>further</hi> payment; that no evidence of the debt can be admitted, but certificates; and <hi>no payment</hi> of the debt certified in them, can be allowed and made to any body but the <hi>holders</hi> of them (all which appears to me to be ſtrange doctrine) I beg leave, if this muſt be the caſe, to introduce my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That all <hi>original holders</hi> of certificates <hi>be paid the full no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal value of their certificates, principal and intereſt;</hi> and that all <hi>alienated certificates</hi> be paid to the <hi>bearer</hi> at the <hi>rate, value or current exchange they had at their dates,</hi> or at the <hi>time of redemption,</hi> as the caſe may require, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo that no certificate ſhall be redeemed at <hi>a higher value or exchange than it bore at the time of its date,</hi> or (if, after its date, it depreciated) at no <hi>higher exchange</hi> than ſhall be its <hi>current value</hi> at the <hi>time</hi> of redemption; for the public never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any <hi>valuable conſideration for it, more than its value</hi> at the time of its <hi>date,</hi> and therefore never ought to pay <hi>any more to redeem it;</hi> but if it has <hi>depreciated</hi> thro' the courſe of its currency or circulation, the <hi>public</hi> has paid that <hi>depreciation once already,</hi> for it operates by way of <hi>tax on the innumerable hands</hi> in which it depreciated, <hi>i. e.</hi> on the <hi>public,</hi> thro' which it circulated; and there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the <hi>public</hi> ſhould pay the <hi>ſame loſs over again;</hi> and if they ſhould do this, it would be no <hi>reparation</hi> to the <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer;</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="unknown:023972_0377_0FC2A96B509C6930"/>
for, at the time of doing this, the certificate would not be in the <hi>ſame hands which ſuffered by the depreciation?</hi> but this argument is more fully diſcuſſed in the preceding Eſſays, where the doctrine of <hi>appreciation</hi> and <hi>depreciation</hi> is often called up and conſidered.</p>
            <p>The certificates are <hi>evidence</hi> of the debt certified, in the hands of the <hi>original holder,</hi> and my propoſition is, to pay it to him: but in the <hi>hands of the alienee</hi> it carries not any <hi>ſuch evidence,</hi> for it is plain enough, both in <hi>fact</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> that, by the ſale of the certificate, nothing more was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>transferred by the ſeller,</hi> or <hi>expected</hi> or <hi>paid for by the purchaſer,</hi> than the <hi>chance</hi> or <hi>right</hi> of receiving ſuch <hi>ſum</hi> or <hi>value</hi> for it, as the Congreſs ſhould <hi>ſet</hi> or <hi>fix</hi> as the <hi>price</hi> or <hi>exchange</hi> at which it ſhould be <hi>finally redeemed:</hi> and this <hi>rate</hi> or <hi>ſcale</hi> of redemption ought to be ſet or eſtimated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt regard to the <hi>loſs</hi> or <hi>gain</hi> of the ſpeculators; but on <hi>principles of general juſtice</hi> and <hi>right only, i. e.</hi> in ſuch manner as will do <hi>moſt right</hi> and <hi>leaſt wrong, i. e.</hi> in ſuch manner, that <hi>no deſcription</hi> of citizens ſhould be <hi>more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited or hurt,</hi> or made <hi>richer</hi> or <hi>poorer,</hi> by it, than <hi>another;</hi> for all national <hi>diſtributions</hi> of juſtice, all public <hi>inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>deciſions</hi> whatever, ought always to be ſo made, that both the <hi>burdens</hi> and <hi>benefits</hi> of them may fall <hi>equably</hi> on all, and not lie <hi>more heavily</hi> or <hi>more beneficially</hi> on <hi>one</hi> than <hi>another, i. e.</hi> ſo that every one ſhall participate his <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>proportionable ſhare</hi> both of the <hi>burden</hi> and <hi>benefit</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>The rate or ſcale of redemption, thus eſtimated and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will manifeſtly pay to the ſpeculator all that he has right to receive, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that he ever bought or paid for; and if the overplus may not be paid to the original credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, let it be retained in the treaſury, and be paid to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body; for I cannot ſee the uſe of paying it at all, where it is not due.</p>
            <p>This propoſition (which I advanced five years ago in my <hi>Seventh Eſſay on Finance)</hi> gave riſe to the great queſtion of <hi>diſcrimination</hi> between <hi>original holders</hi> and <hi>purchaſers</hi> of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, and has been ſo fully diſcuſſed, that little need be added in this Review of the Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="371" facs="unknown:023972_0378_0FC2A96C93937980"/>
Perhaps it may be enough to obſerve, that moſt of the <hi>oppoſers</hi> of the propoſition acknowledge the <hi>juſtice</hi> of it, but object to it at <hi>impracticable.</hi> But I can ſee very little weight in the objection; every one who claims as an <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> holder, muſt <hi>diſcriminate himſelf, i. e.</hi> the <hi>proof will lie on him</hi> that he is <hi>ſuch.</hi> I ſhould ſuppoſe, that his <hi>name</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the certificate, and his <hi>affidavit</hi> that he has never <hi>alienated</hi> it, would be ſufficient. If the certificate was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out for <hi>his benefit</hi> in the <hi>name</hi> of another (as perhaps has been often done) the <hi>balance due on the public books,</hi> and, the certificate <hi>debited</hi> to him, with his own <hi>affidavit,</hi> would make the matter clear enough; beſides, the <hi>negotiator</hi> of ſuch a matter would be a good witneſs.</p>
            <p>There is no more danger of <hi>perjuries</hi> in this caſe, than there is in oaths to original entries on <hi>books of accounts,</hi> to <hi>ſignatures, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> After all, there can be but very few caſes, if any, where the plan I <hi>oppoſe</hi> can give any <hi>more</hi> or <hi>better remedy</hi> to creditors who have loſt their proofs, than the one I <hi>propoſe</hi> affords.</p>
            <p>My laſt propoſition is,—if neither of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned two can be admitted, that the <hi>original holder</hi> ſhall be <hi>firſt paid,</hi> and the <hi>ſpeculator laſt of all,</hi> if he muſt be <hi>paid at all.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe the debt of the <hi>original</hi> holder is founded on <hi>greater merits</hi> and <hi>real earnings</hi> than the other, and, therefore, ought to be conſidered as of a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>more worthy nature,</hi> and, of courſe, ought to be <hi>preferred</hi> in payment.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, I have <hi>no conception</hi> that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent arrangement of the public finances, <hi>i. e.</hi> of receipts and payments, is by any means <hi>adequate to the exigencies of the nation.</hi> I cannot form any idea, that our revenue either <hi>is or can be made ſufficient</hi> to ſupport the <hi>immenſe load</hi> of debt which lies upon it: nor can I conceive how any nation can exiſt without the <hi>utmoſt deficiencies, diſgra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>even bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy,</hi> where the drafts on the revenue ſo greatly exceed the annual incomes of it; can exiſt, I ſay, without running over head and ears into the horrible gulf, the unbounded chaos of derangement, which will draw into it every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable embarraſſment, not only of the public revenue,
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:023972_0379_0FC2A977D313F110"/>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> of the juſtice and honor of the nation, but which will alſo, by its neceſſary conſequence, involve every branch of buſineſs thro' the whole nation in diſappointment and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deferring payments to future time</hi> is but putting <hi>far away the evil day,</hi> and avoiding the pain of <hi>preſent preſſures,</hi> at the expenſe of <hi>future embarraſſment.</hi> The unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an over-loaded revenue will be a <hi>deficiency of the public payments, i. e.</hi> a <hi>failure</hi> of the <hi>public credit,</hi> and of the juſtice and honor of the nation.</p>
            <p>But in our own caſe, this is not <hi>all our calamity;</hi> for, under all this preſſure of taxes, we can derive little <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of our country, or even <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> from them: this immenſe <hi>gulf of debt</hi> ſwallows up all our <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,</hi> and is by no means <hi>ſatisfied with them all;</hi> it leaves us not a <hi>ſhilling</hi> fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>public roads, inland navigation, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of agriculture, manufactures,</hi> or <hi>genius</hi> of any ſort, or even for <hi>defence</hi> againſt <hi>enemies</hi> or <hi>pirates,</hi> in caſe of a war; all the navy of the nation is not ſufficient to ſuppreſs a <hi>pilot-boat,</hi> if it ſhould be armed and manned by <hi>pirates</hi> to <hi>inſult</hi> and <hi>infeſt</hi> our coaſts.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; our people have not the <hi>benefit</hi> of that <hi>increaſed circulation</hi> of caſh, which would ariſe from the heavy taxes they do pay, if the payments were made to creditors <hi>ſcattered over</hi> the nation, who would inſtantly circulate the money they received, among the <hi>ſame people</hi> from whom it had been <hi>collected;</hi> but our money goes to <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> or to ſuch <hi>accumulations,</hi> that it is carried off far beyond our reach for ever, after we have paid it in taxes.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is not poſſible that our nation ſhould continue even <hi>to exiſt</hi> in <hi>honor, eaſe,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> under <hi>theſe burdens;</hi> a <hi>penny</hi> can never pay a <hi>ſhilling,</hi> and a ſhilling due will ever be <hi>a debt,</hi> and a <hi>fretting one</hi> too, <hi>till it is paid.</hi> The nature of our calamity admits but two alternatives, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Either to <hi>reduce the debt</hi> by <hi>docking off ſome part</hi> of it, or to <hi>increaſe the revenue</hi> up to an amount ſufficient to pay it: the <hi>latter</hi> I take to be utterly <hi>impracticable</hi> and <hi>deſperate,</hi> as the matter now ſtands; the <hi>other,</hi> I think, might be done. The <hi>only part</hi> of the eſtimate of the national debt that is
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:023972_0380_0FC2A9794EB0E510"/>
not for the nation's <hi>benefit,</hi> is the 26,000,000 <hi>dollars</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to pay the <hi>clear profits</hi> of the ſpeculators. This, I think, might be <hi>ſpared out of the eſtimate,</hi> but as it is fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I think it cannot be well docked off without a REPEAL <hi>of the funding act,</hi> which I <hi>humbly wiſh may take place.</hi> I know there would be <hi>great difficulties</hi> in doing this, but I conceive there will be much greater difficulties in not doing it. I am confident, the act, when it begins to operate, will be found, in its nature, wrong and impracticable, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity will compel the reſcinding it ſooner or later, and it is much eaſier to correct a new error than an old one; it is more honorable to correct an error with readineſs of mind on firſt conviction, than to wait for the ſevere compulſions of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>But if the repeal of the act ſhould be thought improper, perhaps a ſupplement fixing a reaſonable rate or ſcale of exchange at which the certificates and Continental money ſhall be received into the new loan, might prove a very ſalutary amendment of it: and if I could believe that any thing leſs than the nation's <hi>well-being</hi> made this repeal or amendment neceſſary, I ſhould be ſilent about it.</p>
            <p>Any attempt to pay this vaſt ſum twice over, would draw conſequences the moſt deſtructive and ruinous that can be conceived; and if both cannot be paid, and we cannot avoid the alternative, I would prefer ſacrificing a demand which never <hi>originated</hi> in <hi>real merit or earnings,</hi> but receives its <hi>whole force</hi> from an <hi>extravagant implication</hi> of a <hi>meaning</hi> in words, which, by conſtruction of <hi>ſpeaker</hi> or <hi>hearer</hi> at the time of utterance, was <hi>never compriſed</hi> or <hi>conveyed</hi> in them; I ſay, I would prefer this to any <hi>violation</hi> of the <hi>ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract;</hi> the <hi>ſacred public vows, ſealed</hi> and <hi>plighted</hi> to the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> creditors, in the time of our country's <hi>utmoſt danger</hi> and <hi>deep diſtreſs,</hi> and to whoſe <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>painful fulfilment</hi> of that <hi>contract on their parts,</hi> we are <hi>indebted</hi> under GOD for <hi>our deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the firſt part of this alternative can be adopted, our deſperation may ceaſe, the great difficulty will diminiſh, partly becauſe a large and the moſt exceptionable part of the burden will be taken off, and partly becauſe what is
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:023972_0381_0FC2A97AC5E1A550"/>
left will be a debt of ſuch acknowledged and uncontroverted right, juſtice, and honor, as will give courage and force to our councils to aſſeſs, and our people to bear, ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of tax as will be neceſſary to ſupport it, and gradually to wipe it off.</p>
            <p>It is human to err, but it is the decided mark of ſtrong intellects and a generous temper, to acknowledge and correct an error on conviction; yet ſuch is the common weakneſs of the human mind, that error is often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with obſtinacy; thoſe who are weak enough to make miſtakes, are rarely wiſe enough to correct them; and the hard neceſſity which compels an amendment of an error, will not always produce an acknowledgment of it. The ſtability of public meaſures and deciſions ought to reſt on their rectitude and natural fitneſs, not on an obſtinacy that is blind to their faults. Every body acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that it is honorable and noble to own and correct an error, and that it is mean and baſe to perſiſt in one; yet moſt men feel a ſort of degrading ſhame, when they are called upon to correct their own miſtakes. I hope our public councils are not affected with any of theſe little feelings: but, be it ſo or not, it is commonly true, that errors adopted on long deliberation are not eaſily given up and corrected. I do not wiſh to inſinuate here, that any attention will be wanting to my arguments, drawn from religion and the fear of God (for his name has been called in to give force to the vows of the nation to their real cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors) or to arguments drawn from morality, national juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and honor, from gratitude and compaſſion, &amp;c. theſe are arguments to be anſwered to God, to the nation, and to conſcience.—But to wave all theſe for this time, I beg to conclude with the following queſtions, directed to every body:</p>
            <p>Firſt queſtion. Whether paying the clear profits of the ſpeculators, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 26,250,000 dollars, will not load and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the revenue ſo much, as to put it out of our power to pay our real debts of the firſt honor, juſtice, covenants, and truth of the nation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="375" facs="unknown:023972_0382_0FC2A97C5D844E10"/>
Second queſtion. Whether this payment will not be matter of general diſapprobation and diſguſt, eſpecially when kept alive and freſh in memory, by the annual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of above 1,000,000 dollars to pay the intereſt of it?</p>
            <p>Third queſtion. Whether denying payment to ſuch of our citizens, who, by their virtue and efforts, ſaved our country, will not be matter of great diſſatisfaction to our people, and diſcourage their future zeal and readineſs to ſerve their country, when their ſervices may be neceſſary?</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>right</hi> as well as <hi>duty</hi> of every citizen, to uſe his beſt endeavours to avert his country's <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtreſſes,</hi> whenever they appear threatening. Our country has a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>wiſdom</hi> as well as to the <hi>wealth</hi> of all its inhabitants, when the public exigence makes <hi>either or both neceſſary,</hi> and the <hi>right of the nation</hi> implies the <hi>duty of its citizens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In diſcharge of this <hi>duty,</hi> I here offer my <hi>mite of wiſdom,</hi> ſuch as it is, to my country. If any <hi>one ſentence</hi> of theſe Diſſertations does not carry conviction, let it be rejected; but if my <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>arguments reach the heart,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the mind of the reader to yield to their <hi>rectitude</hi> and <hi>force,</hi> they will produce the effects I wiſh.</p>
            <p>But whether I am gratified or diſappointed, whether my country be ſaved or not, I have that <hi>conſciouſneſs of upright intentions</hi> and <hi>faithful endeavours</hi> for the ſalvation of the Union, which inſpires me with the moſt <hi>ſatisfactory expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> that I ſhall be glorious in the eyes of the LORD and of <hi>poſterity.</hi>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE SEAT OF THE Federal Government, AND THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF CONGRESS OVER A Ten Miles Diſtrict; WITH OBSERVATIONS On the Economy and delicate Morals neceſſary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in infant States.</head>
            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, Sep. 21, 1789.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſeat of Congreſs was at <hi>New-York</hi> at that time.</note>]</head>
            <p>AS the <hi>fixing the Seat of the Federal Government</hi> is a ſubject, which has of late engroſſed the attention of many people both in and out of Congreſs, perhaps a few obſervations on the nature and conſequences of that meaſure may be uſeful, and, of courſe, acceptable at this time. I offer my beſt thoughts with freedom, without meaning to offend.<note n="†" place="bottom">Tho' the <hi>United States</hi> of <hi>America</hi> contain about 640,000,000 acres of land, which have every advantage of ſoil and ſituation that any country can boaſt, and tho' their territory is equal to <hi>Great-Britain, Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> taken together, yet their population and civil eſtabliſhments are both young, and, as yet, in the tender ſtate and ſmall beginnings; and, of courſe, the greateſt attention is neceſſary to that <hi>poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> and <hi>economy,</hi> which muſt ſtrengthen, increaſe, and connect the whole. I therefore hope, that the humble attempts of the author to point out and patronize ſome leading principles of both theſe great objects, which are really of moſt eſſential conſideration, will meet the candor and favorable attention of Congreſs and the Public.</note>

It appears to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that deciding, or even preſſing, the queſtion of the <hi>permanent reſidence</hi> of Congreſs is very <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper at this time,</hi> becauſe,</p>
            <p>I. Congreſs have it in their power, without moving this queſtion, <hi>to obtain every accommodation for themſelves which can be neceſſary</hi> for years to come, and in a ſituation as nearly in the centre of the preſent population of the States, and as convenient for the whole Union, as any that can be obtained by any fixture of place that can be made, and all this without <hi>any expenſe</hi> of the States.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> can and readily would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any and all public buildings, which Congreſs can need for their two Houſes; and it is likewiſe certain, that all the public officers have ſuch <hi>liberal appointments,</hi> that they can very well afford to pay any ſmall rent which would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their offices.</p>
            <p>It is farther certain, that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is neare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the <hi>centre</hi> and <hi>general convenience</hi> of the States, in their preſent ſtate of population, than any ſpot either on the <hi>Potowmac</hi> or <hi>Suſquehannah,</hi> or any <hi>other place propoſed</hi> for the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent reſidence of Congreſs, and will probably continue ſo for many years.</p>
            <p>II. Fixing the ſeat of government will be altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <hi>till a ſum of money can be advanced, ſufficient to purchaſe the ſoil, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rect the neceſſary buildings; which will require</hi> (according to the eſtimate of the Lower Houſe of Congreſs) 100,000 <hi>dollars.</hi> But it is certain, that, in the preſent ſtate of our finances, and the numerous and preſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on the treaſury, we are in no condition to <hi>advance any ſuch ſum;</hi> we have large debts called for in the moſt preſſing manner, by creditors both foreign and domeſtic,
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:023972_0385_0FC2A9998FAC38E8"/>
whoſe demands we are bound to ſatisfy with the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies we can raiſe, either from our own reſources or our credit; theſe demands, I ſay, we are bound to ſatisfy, on every principle of <hi>juſtice, public faith, national honor, and common honeſty,</hi> nay, by every inducement of <hi>gratitude, and even compaſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It follows then, that <hi>to delay theſe payments,</hi> in order to ſquander away 100,000 dollars on buildings of no immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate uſe or neceſſity, is an act of very <hi>high injuſtice,</hi> and even <hi>wickedneſs;</hi> it is proſtituting the <hi>juſtice, honor,</hi> and even <hi>morality</hi> of the nation, to very little more than <hi>vain ſhow</hi> and <hi>pageantry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may, indeed, be doubtful what ſort of juſtice or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is due to the <hi>purchaſers of alienated certificates;</hi> but there can certainly be no doubt of the <hi>juſtice and gratitude too,</hi> which is due to the <hi>original holders</hi> of certificates, who actually rendered their <hi>ſervices, ſupplies,</hi> and <hi>caſh</hi> to the States, in the time of their <hi>higheſt dangers</hi> and <hi>diſtreſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe men did in fact pay the purchaſe of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and can it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Americans</hi> can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the rich bleſſings of their independence, and, at the ſame time, refuſe payment to the <hi>firſt purchaſers</hi> of it, who come like beggars to ſolicit payment, to relieve them from the penury and diſtreſs which they ſuffer for want of it?—Muſt all this ſcandal, meanneſs, and wrong be incurred, in order to laviſh immenſe ſums on a parcel of <hi>large edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> to be reared up in the woods, and which are no more neceſſary to the preſent honor, ſafety, or even convenience of the States, than a fifth wheel to a coach? Common ſenſe forbids it.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſtly as wicked, ſhameful, inhuman, and ridiculous for a State to do this, as for an individual to purchaſe <hi>a large eſtate,</hi> enjoy the <hi>rich produce</hi> of it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay the <hi>original purchaſe of it,</hi> becauſe the creditor happens to be a poor creature, who cannot <hi>compel</hi> him to payment. Can ſuch a man, with any reaſon, expect either the <hi>bleſſings of Heaven, eſteem of mankind,</hi> or any <hi>kind of proſperity</hi> in poſſeſſion of ſuch iniquitous affluence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious grandeur? whilſt the original purchaſe-money is
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:023972_0386_0FC2A99B02DADD90"/>
               <hi>wrongfully withheld</hi> from the creditor; and the money due to him is laid out in ſumptuous buildings and gaudy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade.</p>
            <p>I ſhould think, that gentlemen who can propoſe ſuch a plan, have forgot the great principles of <hi>juſtice, public faith,</hi> and <hi>economy,</hi> on which alone the <hi>honor, eſtabliſhment,</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of a nation can be founded, and, inſtead of theſe, have adopted the ſentiments of young beaus and girls, who think the higheſt diſtinction conſiſts in the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their dreſs, and ſet that mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> down as undoubtedly the moſt reſpectable, whoſe clothes and jewels are the richeſt and moſt brilliant.</p>
            <p>When there is an eſtate much involved, it commonly happens that ſome debts, on account of <hi>greater original merit, better earnings,</hi> or other <hi>cauſes,</hi> are deemed to be of a <hi>higher nature</hi> than others, and are therefore entitled to a <hi>precedency</hi> or <hi>priority</hi> of payment; the <hi>original holders</hi> of the public ſecurities have undoubtedly this claim, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entitled to precedency of payment, and the States are undoubtedly furniſhed with ſufficient reſources to pay them, or, at leaſt, their annual or half-yearly intereſt; and theſe reſources ought not to be diverted from ſo neceſſary and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable an object, to the vain purpoſes of ridiculous parade or extravagant appointments, or other <hi>Utopian</hi> expenſes.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected to this by honeſt men, who will ſay, 'we approve the juſtice and reaſon of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it <hi>coincides</hi> with the <hi>very ſentiments of the heart,</hi> and meets both the <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>grateful feelings</hi> of our ſouls; but, alas! it is <hi>impracticable,</hi> becauſe the original holders of the public ſecurities cannot be <hi>aſcertained</hi> and <hi>diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> from others who are not ſuch; many who are really original holders, will not be able to prove that they are ſuch.' In anſwer to this, I readily admit that any man who preſents himſelf as an original holder, and claims the benefit of precedence of payment, muſt prove himſelf to be ſuch, <hi>i. e.</hi> the proof will lie on him, and which almoſt the whole of them will be able to produce with the utmoſt certainty, becauſe their names are <hi>recorded</hi> in the <hi>public of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> in which their accounts were <hi>ſettled,</hi> and out of which
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:023972_0387_0FC2A9AD666D3820"/>
their <hi>certificates iſſued,</hi> and tho' ſome few will not be able to make this proof, and ſo muſt loſe the benefit for want of proof, yet this affords no reaſon why thoſe who <hi>can make proof,</hi> ſhould loſe the benefit of it; we might as well deny that <hi>authenticated deeds</hi> ſhould be admitted as good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of titles of lands to the poſſeſſor, becauſe many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have purchaſed eſtates, but have either neglected <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> the proper deeds, or, by ſome misfortune, <hi>have loſt</hi> them, and, of courſe, muſt loſe their eſtates, for want of the proper evidence of that <hi>right</hi> which is <hi>really</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>III. In the late public debates of Congreſs on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of fixing the permanent ſeat of government, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men differed ſo extremely <hi>in their eſtimates of the diſtance of ſtations, convenience of paſſage both by land and water, ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity or unhealthineſs of places, ſtate of population, and many other circumſtances</hi> neceſſary to be taken into account, that it appears very plain, that the internal geography and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other local qualities of the United States are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently defined and underſtood, to enable us to fix even the <hi>centrality</hi> of the States, and aſcertain many other things abſolutely neceſſary to be known and conſidered, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the permanent ſeat of government. Therefore, it is prudent to put off that determination, till the <hi>data</hi> on which it manifeſtly ought to depend, can be more fully known and aſcertained.</p>
            <p>IV. It is expected that <hi>four or five States will ſoon be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the preſent Union;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>North-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> had not, at the time this Eſſay was publiſhed, acceded to the Union under the New Conſtitution: the acceſſion of ſome <hi>new</hi> States was expected, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>Vermont, Kentucky, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the acceſſion of two of them we hope to be very near, and it is unreaſonable to puſh the deciſion of a queſtion (which is thought by many to be of the utmoſt conſequence to the whole Union) <hi>by only a part of the whole,</hi> when, by a little delay, in no manner preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to us, a deciſion may be obtained, in which <hi>every part</hi> may have its due weight and influence.</p>
            <p>But there is another reaſon againſt an immediate deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the queſtion (and perhaps of more conſequence
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:023972_0388_0FC2A9B3146F2F98"/>
than this) which is drawn from the preſent ſtate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>V. In the late diſcuſſions of this ſubject in Congreſs, different gentlemen adopted <hi>different ſpots or places for the ſeat of government,</hi> and became divided into two parties nearly equal; each contending for his favorite ſpot with all force of argument and energy of zeal; and both parties adhered to their ſeveral favorite poſitions with ſuch pointed and inflexible obſtinacy, and worked themſelves up to ſuch an acrimony of debate, that it became impoſſible to force the deciſion, without giving a ſort of triumph to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſubjecting the other to very ſenſible mortification; and as the majority muſt be very ſmall, if the queſtion is puſhed on to a deciſion (for the parties are nearly equal) it is much to be feared that the affair will produce much diſſatisfaction, and perhaps deſtroy mutual confidence and good-humor, which may in future <hi>weaken our counſels,</hi> and <hi>leſſen our unanimity</hi> in matters that have <hi>no connection with the ſeat of government;</hi> for it is well known, that irritated parties rarely adopt much accommodating temper or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent condeſcenſion one towards another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France, Holland</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> give us, in their hiſtories, dreadful leſſons of the tragical effects of ſtate-parties, and I pray God, we may have prudence enough to put an early ſtop to them, if we find them in ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings growing amongſt us.</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons I wiſh the ſaid deciſion may be poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned; I would wiſh this, if it was only to give gentlemen <hi>time</hi> to cool, and, <hi>when cool,</hi> to <hi>reviſe</hi> their <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>—Time ſoftens the acrimony of the mind, takes off the edge of the paſſions, makes room for charity and benevolence, and may perhaps produce ſuch a ſpirit of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, as, together with new information and new lights that may be thrown on the ſubject, may produce in a future time a deciſion which will ſtrengthen our union, without any danger of weakening or deſtroying it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may appear in future time, that neither of the ſpots contended for are on the whole eligible, and, of courſe, both parties may yield their favorite poſitions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:023972_0389_0FC2A9B48FC85438"/>
giving any cauſe of triumph to their opponents.—But there are ſtill other reaſons for a poſtponement of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion not yet mentioned, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Centrality will undoubtedly be (c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>teris paribus) the principle on which the ſeat of government ought to be placed,</hi> becauſe every part of the Union has equal right to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation; but this muſt be a <hi>centrality of population,</hi> not of <hi>territory;</hi> it cannot matter much whether the ſeat of government is at little or great diſtance from thoſe parts of the territory, which conſiſt of uninhabited woods and lakes.</p>
            <p>But this centre is, in its nature, a <hi>moving point,</hi> and muſt and will continue ſo, till the population of every part of the territory is complete, and becomes invariable, which, in the common courſe of human events, can never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. And no kind of eſtabliſhment which we can give to the ſeat of government, will keep it <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>unmoved,</hi> when future reaſons and future counſels ſhall operate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, it is altogether vain and highly imprudent to endeavour to fix our ſeat of government by laying out any more money than is of immediate uſe and abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in furniſhing the accommodations of it, and eſpecially at a time when <hi>out finances</hi> are extremely <hi>low and deranged,</hi> our people greatly <hi>burdened,</hi> and the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> of the States every where ſuffering in a ſcandalous manner, by our <hi>breaches of faith</hi> and <hi>failure of public credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' centrality is the principle <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> on which the ſeat of government ought to be placed, yet <hi>(cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris non paribus)</hi> it may become otherwiſe; many other things may occur, to make a removal from centrality ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>VII. The ſeat of government ought to be in a place where the <hi>court</hi> and <hi>officers</hi> of government, and all the <hi>vaſt numbers of people,</hi> both citizens and foreigners, who have occaſion to reſort there, may <hi>be accommodated in the beſt and moſt convenient manner;</hi> but it is certain, that neither the one nor the other have any chance for ſuch accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the deſert banks of the <hi>Potowmac</hi> or <hi>Suſquehannah</hi>
               <pb n="383" facs="unknown:023972_0390_0FC2A9C1D5B9E7A8"/>
for many, many years to come; therefore, I think it beſt to defer moving to either of the places for the preſent.</p>
            <p>VIII. The ſeat of government ought to be in a place of <hi>the greateſt attainable intelligence,</hi> that the rulers may take benefit of the moſt extenſive <hi>correſpondences</hi> of men of all profeſſions, of foreigners reſorting from every part of the earth, of the moſt complete <hi>libraries, maps,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Congreſs may have concerns with all the world. Not a citizen in the States can have a connexion in any part of the earth, but, on ſome occaſion or other, Congreſs may <hi>have the matter before them.</hi> They muſt preſide over all improvements of the country, in which the experience and information of foreigners may be of eſſential uſe. We may be intereſted in the cuſtoms of foreign nations, which nobody can explain ſo well as their own people reſiding among us, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is not ſuppoſable that the Members of Congreſs will come <hi>from home,</hi> furniſhed with competent knowledge of all the ſubjects they will have occaſion to conſider and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; and if they have <hi>not this knowledge,</hi> they muſt obtain it <hi>by information,</hi> as other folks do, and, of courſe, muſt be furniſhed with <hi>the means of information;</hi> but I think we might as well immure them in the <hi>bottom of a well,</hi> or ſhut them up in a <hi>cave,</hi> where they would be effectually cut off from all intelligence of the world, as place them within the deſert, dreary <hi>fogs,</hi> and diſheartening <hi>agues</hi> of either the <hi>Potowmac</hi> or <hi>Suſquehannah,</hi> where there is nothing <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>majeſtic</hi> to be ſeen, but the <hi>ice</hi> and <hi>floods,</hi> and nothing <hi>lively</hi> to be heard or felt, but <hi>muſk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>toes.</hi> I am of opinion, the defects of nature muſt be corrected by art, before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe places can become the beſt centre of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in <hi>America;</hi> and therefore, I think Congreſs need not be in much hurry to move to either of them.</p>
            <p>IX. It is neceſſary the ſeat of government ſhould be placed where <hi>the manufactures, agriculture, trade, and wealth of the country can receive the beſt protection and encouragement,</hi> and be moſt eaſily and properly <hi>directed and regulated by the government.</hi> The great firſt principles of our wealth are our great ſtaples of manufactures and agriculture; theſe
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:023972_0391_0FC2A9C2CC474B98"/>
both receive their invigorating principle from our trade, for nobody would labor much to raiſe the produce of the earth, or make fabrics, if there was no trade to make a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for them, or no market where they could be ſold.</p>
            <p>This, of courſe, brings the whole into action on the <hi>various ſeats of navigation,</hi> and, of courſe, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the ſeat of government ſhould be near ſuch ſeat of navigation, that government may have the beſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to cheriſh and protect theſe moſt important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, which not only compriſe the grand <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources</hi> of the ſubject, but out of which muſt be derived the great and moſt <hi>capital ſupplies</hi> of the government.</p>
            <p>Farther, if it is neceſſary that the ſeat of government ſhould be near <hi>any</hi> of theſe ſeats of navigation and trade, it is evid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>y moſt neceſſary, that it ſhould be placed near to <hi>the greateſt ſeat and centre</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>But neither the banks of <hi>Potowmac</hi> nor <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> are near any ſuch centre, nor have either of them any chance of ever poſſeſſing ſuch advantage; therefore, I think it beſt to put off at leaſt for the preſent an emigration to either of them.</p>
            <p>X. It is neceſſary that the ſeat of government ſhould be placed in that poſition, which is moſt convenient for the <hi>defence and protection of the Union.</hi> Our State is yet young; we are yet ignorant how far, and in what light, we may be conſidered in the political ſyſtems of the <hi>European</hi> or <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can nations,</hi> or what deſigns they are or may be meditating concerning us; I ſuppoſe, our derangements and preſſures ſince the peace have ſet us in a ſomewhat diſadvantageous light among them; but <hi>nature</hi> will ſoon give us <hi>conſequence,</hi> as, in the ordinary courſe of events, another century will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> us as <hi>numerous,</hi> and perhaps as <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>rich,</hi> as the <hi>greateſt</hi> of them, and, of courſe, we ſhall be as <hi>reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> if we have <hi>wiſdom</hi> enough to improve our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two colonies</hi> of the <hi>European</hi> powers, to which we are contiguous, are ſo thinly inhabited and weak, that I conceive we are in little danger from them; the <hi>Indians</hi> we can eaſily manage; our connexions with all the other
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:023972_0392_0FC2A9C75D4EBF20"/>
nations of the world muſt depend <hi>on navigation,</hi> for we can neither paſs to them, nor they to us, otherwiſe than acroſs the ſea.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe nobody does now, or perhaps ever will, wiſh for any other than <hi>commercial connections</hi> with any of them; but even our commerce may require <hi>protection,</hi> and as the caprices of mankind are ſometimes very vicious, and may lead to actions very provoking, it is not impoſſible we may be inſulted <hi>on our own coaſts,</hi> or even in our harbours, if we are wholly <hi>void of force</hi> to protect them.</p>
            <p>All this brings into view the very <hi>great importance of our navigation,</hi> which is the great means of our commerce, and, of courſe, of our wealth, which will doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire very extenſive and numerous ſhipping; and theſe will make a <hi>naval force,</hi> greater or leſs, at leaſt in ſome degree, neceſſary; and as this is an object on which not only the <hi>wealth,</hi> but even the <hi>character</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> of the States will <hi>capitally depend,</hi> it inſtantly riſes into view as an intereſt, an accommodation, of ſuch vaſt magnitude, as to require a ſort of precedence of conſideration, of moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital and decided attention; and, of courſe, will at leaſt require the <hi>ſeat of government</hi> to be ſo near to the <hi>ſeat of it,</hi> as may be neceſſary to give it all the inſpection, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and protection, that a matter of ſuch capital conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt require from government.</p>
            <p>The banks of <hi>Potowmac</hi> and <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> are too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from any practicable <hi>ſeat of a navy,</hi> to admit any probability that it will ever be properly attended to by a court at ſuch diſtance. We have no inſtance of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which pays a proper attention to their navigation, whoſe <hi>ſeat of government</hi> is at a <hi>great diſtance</hi> from their <hi>principal harbours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have good harbours, and every induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and advantage for building and furniſhing a complete navy, but their capitals are far removed from the ſight of ſhips, and, of courſe, they are neglected.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the courts of <hi>England, Holland, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> have their harbours near them, and their ſhipping is rarely neglected or out of order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="unknown:023972_0393_0FC2A9C9243DA238"/>
In as much, then, as capital conſiderations ought ever to control capital deciſions, I have no doubt but a ſeat of the federal government will be looked for and found, not on the banks of <hi>Potowmac</hi> or <hi>Suſquehannah,</hi> but near to ſome <hi>navigable water,</hi> proper for the <hi>capital ſtation of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;</hi> and to recede from this principle will indicate not <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of judgment,</hi> not <hi>corruption of heart alone,</hi> but <hi>abſolute, total madneſs;</hi> and for the juſtice of this remark, I appeal to the ſentiments of all the citizens of <hi>America,</hi> and of all their friends in the world.</p>
            <p>Time has fully juſtified <hi>Peter</hi> the Great, Czar of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy;</hi> who, on the force of this very principle, removed the ſeat of his Empire from its ancient poſition, near 500 miles farther from the centre of his dominions, and into a climate and ſoil much leſs deſirable, merely to gain a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation <hi>contiguous to a harbour for his ſhips;</hi> in conſequence of which his Empire is amazingly enriched by trade, and become very reſpectable for its <hi>naval force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe it will be ſtrongly objected to any delay of fixing the ſeat of government, that, till that is done, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs cannot come into poſſeſſion of their <hi>excluſive juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over ten miles ſquare of territory,</hi> which is to ſurround their ſeat when fixed, and not before; and, of courſe, till then they cannot enjoy the advantages of it.</p>
            <p>This is a meaſure that has been adopted and approved by ſo many votes of Convention, Congreſs, and particular States, that I ſuppoſe myſelf very ſtupid, whilſt I cannot ſee any kind of fitneſs or propriety in the meaſure, or any advantages that will naturally reſult from it. But as <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity is no crime,</hi> and nobody can be rightfully <hi>blamed for not underſtanding</hi> what is <hi>totally out of the reach of his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal powers,</hi> or for <hi>not ſeeing</hi> what does not appear <hi>viſible</hi> to him, I will venture to give my thoughts on this ſubject, in full expectation, not of <hi>blame</hi> and <hi>cenſure,</hi> but of being deemed moſt uncommonly <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> in not being able to comprehend what is ſo <hi>very clear</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> to other folks.</p>
            <p>I. In the firſt place, I can eaſily conceive that Congreſs ought to have and enjoy all <hi>powers, authorities,</hi> and <hi>juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi>
               <pb n="387" facs="unknown:023972_0394_0FC2A9D662E46750"/>
               <hi>that are or can be neceſſary to preſerve their own dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, reſpectability,</hi> and <hi>ſtate;</hi> ſufficient fully to ſecure them, to all intents and purpoſes, againſt all contempts, violences, intruſions, or embarraſſments, and to regulate and adjuſt their own order, economy, and even ceremony, in the moſt proper and decent manner, which they can deviſe; and that they ſhall be fully empowered to <hi>try and puniſh</hi> all violations and treſpaſſes in any of theſe reſpects, either by acts of their corporate or aggregate body, or by ſuch judges or officers as they ſhall appoint; and that all theſe powers ſhall be ſuperior to, and uncontrollable by, any other power or authority whatever.</p>
            <p>All <hi>theſe powers of ſelf-preſervation</hi> ought undoubtedly to exiſt in the fulleſt manner in that auguſt body, and their prudence in the exerciſe of them may ſafely, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, be relied on by the citizens of the States, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſtituting any ſuperior authority to control them.—But, in the ſecond place, it appears to me,</p>
            <p>II. That theſe powers, authorities, and juriſdictions muſt not be <hi>faſtened or limited to any particular place;</hi> but muſt be <hi>inherent</hi> in that auguſt body, and muſt <hi>go and come</hi> with them when and whereſoever <hi>they move.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If, by the invaſions of an enemy, a conflagration of their edifices, the infections of a plague, or any other cauſe, they ſhould find it convenient to remove their court or the ſeat of their reſidence to ſome diſtant place, they muſt <hi>carry all theſe juriſdictions</hi> and <hi>powers with them;</hi> it will not do well to leave them behind; their uſe will be as great and neceſſary in the place to which they move, as it was in the place they have left, and it would be hard upon that auguſt body, to add to their calamities of removal, the additional mortification of being leſſened and deflower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it.</p>
            <p>III. I have no idea that the citizens of any one diſtrict ſhould be any more <hi>ſubject to the authority and control</hi> of Congreſs, or ſhould be <hi>entitled to their benefits or notice</hi> in any way whatever, <hi>more than all the reſt.</hi> Every citizen has <hi>equal right</hi> to all the benefits of, and owes <hi>equal duty</hi> to, that ſupreme body. Any <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of this ſort lay a
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:023972_0395_0FC2A9D7B9648528"/>
foundation for partialities, expectations, or at leaſt jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which are very pernicious in ſociety; and altho' the citizens of the ten miles diſtrict may be few at firſt, yet we ſhall probably find (whatever objections Congreſs have to a reſidence in cities) that buildings and inhabitants will multiply round their court very ſoon into a large city; in which numerous occaſions will probably ariſe to operate on the above-mentioned ſources of diſcontent and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin.</p>
            <p>IV. Congreſs will have to make a <hi>whole code of laws</hi> for the <hi>ten miles diſtrict,</hi> to <hi>appoint</hi> every judiciary and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>officer,</hi> and to ſuperintend the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of the whole; and if they are as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low about that, as they are in organizing the federal government (and the caſe is quite as novel, and the ground equally untrodden) this work may probably take up their time many months; and as the States pay them about 1000 dollars a day, during their ſeſſion, the adminiſtration of the diſtrict will ſoon coſt the States 100,000 <hi>dollars;</hi> which is much more than either we <hi>can ſpare,</hi> or the diſtrict <hi>can be worth</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>V. The whole <hi>police of the diſtrict</hi> will be a <hi>ſoleciſm</hi> in the federal government; their laws will be made and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by people that are not <hi>of their election,</hi> but by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, not by even their own fellow-citizens. It is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the option of Congreſs, whether they may <hi>appoint</hi> one officer of their police, either judiciary or executive; they have no voice in <hi>taxation</hi> or giving their own money; they do <hi>not belong</hi> to the Thirteen States, for they are <hi>no part</hi> of either of them, and, of courſe, <hi>not parties</hi> to the confederation, nor are they a State of themſelves; the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> of none of the confederated States <hi>can run</hi> there, ſo that, for any thing they can do, their diſtrict will be a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge</hi> for debtors, thieves, and even murderers.</p>
            <p>They muſt ſubmit, right or wrong, to the deciſions of their rulers, for they have <hi>no appeal,</hi> no refuge from <hi>injury or tyranny;</hi> and this is no very comfortable circumſtance, if we conſider a little how common it is for courts to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> the cities in which they reſide. And if, under theſe circumſtances, the diſtrict ſhould think themſelves op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:023972_0396_0FC2A9D948DA9DE8"/>
and ſhould happen to <hi>rebel or raiſe an inſurrection,</hi> the <hi>force of the Union</hi> muſt be called in to quell them; and this will occaſion another <hi>expenſe</hi> to the States, both of <hi>blood and treaſure,</hi> which I ſtrongly object to.</p>
            <p>VI. Beſides all this, I know not what <hi>they will do,</hi> or what will <hi>become of them,</hi> if Congreſs ſhould happen to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from them</hi> finally, and <hi>not return;</hi> here muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>new road cut</hi> to their final deſtination, I know not how nor where.</p>
            <p>After all this trouble and expenſe, I cannot ſee <hi>one ſingle benefit</hi> or <hi>advantage</hi> which can accrue to the <hi>Congreſs,</hi> or the <hi>States,</hi> or the <hi>diſtrict,</hi> from the whole of it; the powers and juriſdictions above deſcribed appear to me to contain every thing, every authority which Congreſs can poſſibly need. I take it they are all <hi>compriſed</hi> in the <hi>conſtitution,</hi> tho' not <hi>particularly</hi> enumerated there; but if it ſhould be judged that theſe powers are not given <hi>explicitly enough</hi> in the conſtitution, they can eaſily be added by way of <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and I dare believe every State will readily <hi>ratify</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But I am tired of gazing at this ten miles diſtrict, this <hi>unnatural object,</hi> this <hi>ſport of police;</hi> for I can really make <hi>nothing</hi> of it; and ſo I quit it, being willing to refer it over to Congreſs to make <hi>ſomething</hi> of it, if they can.</p>
            <p>I now return from this long and weariſome diſcuſſion of this great objection againſt any delay in fixing the ſeat of government, and return to my principal ſubject, which I mean briefly to reviſe, and reduce the matter to very few words, as follows:</p>
            <p>We have every neceſſary building for the uſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ready made, and have no need of new ones; and if we did need them, we have no money to ſpare to build them, ſo long as our debts (of moſt poignant preſſure and diſtreſs) are unpaid;—the geography and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the States are not ſufficiantly known, to enable us to aſcertain the moſt central place for a ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;—the preſent violent heats in Congreſs about this ſubject render a deciſion of it dangerous at this time;—we expect an acceſſion of new States, who ought to have their
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:023972_0397_0FC2A9DB03DFE9B0"/>
weight in the deciſion, but they muſt be excluded, if the deciſion is puſhed before their acceſſion;—that any attempt to eſtabliſh a permanent ſeat of government of long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is impracticable and vain, as the juſt and central point for ſuch a ſeat will, in its nature, be always moving, and future reaſons and counſels will alter any eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we can now make;—that the ſeat of government ought doubtleſs to be ſituated in the place of the greateſt intelligence,—in the centre of commerce and navigation,—and as near as may be to the moſt capital and convenient ſtation or harbour of the navy,—and in that place which is moſt convenient for the general protection and defence of all the States.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, the <hi>great internal ſources of our wealth,</hi> which are derived from the labor of our people, either in the way of <hi>huſbandry</hi> or <hi>manufactures,</hi> all tend to <hi>a centre</hi> in the <hi>line of navigation,</hi> which runs near the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, from one end of the States to the other; the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> wealth derived from our <hi>trade</hi> with foreign countries, tends to and centres in <hi>the ſame line;</hi> here <hi>both meet</hi> and <hi>receive their invigorating principle,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> their <hi>market.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>market</hi> or <hi>ſale</hi> is the principle which gives <hi>life</hi> and <hi>vigor</hi> to <hi>both</hi> theſe: this principle is put in action on this <hi>great line of navigation;</hi> here the ſales of <hi>both</hi> are made; the one is <hi>purchaſed</hi> and <hi>ſhipped</hi> for <hi>exportation,</hi> the other is <hi>purchaſed</hi> and <hi>ſent off</hi> for <hi>conſumption,</hi> into the various parts of the country.</p>
            <p>On this <hi>line,</hi> then, is the great <hi>ſeat</hi> and <hi>centre of negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> both of our <hi>home</hi> produce, and our <hi>imported</hi> wealth; here are to be found the <hi>great exchanges</hi> of the nation, and, of courſe, the <hi>greateſt plenty of caſh,</hi> and here are found the <hi>great banks,</hi> the richeſt <hi>repoſitories</hi> of money, and the grand <hi>conduits</hi> of its circulation.</p>
            <p>On this ſame line runs the greateſt courſe of <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>advice</hi> from one end of the States to the other; and next to this are the <hi>communications</hi> which are conveyed <hi>by ſea,</hi> from the <hi>remoteſt countries</hi> on one ſide, and by the <hi>great roads</hi> leading from the extremities of the <hi>interior coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> on the other; but both centre and unite on this grand
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:023972_0398_0FC2A9EAD34A6A60"/>
line of communication: for the truth of this I appeal to every poſt-office in the Union, and to every man whoſe buſineſs has any connexion with the general communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country.</p>
            <p>It is farther obvious, and ſo intuitively plain that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not need a proof, that a court, whoſe buſineſs lies <hi>with all men and all places,</hi> ought to be ſeated in the <hi>greateſt centre of that communication which connects them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It follows then, by the moſt intuitive evidence, that the <hi>ſeat</hi> of the federal government ought to be placed on the <hi>great line of navigation,</hi> and as near the geographical <hi>centre</hi> of it, as the great centre of wealth and communication can be found, and as near as may be to the grand <hi>ſtation of the navigation,</hi> both of <hi>commerce</hi> and <hi>force,</hi> which muſt inſure the wealth, honor, and ſafety of the whole.</p>
            <p>Another obvious and very intereſting reaſon why the ſeat of government ought to be placed in the grand centre of trade and communication, is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> very <hi>many people</hi> will have <hi>buſineſs</hi> of importance <hi>with the federal court</hi> or ſome of its <hi>public offices,</hi> which may be well enough done <hi>without their perſonal attendance,</hi> and they will have many more opportunities of <hi>ſending</hi> their buſineſs by ſome perſon of confidence who is going to the court, than they could find, if the court was held in ſome out-of-the-way place, far from ſuch centre of general reſort.</p>
            <p>It is eaſily obſerved, that a perſon in <hi>Boſton</hi> has more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to ſend to <hi>New-York,</hi> which lies on the <hi>great road</hi> of general communication, than to <hi>Albany,</hi> which lies acroſs the country: a perſon at <hi>Pittſburg</hi> has more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to ſend to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> than to any place of <hi>half the diſtance,</hi> which lies either <hi>north</hi> or <hi>ſouth</hi> of it; any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the country may ſend to their <hi>capital eaſier</hi> than to a <hi>neighbouring town,</hi> which lies in any direction which croſſes the road to their capital at right angles.</p>
            <p>Beſides, many people will frequently have buſineſs with the court, and private buſineſs of trade, at the ſame time; and it is a great advantage to be able to do both with but one expenſe of journey and time; to people who live at great diſtance, theſe advantages will be very conſiderable,
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:023972_0399_0FC2A38B355EC7E0"/>
and the inſtances very numerous tho' perhaps the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter here may ſeem trifling.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtatements of facts, obſervations, and reaſonings appear to me proper, important, and convincing; and for the truth, juſtice, and fitneſs of them, I appeal to the heart of every <hi>American,</hi> to that <hi>approving power</hi> which is to be found in every <hi>human breaſt,</hi> and which no man can <hi>control,</hi> when the matter propoſed ſtrikes the mind with a <hi>force</hi> of evidence, which, however <hi>diſagreeable</hi> the ſubject, will <hi>compel the aſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I farther make the ſame appeal to the <hi>conſcience</hi> of every man, who makes <hi>truth the ſole object of his purſuit,</hi> and who has <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>firmneſs</hi> enough to control the <hi>little ſordid paſſions,</hi> which <hi>local attachments, ſiniſter intereſts,</hi> or party zeal may call up and ſtimulate to <hi>corrupt his judgment,</hi> or to <hi>proſtitute</hi> it; but perhaps, in the preſent corrupt ſtate of human nature, no degree of virtue or natural firmneſs will make a man at all times proof againſt theſe little paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>It is lamentable, when we ſee a man of dignity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, noble ſentiments, great comprehenſion of mind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive erudition, and ſound judgment, forget the great principles of his ſubject, loſe his balance, and fret himſelf out of temper, in patronizing any little local intereſts and partial attachments.—Good Heaven! how he leſſens! how he ſinks! how out of character he appears! like a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſanctity grown fooliſh with drink; a grave judge loſing his law in a paſſion; or a ſenator, entruſted with the confidence and counſels of a nation, fribbling and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a fool to pleaſe a courtezan.</p>
            <p>If the above principles and reaſonings are allowed to be juſt and concluſive, our next buſineſs will be to look for a place for a ſeat of government, to which they will apply; I will venture to propoſe PHILADELPHIA for the place.</p>
            <p>I. It is as near the <hi>geographical centre</hi> as any place in any manner capable of accommodating Congreſs; its diſtance from the ſouth line of the States is about 700 <hi>miles;</hi> from the north-eaſt extremity, <hi>about the ſame;</hi> from <hi>Miſſiſſippi,</hi> on an eaſt and weſt line, perhaps <hi>a little more;</hi> the ſaid <hi>eaſt</hi>
               <pb n="393" facs="unknown:023972_0400_0FC2A395F19F3B58"/>
and <hi>weſt line</hi> will divide the territory of the Union into <hi>two parts,</hi> of <hi>nearly equal acres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The computation cannot be made with accuracy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the northern boundary, as well as the northern part of the weſtern boundary, is little known, and, of courſe, the lines, having never been meaſured, cannot by compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be reduced to certainty; but as far as the <hi>beſt maps</hi> we have may be depended on, the difference is not very great, tho' the <hi>ſouthern part</hi> is the largeſt of the two, but is greatly covered and incumbered by many <hi>huge mountains</hi> of <hi>immenſe length,</hi> every where rendered <hi>incapable of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> by their <hi>height, precipices,</hi> and <hi>rocks,</hi> alſo by <hi>vaſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren plains of hot, coarſe ſand,</hi> and by <hi>dry knolls</hi> of land full of <hi>ſhrubs, hard ſoil,</hi> and <hi>ſtones;</hi> all which can never be capable of but ſmall cultivation, if any at all. The <hi>north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part is better land,</hi> more capable of <hi>extenſive</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form cultivation,</hi> has a <hi>better air,</hi> and <hi>climates</hi> much more <hi>healthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent population of the <hi>northern</hi> part is the <hi>moſt numerous,</hi> if we may compute from the <hi>number of Delegates in Congreſs,</hi> which are ſent from the two parts, allowing ſeven of the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Delegates to the northern part, and one of them to the ſouthern; as the ſaid line leaves about <hi>one-eighth part of Pennſylvania</hi> on the <hi>ſouthern</hi> ſide; but the inhabitants of the <hi>northern</hi> part are much the <hi>moſt robuſt and induſtrious,</hi> and, of courſe, the moſt likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Union.</p>
            <p>The inexhauſtible <hi>fiſheries</hi> in which the <hi>northern</hi> people are concerned, will add greatly to their <hi>population</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> for the <hi>wives of fiſhermen</hi> are noted for bearing the <hi>moſt numerous</hi> and <hi>ſtrongeſt children:</hi> the ſimple herring-fiſhery is ſaid to be one of the greateſt ſources of wealth and population in <hi>Holland;</hi> if ſo, it is probable the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe fiſheries of our northern people will have a ſimilar effect, and of much greater extent.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the chance of rapid population is generally much greater in the northern part than in the ſouthern, for their natural increaſe is much greater, and their people are not only more enterpriſing, but ſtronger and more induſtrious,
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:023972_0401_0FC2A397300BDDA0"/>
and, of courſe, more able and fit to endure the hardſhips of new beginnings. The natural increaſe of <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is not leſs than 30,000 <hi>ſouls yearly,</hi> and their emigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be almoſt wholly to the <hi>weſtward, not</hi> to the <hi>ſouthward,</hi> for they are generally prejudiced againſt the ſouthern climates.</p>
            <p>From all this it appears, that <hi>Philadelphia is as near the centre of the Union, as any point which can be found in the great line of navigation,</hi> and in all probability will continue to be ſo for at leaſt an age or two to come.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Philadelphia</hi> is, and undoubtedly will be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every one, the <hi>greateſt centre of wealth, trade, navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> and <hi>intelligence,</hi> both foreign and domeſtic, which is any where to be found in the United States: this needs no proof.</p>
            <p>III. It is ſeated on the banks of the river <hi>Delaware,</hi> which is the <hi>beſt ſtation or harbour for ſhipping</hi> that can be any where found, or even deſired. It has the following qualities or accommodations: 1. It is capable of <hi>eaſy</hi> and moſt <hi>impregnable fortification</hi> and defence from the <hi>chaps of Newcaſtle Bay,</hi> 80 miles from the ſea, up to <hi>the city,</hi> which is about 50 miles above the ſaid chaps. So that, by its diſtance from the ſea and its defences, it is <hi>perfectly ſecure,</hi> or may be eaſily made ſo, againſt any <hi>ſudden ſurpriſal,</hi> or even <hi>invaſions,</hi> of an enemy. 2. It affords <hi>ſufficient water</hi> for any ſhip that ever was built, as far up as <hi>Wilmington,</hi> which is 15 miles above the ſaid chaps, and 24 <hi>feet water</hi> from <hi>Wilmington up to the city.</hi> 3. It affords the <hi>beſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorage,</hi> and is wholly ſecure againſt <hi>all winds, tides,</hi> and <hi>ſtorms,</hi> the whole length from the ſaid chaps up to the city. 4. The common tides riſe and fall about 6 <hi>feet,</hi> which is a great advantage in many reſpects. 5. Its waters not only produce no incumbrance <hi>to a ſhip's bottom,</hi> but inſtantly kill <hi>all worms, cockles,</hi> and other <hi>vermin</hi> which may happen to infeſt a ſhip on her firſt arrival from ſea. 6. It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the <hi>greateſt plenty of timber, iron,</hi> and all other <hi>materials</hi> and <hi>ſtores</hi> for <hi>building, rigging,</hi> and <hi>repairing ſhips,</hi> and <hi>proviſions</hi> for victualling them. 7. It is furniſhed with all natural conveniencies for <hi>dry docks;</hi> which may be built
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:023972_0402_0FC2A398B5DAD998"/>
in ſufficient number and extent for every purpoſe of <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhips.</hi> 8. It is <hi>ſpacious</hi> enough to afford <hi>anchorage</hi> and every other <hi>accommodation</hi> of ſecurity for perhaps <hi>all the ſhips in the world.</hi> 9. The port of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> being the <hi>grand centre</hi> of commercial navigation, will always furniſh <hi>plenty of ſeamen,</hi> and render the <hi>manning</hi> of a navy always <hi>eaſy,</hi> or at leaſt practicable. Theſe are the rare, ſingular, and excellent advantages of this port and river.</p>
            <p>I know of <hi>but one</hi> conſiderable <hi>inconvenience,</hi> which can be objected to it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>the ice uſually ſtops navigation in the river</hi> about <hi>two months</hi> in the year; but this is in the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of winter,</hi> when we rarely wiſh to have ſhips at ſea; and if they ſhould happen to come on the coaſt in that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they may eaſily make a harbour in <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapeak Bay;</hi> ſhips that winter in the river are eaſily <hi>ſecured againſt any damage from the ice,</hi> as we never have any <hi>floods</hi> which riſe more than a <hi>foot or two</hi> above common high-water.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>Philadelphia</hi> can furniſh more <hi>local accommodations</hi> for Congreſs, and all the vaſt number of people who will reſort to the ſeat of government, than any <hi>other city</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> When compared with any of them, it has more <hi>houſes,</hi> more <hi>inhabitants,</hi> more <hi>riches,</hi> more <hi>churches,</hi> and more <hi>play-houſes,</hi> and quite as <hi>much virtue,</hi> tho' perhaps ſomewhat <hi>leſs ſociability,</hi> but <hi>more punctuality</hi> in payments, which is ſome indication of <hi>more honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. The <hi>climate</hi> is <hi>temperate,</hi> and the <hi>air, good;</hi> the ſpring and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all are delightful; the winters moſtly moderate, with no more ſnow or froſt than in neceſſary for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the inhabitants and the growth of vegetables, &amp;c. the <hi>heat</hi> of ſummer is <hi>rarely intenſe,</hi> and if at any time it becomes violent, it ſeldom <hi>laſts long;</hi> it is very uncommon to have the Mercury at 90°.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe the greateſt objection to it is its <hi>numerous population.</hi> I cannot conceive what objection Congreſs can have to reſiding in <hi>a large city;</hi> their <hi>accommodations</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cheaper, their <hi>intelligence</hi> and <hi>communication</hi> more full and eaſy, their <hi>means of information</hi> from converſation, large libraries, maps, &amp;c. are much greater, and their
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:023972_0403_0FC2A39CBB3D5820"/>
               <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>reſpectability</hi> more conſpicuous than they could poſſibly be <hi>in leſſer places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never heard of the leaſt inconvenience, which the <hi>Engliſh Parliament</hi> ever ſuffered from ſitting in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which is the <hi>moſt populous ſpot in Europe.</hi> The city of <hi>Rome,</hi> which contained 6,000,000 of people, was the ſeat of the <hi>Roman</hi> government, and all the inconveniencies which were felt, aroſe not from the <hi>continuance</hi> of it there, but from the <hi>removal of it to Conſtantinople;</hi> this ſoon brought on a diviſion of the Empire into Eaſtern and Weſtern, or <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian;</hi> which ſoon terminated in the total ruin, and even extinction, of the Weſtern Empire; the <hi>courts</hi> of moſt of the States and kingdoms of <hi>Europe</hi> are held in the <hi>moſt populous cities,</hi> without any miſchiefs ariſing from their population that I ever heard of.</p>
            <p>But if there are miſchiefs in this, they are unavoidable, for let them fix their ſeat where they pleaſe, a <hi>populous city</hi> will ſoon grow round them, which can never be avoided without <hi>repeated removals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never heard of but one inconvenience ariſing from the largeneſs of the city which is the ſeat of Congreſs, which is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>the various allurements and pleaſures of the place are apt to divert ſome of their Members from their attention to the public buſineſs and their duty in the Houſe;</hi> but this, I conceive, is by no means to be remedied by <hi>running away</hi> from the miſchief, but by <hi>impoſing ſevere laws on their own Members, and rigidly puniſhing, and even expelling,</hi> SUCH <hi>of them as are guilty of any immoral and ſcandalous practices, which reflect diſgrace on their body, or corrupt their morals or counſels; or</hi> SUCH <hi>who, on any account, neglect their attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and duty in the Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When perſons appointed to ſuch high and dignified ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, happen to be ſo <hi>loſt to all ſenſe of duty, honor, and even ſhame, as to diſgrace themſelves and the auguſt body to which they belong, by levities, debaucheries, negligence of their duty, and of the moſt important intereſts they are appointed to manage,</hi> theſe men, I ſay, are the proper objects of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if they cannot be reformed, the honor and ſafety of the States require that they be expelled from the
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:023972_0404_0FC2A3A6A48F3508"/>
Houſe. And this, I conceive, is the only practicable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing the miſchief; and this, if put into proper execution, will very effectually cure it.</p>
            <p>It is very manifeſt that the dignity, the honor, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability, example, and even univerſal viſible virtue of Congreſs are <hi>in their own keeping.</hi> No <hi>other authority</hi> can interpoſe to correct a failure in any of theſe, unleſs it is the <hi>awful tribunal of the preſs,</hi> which is a moſt <hi>dreadful court,</hi> that always multiplies and increaſes the miſchief in order to remedy it; and I ſhould ſuppoſe, a Congreſs of the leaſt degree of prudence would take the matter under their <hi>own direction,</hi> in order to prevent <hi>an appeal</hi> to that moſt <hi>ſovereign,</hi> indeed, but moſt <hi>mortifying</hi> and <hi>diſgraceful,</hi> of all umpires.</p>
            <p>The <hi>virtues and example of Congreſs are of infinite import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to the Union. Vices and corruptions <hi>planted in a court</hi> (where they make their firſt appearance with a ſort of brilliance, derived from their connection, or at leaſt cloſe neighbourhood, with the firſt honors of the nation) have a very <hi>high introduction,</hi> and <hi>ſpread faſt</hi> among the people. Nobody can watch and ſuppreſs the firſt budding of this fruitful ſource of evil, more fatal than the opening of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora'</hi>s box, but Congreſs itſelf.</p>
            <p>There is no ſituation in either town or country, no gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of ſhow or pompous parade, no virtues of a few, no combination of every excellency in the Preſident, nor any ſtrength, wealth, and majeſty of the States they repreſent, which can give <hi>dignity to Congreſs,</hi> ſo long as the Members have not <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>diſcretion</hi> to <hi>give dignity to themſelves,</hi> and <hi>fitneſs</hi> to their reſolutions. The <hi>vices,</hi> the <hi>negligence,</hi> and even the <hi>levities,</hi> of a <hi>few,</hi> will tarniſh the <hi>glory</hi> and leſſen the <hi>dignity</hi> of that <hi>auguſt body,</hi> and diminiſh the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> of the ſubject in them.</p>
            <p>Some very extraordinary things which have lately paſſed, induce me to turn my attention to the great principles of economy and delicate morals, which are abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be practiſed in an infant State.</p>
            <p>I. Any appearance of <hi>pomp, grandeur,</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> of <hi>dreſs,</hi> of <hi>equipage,</hi> of <hi>buildings,</hi> or of <hi>entertainments</hi> ſhould be carefully avoided.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="398" facs="unknown:023972_0405_0FC2A3A7B263BFF0"/>
1. Becauſe the <hi>dignity,</hi> the <hi>eſtabliſhment,</hi> the <hi>defence,</hi> and <hi>internal police</hi> of the States, do not at all conſiſt in any of theſe; <hi>Fabricius,</hi> with his diſintereſtedneſs and poverty, exhibited in <hi>Greece</hi> a much more ſtriking ſample of the <hi>dignity and excellence</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> mind and police, than <hi>Lucullus,</hi> when he returned to <hi>Rome</hi> thro' the ſame place, with all the <hi>blaze</hi> of <hi>Eaſtern luxury</hi> and <hi>magnificence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our people being generally of middle rank, have not been accuſtomed to theſe <hi>grand appearances,</hi> and are apt to think there is ſomething <hi>foppiſh</hi> and <hi>puerile</hi> in them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that indicates <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>vanity,</hi> or, which is worſe, may imagine they are deſigned to exhibit and keep up a ſort of <hi>hauteur, loftineſs, and pride of ſtation,</hi> which is to cow down and diſpirit the ſubject, and depreſs him with a ſenſe of his own inferiority, when he comes near the court.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Luxuries and levities, magnificence and ſhow, take up <hi>much time, and are inconſiſtent with that gravity of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, fixed attention, and ſteady purſuit,</hi> which the great affairs of the nation require of its miniſters; it is well known that hard ſtudents, or men deeply engaged in purſuit of any kind of buſineſs, neglect all <hi>pageantries,</hi> and generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All theſe appearances are attended <hi>with expenſe</hi> which is not only <hi>needleſs,</hi> but <hi>hurtful;</hi> as it muſt be a burden either to the <hi>public treaſury,</hi> or to the <hi>individual concerned,</hi> and may probably become a very <hi>bad example of luxury and little pride,</hi> which a young State, like all n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w beginners, ſhould ever avoid.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, the great bulk of our citizens are made up of people who ſet out in the world with <hi>ſmall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> and, by unwearied <hi>induſtry and thrift,</hi> have by little and little accumulated the competency they now enjoy. Any <hi>departure</hi> from this line of conduct they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſeen followed by <hi>poverty</hi> and <hi>wretchedneſs;</hi> ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have a high ſenſe of the <hi>value of money,</hi> becauſe, by long labor and careful economy, they have <hi>earned</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> it. To people of theſe fixed habits, any exceſs of <hi>liberal grandeur</hi> and <hi>ſumptuous parade</hi> muſt appear very <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;</hi>
               <pb n="399" facs="unknown:023972_0406_0FC2A3A9366C82A8"/>
like a gulf which will ſoon ſwallow up all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money; this makes them averſe to the payment of taxes or caſh, which is like to be conſumed and loſt in prodigal expenſes.</p>
            <p>More than all this, very great numbers of our people are derived from anceſtors, who left their native ſoil <hi>on account of religion;</hi> whoſe <hi>devotion and morals</hi> were very ſevere, and a religious <hi>gravity and auſterity of manners</hi> has marked the character of their deſcendants ever ſince; not ſo much as a play-houſe could be admitted, till very lately, in the moſt capital cities; and, of courſe, every exceſs of <hi>levity, gaiety, dreſs, equipage, parties of pleaſure, gallantries, amours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> appear to ſuch people like <hi>debauchery, diſſipation,</hi> and <hi>corruption of morals,</hi> and prudence directs that not only <hi>evil,</hi> but <hi>all appearance of it,</hi> is to be avoided.</p>
            <p>Some reſpect ſhould certainly be paid to the ſtrong <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, cuſtoms, tempers,</hi> and <hi>ſentiments</hi> of any people, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who reſide among them, eſpecially by perſons who have the <hi>management</hi> and <hi>direction</hi> of their moſt <hi>precious and delicate intereſts.</hi> I am ſure the gaieties, pleaſures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes of <hi>New-York,</hi> ſince the new Congreſs have reſided there, are the common talk and lamentation of the people where I live; who are not the moſt noted in the world for <hi>rigid manners</hi> or <hi>parſimony</hi> of living.</p>
            <p>II. Another great article of economy, moſt neceſſary to be obſerved by Congreſs and all the States, is the <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or emoluments</hi> annexed to all <hi>public offices.</hi> Making money or accumulating fortunes ought not to be the <hi>ruling object</hi> either in thoſe who <hi>give,</hi> or thoſe who <hi>take,</hi> public offices; the greateſt <hi>integrity, learning,</hi> and <hi>official abilities</hi> are commonly found among men whoſe habits are formed under the practice of <hi>moderate living and prudent economy;</hi> who would very cheerfully accept a public office with <hi>very moderate</hi> emoluments, and execute it in the <hi>beſt manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>abundant ſufficiency</hi> of men of this caſt may be found in the Union, whoſe <hi>mediocrity of deſires</hi> and <hi>prudent econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> will enable them to afford very well to accept the place on moderate terms; and whoſe habits of induſtry, ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:023972_0407_0FC2A3AAADF13330"/>
and integrity will almoſt inſure a faithful and proper performance of the duties of it.</p>
            <p>What madneſs is it then to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by</hi> this ſort of men, and <hi>offer</hi> the public offices to men of either ſuch <hi>great fortunes</hi> or <hi>great buſineſs,</hi> that they cannot afford to attend to the duties of them, without very <hi>great emoluments?</hi> To hear men talk in Congreſs of the ſacrifices of fortune which they make by accepting their places, raiſes my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not againſt the <hi>impatient ſufferer</hi> ſo much, indeed, as againſt the <hi>fools</hi> who appointed him, who, I conceive, made much greater ſacrifices of <hi>their common ſenſe</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the place, than he did of <hi>his money</hi> in accepting it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, where a man's <hi>wants are ſupplied by his diligence,</hi> he will naturally be very <hi>induſtrious and perſevering;</hi> but it is commonly found that induſtry is very apt to abate, where the occaſions of it are leſſened or removed. I do not know a more effectual way to <hi>ſpoil a public officer,</hi> than making him <hi>too rich;</hi> ſuch a man is apt to turn over the public concerns to <hi>clerks</hi> or <hi>ſubalterns,</hi> and to devote more of his time to <hi>indolence</hi> or <hi>pleaſures,</hi> than to the <hi>buſineſs</hi> of his office.</p>
            <p>Whether any of theſe obſervations will apply to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations which Congreſs have voted to themſelves, the great officers of ſtate, the collectors and officers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, the door-keepers, and ſundry other public officers, I leave to be diſcuſſed another time; without going into any detail of that matter at preſent, I have only to ſay, that the compenſations are generally deemed (by people I have converſed with) to be about <hi>double</hi> of what they ought to be, in order <hi>to inſure the buſineſs of the reſpective offices to be well done;</hi> and as they are amazingly higher than the States of the Union in general allow to their officers of a ſimilar nature, I ſuppoſe they will be thought exceſſive, and, of courſe, will be complained of, and probably viewed with uneaſineſs and diſſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Certainly the extravagancies of the courts of <hi>Europe</hi> in this reſpect are no kind of <hi>rule</hi> for us, and I think any gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman might be aſhamed to quote their example (which is and ever has been univerſally exploded in <hi>America</hi>) as a
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:023972_0408_0FC2A3AD942FA9E0"/>
reaſon why we ſhould <hi>imitate</hi> it. But it may be noted, that no compenſations allowed in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>America</hi> to the Members of any <hi>Parliament, Diet, States General, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> or any <hi>other body</hi> ſimilar to that of Congreſs, ever were <hi>one-third</hi> of what Congreſs have granted to <hi>themſelves;</hi> at leaſt this is true as far as I could ever gain information of the matter.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe they give no credit for the <hi>honor</hi> of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their <hi>acquaintance</hi> with all the capital characters in <hi>America,</hi> and all thoſe of <hi>Europe,</hi> which repair to the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court, their <hi>information</hi> of the ſtate and principle of the manufactures, agriculture, commerce, and policies of all the States of the Union, the opportunities they acquire of ſerving their children and friends, and the <hi>conſequence</hi> which their reſidence in Congreſs will ever after give to <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>families</hi> in their reſpective States, whenever they ſhall return home. I ſhould ſuppoſe <hi>all</hi> theſe advantages, or even <hi>any one</hi> of them, would be compenſation enough for a few months' reſidence in Congreſs, without <hi>any money</hi> at all; eſpecially if their <hi>ſimple and neceſſary</hi> expenſes were born by the public into the bargain.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Economy</hi> abſolutely requires the <hi>payment of the public debts,</hi> at leaſt the annual or half-yearly intereſt of them; the public would derive greater advantages from this, by the <hi>general animation</hi> of every ſort of buſineſs it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, than would <hi>compenſate the burden</hi> of raiſing the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to do it, even if we pay no regard to the <hi>public juſtice, honor, credit, morality, gratitude,</hi> and <hi>even compaſſion,</hi> which all conſpire to enforce the ſame meaſure.</p>
            <p>But if all this cannot be done at preſent, enough may doubtleſs be done to ſatisfy the <hi>original holders</hi> of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſecurities, who are manifeſtly the moſt <hi>meritorious,</hi> as well as the <hi>greateſt, ſufferers,</hi> and the moſt <hi>diſtreſſed</hi> and <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined</hi> by the <hi>public defaults of any among us;</hi> but I touched on this before, and it is needleſs to add more on this drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject in this place.</p>

on <hi>imported luxuries</hi> and articles of <hi>unneceſſary</hi> conſumption, but juſt <hi>high enough</hi> to reduce the <hi>exceſſive</hi> uſe of them down to that degree, which is moſt conducive to the <hi>health, morals,</hi> and <hi>wealth</hi> of our people, together with the <hi>ſmall impoſt</hi> on other articles already aſſeſſed, will, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, produce all the ſupplies which the public exigences require; the collection of all this will be <hi>cheap and eaſy; a few officers in the places of navigation</hi> will be ſufficient; and the importers who pay the duty, will be <hi>few,</hi> and will all be <hi>reimburſed</hi> in their ſales.</p>
            <p>But <hi>a general exciſe</hi> (which, I hear, is in contemplation) will require an almoſt <hi>infinite number of officers,</hi> whoſe <hi>pay</hi> will amount to <hi>vaſt ſums,</hi> and whoſe <hi>duty</hi> will be of the <hi>moſt diſguſting and mortifying kind</hi> to the people; for my part, I had rather pay a <hi>dollar a gallon,</hi> impoſt duty, on all the ſpirits and wines I conſume, than ſuffer the <hi>mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intruſions of an exciſe-officer,</hi> to examine my <hi>liquors,</hi> tho' his demand was but <hi>a ſhilling;</hi> and after all, it will be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally <hi>impoſſible to collect</hi> this duty in the exterior parts of the States with any kind of general uniformity and equality, as all experience has ever made manifeſt. But I have treated this more fully <hi>in my Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays on Free Trade and Finance,</hi> to which I refer any body who wiſhes to ſee my ſentiments on this ſubject more fully explained.</p>
            <p>I write with the moſt <hi>unlimited freedom,</hi> and I expect the <hi>candor</hi> of my countrymen; if my ſentiments are <hi>wrong, condemn them;</hi> if <hi>right, approve and adopt them;</hi> it is not <hi>an itch of writing</hi> which impels me, but <hi>a zeal for a good government and a wiſe adminiſtration</hi> prompts me to write, and dictates every line.

            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, October 12, 1787.]</head>
            <p>I AM now to conſider the objections of our ſixteen Members to the <hi>New Conſtitution</hi> itſelf, which is much the moſt important part that lies on me.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their firſt objection is, that the government propoſed will be <hi>too expenſive.</hi> I anſwer, that if the appointments
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:023972_0411_0FC2A3BE35617378"/>
of offices are not more, and the compenſations or emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of office not greater, than is neceſſary, the expenſe will be by no means burdenſome, and this muſt be left to the prudence of Congreſs; for I know of no way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol ſupreme powers from extravagance in this reſpect. Doubtleſs many inſtances may be produced of many need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs offices being created, and many inferior officers, who receive far greater emoluments of office than the firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the State.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their next objection is againſt a <hi>legiſlature conſiſting of three branches.</hi> This is ſo far from an objection, that I conſider it as an advantage. The moſt weighty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs of the Union muſt be tranſacted in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; the moſt eſſential counſels muſt be there decided, which muſt all go thro' three ſeveral diſcuſſions in three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent chambers (all equally competent to the ſubject and equally governed by the ſame motives and intereſts, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the good of the great Commonwealth, and the approbation of the people) before any deciſion can be made; and when diſputes are very high, different diſcuſſions are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, becauſe they afford time for all parties to cool and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider.</p>
            <p>This appears to me to be a very ſafe way, and a very likely method to prevent any ſudden and undigeſted reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from paſſing; and tho' it may delay, or even deſtroy, a good bill, will hardly admit the paſſing of a bad one, which is by far the worſt evil of the two. But if all this cannot ſtop the courſe of a bad bill, the negative of the Preſident will at leaſt give it further embarraſſment, will furniſh all the new light which a moſt ſerious diſcuſſion in a third Houſe can give, and will make a new diſcuſſion neceſſary in each of the other two, where every member will have an opportunity to reviſe his opinion, to correct his arguments, and bring his judgment to the greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity poſſible: if all this can not keep the public deciſion within the bounds of wiſdom, natural fitneſs, right, and convenience, it will be hard to find any efforts of human wiſdom that can do it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="405" facs="unknown:023972_0412_0FC2A3C2015333F0"/>
I believe it would be difficult to find a man in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who would not readily conſent to have Congreſs veſted with all the vaſt powers propoſed by the New Conſtitution, if he could be ſure that thoſe powers would be exerciſed with wiſdom, juſtice, and propriety, and not be abuſed; and I do not ſee that greater precautions and guards againſt abuſes can well be deviſed, or more effectual methods uſed to throw every degree of light on every ſubject of debate, or more powerful motives to a reaſonable and honeſt deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be ſet before the minds of Congreſs, than are here propoſed.</p>
            <p>And if this is the beſt that can be obtained, it ought in all prudence to be adopted till better appears, rather than to be rejected merely becauſe it is human, not perfect, and may be abuſed. At any rate I think it very plain that our chance of a right deciſion in a Congreſs of three branches, is much greater than in one of a ſingle chamber: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all this may be, I cannot ſee the leaſt tendency in a Legiſlature of three branches to increaſe the burdens or taxes of the people. I think it very evident that any propoſition of extravagant expenſe would be checked and embarraſſed in ſuch an Aſſembly, more than in a ſingle Houſe.</p>
            <p>Further, the two Houſes being by their election take<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the body of the States, and being themſelves princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal inhabitants, will naturally have the intereſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth ſincerely at heart, their principle muſt be the ſame, their differences muſt be (if any) in the mode of purſuing it, or ariſe from local attachments; I ſay, the great intereſt of their country, and the eſteem, confidence, and approbation of their fellow-citizens, muſt be ſtrong governing principles in both Houſes, as well as in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident himſelf.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide this ſubject fully diſcuſſed in my Diſſertation on that Conſtitution which is neceſſary for the United States, page 198.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another objection is, that the Conſtitution propoſed will <hi>annihilate the State-governments, or reduce them to mere corporations.</hi> I take it that this objection is thrown out
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:023972_0413_0FC2A3C3782F7410"/>
(merely <hi>invidiae cauſa</hi>) without the leaſt ground for it; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or I do not find <hi>one article</hi> of the Conſtitution propoſed, which veſts <hi>Congreſs,</hi> or <hi>any of their officers</hi> or <hi>courts,</hi> with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>to interfere in the leaſt in the internal police or government of any one State,</hi> when the intereſts of <hi>ſome other State,</hi> or <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> or <hi>the Union</hi> in general, are <hi>not concerned;</hi> and in all ſuch caſes it is abſolutely and manifeſtly neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould have <hi>a controlling power,</hi> otherwiſe there would be <hi>no end of controverſies and injuries</hi> between <hi>different States,</hi> nor any <hi>ſafety</hi> for <hi>individuals,</hi> nor any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <hi>of ſupporting the Union</hi> with any tolerable degree of honor, ſtrength, or ſecurity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another objection is againſt the <hi>power of taxation veſted in Congreſs.</hi> But I anſwer, this is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unavoidable, from the neceſſity of the caſe; I know it is a <hi>tender point,</hi> a <hi>vaſt power,</hi> and a <hi>terrible engine of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> and <hi>tyranny,</hi> when <hi>wantonly, injudiciouſly,</hi> or <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly uſed,</hi> but <hi>muſt be admitted;</hi> for it is impoſſible to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Union, or indeed any government, <hi>without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe</hi>—the Congreſs are the <hi>proper judges</hi> of that expenſe, the <hi>amount</hi> of it, and the beſt <hi>means</hi> of ſupplying it; the <hi>ſafety</hi> of the States <hi>abſolutely requires</hi> that this power be lodged <hi>ſomewhere,</hi> and no <hi>other body</hi> can have the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to it; and <hi>no part</hi> of the reſources of the States can, with any ſafety, be <hi>exempt,</hi> when the <hi>exigencies</hi> of the Union or government require their <hi>utmoſt exertion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſtronger we make our government,</hi> the <hi>greater protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it can afford us,</hi> and the <hi>greater</hi> will our <hi>ſafety be</hi> under it.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy enough here to harangue on the <hi>arts of a court</hi> to create occaſions for money, or the unbounded <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance</hi> with which they can ſpend it; but all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we muſt take our courts as we do our wives, <hi>for better or for worſe.</hi> We hope the beſt of an <hi>American Congreſs,</hi> but if they diſappoint us, we cannot help it; it is in vain to try to form any plan of <hi>avoiding the frailties</hi> of human nature.—Would any man chooſe a <hi>lame</hi> horſe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt a <hi>ſound</hi> one ſhould run away with him? or will any man prefer a <hi>ſmall tent</hi> to live in, before a <hi>large houſe,</hi> which
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:023972_0414_0FC2A3CA5BB3FEC8"/>
may <hi>fall down</hi> and <hi>cruſh him</hi> in its ruins? No man has any right to find fault with this article, till he can ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a better in its room.</p>
            <p>The ſixteen Members attempt to aggravate the horrors of this devouring power, by ſuggeſting the rigid ſeverity with which Congreſs, with their <hi>faithful ſoldiers,</hi> will <hi>exact and collect</hi> the taxes. This picture, ſtripped of its <hi>black drapery,</hi> amounts to juſt this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that whatever taxes are laid will be collected, without exception, from every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon charged with them, which muſt look diſagreeable, I ſuppoſe, to people who, by one ſhift or another, have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided paying taxes all their lives.</p>
            <p>But it is a plain truth, and will be obvious to any body who duly conſiders it, that nothing can be more ruinous to a <hi>State,</hi> or oppreſſive to <hi>individuals,</hi> than a <hi>partial and dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory collection</hi> of taxes, eſpecially where the tax is an impoſt or exciſe, becauſe the man who <hi>avoids</hi> the tax, can <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,</hi> and conſequently <hi>ruin,</hi> him who <hi>pays</hi> it, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling ruins the fair trader, and a <hi>remedy</hi> of this miſchief, I cannot ſuppoſe, will be deemed by our people in general ſuch a <hi>very awful judgment,</hi> as the ſixteen Members would make us believe their conſtituents will conſider it to be.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They object, that the <hi>liberty of the preſs is not aſſerted</hi> in the Conſtitution. I anſwer, neither are any of the <hi>ten commandments,</hi> but I do not think, that it follows that it was the deſign of the Convention to ſacrifice either <hi>the one</hi> or <hi>the other</hi> to contempt, or to leave them void of protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effectual ſupport.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is objected further, that the Conſtitution contains <hi>no declaration of rights.</hi> I anſwer, this is not true: the Conſtitution contains a declaration of many rights, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important ones, <hi>e. g.</hi> that people ſhall be obliged to <hi>fulfil their contracts,</hi> and <hi>not avoid</hi> them by <hi>tenders</hi> of any thing leſs than the value ſtipulated; that no <hi>ex poſt fact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> laws ſhall be made, &amp;c. but it was no part of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their appointment to make <hi>a code of laws;</hi> it was ſufficient <hi>to fix the Conſtitution right,</hi> and that would pave the way for the moſt effectual ſecurity of the rights of the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="408" facs="unknown:023972_0415_0FC2A3D53B732590"/>
7. They further object, that no proviſion is made againſt a <hi>ſtanding army in time of peace.</hi> I anſwer, that a ſtanding army, <hi>i. e.</hi> regular troops, are often neceſſary in time of peace, to prevent a war, to guard againſt ſudden invaſions, for garriſon-duty, to quell mobs and riots, as guards to Congreſs and perhaps other courts, &amp;c. &amp;c. as military ſchools to keep up the knowledge and habits of military diſcipline and exerciſe, &amp;c. &amp;c. and as the power of raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troops is rightfully and without objection veſted in Congreſs, ſo they are the <hi>propereſt and beſt judges</hi> of the <hi>number</hi> requiſite, and the <hi>occaſion, time,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying them; if they are not wanted on military duty, they may be employed in making <hi>public roads, fortifications,</hi> or any other <hi>public works:</hi> they need not be an <hi>uſeleſs bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to the States: and for all this the prudence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs muſt be truſted, and nobody can have a right to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this, till they can point out ſome way of doing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another objection is, that the New Conſtitution <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes trial by jury in civil cauſes.</hi> I anſwer, I do not ſee one word in the Conſtitution, which, by any candid conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can ſupport even the remoteſt ſuſpicion that this ever entered in the heart of one Member of the Convention: I therefore ſet down the ſuggeſtion for ſheer malice, and ſo diſmiſs it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another objection is, that the federal <hi>judiciary is ſo conſtructed as to deſtroy the judiciaries of the ſeveral States,</hi> and that the <hi>appellate juriſdiction, with reſpect to law and fact, is unneceſſary.</hi> I anſwer, both the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> juriſdiction of the federal judiciary are manifeſtly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, where the cauſe of action affects the citizens of <hi>different</hi> States, the <hi>general intereſt</hi> of the Union, or <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> (and to caſes of <hi>theſe deſcriptions only</hi> does the <hi>juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the federal judiciary <hi>extend</hi>) I ſay, theſe juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the federal judiciary are manifeſtly neceſſary for the reaſons juſt now given under the third objection.</p>
            <p>I do not ſee how they can avoid trying any iſſues joined before them, whether the thing to be decided is <hi>law</hi> or
<pb n="409" facs="unknown:023972_0416_0FC2A3D664D755E0"/>
               <hi>fact;</hi> but I think no doubt can be made, that if the iſſue joined is on <hi>fact,</hi> it muſt be tried by a jury.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They object, that the <hi>election of Delegates</hi> for the Houſe of Repreſentatives <hi>is for two years,</hi> and of Senators, <hi>for ſix years.</hi> I think this a manifeſt <hi>advantage,</hi> rather than an <hi>objection.</hi> Very great inconveniences muſt neceſſarily ariſe from a too frequent change of the Members of large legiſlative or executive bodies, where the reviſion of every paſt tranſaction muſt be taken up, explained, and diſcuſſed anew for the information of the new Members; where the ſettled rules of the Houſe are little underſtood by them, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which ought to be avoided, if it can be with ſafety.</p>
            <p>Further, it is plain that any man who ſerves in ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is better qualified the ſecond year than he could be the firſt, becauſe experience adds qualifications for every buſineſs, &amp;c. the only objection is, that long continuance affords danger of corruption, but for this the Conſtitution provides a remedy by impeachment and expulſion, which will be a ſufficient reſtraint, unleſs a majority of the Houſe and Senate ſhould become corrupt, which is not eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumable: in fine, there is a <hi>certain mean</hi> between too <hi>long</hi> and too <hi>ſhort</hi> continuances of Members in Congreſs, and I cannot ſee but it is judiciouſly fixed by the Convention.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, I think the ſixteen Members have employed <hi>an addreſs-writer</hi> of great dexterity, who has given us a ſtrong ſample of <hi>ingenious malignity and ill-nature</hi>—a maſterpiece of <hi>high coloring</hi> in the <hi>ſcare-crow way;</hi> in his account of the conduct of the ſixteen Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by an unexpected openneſs and candor, he avows <hi>facts</hi> which he certainly cannot expect to juſtify, or even hope that their conſtituents will patronize or even approve, but he ſeems to loſe all candor when he deals <hi>in ſentiments;</hi> when he comes to point out the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>New Conſtitution,</hi> he appears to miſtake the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>true principles</hi> of it very much; or, which is worſe, takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſhowing it in the <hi>worſt light</hi> he can paint it in.</p>
            <p>I however agree with him in this, 'that this is <hi>the time for conſideration and minute examination;'</hi> and, I think, the
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:023972_0417_0FC2A3D7C08A4288"/>
great ſubject, when viewed ſeriouſly, without paſſion or prejudice, will <hi>bear,</hi> and <hi>brighten under, the ſevereſt examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the rational inquirer. If the <hi>proviſions</hi> of the law or Conſtitution do not exceed the <hi>occaſions,</hi> if the <hi>remedies</hi> are not extended beyond the <hi>miſchiefs,</hi> the government can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtly charged with <hi>ſeverity;</hi> on the other hand, if the proviſions are not <hi>adequate</hi> to the occaſions, and the remedies <hi>not equal to</hi> the miſchiefs, the government muſt b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>too lax,</hi> and not ſufficiently operative to give the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>ſecurity</hi> to the ſubject: to form a right judgment, we muſt compare theſe two things well together, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our minds to dwell on one of them alone, without conſidering it in <hi>connexion</hi> with the other; by this means we ſhall eaſily ſee that the one makes the other neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Were we to view only the <hi>gaols</hi> and <hi>dungeons,</hi> the <hi>gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> and <hi>pillories,</hi> the <hi>chains</hi> and <hi>wheel-barrows,</hi> of any State, we might be induced to think the government <hi>ſevere;</hi> but when we turn our attention to the <hi>murders</hi> and <hi>parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,</hi> the <hi>robberies</hi> and <hi>burglaries,</hi> the <hi>piracies</hi> and <hi>thefts, which merit theſe puniſhments,</hi> our idea of <hi>cruelty</hi> vaniſhes at once, and we admire the <hi>juſtice,</hi> and perhaps <hi>clemency,</hi> of that government, which before <hi>ſhocked</hi> us as too ſevere.</p>
            <p>So when we fix our attention only on the <hi>ſuperlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and <hi>energetic force</hi> veſted in Congreſs, and our federal executive powers by the New Conſtitution, we may at firſt ſight be induced to think that we yield more of the <hi>ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of the States</hi> and of <hi>perſonal liberty,</hi> than is requiſite to maintain the federal government; but when, on the other hand, we conſider with full ſurvey the <hi>vaſt ſupports</hi> which the union requires, and the <hi>immenſe conſequence of that</hi> UNION to us all, we ſhall probably ſoon be convinced that the powers aforeſaid, <hi>extenſive</hi> as they are, are not <hi>greater</hi> than is neceſſary for our benefit: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>No laws of any State, which do not carry in them a force which extends to their effectual and final execution, can afford a certain and ſufficient ſecurity to the ſubject;</hi> for,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Laws of any kind, which fail of execution, are worſe than none,</hi> becauſe they <hi>weaken</hi> the government, expoſe it to <hi>contempt,</hi> deſtroy the <hi>confidence</hi> of all men, both ſubjects
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:023972_0418_0FC2A3DBCC3CE770"/>
and ſtrangers, in it, and <hi>diſappoint</hi> all men who have <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, <hi>our union</hi> can never be ſupported without <hi>definite</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> laws, which are co-extenſive with their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and which are ſupported by authorities and powers which can give them <hi>execution with energy;</hi> if admitting ſuch powers into our Conſtitution can be called a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> it is a <hi>ſacrifice to ſafety,</hi> and the only queſtion is, whether our UNION or federal government is worth this ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> UNION, I ſay, <hi>under the protection of which</hi> every individual reſts ſecure againſt <hi>foreign</hi> and <hi>domeſtic</hi> inſult and oppreſſion; but <hi>without it</hi> we can have no ſecurity againſt invaſions, inſults, and oppreſſions of <hi>foreign powers,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inroads and wars of <hi>one State on another,</hi> or even againſt <hi>inſurrections</hi> and <hi>rebellions</hi> ariſing within particular States, by which our wealth and ſtrength, as well as eaſe, comfort, and ſafety, will be devoured and deſtroyed by <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies growing out of our own bowels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>our</hi> UNION <hi>alone</hi> which can give us <hi>reſpectability abroad</hi> in the eyes of foreign nations, and ſecure to us all the advantages both of <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi> which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>treaties with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thirteen States all united and well cemented toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are a <hi>ſtrong, rich,</hi> and <hi>formidable</hi> body, not of <hi>ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary,</hi> maturated power, but <hi>increaſing</hi> every day in riches, ſtrength, and numbers.</p>
            <p>Thus circumſtanced, we can demand the attention and reſpect of all foreign nations, but they will give us both in <hi>exact proportion</hi> to the <hi>ſolidity of our union:</hi> for if they obſerve our <hi>union</hi> to be <hi>lax,</hi> from <hi>inſufficient</hi> principles of cement in our <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> or <hi>mutinies</hi> and <hi>inſurrections</hi> of our own people (which are the direct conſequence of an <hi>inſufficient cement of union</hi>) I ſay, when foreign nations ſee either of theſe, they will immediately <hi>abate</hi> of their <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> to us, and <hi>confidence</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>And as it appears to me, that the New Conſtitution does not veſt Congreſs with <hi>more</hi> or <hi>greater</hi> powers than are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport this <hi>important union,</hi> I wiſh it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:023972_0419_0FC2A3E5E9FA3B28"/>
in the moſt <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>unanimous</hi> manner by all the States.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>human</hi> compoſition, and may have <hi>errors</hi> which future experience will enable us to diſcover and correct; but I think it is pretty plain, if it has faults, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs-writer of the ſixteen Members has not been able to find them; for he has all along either hunted down <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of error,</hi> that have no <hi>real exiſtence,</hi> or, which is worſe, <hi>tarniſhed real excellencies</hi> into <hi>blemiſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have dwelt the longer on theſe remarks of this writer, becauſe I obſerve that all the ſcribblers in our papers againſt the New Conſtitution, have taken their cue principally from him; all their lucubrations contain little more than <hi>his ideas</hi> dreſſed out in a great variety of forms; one of which colors ſo high as to make the New Conſtitution ſtrongly reſemble the <hi>Turkiſh government</hi> (vide Gazetteer of the 10th inſtant) which, I think, comes about as near the truth as any of the reſt, and brings to my mind a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent in polemical divinity, which I have ſomewhere read, that there were once great diſputes and different opinions among divines about the <hi>mark which was ſet on Cain,</hi> when one of them very gravely thought it was a <hi>horn fully grown out on his forehead.</hi> It is probable he could not think of a <hi>worſe mark</hi> than that.</p>
            <p>On the whole matter, there is no end of the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the human fancy, which are commonly dictated by <hi>poignant feelings, diſordered paſſions,</hi> or <hi>affecting intereſts;</hi> but I could wiſh my fellow-citizens, in the matter of vaſt importance before us, would diveſt themſelves of bias, paſſion, and <hi>little perſonal</hi> or <hi>local intereſts,</hi> and conſider the great ſubject with that dignity of reaſon, and independence of ſentiment, which national intereſts ever require.</p>
            <p>I have here given my ſentiments with the moſt unbiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed freedom, and hope they will be received with the moſt candid attention and unbiaſſed diſcuſſion by the State in which <hi>I live,</hi> and in which I expect <hi>to leave my children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude with one obſervation, which I take to be very capital, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the diſtreſſes and oppreſſions, both of nations and individuals, often ariſe from the <hi>powers of
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:023972_0420_0FC2A3E71489B4A8"/>
government</hi> being <hi>too limited</hi> in their <hi>principle,</hi> too <hi>indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> in their <hi>definition,</hi> or too <hi>lax</hi> in their <hi>execution,</hi> and, of courſe, the ſafety of the citizens depends much on <hi>full</hi> and <hi>definite</hi> powers of government, and an <hi>effectual execution</hi> of them.</p>

            <head>The Weakneſſes of Brutus expoſed: OR, SOME REMARKS In Vindication of the Conſtitution PROPOSED BY THE LATE FEDERAL CONVENTION, AGAINST THE OBJECTIONS and GLOOMY FEARS of that WRITER.</head>
            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, Nov. 4, 1787.]</head>
            <p>THE long piece ſigned BRUTUS (which was firſt publiſhed in a <hi>New-York paper,</hi> and was afterwards copied into the <hi>Pennſylvania Packet</hi> of <hi>Oct.</hi> 26, 1787) is wrote in a very good ſtyle; the language is eaſy, and the addreſs is polite and inſinuating: but the <hi>ſentiments,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, are not only <hi>unſound,</hi> but <hi>wild and chimerical;</hi> the dreary fears and apprehenſions, altogether groundleſs; and the <hi>whole tendency</hi> of the piece, in this very important criſis of our politics, very <hi>hurtful.</hi> I have, therefore, thought it my duty to make ſome animadverſions on it; which I here offer, with all due deference, to the author and to the public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="414" facs="unknown:023972_0421_0FC2A3E8527192A8"/>
HIS firſt queſtion is, <hi>Whether a confederated government is beſt for the United States?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer,—If <hi>Brutus,</hi> or any body elſe, cannot find any <hi>benefit</hi> reſulting from the <hi>union of the Thirteen States;</hi> if they can do <hi>without</hi> as well as <hi>with</hi> the reſpectability, the protection, and the ſecurity, which the States may derive from that union, I have nothing further to ſay: but if <hi>that union</hi> is to be <hi>ſupported</hi> in any ſuch manner as to afford re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability, protection, or ſecurity to the States, I ſay it muſt be done by an <hi>adequate government,</hi> and cannot be <hi>otherwiſe done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This government muſt have a ſupreme power, <hi>ſuperior to and able to control</hi> each and all of its parts. It is eſſential to all government, that <hi>ſuch a power be ſomewhere exiſting in it;</hi> and if <hi>the place</hi> where the propoſed Conſtitution has fixed it, does not ſuit <hi>Brutus</hi> and his friends, I will give him leave to ſtow it away in any <hi>other place that is better:</hi> but I will not conſent to have it <hi>annihilated;</hi> neither will I agree to have it <hi>cramped and pinched</hi> for room, ſo as to <hi>leſſen</hi> its energy; for that will <hi>deſtroy</hi> both its nature and uſe.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme power of government ought to be <hi>full, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, eſtabliſhed,</hi> and <hi>acknowledged.</hi> Powers of government <hi>too limited,</hi> or <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>diſputed,</hi> have ever proved, like <hi>Pandora'</hi>s box, a moſt fruitful ſource of quarrels, animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wars, devaſtation, and ruin, in all ſhapes and degrees, in all communities, ſtates, and kingdoms on earth.</p>
            <p>Nothing tends more to the <hi>honor, eſtabliſhment,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of ſociety, than <hi>public deciſions,</hi> grounded on principles of <hi>right, natural fitneſs, and prudence;</hi> but when the powers of government are <hi>too limited,</hi> ſuch deciſions cannot be <hi>made and enforced;</hi> ſo the miſchief goes without a remedy: dreadful examples of which we have felt, in inſtances more than enough, for ſeven years paſt.</p>
            <p>Further, where the powers of government are not <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> but <hi>diſputed,</hi> the adminiſtration <hi>dare not</hi> make deciſions on the footing of <hi>impartial juſtice and right;</hi> but muſt <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize</hi> with the parties, leſt they loſe <hi>friends</hi> or make <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> and, of courſe, the <hi>righteous</hi> go off injured and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted, and the <hi>wicked</hi> go off grumbling too; for it is rare
<pb n="415" facs="unknown:023972_0422_0FC2A3E9D9641F40"/>
that any ſacrifices of a court can ſatisfy a prevailing party in the State.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary in States, as well as in private families, that controverſies ſhould have a juſt, <hi>ſpeedy,</hi> and effectual deciſion, that right may be done before the contention has <hi>time</hi> to grow up into habits of malignity, reſentment, ill-nature, and ill offices. If a controverſy happens between <hi>two States,</hi> muſt it continue <hi>undecided,</hi> and <hi>daily increaſe,</hi> and be more and more <hi>aggravated,</hi> by the repeated inſults and injuries of the contending parties, till they are ripe for the <hi>deciſion of the ſword?</hi> or muſt the <hi>weaker States</hi> ſuffer, without remedy, the groundleſs demands and oppreſſions of their <hi>ſtronger neighbours,</hi> becauſe they have no <hi>avenger,</hi> or <hi>umpire</hi> of their diſputes?</p>
            <p>Or ſhall we inſtitute <hi>a ſupreme power, with full and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual authority to control the animoſities and decide the diſputes of theſe ſtrong, contending bodies?</hi> In the one propoſed to us, we have perhaps every chance of a <hi>righteous judgment,</hi> that we have any reaſon to hope for; but I am clearly of opinion, that even a <hi>wrongful deciſion</hi> would, in moſt caſes, be preferable to <hi>the continuance</hi> of ſuch deſtructive contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe that neither <hi>Brutus</hi> nor any of his friends would wiſh to ſee our government <hi>embroiled abroad,</hi> and, therefore, will admit it neceſſary to inſtitute ſome <hi>federal authority,</hi> ſufficient to puniſh <hi>any individual or State,</hi> who ſhall violate our <hi>treaties</hi> with foreign nations, inſult their <hi>dignity,</hi> or abuſe their <hi>citizens,</hi> and compel due reparation in all ſuch caſes.</p>
            <p>I further apprehend, that <hi>Brutus</hi> is willing to have the <hi>general intereſt and welfare</hi> of the States well provided for and ſupported, and, therefore, will conſent that there ſhall exiſt in the States an authority to <hi>do</hi> all this <hi>effectually;</hi> but he ſeems grieved that Congreſs ſhould be the <hi>judges of this general welfare</hi> of the States. If he will be kind enough to point out any <hi>other more ſuitable and proper judges,</hi> I will conſent to have them admitted.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I begin to have hopes of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and think he may come right at laſt; for I obſerve (after all his fear and
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:023972_0423_0FC2A3F388982E18"/>
trembling about the new government) the conſtitution he <hi>defines and adopts,</hi> is <hi>the very ſame</hi> as that which the <hi>Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Convention</hi> have propoſed to us, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "that the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen States ſhould continue thirteen confederated republics, under the <hi>direction and control</hi> of a ſupreme <hi>federal head,</hi> for certain <hi>defined national purpoſes</hi> only." Where we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the New Conſtitution <hi>leaves</hi> all the Thirteen States, <hi>complete republics,</hi> as it <hi>found</hi> them, but all confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated under the direction and control of a <hi>federal head,</hi> for certain <hi>defined national purpoſes only, i. e.</hi> it leaves all the dignities, authorities, and internal police of each States in <hi>free, full,</hi> and <hi>perfect condition;</hi> unleſs when national pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes make the control of them by the federal head or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, neceſſary to the <hi>general benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe powers of control by the federal head or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority are defined in the New Conſtitution, as minutely as may be, <hi>in their principle;</hi> and <hi>any detail</hi> of them which may become neceſſary, is committed to the wiſdom of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It extends the controlling power of the federal head to <hi>no one caſe,</hi> to which the juriſdiction or power of defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive deciſion of any one State <hi>can be competent.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. In every ſuch caſe, the <hi>controlling power</hi> of the fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head is abſolutely neceſſary to the <hi>ſupport, dignity, and benefit</hi> of the <hi>national government,</hi> and the <hi>ſafety of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals;</hi> neither of which can, by any poſſibility, be ſecured without it.</p>
            <p>All this falls in pretty well with <hi>Brutus'</hi>s ſentiments; for he does not think that the New Conſtitution in its <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate</hi> ſo very bad, but fears that it will <hi>not preſerve</hi> its purity of inſtitution, but, if adopted, will immediately verge to, and terminate in, <hi>a conſolidation, i. e.</hi> a deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State-governments. For argument, he ſuggeſts the <hi>avidity of power</hi> natural to rulers, and the <hi>eager graſp</hi> with which they hold it when obtained, and their ſtrong <hi>propenſity to abuſe</hi> their power, and <hi>encroach</hi> on the liberties of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="417" facs="unknown:023972_0424_0FC2A3F60D4648F0"/>
He dwells on the <hi>vaſt powers</hi> veſted in Congreſs by the New Conſtitution, <hi>i. e. of levying taxes, raiſing armies, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing federal courts, &amp;c.</hi> takes it for granted that all theſe powers will be <hi>abuſed</hi> and carried to an <hi>oppreſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;</hi> and then harangues on the dreadful caſe we ſhall be in, when our <hi>wealth</hi> is all devoured by taxes; our <hi>liberty</hi> deſtroyed by the power of the army; and our <hi>civil rights</hi> all ſacrificed by the unbounded power of the federal courts, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And when he has run himſelf out of breath with this dreary declamation, he comes to the concluſion he ſet out with, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the Thirteen States are <hi>too big</hi> for a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government, which requires <hi>ſmall territory,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſupported in <hi>more extenſive nations;</hi> that in large States <hi>liberty</hi> will ſoon be ſwallowed up, and loſt in the <hi>magnitude of power</hi> requiſite in the government, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If any concluſion at all can be drawn from this baſeleſs aſſemblage of gloomy thoughts, I think it muſt be <hi>againſt any union at all;</hi> againſt <hi>any kind of federal government.</hi> For nothing can be plainer than this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that the union cannot by any poſſibility be ſupported with ſucceſs, without adequate and effectual powers of government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt have <hi>money</hi> to ſupport the union, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the <hi>power of raiſing it</hi> muſt be lodged <hi>ſomewhere;</hi> we muſt have <hi>a military force,</hi> and, of conſequence, the power of <hi>raiſing and directing it</hi> muſt exiſt; <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>criminal cauſes</hi> of national concern will ariſe, therefore, there muſt be ſomewhere a power of appointing <hi>courts</hi> to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them.</p>
            <p>Theſe powers muſt be veſted in Congreſs; for nobody pretends to wiſh to have them veſted in any <hi>other body</hi> of men.</p>
            <p>The Thirteen States have a territory very extenſive, and inhabitants very numerous, and every day rapidly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore, the powers of government neceſſary to ſupport their union muſt be <hi>great</hi> in proportion. If the <hi>ſhip</hi> is large, the <hi>maſt</hi> muſt be proportionably great, or it will be impoſſible to make her ſail well. The federal powers muſt extend to <hi>every part</hi> of the federal territory,

               <hi>i. e.</hi> to the <hi>utmoſt limits</hi> of the United States, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of them; and muſt carry with them ſufficient <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to ſecure the <hi>execution</hi> of them; and theſe powers muſt be veſted <hi>in Congreſs,</hi> and the execution of them muſt be under <hi>their</hi> direction and control.</p>

               </gap> has been uſed to procure and form a <hi>good</hi> Congreſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>dignity and importance</hi> of their ſtation and character will afford all the inducements to virtue and effort, which can influence a mind <hi>capable</hi> of their force.</p>
            <p>Their own <hi>perſonal reputation,</hi> with the eyes of all the world on them,—the <hi>approbation of their fellow-citizens,</hi> which every man in public ſtation naturally wiſhes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and the <hi>dread of cenſure and ſhame,</hi>—all contribute ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forcible and ſtrong inducements to noble, upright, and worthy behaviour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>particular intereſt</hi> which every Member of Congreſs has in every public order and reſolution, is <hi>another ſtrong motive</hi> to right action. For every act to which any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber gives his ſanction, if it be raiſing an <hi>army,</hi> levying a <hi>tax,</hi> inſtituting a <hi>court,</hi> or any other act to bind the <hi>States,</hi> ſuch act will equally bind <hi>himſelf, his neareſt connexions, and his poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another mighty influence to the nobleſt principle of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be, <hi>the fear of God before their eyes;</hi> for while they ſit in the place of God, to give law, juſtice, and right to the States, they muſt be <hi>monſters indeed,</hi> if they do not regard <hi>his law,</hi> and imitate <hi>his character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all this will not produce <hi>a Congreſs fit to be truſted, and worthy of the public confidence,</hi> I think we may give the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up as impracticable. But ſtill we muſt make ourſelves as eaſy as we can, under a <hi>miſchief</hi> which admits <hi>no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and bear with patience an <hi>evil</hi> which cannot be <hi>cured:</hi> for <hi>a government</hi> we muſt have; there is no ſafety <hi>without</hi> it; tho' we know it will be imperfect, we ſtill muſt prefer it to <hi>anarchy or no government at all.</hi> It is the height of folly and madneſs to reject a <hi>neceſſary</hi> convenience, becauſe it is not a <hi>perfect</hi> good.</p>
            <p>UPON this ſtatement of facts and principles (for the truth and reality of which, I appeal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o every candid man) I beg leave to remark,</p>

               <pb n="420" facs="unknown:023972_0427_0FC2A403511F7FC8"/>
1. That the Federal Convention, in the Conſtitution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, have exerted their utmoſt to produce <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs worthy of the public confidence,</hi> who ſhall have <hi>abilities</hi> adequate to their important duty, and ſhall act under every poſſible inducement to execute it <hi>faithfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That this affords <hi>every chance</hi> which the nature of the thing will admit, <hi>of a wiſe and upright adminiſtration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Yet all this notwithſtanding, it is very poſſible that Congreſs <hi>may err, may abuſe or miſapply</hi> their powers, which no precaution of human wiſdom can prevent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is <hi>vain,</hi> it is <hi>childiſh,</hi> it is <hi>contentious</hi> to object to a Conſtitution thus framed and guarded, on pretence that the Commonwealth may ſuffer by a <hi>bad adminiſtration</hi> of it; or to <hi>withhold the neceſſary powers</hi> of government from the ſupreme rulers of it, leſt they ſhould <hi>abuſe or miſapply</hi> thoſe powers. This is an objection which will operate will equal force againſt <hi>every inſtitution</hi> that can be made in this world, whether of <hi>policy, religion, commerce,</hi> or <hi>any other human concern,</hi> which can require regulations: for it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to form any inſtitution however neceſſary, wiſe, and good, whoſe uſes may not be leſſened or deſtroyed by bad management.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Brutus</hi> or any body elſe can point out any <hi>checks, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</hi> or <hi>regulations,</hi> which have been hitherto omitted, which will make Congreſs more <hi>wiſe,</hi> more <hi>capable,</hi> more <hi>diligent,</hi> or more <hi>faithful,</hi> I am willing to attend to them.</p>
            <p>But to ſet Congreſs at the <hi>head</hi> of the government, and object to their being veſted with <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ſufficient power</hi> to manage all the great departments of it, appears to me <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,</hi> quite <hi>wild,</hi> and <hi>chimerical:</hi> it would produce a plan which would deſtroy itſelf as it went along, would be a ſort of counter-poſition of contrary parts, and render it impoſſible for rulers to render thoſe ſervices, and ſecure thoſe benefits, to the States, which are the only great ends of their appointment.</p>
            <p>The Conſtitution, under <hi>Brutus'</hi>s corrections, would ſtand thus, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Congreſs would have power to <hi>raiſe money,</hi> but muſt not direct the <hi>quantity,</hi> or <hi>mode of levying</hi> it; they might raiſe <hi>armies,</hi> but muſt not judge of the <hi>number</hi> of
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:023972_0428_0FC2A404F05AA980"/>
ſoldiers neceſſary, or <hi>direct</hi> their deſtination; they ought to provide for the <hi>general welfare,</hi> but muſt not be judges of what that welfare <hi>conſiſts in,</hi> or in <hi>what manner</hi> it is to be provided for; they might <hi>control</hi> the ſeveral States for <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined national purpoſes,</hi> but muſt not be judges of <hi>what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi> would come within that <hi>definition, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Any body with half an eye may ſee what ſort of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration the Conſtitution thus corrected would produce, <hi>e. g.</hi> it would require much greater trouble to leave the work <hi>undone,</hi> than would be neceſſary to get it <hi>well done,</hi> under a Conſtitution of ſufficient powers. If any one wiſhes to view more minutely this bleſſed operation, he may ſee a <hi>lively ſample</hi> of it in the <hi>laſt ſeven years'</hi> practice of our federal government.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Brutus</hi> all along founds his objections and fears on <hi>extreme caſes</hi> of abuſe or miſapplication of ſupreme powers, which may <hi>poſſibly</hi> happen under the adminiſtration of a <hi>wild, weak,</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> Congreſs; but it is eaſy to obſerve, that all inſtitutions are liable to <hi>extremes,</hi> but ought not <hi>to be judged by them;</hi> they do not <hi>often</hi> appear, and perhaps <hi>never</hi> may; but if they ſhould happen in the caſes ſuppoſed (which God forbid) there is <hi>a remedy pointed out in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution itſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not ſuppoſable that ſuch abuſes could riſe to any ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous height, before they would affect the States ſo much, that at leaſt <hi>two-thirds</hi> of them would unite in purſuing a remedy in the mode preſcribed by the Conſtitution, which will always be liable <hi>to amendment,</hi> whenever any miſchiefs or abuſes appear in the government, which the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in its preſent ſtate, cannot reach and correct.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Brutus</hi> thinks we can never be too much afraid of the <hi>encroaching avidity of rulers;</hi> but it is pretty plain, that however great the natural <hi>luſt of power in rulers</hi> may be, the <hi>jealouſy of the people in giving it</hi> is about equal; theſe two oppoſite paſſions will always operate in <hi>oppoſite</hi> direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to each other, and, like <hi>action and reaction</hi> in natural bodies, will ever tend to a <hi>good balance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At any rate, the Congreſs can never <hi>get</hi> more power than the people will <hi>give,</hi> nor <hi>hold</hi> it any longer than they
<pb n="422" facs="unknown:023972_0429_0FC2A40F4323D540"/>
will <hi>permit;</hi> for ſhould they aſſume tyrannical powers, and make encroachments on liberty without the conſent of the people, they would ſoon atone for their temerity with <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>diſgrace,</hi> and probably with their <hi>heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is here to be noted, that all the danger does not ariſe from <hi>the extreme</hi> of power <hi>in the rulers;</hi> for when the balance verges to the <hi>contrary extreme,</hi> and the power of the rulers becomes too much <hi>limited and cramped,</hi> all the nerves of government are weakened, and the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt unavoidably <hi>ſicken</hi> and <hi>loſe that energy</hi> which is abſolutely neceſſary for the ſupport of the <hi>State,</hi> and the ſecurity of the <hi>people.</hi> For it is a truth worthy of great attention, that laws are not made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> much for the <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> as for the <hi>wicked;</hi> who never fail to ſhelter themſelves <hi>from puniſhment</hi> whenever they can, under the <hi>defects of the law, and the weakneſs of government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now come to conſider the grand propoſition which <hi>Brutus</hi> ſets out with, concludes with, and interlards all along, and which ſeems to be the great giſt of his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>that a confederation of the Thirteen States into one great republic is not beſt for them:</hi> and goes on to prove by a variety of arguments, that <hi>a republican form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not compatible, and cannot be convenient to ſo extenſive a territory as the ſaid States poſſeſs.</hi> He begins by taking one aſſumption for granted (for I cannot ſee that his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prove it at all) <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the Conſtitution propoſed will <hi>melt down</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>juriſdiction</hi> of the particular States, and <hi>conſolidate</hi> them all into one <hi>great republic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot ſee the leaſt reaſon for this ſentiment, nor the leaſt <hi>tendency</hi> in the New Conſtitution to produce <hi>this effect.</hi> For the Conſtitution does not ſuffer the <hi>federal powers</hi> to <hi>control</hi> in the leaſt, or ſo much as to <hi>interfere in, the internal policy, juriſdiction,</hi> or <hi>municipal rights</hi> of any particular State; except where great and manifeſt <hi>national purpoſes and intereſts</hi> make that control neceſſary.</p>
            <p>It appears very evident to me, that <hi>the Conſtitution gives an eſtabliſhment, ſupport, and protection to the internal and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate police</hi> of each State, under the ſuperintendency of the federal powers, which it could not poſſibly enjoy in an
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:023972_0430_0FC2A412EBEF0E18"/>
independent ſtate. Under the confederation each State derives ſtrength, firmneſs, and permanency from its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the other States. Like <hi>a ſtave in a caſk well bound with hoops,</hi> it ſtands <hi>firmer,</hi> is not ſo eaſily <hi>ſhaken, bent,</hi> or <hi>broken,</hi> as it would be were it ſet up <hi>by itſelf alone,</hi> without any connexion with its neighbours.</p>
            <p>There can be no doubt that each State will receive from the union great <hi>ſupport and protection</hi> againſt the <hi>invaſions and inroads</hi> of foreign enemies, as well as againſt <hi>riots and inſurrections</hi> of their own citizens; and, of conſequence, the courſe of their internal adminiſtration will be ſecured by this means againſt any <hi>interruption or embarraſſment</hi> from either of theſe cauſes.</p>
            <p>They will alſo derive their <hi>ſhare of benefit</hi> from the <hi>reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability</hi> of the Union <hi>abroad,</hi> from the <hi>treaties</hi> and <hi>alliances</hi> which may be made with <hi>foreign nations, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another benefit they will receive from the control of the ſupreme power of the Union is this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from making <hi>angry, oppreſſive, and deſtructive laws;</hi> from declaring <hi>ruinous wars</hi> with their neighbours; from fomenting <hi>quarrels and controverſies, &amp;c.</hi> all which ever <hi>weaken</hi> a State, tend to its fatal <hi>diſorder,</hi> and often end in its diſſolution. <hi>'Righteouſneſs exalts</hi> and ſtrengthens <hi>a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſin is a reproach</hi> and weakening of <hi>any people.'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They will, indeed, have the privilege of oppreſſing <hi>their own citizens</hi> by bad <hi>laws</hi> or bad <hi>adminiſtration;</hi> but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the miſchief extends <hi>beyond their own State,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to affect the citizens of <hi>other States, ſtrangers,</hi> or the <hi>national welfare,</hi>—the ſalutary <hi>control</hi> of the ſupreme power will <hi>check the evil,</hi> and reſtore <hi>ſtrength and ſecurity,</hi> as well as <hi>honeſty and right,</hi> to the offending State.</p>
            <p>It appears then very plain, that the natural effect and tendency of the <hi>ſupreme powers</hi> of the Union is, to give <hi>ſtrength, eſtabliſhment, and permanency</hi> to the internal police and juriſdiction of <hi>each of the particular States;</hi> not to <hi>melt down and deſtroy,</hi> but to <hi>ſupport and confirm,</hi> them all.</p>
            <p>By what ſort of aſſurance, then, can <hi>Brutus</hi> tell us, that the New Conſtitution, <hi>if executed, muſt certainly and infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

republic, ſubverting all the State-authorities.</hi> His only argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that the federal powers <hi>may be corrupted, abuſed, and miſapplied,</hi> till this effect ſhall be produced. It is true, that the Conſtitution, <hi>like every other on earth</hi> committed to human management, <hi>may be corrupted by a bad adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and be made to operate to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the very capital benefits and uſes, which were the <hi>great end</hi> of its inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The ſame argument will prove, with equal cogency, that the Conſtitution of each particular State may be corrupted in practice, become tyrannical and inimical to liberty. In ſhort, the argument proves <hi>too much,</hi> and, therefore, proves <hi>nothing:</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is empty, childiſh, and futile, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious propoſal of it is, I conceive, an affront to the human underſtanding.</p>
            <p>But, after all, ſuppoſing this event ſhould take place, and, by ſome ſtrange fatality, the ſeveral States ſhould be <hi>melted down</hi> and <hi>merged</hi> in the great Commonwealth, in the form of <hi>counties</hi> or <hi>diſtricts;</hi> I do not ſee why <hi>a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth mode of government would not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s ſuitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the great State, as any other form whatever;</hi> I cannot ſee any ſufficient ground or reaſon for the poſition pretty often and boldly advanced, <hi>that a republican form of government can never be ſuitable for any nation of extenſive territory and numerous population.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if Congreſs can be choſen by the ſeveral States, tho' under the form and name of <hi>counties or election-diſtricts,</hi> and be in every reſpect inſtituted as directed by the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, I do not ſee but we ſhall have as ſuitable a <hi>nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al council,</hi> as wiſe a <hi>legiſlative,</hi> and as ſtrong and ſafe an <hi>executive, power,</hi> as can be obtained under any form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatever, let our territory be <hi>ever ſo extenſive or populous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt <hi>deſpotic monarch</hi> that can exiſt, muſt have <hi>his councils and officers</hi> of ſtate; and I cannot ſee any one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of their being appointed under <hi>a monarchy,</hi> that can afford any chance of their being any <hi>wiſer</hi> or <hi>better</hi> than <hi>ours may be.</hi> It is true, indeed, the deſpot may, if he pleaſes, act <hi>without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="425" facs="unknown:023972_0432_0FC2A41FE9C150D8"/>
ſo, I conceive it will be very rare that the nation will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive greater advantage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from his <hi>unadviſed edicts,</hi> than may be drawn from the <hi>deliberate acts</hi> and <hi>orders</hi> of our ſupreme powers. All that can be ſaid in favor of <hi>thoſe</hi> is, that they will have leſs chance of <hi>delay,</hi> and more of <hi>ſecrecy,</hi> than <hi>theſe;</hi> but I think it probable, that the latter will be grounded on <hi>better information</hi> and <hi>greater wiſdom,</hi> will carry <hi>more weight,</hi> and be <hi>better ſupported.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> roſe from ſmall beginnings to a very great extent of territory, population, and wiſdom; I do not think their conſtitution of government was near ſo good as the one propoſed to us, yet we find their power, ſtrength, and eſtabliſhment were raiſed to their utmoſt height under <hi>a republican form of government.</hi> Their State received very little acquiſition of territory, ſtrength, or wealth, <hi>after their government became imperial;</hi> but ſoon began to weaken and decay.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> acquired an amazing degree of ſtrength, wealth, and extent of dominion, under <hi>a republican form of government.</hi> Neither <hi>they</hi> nor the <hi>Romans</hi> owed their diſſolution to any cauſes ariſing from <hi>that kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> it was the <hi>party rage, animoſity,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of their citizens, which deſtroyed them both; <hi>i. e.</hi> weakened them, till <hi>the one</hi> fell under the power of their <hi>enemies,</hi> and was thereby reduced to ruin; <hi>the other</hi> changed their form of government to a monarchy, which proved in the end e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually fatal to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſame cauſes,</hi> if they cannot be reſtrained, will <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> or <hi>deſtroy</hi> any nation on earth, let their form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>No form of government can preſerve a nation, which cannot <hi>control the party rage of its own citizens;</hi> when any <hi>one citizen</hi> can riſe <hi>above the control</hi> of the laws, <hi>ruin</hi> draws near.

            <p>On the whole, I do not ſee but that any form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be ſafe and practicable, where the <hi>controlling authority</hi> of the ſupreme powers is <hi>ſtrong enough</hi> to effect the ends of its appointment, and, at the ſame time, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently <hi>che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Credit, in a commercial ſenſe, <hi>is the confidence which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple place in a man's integrity and punctuality in fulfilling his contracts and performing his engagements.</hi> When we ſpeak of a merchant of credit, we mean a merchant in whoſe ability, integrity, and punctuality in fulfilling his contracts and engagements, people have confidence, <hi>i. e.</hi> a man of integrity and truth, who is fit to be believed and truſted; the contrary or reverſe of this is a man of no integrity in his dealings, who will quibble and ſhuffle, evade his contracts, violate his word and truth, delay his payments,
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:023972_0435_0FC2A42434E08790"/>
diſappoint his creditors, uſe deceit, chicanery, and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> is not fit <hi>to be believed or truſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this view of the matter it appears, that credit is a moſt valuable thing in ſociety, it gives hearts-eaſe, it gives wealth, it is <hi>a nurſe of every ſocial virtue,</hi> it makes a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oil ſuitable for the growth of public ſpirit and every pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue; the worth and value of this may, perhaps, be beſt illuſtrated by comparing it or viewing it in contraſt with its contrary; how much better do we feel, how much richer do we grow, how much more eaſy, ſafe, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied do we enjoy ourſelves, when we live among citizens to whom we can give full credit, in whom we can have ſafe confidence, and whom we can truſt, than when we find ourſelves among people to whom we can give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, in whom we can have no confidence, and whom we cannot truſt, and where every concern or contract we make with them is attended with <hi>anxiety,</hi> uneaſineſs, and fear, and commonly followed by <hi>deceit, loſs,</hi> and <hi>diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> In this caſe, I deſire, I can need, no better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no better proof, no better explanation of my ſubject, than an appeal to the <hi>inſtant feelings</hi> of my fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
            <p>But however valuable and excellent in ſociety, however profitable and happyfying, however ſoothing to our warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſhes, <hi>credit public</hi> or <hi>private</hi> may be, <hi>it is in vain to hope for it, or even to imagine the poſſibility of its exiſtence, without its proper object, which is honeſty or integrity;</hi> it can no more be forced by laws, it can no more be obtruded by authority, however high and puiſſant, than an article of faith can be forced on the underſtanding, without proper proof or evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credit and honeſty are in their nature correlatives, and muſt and for ever will imply and ſupport each other.</hi> Integrity will generate credit and confidence the moment it is known in any part of the world; and the moment that integrity or honeſty is obſerved to ceaſe, the credit or confidence which was generated by it, inſtantly ceaſes too; it dies, it can never be brought to draw another breath, after the
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:023972_0436_0FC2A425CDDF0A68"/>
integrity which generated it and ſupplied all its vital mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is gone.</p>
            <p>It is here to be noted, that however neceſſary and even eſſential <hi>integrity</hi> is to <hi>credit,</hi> yet in a commercial ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> as far as it relates to trade, money, or wealth, it is not the <hi>only</hi> thing neceſſary; <hi>power or ability muſt be added;</hi> for however clear and plain it is, that an honeſt man will never contract beyond his power of performance, yet it often happens that his power of performance may be much leſſened between the time of <hi>contract</hi> and the time of <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by many incidents which may and often do take place, which at once leſſen his credit, or the confidence of his neighbours in his engagements.</p>
            <p>Theſe incidents often affect honeſt merchants ſo deeply, as to occaſion <hi>their failure or bankruptcy,</hi> and <hi>their</hi> failure often produces <hi>another</hi> in their creditors, that a <hi>third,</hi> and that a <hi>fourth, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of <hi>failures</hi> often origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in a <hi>ſwindler</hi> or <hi>raſcal,</hi> who knowingly contracts vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beyond his ability of performance, and, of courſe, ruins not only himſelf, but a numerous ſucceſſion of honeſt men.</p>
            <p>This affords us one inſtance of the vaſt miſchief which a community may and often does ſuffer, from <hi>one diſhoneſt man</hi> reſiding among them; very many others might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of like miſchief, effected in a great variety of ways, and to ſuch a degree that a <hi>national character</hi> may be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtained by the <hi>iniquity and knavery of a few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhows that it is of moſt ſerious conſequence to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry State, to uſe every poſſible means, not only to preſerve the national credit and character of their State in <hi>good pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and honor,</hi> but alſo to introduce, as far as may be, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of integrity and honor</hi> among their <hi>citizens,</hi> and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, as far as can be done, all ſuch villainous and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous practices, as naturally tend to diſgrace the <hi>national character,</hi> and ruin the fortunes of <hi>private</hi> citizens.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations will appear with greater force and advantage, if we recur for a moment to what I juſt now mentioned, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the great eaſe, ſatisfaction, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of living in a State where the <hi>public finance is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,</hi>
               <pb n="430" facs="unknown:023972_0437_0FC2A4272E8C6990"/>
that all private citizens can <hi>ſafely rely on the juſtice and punctuality of the public engagements,</hi> and where the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of honeſty and integrity are ſo general among the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> citizens, that they may ſafely truſt <hi>one another,</hi> ſo that credit and mutual confidence in each other may prevail thro' the community.</p>
            <p>Thus circumſtanced, every man may ſafely employ his ſtock in any buſineſs of advantage, either of merchandiſe, mechaniſm, or huſbandry; whereas if he lived in a State, and among citizens, of contrary character, <hi>he would be afraid to let his ſtock go out of his own keeping, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t it ſhould fall into hands, either public or private, which would retain it from him, ſo that he could not recover it again, tho' the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of improvement, both to the public and himſelf, might be very great and inviting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a State, and among citizens, ſo happily diſpoſed, <hi>any man,</hi> with induſtry and economy, tho' his means were ſmall, might <hi>live very eaſy and comfortable,</hi> and the <hi>man of fortune</hi> might <hi>improve</hi> his eſtate very ſafely and happily, to the great advantage both of the public and himſelf. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers would have every encouragement to flock in to ſuch a State, and thereby increaſe the population, and, of courſe, the commerce, manufactures, and huſbandry of it.</p>
            <p>From this view of the ſubject it appears ſtrikingly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>credit, both public and private,</hi> and the <hi>mutual confidence</hi> of citizens in the <hi>public juſtice</hi> and <hi>in each other,</hi> is of moſt momentous advantage, of moſt capital conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both to the public and to the individual members of it; it contributes moſt decidedly and eſſentially to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal eſtabliſhment, ſecurity, and ſafety of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſe, wealth, and happineſs of private citizens; therefore, it follows, that <hi>it is the high intereſt and great duty of every State to adopt and purſue every practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable method of ſecuring, enlarging, and extending to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree, all the advantages and bleſſings which can reſult from ſuch public and private credit, and the mutual confidence of the ſubjects of the State in the public and in each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wiſeſt and richeſt nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> long before we were born, have ſeen this ſubject and its moſt momentous
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:023972_0438_0FC2A42D9BD14AC8"/>
importance in a light ſo ſtrong and glaring, as induced them to adopt every practicable method in their power, to ſecure to themſelves ſuch invaluable advantages. In their <hi>practice</hi> we have an <hi>example,</hi> and in their <hi>ſucceſs</hi> we have <hi>encouragement,</hi> and very ſtrong <hi>inducement</hi> to imitate it.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, the richeſt trading cities of <hi>Europe</hi> long ſince adopted the plan of eſtabliſhing <hi>public</hi> BANKS; this plan they formed upon the moſt deliberate conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they had the greateſt opportunities of information, had the greateſt experience in the ſubject; they knew the <hi>importance, operation, and effects</hi> of both <hi>caſh and credit,</hi> the beſt of any men then in the world, as their trade and wealth were then the greateſt of any in the world. It is not to be ſuppoſed that their firſt eſſays reached the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubject, but they found advantages enough in their firſt trial, to induce them to continue the practice ever ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Genoa</hi> was the firſt State in <hi>Europe</hi> which eſtabliſhed a public bank; their bank of <hi>St. George</hi> was eſtabliſhed in 1407, by a public act of that republic. The plan was ſoon followed by <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe bank, which continues to this day with the greateſt advantage to the State, as well as to their private citizens, and has ever been in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reputation and credit both at home and thro' all <hi>Europe,</hi> was eſtabliſhed by a public act of their State.</p>
            <p>The city of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> long after followed their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their <hi>preſent bank</hi> received a public eſtabliſhment by an act of their States-General in 1609. The cities of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> adopted the ſame practice; and <hi>England,</hi> who is always phlegmatic and late in adopting the example of the other <hi>European</hi> States, inſtituted and eſtabliſhed its <hi>bank</hi> in 1694; and <hi>France,</hi> whoſe attention in thoſe days was little turned to improvements in trade, came later into it; their royal <hi>bank</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> was eſtabliſhed by public authority in 1718.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, very many other banks of leſs extent and conſequence, both public and private, are now eſtabliſhed in the greateſt trading cities and <hi>banks</hi> are become the
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:023972_0439_0FC2A42ED38227E8"/>
great receptacles of the <hi>caſh of Europe,</hi> and almoſt all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile receipts and payments are made thro' them.</p>
            <p>The bank of <hi>Genoa,</hi> indeed, failed in 1746, after that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public had, for a great length of time, enjoyed moſt ſignal and capital benefits from it; but its ruin was not brought on by <hi>any defect of its principle,</hi> or <hi>miſmanagement</hi> of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, but by the <hi>madneſs of the rulers</hi> of that State; they were not mad enough, indeed, to decry it as an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or dangerous inſtitution, but they adopted the contrary extreme, they magnified its ſtrength and power too much, and compelled the directors to make <hi>advances</hi> to the State, beyond what their <hi>funds</hi> would bear.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>banks</hi> have continued to this day, and with ſuch incredible and moſt acknowledged benefit to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral States in which they are eſtabliſhed, that their <hi>credit or decline</hi> has generally been conſidered as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort of <hi>ſure crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion of the ſtrength or weakneſs</hi> of the State in which they are eſtabliſhed. When nations are at war, they ever have thought it a ſure way to bring fatal embarraſſments on an enemy, if they can by any poſſible means <hi>ſhake the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of their bank;</hi> and every State has always been ready to go great lengths to <hi>ſupport their bank,</hi> if, by any turn of affairs, it has happened to be in diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>It muſt, therefore, be very abſurd to ſuppoſe that <hi>ſuch an inſtitution can be hurtful or even uſeleſs, that has ſtood the teſt of ſuch extenſive and durable trial and practice, among ſo many nations of the greateſt experience and moſt accurate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſubject;</hi> an inſtitution thro' which not only the caſh of <hi>private merchants,</hi> but of the greateſt and richeſt <hi>trading companies,</hi> and even the <hi>treaſure of nations,</hi> has been ſo long negotiated, and which, thro' ſo great a length of time, up to this very hour, ſupports its credit and character of vaſt utility, by the univerſal ſuffrage of nations, thro' all ranks of people, from crowns and the moſt dignified aſſemblies of ſtateſmen, and the moſt wealthy companies of merchants, down to the loweſt dealer.</p>
            <p>But all this notwithſtanding, people may be found, little acquainted with the ſubject, and wholly unexperienced in it, who will give their opinion <hi>that ſuch an inſtitution is
<pb n="433" facs="unknown:023972_0440_0FC2A432C51B8A78"/>
injurious to a State, and incompatible with the ſafety of it.</hi> This may be conſidered as an inſtance and proof of that height of abſurdity which people may arrive at, who grow <hi>zealous and poſitive in things they do not underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however well the nature of <hi>banks</hi> may be underſtood in <hi>Europe,</hi> and however immenſe the advantages and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which are derived from them may be, yet the thing is new in <hi>America,</hi> and by many people thought unfavora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of.</p>
            <p>The BANK OF NORTH-AMERICA, tho' eſtabliſhed by act of Congreſs (<hi>December</hi> 31, 1781) which is the higheſt authority of the Union, and recogniſed expreſsly by many of the States, and implicitly by them all, is nevertheleſs treated by many people here as a moſt dangerous and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing, utterly incompatible with the ſafety of the State, and, of courſe, they think it ought to be demoliſhed without ceremony, and that even the <hi>common forms</hi> of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution are unneceſſary, as people are not <hi>very nice</hi> in the manner, or <hi>delicate</hi> in the choice of means, of hunting down a <hi>beaſt of prey,</hi> or deſtroying a <hi>common enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as I ſuppoſe my fellow-citizens will ever be willing to <hi>hear</hi> before they <hi>condemn</hi> a thing that has <hi>once ſaved them,</hi> and very often afforded many of them a <hi>material conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> I apprehend a ſhort diſſertation, ſhowing the nature of a bank, will not be unacceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> BANK <hi>is a large repoſitory of caſh, depoſited under the direction of proper officers</hi> (ſay, a preſident and directors) <hi>for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing and ſupporting a great and extenſive credit, to be made uſe of in every caſe where an eſtabliſhed cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit will anſwer in exchange or payment as well as caſh, or better than caſh, as in many circumſtances will manifeſtly and undoubtedly be the caſe:</hi> for inſtance, ſuppoſe this State ſhould incorporate a <hi>bank,</hi> and order all the <hi>revenues of the State</hi> to be paid <hi>into it,</hi> and ſhould direct that all the <hi>debts of the State</hi> ſhould be paid in checks on the bank, or in bank-bills, payable to the bearer, which bearer ſhould have liberty, whenever he pleaſes, to carry his bill to the bank, and receive caſh for it, and ſhould direct further, that if ſuch bank-bills, in any circumſtance, happen to ſuit any
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:023972_0441_0FC2A43950DE86F8"/>
citizen <hi>better than caſh,</hi> he ſhould be at liberty to carry his <hi>caſh</hi> to the bank, and take out <hi>bank-bills</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>The effect or operation of ſuch a bank, when its credit becomes eſtabliſhed (<hi>i. e.</hi> when the people at large believed with full confidence that the fund or ſtock was ſufficient, and the management fair and upright) I ſay, the operation or effect of ſuch a bank would be, that very few of the people who ſhould be poſſeſſed of ſuch bank-bills, would carry them into the bank, and receive caſh for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bills would anſwer by far the greateſt part of the purpoſes of caſh as well as ſpecie, <hi>i. e.</hi> they would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any kind of commodities, and pay any kind of debts, as well as caſh, as we find is the caſe of the bank-bills of the <hi>Bank of North-America,</hi> at this time.</p>
            <p>Further, ſuch bills would not only be as good as ſpecie for almoſt every purpoſe where caſh is uſed or needed, but, on many accounts, they would be better than caſh, as any ſum of them is <hi>eaſier</hi> and more certainly <hi>counted</hi> than caſh; the danger of <hi>counterfeits</hi> would be leſs; the <hi>carriage</hi> would be eaſier; they would be leſs expoſed to <hi>thefts</hi> and <hi>robberies</hi> than caſh (for a man can conceal from a thief 1000 dollars in bills, or run from a robber with them, eaſier than with 1000 dollars of ſilver); in caſe they are deſtroyed by <hi>fire, water,</hi> or <hi>other accident,</hi> they are not <hi>loſt,</hi> but on proof made at the bank, they may be replaced, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The advantage would be ſtill greater, if, inſtead of bank-bills, the owner would take <hi>a bank credit,</hi> and <hi>draw checks</hi> on the bank whenever he needed his money; this would enable him to pay any ſum <hi>exactly,</hi> without the trouble of <hi>making change;</hi> he would be able in any future time <hi>to prove his payments,</hi> if he preſerved his checks which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cancelled from the bank, as every man ought to do; this would at once free him from all danger of loſs by <hi>fire, robbers, miſlaying, dropping them on the road, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> This practice is found by experience to be ſo very convenient, that it is almoſt <hi>univerſally adopted</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> people who keep their caſh in our preſent bank.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many other advantages which bank-bills or bank-credit have beyond what caſh can have, would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:023972_0442_0FC2A445A0E27118"/>
induce moſt people <hi>to prefer bills</hi> or <hi>bank credit</hi> to <hi>caſh,</hi> and, of courſe, very few poſſeſſors of either would demand caſh at the bank; the conſequence of which would be, that at the end of the year much of the caſh would remain in the bank, tho' the whole amount of the bank-ſtock ſhould have been paid out in bills, and been conſtantly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating among the people, with every advantage that <hi>caſh could have,</hi> and many other very valuable advantages that <hi>caſh could not have,</hi> as has been juſt now ſhown.</p>
            <p>The benefits or uſes of the bank, when thus eſtabliſhed, are various: 1. <hi>The bank gains all the loſt paper,</hi> i. e. <hi>all ſuch bank-bills as are loſt (where the loſs cannot be proved) and, of courſe, can never be brought to the bank for redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or payment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The bank can, on any public emergency, <hi>emit bank-bills beyond the amount of the caſh or ſtock in the bank,</hi> and, of courſe, can have the benefit of a conſiderable ſum to circulate or uſe for the public benefit, without paying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or <hi>having it known to an enemy that they are embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed or in debt.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the exigencies of the State ſhould not require this, <hi>they may accommodate their citizens with diſcounts or loans on intereſt, to the great increaſe of the bank-ſtock or revenue,</hi> as well as doing great favor to individuals, and increaſing the trade, manufactures, and huſbandry of the State; <hi>this is the beſt and perhaps the only proper way of ſupporting a public loan-office in a State.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the revenues ſhould increaſe beyond the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the State, <hi>they will accumulate in the bank till the amount may be very great;</hi> and a rich State, like a rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, derives many and great advantages from wealth, and even from the reputation of wealth.</p>
            <p>Theſe advantages have been found by experience to be much greater, vaſtly greater, than a ſanguine ſpeculator, upon a bare view of the nature of the ſubject, would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. <hi>The force and energy of credit, perfectly well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and permanent, is vaſt almoſt beyond conception;</hi> it is found by experience to ſupply the place of caſh, and much better than caſh, in almoſt all tranſactions, except in ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes,
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:023972_0443_0FC2A4483A415480"/>
where ſmall change is neceſſary, ſuch as travelling expenſes, market-money, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is alſo found by experience, that any ſum of money in the ſtock of a bank well regulated and managed, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport the credit of <hi>double or treble its amount in bank-bills,</hi> whilſt each of thoſe bills is indiſputably as good as caſh, becauſe <hi>the poſſeſſor may at any time exchange them at the bank for ſolid hard money, whenever, either thro' diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of the bank, or his own conveniency, he may chooſe to do it;</hi> it follows then,</p>
            <p n="5">5. That a good bank may increaſe the circulating medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of a State to double or treble the quantity of real caſh, without increaſing the real money, or <hi>incurring the leaſt danger of a depreciation.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>A good bank will receive no money but good coin of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard weight and fineneſs,</hi> and this will naturally and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably keep the current coin, caſh, or medium <hi>good,</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its <hi>defects;</hi> for if, by any means, a debaſed or light coin, or public bills of depreciated value, ſhould gain a currency in any State (all which have often happened) the ſtandard of the bank will diſcover their defects, <hi>and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or agio of ſuch depreciated money and that of the bank, will at once determine the true or real value of ſuch depreciated currency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Another capital uſe and advantage of a bank is, <hi>that it makes one of the beſt repoſitories for money that is deſigned to lie for any great length of time on intereſt,</hi> as it affords a much better ſecurity than can be found in the hands of any private man, and the half-yearly dividends are more than equal to any profit that can be derived from them when put to intereſt on mortgage, and the punctuality of payment better ſecured, and the trouble of collection much leſs.</p>
            <p>Such monies as are here intended, are <hi>legacies or any other proviſion which is made for young children,</hi> to be paid to them with the intereſt, at their full age; <hi>any proviſion which a man may wiſh to make for himſelf or wife, againſt old age;</hi> the funds of <hi>public inſtitutions of religion or charity,</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, &amp;c. &amp;c. And as bank-ſtock of a good bank can at any time <hi>be ſold for caſh,</hi> the bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſureſt fund to produce the principal caſh repoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, when needed, and alſo the intereſt in the mean time, which may be uſed, if needed, when it is paid in, or may be added to the principal in the bank.</p>
            <p>This will appear to be a very important uſe of a bank, if we attend to the ſubject a little, eſpecially to the caſe of <hi>orphans and infants,</hi> and ſee in how many ways they are <hi>defrauded or ſomehow deprived of the caſh. which their parents have carefully laid up for them,</hi> whilſt their infancy prevents their taking care of it themſelves.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another great uſe of a good bank is, <hi>that it probably may very much promote economy and induſtry,</hi> as <hi>particularly in many of the fore-mentioned inſtances,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> when a man is engaged in accumulating any ſum of money for any capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal purpoſe, ſuch as making proviſion for his infant chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or himſelf in old age, or for a heavy purchaſe, or any other deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n which lies near his heart, he will be very induſtrious, and his economy will be very good, till he has <hi>made up his heap,</hi> or got the <hi>neceſſary ſum</hi> together, and by that time he may perhaps have acquired ſuch habits of induſtry and economy, that he may not ſtop at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of the ſum firſt propoſed, but may be induced to keep on and enlarge it beyond the original deſign.</p>
            <p>The bank gives a ſure operation to ſuch a ſcheme, at leaſt in point of ſafe keeping and punctual payment. Neighbours may ſee the example and its advantages, and fall into it themſelves, and ſo on till the inſtances of ſuch accumulations, and, of courſe, of ſuch economy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, may become general among monied men thro' the State, to the great advantage and ſtrength of the State, the bank, and themſelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe are only <hi>a few of the benefits derived from a bank,</hi> which our ſhort experience will enable us clearly to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:023972_0445_0FC2A4538ABFA5E0"/>
and which in point of <hi>fact or reality</hi> are demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame experience ſo clearly and fully, as to put the matter beyond a doubt. I do not pretend to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the great ſubject enough to explain all the infinite uſes and advantages which the long experience of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cities of <hi>Europe</hi> has found reſulting from banks, or the ſtill greater advantages which a further experience may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover either to them or to us; but theſe are certainly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to induce every friend to the integrity, wealth, and honor, intereſt and genuine reſpectability of his country, to think favorably of the ſubject, and to exert all proper endeavours to participate of its uſes.</p>
            <p>But to purſue the matter further—ſuppoſe a number of <hi>private citizens</hi> form a bank, each of whom puts in one or more ſhares, and raiſe in that way a bank-ſtock of any proper ſum (ſay, 1,000,000 dollars) for a fund to ſupport a large and extenſive credit, for the purpoſe of <hi>depoſits, loans,</hi> and <hi>diſcounts,</hi> and appoint proper officers to manage the ſame, and obtain a public eſtabliſhment by <hi>a charter,</hi> or <hi>other public act</hi> of the government; this will be <hi>a private bank,</hi> becauſe the ſtock of it is the money of private men, and the officers or directors are appointed by private ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; <hi>but it may in ſome ſenſe be deemed public,</hi> both on account of its <hi>extenſive utility and public importance,</hi> and the <hi>public patronage and eſtabliſhment</hi> it receives from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>This bank will have a nature and operation ſimilar to the other, and will a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ord the ſame kind of convenience to the citizens who chooſe to be concerned in it, and in both caſes the particular profits of the bank will go to the ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the private ſtockholders, whoſe contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions compoſe the ſtock, or to the State, as far as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic funds are veſted in bank-ſtock, if it ſhould be thought proper to veſt any part of the public treaſure in ſuch ſtock, but the <hi>management</hi> of it would be excluſively under the conduct of its <hi>own ſtockholders and directors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this kind is the BANK OF NORTH-AMERICA, and has a much greater capital (about 900,000 dollars) than any <hi>ſtate-bank</hi> can have in the preſent condition of our
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:023972_0446_0FC2A454EF4D96B0"/>
finances, and its operation, effects, and uſes are much more extenſive, and its accommodations to the citizens, and even to the State, much greater than a ſtate-bank could have; this may afford one anſwer to an objection which ſome may raiſe againſt the preſent bank, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it would be better to diſcontinue the preſent bank, and erect a ſtate or public bank in its ſtead;</hi> another anſwer may be, <hi>that no plan of this ſort can be ſo ſure of a proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement under the State, as it would be under the direction of its own proprietors.</hi> A bank is a ſort of mercantile inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or at leaſt has ſuch a cloſe connexion with the whole mercantile intereſt, that it will more naturally and properly fall under the direction of merchants, than of any other ſort of men leſs acquainted with its nature and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and leſs intereſted in its ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon is, that a bank, whoſe ſtock is made up by the ſubſcription of private men, and managed by the ſtockholders, is the <hi>ſureſt antidote or preſervative againſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny in the government, that can be named;</hi> its owners are the <hi>rich men</hi> of the State, who will never be concerned in <hi>needleſs popular clamors</hi> or <hi>ſedition</hi> againſt the government, but, at the ſame time, have both <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>inducement</hi> enough to be a <hi>check</hi> and <hi>reſtraint</hi> on government, when it becomes <hi>oppreſſive,</hi> and <hi>really verges towards tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rich have an intereſt in their poor fellow-citizens, and (as ſome men uſe their wives) however tyrannical they may be <hi>themſelves,</hi> they will not ſuffer <hi>any body elſe</hi> to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize over them. Trade and banks cannot flouriſh in a <hi>deſpotic government,</hi> and, of courſe, where they do exiſt, they will keep <hi>deſpotiſm,</hi> as far as poſſible, <hi>out of the State.</hi> The ſtockholders are too numerous, too much ſcattered, of ſentiments and connexions too different, to admit any danger of becoming <hi>tyrants themſelves.</hi> I never heard an inſtance of a State whoſe government was corrupted by a <hi>private</hi> bank.</p>
            <p>But a <hi>ſtate-bank,</hi> if we could poſſibly ſuppoſe that it would be <hi>well managed,</hi> and <hi>grow rich, would tend immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and directly to tyranny in the government,</hi> becauſe it would give the miniſter or ruler the command of a vaſt
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:023972_0447_0FC2A456793C4860"/>
ſum of money; and I never knew a <hi>rich treaſury</hi> at the command of a <hi>miniſter,</hi> whoſe head was not <hi>turned by it,</hi> and the inſanity never fails to take <hi>a direction towards ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better way, I ſhould think, would be <hi>to join both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as that all the ſtate-revenues may be paid into the bank, and all public payments be made by checks on the bank,</hi> and let the State become <hi>ſtockholders</hi> as far as they pleaſe, and take ſums out of the bank to the amount of their ſtock, whenever it is neceſſary.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Many advantages would ariſe from this method:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The bank is more reſponſible for any deficiency than any private man can be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It has <hi>the beſt convenience and ſecurity</hi> for <hi>ſafe keeping</hi> the caſh depoſited in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. No miniſter or other man <hi>can pay away</hi> public money otherwiſe than <hi>by a check on the bank,</hi> which is in ſome degree a <hi>matter of notoriety,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a <hi>reſponſibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The receipts and payments would <hi>be ſettled up</hi> to a ſhilling (according to the cuſtom of the bank) at leaſt <hi>once a month.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>commiſſion</hi> or <hi>allowance</hi> to a treaſurer for this ſervice <hi>would be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as the bank would be very willing to undertake the buſineſs of <hi>receiving</hi> all or any part of the public revenue, and <hi>paying</hi> the ſame out, without <hi>any commiſſion or ſalary, i. e.</hi> without any <hi>allowance</hi> or <hi>charge</hi> for the ſervice; this would be a <hi>great ſaving,</hi> even if the commiſſion allowed to a treaſurer was not more than a <hi>real compenſation</hi> for the ſervice.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>This will anſwer every purpoſe of <hi>the State</hi> as well as a <hi>ſtate-bank,</hi> will increaſe the ſtock of the preſent bank, and, of courſe, extend the power and energy of it ſo much, that it will be able to ſupply the neceſſities of the State with <hi>any loans of caſh,</hi> which (without the moſt violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions) can ever be neceſſary; and, at the ſame time, would be able to afford moſt ample accommodations to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate citizens or companies, to the vaſt benefit and increaſe, not only of private fortunes, but of our <hi>trade, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and <hi>huſbandry</hi> in general.</p>
            <p>The preſent funds of the BANK OF NORTH-AMERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CA, or the caſh which ſupports it, is, 1ſt. <hi>the bank-ſtock,</hi> or the money paid in by the ſtock-holders, which is about 900,000 dollars: and, 2d. the <hi>money depoſited</hi> by men of all deſcriptions, who may draw it out by checks on the bank whenever they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="441" facs="unknown:023972_0448_0FC2A4581E163988"/>
Theſe ſums are variable, indeed, but always very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as no perſon ever draws checks <hi>beyond his depoſit,</hi> very few ever draw <hi>quite up,</hi> and very many people have large ſums there, becauſe their <hi>caſh lies in the bank</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>more ſecure,</hi> but is more <hi>convenient</hi> for payments <hi>there,</hi> than it could be in the <hi>keeping</hi> of its owner.</p>
            <p>Some objections have been made to the preſent bank, which it may be proper to conſider—</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Such vaſt ſums of money are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oarded up in the bank, that caſh is become ſcarce</hi> in town and country. I anſwer,—This is not true in fact:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>the bank circulates daily more caſh than it has in the bank,</hi> and, of courſe, makes caſh plentier than it would be, if we had no bank. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A very great part of the bank-ſtock, on the ſtrength of which the bank iſſues and ſupports the circulation it gives out, belongs not to this State or its neighbourhood, but to people who live in diſtant parts,</hi> to whom it muſt be remitted if the bank ſhould be broke up.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Another objection is, that monied men find a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in purchaſing bank-ſtock than in letting their money on intereſt to people in the country, as formerly was done, and, of courſe, tho' the monied men in town may gain by the bank, yet the country-people ſuffer by it.</hi>—This is a ſtrange ſort of ſentiment to appear in form of an objection; becauſe the bank enhances the value, or increaſes the uſe, of caſh or any other property, ſo that the poſſeſſor can be more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it than before; therefore, the bank is hurtful.</p>
            <p>The ſame cauſe (<hi>i. e.</hi> the bank) raiſes the price of wheat and flour, to the benefit of the <hi>country farmer,</hi> indeed, but to the damage of the <hi>merchant</hi> in town, who muſt pay more for them than before; if our country produce was all conſumed in the State, theſe miſchiefs and benefits would balance one another; becauſe what one citizen loſt, another would gain; but a very conſiderable part of our produce is exported and paid for by foreigners; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the higher the price, the greater is the benefit to the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="442" facs="unknown:023972_0449_0FC2A4626CDCCD60"/>
But this evil complained of <hi>does not originate in the bank,</hi> but in quite <hi>different</hi> cauſes; many monied men who uſed to lend money on intereſt, have loſt their money <hi>by the war, by the enemy, or by the depreciation of money, or by eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of payment</hi> which have been introduced ſince, and, of courſe, have <hi>no money</hi> to lend; and all who have any, have found the danger of letting it in the old way ſo great, that few will venture into it again; and, laſtly, the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is hardly true in fact; <hi>becauſe any man in the country who has credit enough in town to get a good indorſer, can have money out of the bank, as well as a merchant of the city.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Another objection to the bank is, <hi>that the diſcounts of the bank make money of ſuch eaſy acquirement, that it induces merchants to</hi> over-trade <hi>their ſtocks, and diſſipating young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to</hi> ſpend <hi>their money</hi> faſter <hi>than they would do, if it was harder to get it.</hi> I believe this is all true, and not only ariſes from, but is an actual proof of, the <hi>great convenience</hi> and <hi>public utility</hi> of the bank.</p>
            <p>This is juſt of the nature of all other objections againſt a <hi>good thing;</hi> becauſe it may be made an <hi>ill uſe</hi> of; and will prove that a <hi>good farm</hi> is worſe than a <hi>bad one,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes the farmer <hi>lazy,</hi> in as much as a little work on good land will raiſe his bread; <hi>good victuals and drink</hi> are worſe than <hi>bad,</hi> becauſe <hi>gluttons</hi> and <hi>drunkards</hi> will eat and drink to <hi>exceſs;</hi> a <hi>loving wife</hi> is worſe than a <hi>croſs one,</hi> becauſe her huſband will be apt to lie in bed <hi>too long</hi> with her; and <hi>riches</hi> are worſe than <hi>poverty,</hi> becauſe they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>luxury, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> But I cannot be made to believe that bleſſings ought to be driven out of the State, becauſe ſome people will make <hi>an ill uſe</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ever believe that it is eaſier living in a place where a man can raiſe a ſum of ready caſh on any emergency, without delay or difficulty, than where ſuch a thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obtained without great delay, trouble, or perhaps ſelling property to great diſadvantage for it. Such a faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is an advantage which, I think, is not to be deſpiſed or eaſily parted with.</p>
            <p>IV. Another objection is, <hi>that all the benefits of the bank centre in the city and near confines of it, but the country reaps
<pb n="443" facs="unknown:023972_0450_0FC2A4673A5E69D0"/>
no advantage from it.</hi> I anſwer,—ſuppoſe this was true (which cannot well be admitted) as it coſts the country no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, why do they begrudge the advantages of it to the city? I dare ſay the inhabitants of the city would all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice moſt heartily to ſee the country in full enjoyment of every advantage and convenience of life, that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from nature or art.</p>
            <p>But it is very evident that the country derives a great advantage from the bank, for <hi>the richer the merchants are, and the greater their trade, the better market they afford for the produce of the country.</hi> This is a particular of capital conſequence to the country, for their huſbandry is <hi>animated and ſupported</hi> by their <hi>market;</hi> indeed, the huſbandman and the merchant ever <hi>mutually ſupport and benefit</hi> each other: and it is ſcarcely poſſible that <hi>either</hi> of them ſhould be benefited or hurt, but the <hi>other</hi> will be affected by it.</p>
            <p>V. Another objection is, <hi>that the great wealth of the bank will give it an undue influence on the government.</hi> There is no doubt but wealth creates influence; but it is that ſort of influence which has ever been found ſafe to the State. Our bank is a ſort of mercantile inſtitution, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of merchants is the ſafeſt of any that can affect a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>parſon</hi> lives on the <hi>ſins</hi> of the people, the <hi>doctor</hi> on their <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> and the <hi>lawyer</hi> on their <hi>diſputes</hi> and <hi>quarrels</hi> (and, I ſuppoſe, they all think they ought to <hi>pray</hi> for their <hi>daily bread</hi>) but the merchant lives on the <hi>wealth</hi> of the people. He never wiſhes for a poor cuſtomer or a poor country; the richer his cuſtomers are, the more they can purchaſe, and the better payments they can make to him. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant has every inducement to ſeek and promote the <hi>wealth</hi> of the State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wealth rarely begets ſedition;</hi> that baneful production ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſprings from <hi>poverty, vice, and diſappointment.</hi> Theſe are the characters which find an intereſt in fiſhing in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters. We have, perhaps, no inſtance of a nation ruined by its merchants. I never heard of a State diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>private bank;</hi> but inſtances are plenty enough of States <hi>ſerved and ſaved</hi> by ſuch a bank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="444" facs="unknown:023972_0451_0FC2A46892E4BB20"/>
On the whole, I think it abſurd to baniſh wealth from a State, for fear it ſhould gain <hi>too much influence</hi> in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or <hi>generate faction</hi> in the State; but of all kinds of wealth, <hi>a bank would be the leaſt likely to produce theſe effects,</hi> becauſe the ſtock-holders of the bank are made up of <hi>all parties,</hi> and are as likely to balance each other's influence <hi>there,</hi> as in <hi>any other part of the State.</hi> It would, in my opinion, be much more politic, to make a <hi>levelling act,</hi> to prevent the great wealth of <hi>individuals,</hi> who are much more likely to become dangerous to the State, than any <hi>aggregate bodies</hi> of men, however wealthy they may be.</p>
            <p>VI. Another objection is, <hi>that the general benefits of a bank depend on the integrity of the directors, who may, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways, by a corrupt or partial management, deſtroy theſe uſes, or make the whole ſtock of the bank ſubſervient to the intereſts of a few favorites, and, of courſe, the great body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt be excluded from the advantages of it.</hi> I anſwer,—this is an objection that may be made with equal force againſt every inſtitution on earth; none of which are ſo good and beneficial, but their uſes may be leſſened or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by corrupt management; and when our directors are called upon to vindicate themſelves againſt any ſuch charge, it will be time enough to think of an anſwer: in the mean time, the preſent internal ſtrength and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our bank demonſtrate, that the management of the directors has been conducted with great prudence.</p>
            <p>I here beg leave to ſubjoin <hi>a ſhort hiſtory of the Bank of North-America, with an account of ſome great difficulties it hath had to ſtruggle with from its firſt commencement (four years ago) down to this time,</hi> and to make <hi>ſome remarks on its preſent ſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. I ſhall attempt to give a ſhort hiſtory of our bank.—It being obſerved that the <hi>finances</hi> of the wiſeſt and beſt regulated States of <hi>Europe,</hi> have for a long time been <hi>nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated thro' their banks,</hi> or at leaſt been ſo <hi>cloſely connected</hi> with them, as to derive the moſt <hi>capital benefits</hi> and <hi>aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> from them, mr <hi>Morris,</hi> in 1781, when our finances were in a criſis almoſt deſperate, I ſay, mr. <hi>Morris,</hi> being then <hi>Financier-General,</hi> adopted the ſcheme of forming a
<pb n="445" facs="unknown:023972_0452_0FC2A46C37EFF628"/>
bank in <hi>America,</hi> which was propoſed to and approved by Congreſs, to which <hi>a thouſand ſhares, of 400 dollars</hi> each, were ſoon ſubſcribed, and application was made to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for <hi>a charter of incorporation,</hi> which was granted by their <hi>public ordinance of December 31, 1781.</hi> It appears by the preamble of ſaid ordinance, that Congreſs approved and adopted the ſcheme <hi>from a conviction of the ſupport which the</hi> finances <hi>of the United States would receive from a national bank,</hi> and that <hi>the exigencies of the United States made it indiſpenſably neceſſary</hi> that ſuch a bank ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated.</p>

            <p>In the reſolution laſt mentioned, Congreſs recommended to all the States to make all neceſſary laws <hi>for ſupport of the</hi> BANK, and in particular to make it felony to counterfeit the bank-notes, ſeal of the bank, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The State of Pennſylvania recogniſed not only the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations, by their act of March</hi> 18, 1782, againſt counterfeiting bank-bills, &amp;c. but by another act of <hi>April</hi> 1, 1782, counting upon the act of Congreſs incorporating the bank, did grant an act of incorporation to the bank, ſimilar to, and in the ſame words of, that of Congreſs, enacting THAT THOSE WHO ARE AND THOSE WHO SHALL BECOME SUBSCRIBERS TO THE SAID BANK, BE AND FOR EVER HEREAFTER SHALL BE, A CORPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RATION
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:023972_0453_0FC2A46DC601AC88"/>
AND BODY POLITIC, BY THE NAME AND STILE OF THE PRESIDENT, DIRECTORS, AND COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PANY OF THE BANK OF NORTH-AMERICA.</p>
            <p>By theſe public acts, the ſubſcribers to the bank conſider themſelves and their property in the bank <hi>for ever,</hi> under the moſt ſolemn and ſacred <hi>ſanction and protection of the law, and guarantied in the moſt effectual manner conceivable by the public faith,</hi> pledged to them both by Congreſs and the State; for it is not poſſible that the public faith can be plighted more ſolemnly and more effectually by any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme or ſubordinate authority, than by a <hi>formal public act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under this ſacred ſanction of the law, and fully confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the honor, juſtice, and even contract, of our Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, the Directors, in <hi>January</hi> 1784, reſolving to make their inſtitution as extenſive and uſeful as poſſible, opened their books <hi>for new ſubſcriptions.</hi> Under the <hi>inducement and encouragement of theſe firm eſtabliſhments,</hi> very many perſons, both citizens and foreigners, became ſubſcribers, <hi>and placed their money in our bank;</hi> the amount of the new ſubſcriptions, after the charter of this State was obtained, was above 500,000 dollars. Old men placed the money deſigned for the ſupport of their old age in the bank; the money of widows and orphans likewiſe was lodged there, as well as the monies of the merchants, and every other deſcription of men.</p>
            <p>The amount of the old and new ſubſcriptions aroſe up to the vaſt ſum of 900,000 dollars, which is the preſent amount of the ſtock of the bank, a vaſt ſum indeed for the new beginnings of <hi>America,</hi> tho' ſmall when compared with the immenſe ſtock of ſome <hi>European</hi> banks.—With the depoſits and this great capital ſtock (which was perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and not liable to be withdrawn by the proprietors, as the depoſited monies were) with the depoſits and the permanent ſtock, I ſay, the bank was in condition with great ſafety <hi>to make ſuch extenſive negotiations, as could afford very capital accommodations both to the public and to private ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,</hi> whenever their occaſions and exigencies made the aſſiſtance of the bank neceſſary to them.</p>

               <pb n="447" facs="unknown:023972_0454_0FC2A4718A720E98"/>
So great was its ſucceſs, and ſo amazing were its effects, that it appears by the bank-books, that its caſh-account in one year, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from <hi>January</hi> 1, 1784, to <hi>January</hi> 1, 1785 (the third year of its operation) amounted to the almoſt incredible ſum of 59,570,000 Mexican dollars; and tho' the attacks upon the bank, and many other difficulties which much diminiſhed its negotiations in the ſucceeding year, were ſo great as ſeemed <hi>almoſt fatal,</hi> yet ſuch was its <hi>great internal ſtrength,</hi> and the <hi>energy</hi> of its <hi>very nature,</hi> that its tranſactions from <hi>January</hi> 1, 1785, to <hi>January</hi> 1, 1786, amounted to about 37,000,000 dollars.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>I now proceed to give ſome account of the difficulties which the bank has had to ſtruggle with, from its firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning down to this time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt difficulties aroſe from the novelty of the thing.</hi> The Directors were engaged in a buſineſs in which they had no experience (nothing of the kind having ever before been practiſed in <hi>America</hi>) and tho' they acted with the greateſt conſideration, care, and caution poſſible, yet all this notwithſtanding, it is hardly ſuppoſable but <hi>ſome errors in management muſt have been committed.</hi> Theſe (if any have happened) by experience will be diſcovered, and by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be corrected and avoided in future time, but they form no concluſion againſt the <hi>principles</hi> of the bank or its <hi>natural</hi> utility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſame novelty of the thing prevented a general confidence in the bank at firſt among the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was further unlucky, that the bank was firſt opened <hi>at a time when the people had ſo often been diſappointed and deceived in every ſpecies of public propoſitions and engagements relative to money, that they knew not whom they could truſt;</hi> they heſitated leſt they ſhould be taken in by the bank, as they had often been by very numerous propoſals to which their confidence had been courted. But the <hi>fidelity</hi> of the Directors, and the <hi>perfect punctuality of all payments</hi> at the bank, ſoon got the better of this diffidence, and the bank gained an almoſt univerſal <hi>credit</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> among the people, even among its profeſſed and bittereſt enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="448" facs="unknown:023972_0455_0FC2A47B00AFA8C0"/>
2. Another difficulty with the bank has ever been, that <hi>the balance of foreign trade has been againſt America, ever ſince the bank was firſt eſtabliſhed.</hi> This has occaſioned ſuch great exportations of caſh as render it ſcarce, and, of courſe, embarraſſes all caſh buſineſs. This muſt deeply affect the bank, as it is obvious at firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight to every one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another ſort of difficulties aroſe <hi>from numerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who, from different motives, embarraſſed the operation of the bank much;</hi> they began with crying up the <hi>public uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of the inſtitution, and its great profits to the ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, and thought that one ſet of men ought not to monopolize the reputation and opportunity of doing ſo much good, and engroſſing ſuch great profits to themſelves, and withal threw out hints, importing that the Directors were <hi>haughty, partial, and not obliging enough, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To remedy all which, in 1784 they ſet on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oot <hi>a ſcheme for a new bank, by the name of the Bank of Pennſylvania,</hi> got large ſubſcriptions for a fund to begin with, and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the Aſſembly of this State for a charter, &amp;c. not a word was heard all this time againſt the bank, <hi>as an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution hurtful to the States or individuals,</hi> but its <hi>miſchiefs</hi> were made to grow out of its <hi>great utility</hi> and <hi>ſalutary</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>The Directors, with much trouble, <hi>put a ſtop to this plan,</hi> by ſtrongly urging the fatal conſequences ariſing <hi>from two capital banks operating in one city,</hi> which might, perhaps, <hi>act in oppoſition to each other,</hi> and, of courſe, deſtroy each other. They finally perſuaded the ſubſcribers to the new bank to relinquiſh their ſcheme, and join the old bank, and add their ſubſcriptions to it, which they at laſt agreed to, and ſo that difficulty was got over.</p>
            <p>But the bank did not reſt long, for ſoon after this laſt mentioned difficulty ſubſided, there aroſe a pretty nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous party in the State who adopted the <hi>ſcheme of paper money to be iſſued by our General Aſſembly.</hi> All the difficulty was to make it paſs <hi>equal to hard money,</hi> and they had little hopes of this, unleſs the <hi>bank</hi> would give it <hi>a currency,</hi> which every body ſaw plain enough that the Directors
<pb n="449" facs="unknown:023972_0456_0FC2A47C20506E30"/>
               <hi>could not do.</hi> The <hi>bank,</hi> therefore, and the <hi>ſcheme for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money,</hi> were conſidered as inconſiſtent with each other, and one or the other, of courſe, muſt fall. The party for paper money determined at once that the <hi>bank muſt be ſacrificed,</hi> and united with all its other enemies to decry it as an inſtitution <hi>injurious to the State, and incompatible with the public ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They raiſed (and declaimed upon) many objections to it, the moſt material of which (that I heard of) I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered already in the foregoing pages of this Eſſay. The matter was carried ſo far, that an act of the Legiſlature of this State was obtained, and paſſed <hi>September</hi> 13, 1785, repealing the act of <hi>April</hi> 1, 1782, which granted the <hi>ſtate-charter</hi> to the bank, and alſo the act of <hi>March</hi> 18, 1782, which made it <hi>felony to counterfeit</hi> the bank-bills, &amp;c. and thus ſtands the matter at preſent.</p>
            <p>III. I now proceed <hi>to make ſome remarks on the preſent ſtate of the bank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Notwithſtanding all the difficulties above-mentioned, the bank is now in good condition; its internal ſtrength is not weakened; its funds are not diminiſhed, tho' its energy and extent of operation has been indeed ſomewhat leſſened, as was obſerved before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The preſent funds or wealth of the bank conſiſts in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1ſt. <hi>the bank-ſtock, about 900,000</hi> Mexican dollars. 2d. In the <hi>diſcounted bills</hi> now in the bank, and payable to it. 3d. The <hi>caſh depoſited</hi> in the bank for ſafe keeping, and which the owners may draw out whenever they pleaſe. 4th. The <hi>furniture and utenſils</hi> of the bank, and any <hi>ſmall profits</hi> which may have lain over or ariſen ſince the laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend.</p>
            <p>The debts of the bank to be paid out of their ſtock are, 1ſt. All the <hi>bank-bills now in circulation.</hi> 2d. All the <hi>bank-credits</hi> or balances due to ſuch perſons as have depoſits in the bank. N. B. <hi>When both theſe are deducted from the ſtock, they leave a balance of about 900,000 dollars in favor of the bank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="450" facs="unknown:023972_0457_0FC2A47FE1E89E48"/>
3. The <hi>legal</hi> eſtabliſhment of this bank is derived from the charter of Congreſs, of <hi>December</hi> 31, 1781; from the charter of the State of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 9, 1782; from the charter of <hi>Delaware</hi> State, of <hi>February</hi> 2, 1786; from the recogniſance of the charter of Congreſs, publicly made by the State of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> in their act of <hi>March</hi> 18, 1782, and their charter of incorporation of the bank, by their act of <hi>April</hi> 1, 1782: but it is to be obſerved, that <hi>theſe two laſt mentioned</hi> acts of the State of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> were repealed by their act of <hi>September</hi> 13, 1785. This repeal of the ſaid two acts of the Legiſlature of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> has given riſe to ſeveral very important queſtions.</p>
            <p>Queſtion I. <hi>Whether Congreſs has a right to eſtabliſh a national bank, ſo as to make it ſuch a legal inſtitution as the laws of the States of the Union are obliged to acknowledge or recogniſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer,—this objection is grounded principally on the ſecond article of the Confederation, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "Each State retains its ſovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, juriſdiction, and right, which is not <hi>expreſsly</hi> delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſſembled." But the anſwer is eaſy; for,</p>
            <p>1ſt. A power of incorporating a <hi>national bank</hi> never did exiſt in any of the States. They might erect banks, or any other corporations, and call them by what <hi>name</hi> they pleaſed; but their <hi>authority,</hi> like that of all their other laws, muſt be limited by the bounds of the State, and could not extend beyond them. Nor,</p>
            <p>2d. Does this act of Congreſs <hi>limit the power</hi> of any of the States?—They ſtill retain and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> exerciſe <hi>every power,</hi> juriſdiction, and right of incorporating banks, as fully as ever they had them: for,</p>
            <p>3d. The ſaid ſecond article of Confederation does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain Congreſs from having or exerciſing any ſovereignty, power, juriſdiction, or right, whatever; it only reſtrains them from exerciſing it in <hi>ſuch manner as to deprive the States of it.</hi> Notwithſtanding all the ſovereignty and power of Congreſs, they ſhall ever be ſo limited, that each
<pb n="451" facs="unknown:023972_0458_0FC2A4869ADD8870"/>
State ſhall retain its own ſovereignty, power, &amp;c. even <hi>concurrent juriſdictions</hi> (if theſe can be called ſuch) often exiſt together without the leaſt reſtraint of each other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The act of Congreſs incorporating the bank, <hi>is an act of finance;</hi> they conſidered it moſt expreſsly as a means, a very important <hi>means, of finance,</hi> which is a branch of power that moſt undoubtedly falls within their authority or juriſdiction. They are not <hi>expreſsly</hi> empowered, indeed, to appoint a <hi>Financier,</hi> give him inſtructions, receive his plans, or <hi>form a bank.</hi> But, as all thoſe were neceſſary means of promoting the general intereſt, the liberties, and general welfare of the States, which are the grand and moſt acknowledged objects of the Confederation, they are doubtleſs comprehended within its powers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Confederation (article 9) empowers Congreſs to <hi>borrow money</hi> on the credit of the States, and <hi>this certainly implies a power to find or procure ſomebody who will lend it to them;</hi> and this they effected to a great degree by incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the bank, which ſupplied them to a very large a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.—They owed the bank at one time 400,000 Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can dollars, for money lent them by the bank; and all the monies lent at different times to Congreſs, and to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>departments</hi> under their direction, amounted to above 2,000,000 Mexican dollars; and theſe loans were of ſuch capital and eſſential ſervice in that moſt deranged and weak ſtate of the public finances, that (in the opinion of thoſe beſt acquainted with the matter) the war could not have been continued without them.</p>
            <p>The bank alſo lent at different times to this State, for its defence and other public purpoſes, above 130,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which certainly proves that the bank was very conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to the public, and very neceſſary to the general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and general intereſt of it; and, therefore, muſt be comprehended in the powers granted to Congreſs, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the general intereſt, and ſecure the liberties, defence, and general welfare of the States.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The independence, defence, and almoſt the very exiſtence, of our preſent political eſtabliſhments muſt depend on the bank, in caſe of an invaſion of an enemy;</hi> for it is very certain, that,
<pb n="452" facs="unknown:023972_0459_0FC2A4880E7BCF38"/>
in ſuch caſe, due and neceſſary oppoſition and defence could not be made by a depreciating currency; nor do I think it would be poſſible for the Congreſs or States to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row elſewhere monies ſufficient, and in ſeaſon, for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; or to iſſue paper bills enough for that purpoſe, which would not depreciate.—I apprehend I ſhall not be called on for any proof of this.</p>
            <p>I therefore go on to infer, that Congreſs, who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly empowered to ſecure <hi>the defence, liberties, welfare, and general intereſts</hi> of the States, are, of courſe, empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered <hi>to inſtitute a bank,</hi> which is ſo <hi>apparently and eſſentially neceſſary to all theſe great purpoſes.</hi>—It follows then, that thoſe who oppoſe the bank, oppoſe the eſſential means of our defence, and, of courſe, lay us open to deſtruction, the firſt time any enemy ſhall invade our country.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If we ſhould admit that there was a defect in the powers of Congreſs to incorporate the bank, yet <hi>that defect is amply ſupplied by the ſubſequent recogniſance of the States, their acquieſcence in the inſtitution, and participation of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it, for a courſe of years; for a ſubſequent conſent of the principal</hi> is as good as <hi>a previous order,</hi> to every purpoſe of eſtabliſhment or legitimation of any act of <hi>a ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the whole, then, I conclude that the Bank of <hi>North-America,</hi> by the ordinance of Congreſs for its incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a well-eſtabliſhed and <hi>legal</hi> inſtitution, and as ſuch ought to be conſidered and recogniſed by all the States, both in their laws and all judicial proceedings, as far as the ſame may affect the ſaid bank.</p>
            <p>Queſtion II. <hi>What is the meaning, energy, and operation of the act of this State of March</hi> 18, 1782, <hi>making it felony to counterfeit the ſeal or bills of the bank?</hi>—I anſwer—</p>
            <p n="1">1. It carries in it the ſtrongeſt <hi>recogniſance</hi> or <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> legal eſtabliſhment of the bank;</hi> and, of courſe, of the authority and lawful force of the ordinance of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for its incorporation, on which alone the legality of the bank then depended; for it is trifling, it is ridiculous, it is infamous, to ſuppoſe that the Legiſlature of this State would, by a moſt ſolemn act, make it <hi>felony, i. e.</hi> death,
<pb n="453" facs="unknown:023972_0460_0FC2A48993D4EF50"/>
to counterfeit the ſeal and bills of any number of men, who had <hi>no legal right</hi> to <hi>make a ſeal, iſſue bills,</hi> or <hi>aſſume</hi> to themſelves any other <hi>powers,</hi> liberties, or privileges of <hi>a corporate body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That act implies the moſt ſolemn conſent of this State to the aforeſaid ordinance of Congreſs, and carries in it further the nature and energy of a ſolemn ſtipulation and compact</hi> of this State with Congreſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> with all the States, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that public meaſure of the Union, with all the weight and authority which this State could give to it, in all the particulars or clauſes mentioned or enacted in the ſaid law.</p>
            <p>The <hi>public and vigorous ſupport</hi> of the particular States gives <hi>great force</hi> to an act of Congreſs, tho' it might be conſidered as <hi>fully legal</hi> without it, gives confidence in the public meaſures, and is a good reaſon and ſtrong induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to engage the public councils of the particular States, as well as individuals, ſtrongly to exert themſelves and riſk their fortunes therein. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That act cannot, of right, be repealed by this State, without conſent of Congreſs, i. e. of the other States of the Union.</hi> It is a part of <hi>that ſupport</hi> of a public meaſure of the Union, on which the <hi>other States</hi> have, and ought to have, <hi>dependence and confidence. Mutual confidence is the end of the Union,</hi> as that alone can produce defence and other exertions for the public welfare; all the States have therefore an intereſt in <hi>that ſupport,</hi> a very great intereſt, indeed, and cannot be deprived of it, without a violation of the union; it is a part of that band of union, which holds the States together; to take it away, therefore, is to weaken the union, and, of courſe, to leſſen its power of operation, and the benefits reſulting from it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if this State can <hi>repeal</hi> the ſaid act <hi>without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the other States,</hi> I do not ſee why they may not go on to <hi>repeal</hi> all the acts they have ever made <hi>in ſupport of the union,</hi> and all the powers of it, even up to that act of theirs which conſented to and adopted the <hi>Confederation</hi> itſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="454" facs="unknown:023972_0461_0FC2A48AF34BF928"/>
Queſtion III. <hi>What is the meaning, energy, and effect of the act of this State of April</hi> 1, 1782, <hi>incorporating the bank?</hi> I anſwer,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. It carries in it <hi>the moſt public and full acquieſcence and ſatisfaction of our Legiſlature in the act of Congreſs for incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating the bank;</hi> becauſe it counts upon that act, without the leaſt cenſure, but with moſt apparent approbation of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It imports their <hi>approbation,</hi> becauſe they ſhow a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to give it all the ſupport which the authority of this State could give, and add to its eſtabliſhment the further ſanction of a charter of this State, conceived in the very words of Congreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho', as I take it, <hi>this ſtate-charter</hi> did not add any thing to the <hi>legality of the bank's eſtabliſhment under the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Congreſs,</hi> yet it ſerved to obviate and ſatisfy the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of many people,</hi> who had formed an opinion, that it would be ſafer to truſt their property in the bank, <hi>with</hi> a ſtate-charter, than <hi>without</hi> one, and, on the account, <hi>withheld their ſubſcriptions till the ſtate-charter was made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I never heard that any body, at that time, diſputed or called in queſtion the <hi>legal authority</hi> of Congreſs to give a charter to the bank; but the public faith, plighted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, relating to money, had been at that time ſo <hi>often and recently violated,</hi> that very little confidence was placed by many people in their <hi>public acts</hi> or <hi>reſolutions</hi> of any ſort, who therefore thought themſelves more ſecure under a ſtate-charter, than they ſhould be under a charter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, without ſuch ſupport.</p>
            <p>This I take to be the true reaſon why the Preſident and Directors of the bank applied to our Aſſembly for a ſtate-charter, which manifeſtly removed many <hi>prejudices</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles</hi> which operated againſt the bank, as it was plain that ſubſcriptions to it were offered faſter, and bank-ſtock was more coveted, after the ſtate-charter was obtained than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: therefore, I think it very evident that,</p>
            <p n="4">4. This act operated by way of <hi>ſtrong inducement and encouragement to very many citizens, as well as ſtrangers,</hi> to <hi>ſubſcribe to the bank, and truſt their property in it;</hi> and that
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:023972_0462_0FC2A48C6EC5EC38"/>
the act was purpoſely made with intention that it might have this operation and effect; and therefore ought to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the proprietors</hi> from <hi>any diſappointment,</hi> as far as the whole force of the act can do it; for certainly it cannot be juſtifiable in any State <hi>to hold out encouragement</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to draw them into a <hi>ſnare,</hi> and then leave them in the <hi>lurch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Whatever might be the effect of this act on the bank, by way of aiding the legality of its eſtabliſhment, or giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſupport as a Continental inſtitution, there is no doubt but it had this one perfect effect, <abbr>viz.</abbr> it incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſubſcribers to the bank into a legal company, and inſtituted a <hi>complete, eſtabliſhed,</hi> and <hi>legal bank</hi> of <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> tho' by the name of the Preſident, Directors, and Company of the Bank of <hi>North-America;</hi> for any State may give <hi>what name</hi> or <hi>title</hi> they pleaſe to their coporations, tho' they cannot extend their <hi>authority</hi> or <hi>privileges</hi> beyond their own juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>This act, therefore, undoubtedly brought the bank un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>cogniſance</hi> of the laws of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and entitled the Company, and every proprietor of it, to the full <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> of theſe laws. Whether this put them into any <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> condition than they were before, made their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any more <hi>legal,</hi> or increaſed their right to the <hi>protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the laws of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> or not, may be a queſtion; but it can be no queſtion, that very many people were of this opinion, and governed their conduct by it.</p>
            <p>It is further certain that this ſtate-charter may eventually prove of moſt capital ſervice to the ſtockholders; for it is poſſible that Congreſs may repeal their ordinance for incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating the bank, or, by ſome other act of ſovereignty, may vacate its charter (for ſtranger things happen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) or the union of the Thirteen States may, by ſome means or other, be diſſolved (which, I think, would ſoon happen, if each State ſhould <hi>withdraw its ſupports</hi>) and, by that means, the authority of all their acts might ceaſe, and, of courſe, their charter of the bank might fall with the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="456" facs="unknown:023972_0463_0FC2A49AA97E4C98"/>
Yet, I ſay (all theſe miſhaps notwithſtanding) under the charter of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> the bank would continue to be a <hi>legal ſtate-eſtabliſhment,</hi> and might go on with its negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, in ſhort, purſue the whole buſineſs which the great intereſts of the concern might make neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Queſtion IV. <hi>Can the act of March</hi> 18, 1782 (making it felony to counterfeit bank-bills, &amp;c.) <hi>and that of April</hi> 1, 1782 (incorporating the bank) I ſay, <hi>can theſe acts, of right, be repealed by our Legiſlature, without conſent of the parties intereſted.</hi>—I give my anſwer in the negative, and for this my opinion I beg the reader's candid attention to the following reaſons, which appear to me to deſerve great conſideration, even by thoſe who may not think them of ſufficient force to juſtify my concluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe acts <hi>veſt a right, privilege, and intereſt, i. e. a valuable property in all the ſtockholders of the bank,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot, of right, be repealed by any act of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, <hi>without the conſent of the ſtockholders.</hi> Theſe acts are of the nature of <hi>bargains or contracts</hi> between the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature</hi> and the <hi>ſtockholders,</hi> in which the ſtipulations were, that in conſideration that the ſtockholders had or ſhould <hi>put their money</hi> into the bank, the Legiſlature would give ſuch <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>legal eſtabliſhment to the bank,</hi> as ſhould enable them to make and enjoy all the advantages and profits which ſhould reſult from it, under the <hi>firm protection of the law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On this <hi>encouragement,</hi> the ſtockholders held or placed their fortunes in the bank, and the Legiſlature paſſed the ſaid acts in ſupport of it, and ſo the <hi>bargain was finiſhed.</hi> I take it that when the act of the Legiſlature veſts in or grants to any individual or company of men, on valuable conſideration (<hi>i. e.</hi> for which the grantee pays his money) <hi>any valuable right, intereſt,</hi> or <hi>property,</hi> the <hi>grantees inſtantly become legally ſeized of ſuch right, which thereby becomes as much guarantied or warranted to them by the law of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d,</hi> as is any <hi>other property</hi> whatever which they <hi>may</hi> or <hi>can poſſeſs;</hi> and, therefore, they cannot be deveſted or depr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d of it by any act of the Legiſlature, any more than of their <hi>lands, cattle, furniture,</hi> or any <hi>other eſtate,</hi> of which they
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:023972_0464_0FC2A49BE1819B30"/>
are lawful owners, and which they hold under the full <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> of the law.</p>
            <p>The ſort of acts of the Legiſlature which I here mean (that veſt a <hi>right</hi> or <hi>intereſt</hi> in any <hi>individual</hi> or <hi>company</hi> of men) are ſuch as theſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> an act granting <hi>a commiſſion of ſewers to owners of meadows,</hi> who expend much money in banking and ditching them, to make them uſeful to the public and their owners; an act granting <hi>toll to perſons who ſhall build a bridge,</hi> for which they contribute their money; an act granting <hi>wild lands to people who will cultivate and improve them,</hi> and who expend their money for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; any acts for <hi>ſupporting and incorporating the ſubſcribers of a bank,</hi> in conſideration of <hi>large ſums of money</hi> ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or contributed to it, and in proſpects of great benefits reſulting from it, both to the public and to the ſtockhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; an act for incorporating <hi>churches, univerſities, hoſpitals, ſchools, &amp;c.</hi> in conſideration <hi>of money paid or to be paid</hi> by the contributors, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I conceive that all acts of this kind veſt <hi>ſuch rights, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, or intereſts in the grantees</hi> (who thereby gain ſuch <hi>protection</hi> of the laws in the enjoyment of them) that they <hi>cannot be rightfully deveſted or deprived by any act of repeal of the charters or acts which give their title, or by any other act of the Legiſlature whatever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond great reaſon of this is, that <hi>the declaration of rights</hi> (which is part of the Conſtitution of this State) <hi>gives every citizen a right to be protected in the enjoyment of his property.</hi> It knows but two ways by which the ſubject can be deveſted of his lawful property; 1ſt. by <hi>crime and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture;</hi> and, 2d. <hi>by his own contract or conſent:</hi> if his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is challenged or demanded of him in either of theſe ways, or by any other way, let the controverſy be of what nature ſoever, reſpecting property, he is entitled <hi>to a fair trial by jury.</hi> [See articles 8, 9, and 11.] This can be had no where but in a <hi>judicial court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The General Aſſembly are <hi>not ſuch a court;</hi> they have the <hi>legiſlative,</hi> but not the <hi>executive</hi> or <hi>judicial,</hi> power of the State; they can neither <hi>empannel a jury,</hi> nor make a judicial deciſion <hi>without one,</hi> much leſs can they deprive
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:023972_0465_0FC2A49CF224D678"/>
any individual or company of ſubjects of any of their legal rights, intereſts, property, or privileges, <hi>without any trial, ſummons,</hi> or <hi>examination</hi> at all, by any <hi>act</hi> or <hi>repeal of acts</hi> whatever, which they can make.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I take it, <hi>that the declaration of rights is of ſuperior authority to any act which the General Aſſembly can make, and will control and even render totally null and void any act of the Aſſembly which infringes it; and will</hi> and ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſo <hi>by the judges of our courts, whenever the ſame may be pleaded before them:</hi> for when two <hi>contradictory laws</hi> are pleaded before a court, it is impoſſible but the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> muſt be judged <hi>void;</hi> and if <hi>one</hi> of theſe laws ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be grounded on a <hi>ſuperior</hi> authority to that of the <hi>other,</hi> there can be no doubt but the <hi>ſuperior</hi> authority muſt control the <hi>leſſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conſider the Aſſembly as <hi>the mere creatures</hi> of their conſtituents, and acting merely by <hi>a ſubſtituted power;</hi> and the declaration of rights I conſider as <hi>the capital inſtructions</hi> which they receive from their <hi>conſtituents,</hi> by which they are <hi>bound to regulate their conduct, and by which their power and authority are altogether limited.</hi> This doctrine ought to be brought into full view, and to be recogniſed by every ſubject, in its whole importance and energy, whenever we ſee our Aſſembly <hi>infringing the declaration of rights,</hi> in ſo capital and alarming an inſtance, as to make any act what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which will, <hi>in its operation, unavoidably and eventually deprive any ſubject, or number of ſubjects, of any right, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or property, without trial by jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very perſons whoſe <hi>wiſhes</hi> or <hi>prejudices</hi> may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by ſuch acts of the Legiſlature, ought to <hi>tremble</hi> at their conſequences, for the <hi>two-edged</hi> ſword, which has <hi>one edge</hi> turned againſt our enemy, has <hi>another</hi> which may be turned againſt <hi>ourſelves, i. e.</hi> it can cut both ſides alike, and is equally qualified to wound <hi>both parties,</hi> whenever it may be applied to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charters</hi> (or rights of individuals or companies ſecured by an act of the State) <hi>have ever been conſidered as a kind of ſcored things,</hi> not to be vacated by a bare <hi>holding up a few hands,</hi> and <hi>ſoiling a page of paper,</hi> without any further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:023972_0466_0FC2A49E7137A7B8"/>
or ſubſequent forms or ceremonies; but in all wiſe States have ever been conſidered as <hi>ſecurities</hi> of ſuch <hi>capital conſequence,</hi> that any attempts to deſtroy them have ever excited a <hi>general alarm,</hi> and have rarely happened but in times of great <hi>corruption</hi> of government and <hi>dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments</hi> of arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>I think it, on the whole, very manifeſt, that a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, for valuable conſideration paid, has by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic act <hi>ſold and granted certain valuable rights, privileges, or intereſts</hi> to any individual or company of men; I ſay, ſuch Legiſlature have <hi>no more right by repeal of their act to vacate the title and deſtroy the eſtate</hi> of ſuch grantees, and to <hi>releaſe themſelves,</hi> than any private contractor has to <hi>releaſe himſelf,</hi> and <hi>refuſe to execute</hi> his own contract, whenever he grows <hi>ſick</hi> of his bargain.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I think the ſacred force of contracts <hi>binds ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in an act of ſtate,</hi> than in the <hi>act of an individual,</hi> becauſe <hi>the whole government is injured and weakened by a violation of the public faith,</hi> but the vacillation of a <hi>private man</hi> can produce no more than <hi>private damages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as <hi>public faith</hi> is an old threadbare topic of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and is as much <hi>out of faſhion</hi> as going to <hi>church</hi> or reading the <hi>bible,</hi> and has been dinned in the ears of ſome folks, till, like the doctrine of repentance to ſinners, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nauſeates than convicts, I will forbear preſſing it further at this time, as I wiſh not to <hi>diſguſt</hi> but to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ordinance of Congreſs for granting the charter of the bank is a meaſure of the Union,</hi> ſolemnly recogniſed by this State (in the two <hi>repealed acts</hi>) in which all the States are intereſted, and is, therefore, of ſuch <hi>high authority</hi> as controls all the States to ſuch a degree, that any attempts of this State (by an act of repeal, or any other act) to withdraw their ſupport, and thereby weaken and embarraſs ſuch meaſure of the Union, muſt be void, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> in itſelf.</p>
            <p>For I take it, that every act of Congreſs appointing or directing any meaſure of the Union, when recogniſed by the States, either by their expreſs act of approbation, or
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:023972_0467_0FC2A4A037AF4B78"/>
by long acquieſcence and practice, is of ſuperior authority to any act of any of the States, nor <hi>does it remain in the power of any particular State to withdraw their ſupport from it, or to releaſe and diſcharge themſelves</hi> from their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to it, or to make any act which ſhall, in its operation, <hi>leſſen the energy and effect of it.</hi> But I have touched on this before, and ſo need not enlarge on it further in this place.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The act of repeal (<hi>Sept.</hi> 13, 1785) <hi>deprives a great number of our citizens and ſtrangers of their rights, privileges, and property,</hi> to a vaſt amount, and to the utter ruin of many families; rights, privileges, and property which were <hi>gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantied and ſecured</hi> to them <hi>for ever,</hi> by the moſt <hi>ſolemn act</hi> of our Legiſlature, and, of courſe, by the whole <hi>force and power of the law;</hi> and all this by an act of <hi>mere ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> without ſo much as alleging againſt them <hi>any crime</hi> by which they have <hi>forfeited,</hi> or <hi>contract</hi> by which they have <hi>alienated,</hi> them, and without any <hi>ſummons,</hi> or <hi>trial,</hi> or <hi>judgment of court,</hi> or <hi>verdict of jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo directly in the very face of our <hi>declaration of rights,</hi> as manifeſtly <hi>infringes</hi> it, and, of courſe, renders <hi>the act void.</hi> This is, indeed, rather an epitome of what I ſaid before than a new argument, but the immenſity of the doſs or damage occaſioned by the ſaid act of repeal, may, perhaps, engage the reader's attention, and ſet the ſubject in a ſtronger light of importance, than it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in, were the conſequences <hi>leſs fatal and ruinous</hi> both to the <hi>Union</hi> in general, to <hi>each of the States,</hi> and <hi>all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi> who are concerned in the bank.</p>
            <p>But admitting that the act of <hi>Sept.</hi>

               </gap>3, 1785, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing the ſaid acts of <hi>March</hi> 8, 1782, and of <hi>April</hi> 1, 1782, is to all intents and purpoſes valid in law, and, of courſe, that the bank is thereby deprived of all the ſupport and legal eſtabliſhment which it once received from the ſaid laws, when they were in force, there ariſes another queſtion, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Queſtion V. <hi>In what condition does the ſaid act of repeal leave the bank?</hi> I anſwer,—</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="461" facs="unknown:023972_0468_0FC2A4A76D334DE8"/>
1. In point of its <hi>legality, the ſaid act of repeal leaves the bank juſt where the ſaid repealed acts found it,</hi> when they were firſt made; the repeal takes away <hi>no more</hi> than the acts themſelves <hi>gave,</hi> and, of courſe, if the bank was a <hi>legal eſtabliſhment</hi> before theſe acts were made, it <hi>continues ſo</hi> ſtill after the repeal of them: therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Preſident, Directors, any Company of the Bank remain a <hi>legal corporate body,</hi> under the charter of <hi>Congreſs,</hi> and may do all acts as ſuch in <hi>the ſame manner</hi> as before the ſaid repealed acts of this State were made.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, I think it very plain that <hi>the ſupreme authority</hi> of all States under all forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether monarchical, oligarchical, or democratical (a theocracy only excepted) <hi>is lodged in the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1ſt. Becauſe the <hi>right to be ſecured by, and which are the ſole end of, all civil government, are veſted in them:</hi> and,</p>
            <p>2d. Becauſe the great <hi>force or ſtrength which muſt ſupport all civil government is lodged in them,</hi> and, of courſe, all <hi>pacta conventa</hi> or capital conſtitutions eſtabliſhed by them, do <hi>bind and control all authorities whatever which act under them,</hi> and, of courſe, it appears that the Legiſlature of this State have not an <hi>original</hi> but <hi>a derived</hi> authority, which, of courſe, is not <hi>abſolute</hi> but <hi>limited,</hi> it is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,</p>
            <p>1ſt. By <hi>the laws of</hi> GOD:</p>
            <p>2d. By the <hi>Conſtitution of this State:</hi> and,</p>
            <p>3d. By the <hi>confederation or union of the Thirteen States,</hi> and, of courſe, by <hi>every legal act of Congreſs</hi> under that union, for the general welfare of the States: therefore, if our Legiſlature ſhould make an act to repeal <hi>the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> or to infringe <hi>the Conſtitution,</hi> or to deſtroy or weaken <hi>the Union, or any legal meaſures of Congreſs,</hi> it would, of courſe, be <hi>ipſo facto void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, I take it that our General Aſſembly are limited and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d down to <hi>the ſort or kind of authority which is given to them;</hi> all acts proper for a <hi>legiſlative body,</hi> they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to do, <hi>ſubject to the aforeſaid limitations,</hi> but they cannot aſſume to themſelves or exerciſe the <hi>judicial</hi> or <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive</hi>
               <pb n="462" facs="unknown:023972_0469_0FC2A4B6A8EBA1B8"/>
               <hi>powers of government;</hi> theſe powers are totally out of their commiſſion or juriſdiction, and they can no more intrude on, or exerciſe the <hi>authority of theſe departments,</hi> than a <hi>ſheriff</hi> can obtrude himſelf on the <hi>judge's ſeat,</hi> or a <hi>chief juſtice ſerve a writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, it follows that if the Legiſlature ſhould paſs an act, which, by its operation, takes away the <hi>life, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or lawful rights, privileges, or property of any ſubject, i. e.</hi> ſuch as the ſubject holds under <hi>the protection and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law,</hi> it muſt be <hi>void;</hi> for if any thing of this ſort is to be done in the State, or if any controverſy or queſtion about it, is to be decided, the Conſtitution has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>a different method, a quite different court or authority, in and by</hi> which it muſt be done.</p>
            <p>It is no objection to this, to ſay that much and many important things <hi>muſt</hi> be left to <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>the diſcretion</hi> of the Aſſembly; for ſuch <hi>neceſſity</hi> muſt <hi>exiſt,</hi> before it can <hi>operate, or juſtify any act grounded on it;</hi> and becauſe much is left to the <hi>diſcretion</hi> of the Aſſembly, it does not follow, that they have a right <hi>to throw by all diſcretion,</hi> and act without any.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>There is no doubt but ſuch a combination and concurrence of event may happen, as will make <hi>a departure</hi> not only from the <hi>ordinary courſe</hi> of adminiſtering juſtice, but even from the <hi>common maxims of juſtice itſelf, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi>

            <head>STRICTURES ON THE NET PRODUCE OF THE TAXES OF GREAT-BRITAIN, In the Year 1784, as publiſhed by Order of their Houſe of Commons.</head>

            <p>HAVING by accident met with <hi>a liſt or detail of the Britiſh taxes for</hi> 1784, and the <hi>net produce</hi> of each of them, which lays open in a pretty clear manner the <hi>ſources</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> revenues, and points out the <hi>ways and means</hi> by which thoſe immenſe ſums are raiſed, which are neceſſary for the current ſervices of the year, payment of the intereſt of their vaſt national debt, ſupport of their public credit, &amp;c. and as the attention of the <hi>Thirteen American States</hi> is, or ought to be, much fixed on <hi>a public revenue,</hi> and, of courſe, on <hi>our trade,</hi> out of which it muſt grow; I thought the practice and example of ſo old, ſo experienced, and ſucceſsful a people as the <hi>Britons,</hi>
               <pb n="465" facs="unknown:023972_0472_0FC2A4BD300F3CE8"/>
might be of uſe to us at this time, and therefore procured the account or liſt of their revenues above referred to, to be publiſhed in the <hi>Pennſylvania Packet</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4, 1785, and added theſe Strictures on them.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government has expended the vaſt, the immenſe ſums produced by their finance for the laſt 90 years, for purpoſe <hi>ſalutary</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> to the nation, or not, is out of the preſent queſtion; but their <hi>ſucceſs in raiſing theſe vaſt ſums</hi> is certainly ſurpriſing. Eſpecially when we conſider that this has been done in ſuch a manner, that the nation has not only, <hi>not been impoveriſhed thereby,</hi> but has been <hi>increaſing rapidly in the moſt ſubſtantial riches,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time it ſupported the immenſe preſſure of their taxes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>houſes</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are now much more valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than they were 90 years ago; the <hi>live ſtock</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> their farms is greatly increaſed; their <hi>lands</hi> are better cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and much more productive; their conveniences for <hi>tranſportation</hi> are greatly increaſed by mending <hi>roads,</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>canals,</hi> and clearing <hi>rivers</hi> for <hi>inland navigation:</hi> their <hi>manufactures</hi> are vaſtly increaſed, both in quantity and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; the <hi>trading ſtock</hi> of their merchants, their <hi>ſhipping,</hi> and the <hi>exports</hi> of their manufactures, and <hi>produce</hi> of their lands, are vaſtly increaſed ſince the year 1694, when the Bank of <hi>England</hi> was firſt inſtituted, and the ſcheme of funding the public debts had its origin. By <hi>theſe only</hi> the wealth of the nation can be truly eſtimated.</p>
            <p>This <hi>real wealth,</hi> conſidered as national, has very little connexion with the public funds or ſtocks; for ſhould they all ſail, this muſt continue, and out of it might always be produced <hi>funds</hi> or <hi>ſtocks</hi> ſufficient for the uſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic: <hi>this kind of wealth</hi> muſt then be conſidered as the <hi>real, ſubſtantial</hi> wealth of the nation; the great <hi>baſis</hi> on which all the ſuperſtructures of public credit or nominal wealth muſt be built, and by which they muſt be ſupported.</p>
            <p>The fact is, then, that this <hi>real wealth</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> is much <hi>greater</hi> now than it was 90 years ago, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the amazing taxes which have been paid during the whole of the laſt 90 years, and the vaſt debt which now
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:023972_0473_0FC2A4BF648A2FE0"/>
lies on the nation: indeed, this real wealth, as obſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> has <hi>little connexion</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>word public debt; but, on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, is rather <hi>helped</hi> than <hi>hurt</hi> by it; for it appears very plain, that the national wealth has increaſed faſter under the weight of that debt, than ever it did before the doctrine of creating and funding a national debt was thought of.</p>
            <p>It appears, then, that the national <hi>debt,</hi> or the <hi>public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, may fail,</hi> without deſtroying the real and ſubſtantial wealth of the nation; for if the public credit was to fail, as <hi>our</hi> Continental money, and <hi>their South-Sea</hi> ſtock, once did, and every perſon who had any thing in the funds ſhould loſe it all, this would not deſtroy the <hi>houſes, fields, cattle, &amp;c.</hi> of the country; it would only produce a <hi>ſhift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> from one perſon to another; would produce infinite injuſtice and ruin to individuals, indeed, and no degree of puniſhment would be too great for thoſe, thro' whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management, fraud, and corruption, ſuch a thing ſhould happen; but it would by no means bring on the <hi>deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that could happen would be, that thoſe who had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the ſtocks would <hi>loſe</hi> them; and thoſe who were taxed to ſupport the ſtocks, would be <hi>liberated</hi> from the burden of tax; but the <hi>fields</hi> would produce the ſame quantity of <hi>wheat,</hi> and the <hi>meadows</hi> would fatten the <hi>ſame number</hi> of cattle, as before; and, of courſe, the bread and the meat would be as plenty as ever, and the more bread and meat the country produced, the richer it certainly would be.</p>
            <p>Therefore, a man who buys lands and puts them into high cultivation, or erects mills, ſhops, &amp;c. for manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and conveniencies of life, poſſeſſes <hi>moſt ſubſtantial wealth of high independence;</hi> whilſt the man who deals in public <hi>ſecurities</hi> and <hi>paper credit,</hi> depends on the humor, the honor, the wiſdom, and the juſtice of the nation, and therefore acquires a wealth <hi>'which is liable to moth and ruſt, and which thieves can ſteal.'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The long experience of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> affords a moſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable proof of fact, that both thoſe kinds of wealth are mutual ſupports of each other, <hi>i. e.</hi> that public credit
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:023972_0474_0FC2A4C32DA31330"/>
increaſes the <hi>value</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> of the lands and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whilſt, at the ſame time, the lands and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures produce the <hi>great ſtaple</hi> and extenſive commerce, which enable the nation, <hi>by a proper management,</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the public credit; and, therefore, what <hi>this proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement is, becomes a matter of much importance for us to know, and carefully attend to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> in one great thing, are alike, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ſource of wealth in both countries is the ſame; the lands and manufactures are the <hi>firſt matter</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords the great ſtaples of <hi>commerce,</hi> as well as the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital <hi>home-ſupplies</hi> of the people; therefore, it is probable, that the ſame management or line of conduct which has proved advantageous to <hi>them,</hi> may be ſo to <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee in the account of the taxes of <hi>Britain,</hi> a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and a good deal of the detail of this important ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,—on which I beg leave to remark—</p>
            <p>I. <hi>They are very careful to make their revenues in ſuch form that their produce ſhall be certain, and their amount capable of pretty exact computation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. To be guarded againſt all poſſible delay or diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>they circulate their revenues moſtly thro' the bank, or at leaſt keep the exchequer ſo cloſely connected with the bank, that they can at all times avail themſelves of a bank-credit when they need it:</hi> ſo that they are always able to ſatisfy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of every creditor of the public funds, without the leaſt delay or trouble: this could not, perhaps, by any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, be done in any other method than by the help of the <hi>bank,</hi> and the importance of it will be obvious to any body, who conſiders that <hi>public credit</hi> can by no poſſibility be ſupported in any other way than by <hi>moſt punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to the public creditors: the experience of all nations, but eſpecially our own, has taught us that public <hi>promiſes</hi> and <hi>paper,</hi> or public <hi>laws of regulation</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> can <hi>do nothing</hi> towards the ſupport of public credit, without <hi>punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual payment</hi> of the public creditors.</p>
            <p>III. They have ever made it an object of great care, <hi>to lay and collect the public taxes in ſuch a manner as ſhould be the moſt eaſy, the moſt inſenſible, and the moſt advantageous of
<pb n="468" facs="unknown:023972_0475_0FC2A4D45416E220"/>
any they could deviſe:</hi> this is, indeed, the <hi>materia magna</hi> of the whole ſubject (which is odious and heavy, under all forms of delicacy and prudence that any adminiſtration can deviſe) as inſtances of this, it is eaſy to obſerve—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the great burden of their taxes conſiſts in the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, exciſe, and ſtamps;</hi> the net produce of theſe is above 9,000,000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling, in all which, lands, labor, and farmer's ſtock are not called on, nor is any perſon compelled to pay any of the taxes, unleſs he chooſes to be concerned in the articles taxed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The tax is laid in a very great meaſure on either articles of mere luxury, or ſuch fine and rich goods as are conſumed moſtly by people of wealth, e. g.</hi> about one half of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is on <hi>drinkable liquors</hi> (for under this claſs I ſhall doubtleſs be allowed to rank malt, hops, tea, &amp;c. &amp;c. the ſole uſe of which is to make ſuch liquors) theſe are moſtly articles of luxury, as wines, ſpirits, ſtrong beer, &amp;c. <hi>Tobacco</hi> and ſnuff are great articles, as alſo are <hi>Eaſt-India goods, carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, &amp;c.</hi> moſt of which are either articles of <hi>mere luxury,</hi> or the conſumption of very <hi>wealthy people.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Goods of neceſſary conſumption are not wholly omitted,</hi> as we ſee in the articles of <hi>hides, tallow, candles, ſalt, cools, paper, &amp;c.</hi> but in theſe the heavieſt part of the burden falls on the <hi>rich,</hi> as they conſume theſe articles with much greater prodigality and profuſeneſs than the poor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Very poor people have very ſmall uſe for any papers which pay a ſtamp-duty, and, of courſe, thoſe duties are almoſt wholly paid by people of at leaſt good ſubſtance, if not great wealth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The heavieſt and moſt painful part of ſaid taxes is that on houſes and windows,</hi> ranked under the head of incidents; this is ſaid to be paid by the poor tenants, many of whom brick up their windows to avoid the tax.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The land-tax at 4s. on the pound</hi> (not mentioned in the account) <hi>produces about</hi> 2,000,000 <hi>a year:</hi> but this, tho' called 4<hi>s.</hi> is really not more than 1<hi>s.</hi> or perhaps not 6<hi>d.</hi> becauſe that tax is laid on <hi>an old aſſeſſment</hi> or eſtimate of the lands of <hi>England,</hi> which ſets them at leſs than a <hi>quarter</hi> of their preſent value, and ſome very improved eſtates are not
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:023972_0476_0FC2A4D5785A48E8"/>
eſtimated at <hi>one-tenth</hi> of their preſent value, and, of courſe, if a man has rents to amount of 100<hi>l.</hi> per annum, his tax may be 5<hi>l.</hi> or perhaps not 40<hi>s.</hi> This, and the tax on <hi>houſes</hi> and <hi>windows,</hi> are all which bear any reſemblance to <hi>our taxes on polls and eſtates,</hi> and, in point of <hi>weight and burden, bear no proportion</hi> to ours.</p>
            <p>On the mode of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> taxes, and the operation of their national debt, the following things may be noted, and deſerve our conſideration.</p>
            <p>I. Their taxes being chiefly on luxuries <hi>are a benefit and ſaving to the nation;</hi> they leſſen the <hi>conſumption,</hi> and of courſe reſtrain the <hi>exceſſes,</hi> of luxury, and preſent the vices, expenſes, and miſchiefs, which would otherwiſe enſue.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The taxes prevent the exportation of money;</hi> that part of the price of the goods taxed, which goes to pay the duty, cannot <hi>be exported,</hi> but goes into the public treaſury, whence it iſſues in half-yearly payments to the <hi>public credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors all over</hi> the nation.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>This produces a great plenty and briſk circulation of caſh;</hi> for theſe payments are all made without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, and in ready caſh, and the amount being very large (perhaps, about half the current caſh of the nation yearly) makes a very large and briſk circulation of caſh, and the frequency of the payments keeps up that circulation into almoſt an equable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low thro' the year.</p>
            <p>IV. From this plenty and quick circulation of caſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the taxes, <hi>each individual, or at leaſt the nation at large, derives a benefit which more than compenſates the tax which is the purchaſe of it;</hi> for every one knows the odds of doing buſineſs in a place where <hi>caſh is plenty</hi> and <hi>briſkly circulating,</hi> and in a place where it is <hi>ſcarce and ſtagnant;</hi> this will ſoon produce a difference in the proceeds of any man's buſineſs, equal to his ſhare of the tax.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>This ſhows a reaſon why the Britiſh nation increaſes rapidly in wealth under the preſſure of vaſt taxes,</hi> and has uniformly done ſo for 90 years paſt, <hi>i.e. the benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the tax are more than a compenſation for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of paying it.</hi> So that it leaves a balance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in favor of the nation or individual who pays it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="470" facs="unknown:023972_0477_0FC2A4D92BF8ED70"/>
VI. This benefit reſults chiefly from the <hi>great punctuality with which the public creditors are paid</hi>—to a day—to an hour—without the leaſt put off or delay. This not only ſets the example, but gives the power, of punctual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtrongly tends to introduce the general practice of it, to the vaſt advantage of all trade. This depends on the ſame principle as the old adage, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "If you would make money faſt, pay a high rent;" <hi>i. e.</hi> it is better to have a ſtand in a place of <hi>briſk buſineſs,</hi> tho' the <hi>rent is high,</hi> than to ſit down in a <hi>dull</hi> place at a <hi>low</hi> rent, or even <hi>rent-free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. This punctuality of the public payments, which produces ſo many vaſt advantages, <hi>becomes practicable only by the cloſe connexion which ſubſiſts between the public treaſury and the bank;</hi> but theſe advantages are not the whole of the benefits thence derived, the <hi>ſame thing enables the treaſury</hi> to furniſh any ſum of money in an inſtant, which any emergency may make neceſſary; ſo that the nation is never in danger of <hi>loſing the benefit</hi> of any important manoeuvre for <hi>want of caſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means they have often been enabled to oppoſe <hi>foreign enemies,</hi> cruſh interior <hi>rebellions,</hi> ſupport their great <hi>trading companies</hi> at a hard puſh, give aid to the <hi>bank,</hi> and ever to preſerve their <hi>public credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And could that diſcerning, ſucceſsful people have poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiſdom and gravity of counſel enough to make the beſt uſe of their own advantages, <hi>ſua ſi bona norint,</hi> their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory muſt have been vaſt indeed. Had they in <hi>improvements</hi> of their huſbandry and trade, in <hi>meliorating</hi> and <hi>decorating</hi> their country, ſpent the money which they have <hi>waſted</hi> in needleſs <hi>ſubſidies</hi> to foreign princes, in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental</hi> and <hi>American</hi> wars, and many other fatal policies, their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> their <hi>riches,</hi> their <hi>reſpectability,</hi> their <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> would have riſen ſuperior to that of any nation on the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>This is the nation from which we derive our <hi>origin,</hi> and I hope we may reſpect the <hi>honors of our parentage,</hi> without imitating the <hi>vices of our anceſtors.</hi> And what I have to wiſh is, that tho' we are broken off from them, we may
<pb n="471" facs="unknown:023972_0478_0FC2A4DA77BF9758"/>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>On which I beg leave to remark,</p>
                  <p>I. That a very great number of the principal inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and as reſpectable and well-behaved as any in the State, <hi>from ſcruples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had ever refuſed to take or ſubſcribe any oath or affirmation of allegiance to any government, either Britiſh or American.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. Very many very ſerious and good men, and faſt friends to <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>American</hi> cauſe, thought at that time that the <hi>Declaration of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence was premature;</hi> and it was a matter of great doubt with all men, whether that independence could be <hi>finally ſupported;</hi> and, ſhould it fail, many thought,</p>
                  <p>III. That <hi>abjuring the Britiſh government would involve them in perjury,</hi> or, at leaſt, in a <hi>ſhameful and ridiculous duplicity of contact,</hi> under the moſt awful and ſolemn criſis of deportment.</p>
                  <p>IV. Many wiſe men had a great attachment to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government, under which they were <hi>born and educated;</hi> and tho' <hi>they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the demands</hi> and <hi>conduct of the Britiſh</hi> court as much as any man in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs yet did not think that a redreſs of <hi>American</hi> grievances was <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or that it was the <hi>real, true intereſt</hi> of <hi>America</hi> to be <hi>disjoined from the Britiſh Empire;</hi> at leaſt, they thought the <hi>American independence</hi> ought to the <hi>ſettled,</hi> and the <hi>war</hi> ſhould <hi>be ever,</hi> and the <hi>diſputes</hi> between the contending States ſhould be <hi>adjuſted,</hi> before an <hi>oath of allegiance</hi> to the one, or <hi>abjuration</hi> of the other, ſhould be demanded.</p>
                  <p>V. Many good men thought they did not underſtand the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial qualities of treaſons or treaſonable conſpiracies,</hi> well enough to be ſafe in <hi>ſwearing</hi> to give information of all ſuch as came within their knowledge; or they might <hi>know</hi> ſuch, but not be able to <hi>make proof</hi> of them, and, of courſe, their information would expoſe them not only to the <hi>reſentment,</hi> but to <hi>real actions of defamation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not pretend to determine whether any or all of the above objections againſt taking ſaid oath, were good and proper or not; but they had ſuch weight with <hi>great numbers,</hi> that near half of our moſt ſerious people refuſed taking the oath.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I conceive, all men will allow that <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> was as <hi>true</hi> to the <hi>American</hi> cauſe, and <hi>ſupported</hi> it with as much <hi>effort, zeal, and unanimity</hi> as any State in the Union; and the <hi>

            <p>TEST-ACTS impoſed with penalties, I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, are hurtful; becauſe,</p>
            <p>I. Their addreſs is to the <hi>hidden things of the heart,</hi> to the <hi>ſecret ſentiments</hi> of the underſtanding, which are not
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:023972_0479_0FC2A4DC2365DFD8"/>
               <hi>controllable</hi> by any human authority, nor <hi>amenable</hi> to it; they belong to <hi>God only,</hi> and the <hi>conſcience</hi> of the poſſeſſor,
<pb n="473" facs="unknown:023972_0480_0FC2A4DD7203C988"/>
and no man can be obliged to <hi>confeſs or divulge</hi> them, more than to <hi>accuſe</hi> himſelf. Teſt-acts, tho' in a leſs degree, are of the ſame nature as <hi>racks and tortures,</hi> are calculated for the ſame ends, produce the ſame effects, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grounded on the ſame principles, and, of courſe, are reprobated by the ſame reaſons; their end is to <hi>wring out</hi> thoſe hidden things of the heart, which no man living has a right to demand, and, of courſe, no man can be under any obligation to <hi>diſcloſe.</hi> It is impoſſible that any man ſhould have a <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>more excluſive right</hi> to any thing whatever, than to the ſecrets of his own mind; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to <hi>force</hi> them from a man is a direct violation of the moſt <hi>ſacred,</hi> as well as moſt <hi>delicate, rights</hi> of human nature.</p>
            <p>II. Every man <hi>has a right</hi> (in the uſe of his reaſon) to form ſentiments of <hi>government,</hi> as well as of <hi>religion,</hi> and every thing elſe which <hi>concerns his well-being.</hi> There can be <hi>no crime</hi> in this, and, therefore, his <hi>ſentiments</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (be they what they may) ought not to ſubject him to any kind of <hi>puniſhment</hi> either of <hi>pain or loſs,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of any one <hi>privilege or benefit</hi> of civil ſociety. It is true, if he <hi>accepts an office</hi> under a government which
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:023972_0481_0FC2A4E46D0C0B20"/>
he diſapproves, he ought to execute the office faithfully and legally, or he is puniſhable; if he cannot do this, he ought not to accept the office: he doubtleſs ought alſo to be a quiet and peaceable ſubject of the government which exiſts, and to uſe none but lawful means to mend or alter it.</p>
            <p>He is ſuppoſed to be of a <hi>minor party,</hi> who muſt be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the <hi>major vote;</hi> but ſuch minor party, having no guilt, is entitled to every bleſſing and benefit of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as much as any of that party who are moſt cordial to the preſent eſtabliſhment, <hi>i. e.</hi> government ought to hold an even, true, and juſt balance over every ſubject, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and defend the rights, liberties, property, privileges, &amp;c. of every individual equally. The law is the equal right of every man, and therefore every man has an equal right to all its benefits, protections, ſecurities, privileges, and advantages of every kind, till by ſome act of guilt the ſhall forfeit them.</p>
            <p>It may be objected here,—ſhall <hi>the enemies</hi> of the <hi>preſent Conſtitution</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Conſtitution of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> then newly made (but ſince abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the late Convention of the State) was greatly oppoſed by moſt men of gravity and wiſdom, tho' it was carried by a warm party which prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that time, and was propped up by teſt-acts, &amp;c.</note> enjoy the <hi>ſame privileges</hi> under it as its <hi>friends,</hi> who have run <hi>every riſk,</hi> and made the <hi>ſtrongeſt exertions,</hi> to introduce and eſtabliſh it? I anſwer—<hi>Yes.</hi> It is to be preſumed, that the zeal of the patrons of the Conſtitution has ever been directed in all their exertions with a ſingle eye to the public good, otherwiſe they certainly deſerve no favor; if their deſign was to introduce a partial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not equal to all, in which they and their friends could <hi>monopolize the benefits and emoluments</hi> of government to themſelves, they muſt be deemed very execrable, and their plan and adminiſtration moſt pernicious to ſociety.</p>
            <p>Government (both in theory and practice, ſyſtem and adminiſtration) is a ſort of <hi>public thing,</hi> in which <hi>every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual has an intereſt,</hi> and this intereſt is of ſo high and delicate a kind, that <hi>any violation</hi> of it excites the <hi>higheſt reſentment</hi> in the ſufferer. To be thrown <hi>out of the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law,</hi> is a puniſhment of a very high nature, and
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:023972_0482_0FC2A4E5CEC36F28"/>
all good governments pre-ſuppoſes a <hi>conviction</hi> of ſome very <hi>black</hi> and <hi>atrocious crime,</hi> ſome crime of a very high nature and deep guilt. Wherefore, the <hi>leaſt diſfranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>deprivation of any one benefit,</hi> which ought to flow from government equally on every ſubject, muſt partake of the nature of that high puniſhment, and, of courſe, ought never to take place, but where there has preceded a <hi>conviction of ſuch high guilt</hi> as will juſtify it.</p>
            <p>To adopt any <hi>principles</hi> or <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of government, which, from their nature, muſt keep <hi>party reſentments alive,</hi> and fret the community with the perpetual <hi>gnawing anguiſh of continued oppreſſions,</hi> is the height of abſurdity, muſt keep ſociety in a perpetual ferment, and will for ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the community from cementing in ſuch an union, confidence, and acquieſcence in the government, as are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the well-being of civil ſociety; for human nature muſt ceaſe to be what it is, before any part of mankind will acquieſce in an adminiſtration which treats them with <hi>diſtinctions of contempt,</hi> like underlings <hi>cut off from</hi> thoſe <hi>honors or emoluments</hi> of the State, which the government diffuſes with equal benevolence on all their neighbours.</p>
            <p>If the government be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>properly adminiſtered,</hi> it will <hi>prove itſelf ſo by practice;</hi> the benefits of it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed thro' the community, and be felt by every one. This will naturally reconcile every oppoſer to its principles and practice, and it will ſoon have <hi>all good men</hi> for its friends; and when this is the caſe, there will be little danger of public diſquietude ariſing from the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>guilty part</hi> of the community, who are uneaſy with the government only becauſe it reſtrains their wickedneſs, follies, or luſts.</p>
            <p>It appears, then, that the <hi>teſt-acts,</hi> which have for their object the <hi>ſecret thoughts, opinions, ſentiments,</hi> and <hi>deſigns</hi> of men, have an object which no human authority <hi>can</hi> or <hi>ought to reach;</hi> that the very attempt to do this is a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt ſacred rights of the ſubject; It is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion into the great and excluſive prerogative of the AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY, to whom alone <hi>ſecret things belong;</hi> goes on a ſuppoſition that is both uſeleſs and impoſſible, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the ſecret opinions, ſentiments, and deſigns of all men <hi>can or</hi>
               <pb n="476" facs="unknown:023972_0483_0FC2A4F2957DF7E8"/>
               <hi>ought to be alike;</hi> limits the rights, privileges, liberties, and ſecurity of the ſubject, to conditions which are abſurd and ridiculous, becauſe they have no connexion with the <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> or <hi>vice,</hi> the <hi>merit</hi> or <hi>demerit</hi> of the ſubject; and is ſo far from ſecuring the peace, good order, and ſafety of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that it cannot fail, on moſt natural principles, to keep up a perpetual fret and reſentment of parties, to plant and keep alive that diſcord, uneaſineſs, and revenge, which is of the worſt tendency, and generally produces very hurtful, and often very tragical, effects.</p>
            <p>In fine, human nature is ſuch, that all mankind have <hi>ſecret things about them,</hi> which they wiſh and think they have right to hold ſecure againſt the <hi>forcible intruſion</hi> of any body: if they diſcloſe them, it muſt and ought to be their own voluntary act, to which they ought to be <hi>courted,</hi> not <hi>compelled;</hi> any attempt, therefore, by violence and the force of laws, to <hi>wring ſuch ſecrets</hi> from the poſſeſſor, is againſt nature, is an inſult on the natural feelings of every perſon living; the abſurdity, indecency, and injury of which all men living ſee faſt and clear enough, when it is put in practice by their enemies on themſelves or their friends.</p>
            <p>But what adds to the abſurdity of this ill-fated piece of policy, is, that the <hi>little benefit</hi> which is hoped for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it, <hi>fails entirely in the effects;</hi> and ſo after all the riſks, ſcandals, cruelties, and miſchiefs wrought by it, there remains <hi>no balance of profit</hi> at all, and the meaſure turns up at laſt, after all the trouble and pother about it, <hi>ridiculouſly uſeleſs.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>III. The benefits expected from it <hi>all fail upon the trial.</hi> It would, indeed, be a fine thing to have a criterion by which we might diſtinguiſh our friends from our enemies, to have all our ſubjects under the ſtrongeſt voluntary ties to the government, and to have the ſacred power of <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <hi>France;</hi> in which <hi>teſt-acts greatly abounded</hi> (and, I think, they are ever a ſign of a <hi>weak</hi> adminiſtration:) in all theſe we find a cloud of evaſions, explanations, mental reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. which, with infinite variety of operation, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe till they have totally avoided or obliterated the force of the acts.</p>
            <p>For, whatever <hi>obligation</hi> the impoſers of theſe acts may conceive to be in them, or whatever <hi>force</hi> the deciſions of divines, civilians, or canoniſts may give them, it is plain that the general ſenſe and practice of mankind, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed with them, give them <hi>mighty little</hi> or <hi>none</hi> at all. It is a well-known maxim, that the conſtruction of any ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute obtained by uſage and common practice, is of more effect than the words, becauſe ſuch uſage always controls the words: and if this rule may be allowed to apply, mighty little binding force will be left in the teſt-acts.</p>
            <p>Indeed, I think it requires but little acquaintance and obſervation of the world, to ſee plain enough, that it is matter of general ſentiment, that the moſt of mankind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did and always will believe, that if <hi>rulers</hi> or <hi>robbers</hi> attempt by force to wring from you any ſecret of your mind, which they neither <hi>have</hi> not <hi>can have</hi> any right to know, that it is very proper and lawful for you to <hi>deceive them, cheat them, bubble them, and get rid of them any how that you can,</hi> and retain your own ſecret.</p>

I am of opinion, that a little practice of ſuch a ſweet cue on various ſubjects, would ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the utility or abſurdity of this <hi>magical kind of logic,</hi> or method of inveſtigating truth, ſhow how it will ſuit the ordinary feelings of the human heart, and diſcover what rare inducements ſuch curious queſtions muſt excite in ſenſible minds, to tell the <hi>truth,</hi> the <hi>whole truth,</hi> and <hi>nothing but the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this unreaſonable, indelicate method of inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating truth would always produce it, I have ſtill a pretty cogent reaſon againſt the practice of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the public would not be <hi>benefited,</hi> but <hi>greatly prejudiced by ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> I think it is very evident that many ſins do <hi>leſs hurt</hi> while they <hi>lie concealed,</hi> than they would do, <hi>if publiſhed;</hi> caves-droppers rarely hear any good of themſelves; jealouſy is a low, uneaſy paſſion, and is commonly gratified by an <hi>increaſe of torment;</hi> and people that are anxiouſly fond of <hi>fiſhing</hi> for ſecrets, rarely fail to <hi>hook in</hi> trouble; and theſe obſervations are not leſs true, and commonly more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, in <hi>ſtate-policy</hi> than in <hi>private life;</hi> but in both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually indicate <hi>weakneſs of intellects,</hi> diſorders of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, great ignorance of human nature, and that painful, ridiculous anxiety which generally accompanies irritable nerves, and want of true, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound judgment.</p>
            <p>This weakneſs of human nature is a kind of <hi>womaniſh imbecillity,</hi> like tears, which appear much more ridiculous in ſubjects of <hi>dignity and gravity,</hi> than in the <hi>weaker ſex,</hi> to which they more properly belong. Government may enjoin a <hi>thouſand oaths,</hi> and thereby occaſion <hi>ten thouſand perjuries,</hi> not one of which can be proved or puniſhed without <hi>over acts,</hi> and ſuch <hi>overt acts</hi> will have equal effect both of conviction and puniſhment of all the abjured trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>without the oaths</hi> as <hi>with them;</hi> and, of courſe, the oaths are at leaſt uſeleſs, if not hurtful.</p>
            <p>Dignity and gravity ought always to be moſt carefully maintained in government; which will ever loſe its reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability,

when it deſcends to <hi>low, pimping</hi> methods of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. The tree is to be judged by its fruit only.</p>
            <p>It is by <hi>overt acts only</hi> that the deſigns of the heart can be made <hi>to appear;</hi> within this line of evidence we are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited <hi>by the laws of nature,</hi> as within brazen walls, <hi>beyond which</hi> the human powers cannot go. Nor does the ſafety of human ſociety require this to be exceeded; for I am fully perſuaded, if the well-being of mankind had required any other or better way of <hi>diſcovering the ſecrets</hi> of the heart, the <hi>great Governor</hi> of the world would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to men ſome <hi>other way</hi> in which it <hi>could</hi> be done.</p>
            <p>I have on the whole no opinion that <hi>teſt-acts</hi> or even <hi>oaths of allegiance</hi> afford any kind of ſecurity to the State; nor have I any very high opinion of <hi>oaths of office,</hi> but I do greatly object to <hi>any oaths being tacked to an office,</hi> more than the ſimple <hi>adjuration to execute the office legally and faithfully;</hi> and I equally object to municipal rights and privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made dependent on teſt-oaths or ſolemn declarations of ſecret opinions or ſentiments.</p>
            <p>I have candidly given my reaſons for my opinion, which I hope will be candidly conſidered; and beg leave to move, with ſome hope and great humility, that <hi>all acts which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join ſuch oaths,</hi> eſpecially <hi>the teſt-acts,</hi> may be repealed by the proper authority. But if a repeal of thoſe acts ſhould be thought too much, I beg leave to recommend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of ſome of the ſeverities which are impoſed by theſe acts on the non-jurors; particularly their <hi>double tax,</hi> and the demand of that part of their tax in <hi>hard money,</hi> which the jurors are allowed to pay in <hi>paper of about one-third the value of hard money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a reaſon for this, I humbly urge, over and above the capital arguments drawn from the juſtice of government, and the equality and impartiality with which it ought to be adminiſtered to all orders and ranks of people, I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, I wiſh to urge the neceſſity of convincing all our people, <hi>by the equity and impartiality of our government,</hi> that it is a <hi>ſafe and ſure protection</hi> of perſon and property; that

the <hi>burdens</hi> of it are <hi>equally laid,</hi> ſo that no <hi>one part</hi> of the community is <hi>oppreſſed or burdened more than the reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will give a practical proof that our government carries in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the moſt characteriſtic marks of a <hi>free, juſt, and gentle policy,</hi> which is directly oppoſed <hi>to tyranny,</hi> the eſſence of which conſiſts in a <hi>denial or partial diſtribution of juſtice,</hi> and laying <hi>unequal</hi> burdens on <hi>one part</hi> of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, in <hi>favor of other parts.</hi> This will ſoon gain the approbation and confidence of all people of ſerious and cool reflexion; the <hi>violent ravings</hi> of paſſion and prejudice will ſoon <hi>ſpend their own ſtrength,</hi> and ſubſide of courſe, when all <hi>real ground</hi> of complaint is taken away.</p>
            <p>The non-jurors are very numerous; our buſineſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is to get them reconciled, not exterminated. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will ever like that government beſt, where they can enjoy moſt ſecurity, juſtice, and peace. Our political cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, both among neighbours and foreign nations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this; if great numbers of <hi>our own people</hi> have a ſtrong averſion to <hi>our</hi> government, it will afford a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to ſtrangers, that either our people or our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt be <hi>very bad.</hi> Either of which will leſſen our dignity and weight, and injure our public character abroad, and diſcourage that acceſſion of foreigners, which is neceſſary to increaſe our population, trade, and huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rigor</hi> and <hi>force</hi> can never govern any people longer than till they can find an opportunity of <hi>avoiding</hi> or <hi>revenging</hi> it. The underſtandings of the people muſt be convinced and courted, and the cements of ſociety cannot be long want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We may, by perpetual, galling, and odious diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, keep up the <hi>heat and virulencies</hi> of parties, as long as thoſe of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibbelines</hi> laſted in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to about as much advantage, <hi>i. e.</hi> till the peace, wealth, and morality of the country are all ruined.</p>
            <p>We may, if we pleaſe, with more eaſe, like <hi>Henry IV.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> by giving equal juſtice, benefit, and favor to all, ſoon convince all, that the government is their <hi>beſt friend</hi> and <hi>ſureſt protection;</hi> then they will love and truſt it for their own ſakes, and when <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>allegiance</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire

together, and mutually ſupport each other, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has the higheſt poſſible ſecurity of good order, public peace, and ſocial happineſs.</p>
            <p>Sundry other reaſons and obſervations might be added on this ſubject, which I can only hint at here, and leave the reader to enlarge on them as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>I. A great <hi>multiplicity</hi> of oaths makes them <hi>common</hi> and <hi>families,</hi> and thereby <hi>leſſens</hi> their ſolemnity and practical force.</p>
            <p>II. It cannot be expected that they will be <hi>ſincerely taken and kept;</hi> and, therefore, they will introduce many <hi>perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, evaſions, &amp;c.</hi> which naturally tend to eradicate from the mind the high obligation of ſuch awful appeals to the ALMIGHTY, and that <hi>ſolemn ſenſe of truth,</hi> which moſt effectually ſecures the benefits of an oath.</p>
            <p>III. It is preſumed that very few of the preſent non-jurors refuſe the oaths becauſe they wiſh to return to the <hi>Engliſh government,</hi> or becauſe they are averſe to the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican independency;</hi> but for a great variety of other reaſons, which might be eaſily mentioned; and for the truth of this I appeal to the non-jurors themſelves, who can beſt explain their own opinions and ſentiments.</p>
            <p>IV. Some of the enjoined oaths contain <hi>facts</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do not believe to be true, and <hi>contradictions</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reconciled.</p>
            <p>V. People of the moſt delicate ſentiments of religion and truth only, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>beſt people</hi> in the world, may be <hi>governed</hi> and perhaps <hi>hurt</hi> by them; whilſt people of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> character will all avail themſelves of ſome <hi>ſhift or other</hi> to avoid their whole effects.</p>
            <p>VI. The experience of ages and nations proves that this meaſure has ever <hi>failed of producing the effects propoſed and intended</hi> by it. Have we ſecured the obedience and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of one <hi>American</hi> ſubject by it? We have ſeen, with indignation and contempt, the <hi>Britiſh generals</hi> rigidly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>their</hi> oath of allegiance wherever they gained foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hanging ſuch as have relapſed; the conſequence is, they have <hi>diſaffected</hi> and <hi>loſt</hi> all their friends in the
<pb n="482" facs="unknown:023972_0489_0FC2A50BE6D3BA50"/>
ſouthern governments lately, and in all the reſt long ago; the revolts againſt them are nearly univerſal.</p>
            <p>VII. The real object of theſe teſts is not always the <hi>ſafety of the State;</hi> they are <hi>too often</hi> made uſe of as <hi>engines of a ruling party,</hi> to entrap and puniſh ſuch people as they ſuppoſe inimical to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and whoſe conduct is ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and inoffenſive, that they are not liable to puniſhment, but by ſome law which creates a crime which can be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and puniſhed <hi>without the evidence of overt acts.</hi> This is the height of <hi>abomination,</hi> a moſt execrable corruption and abuſe of the moſt ſacred rights of law.</p>
            <p>VIII. When, by ſuch wicked tricks, numbers of our freemen are excluded from their <hi>right of election,</hi> and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their part in the government of the State, the <hi>eſſential principle</hi> on which the government of the United States is founded, <hi>is violated.</hi> This principle is, <hi>that all rights of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lies in the people,</hi> and that <hi>our government</hi> is a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>the people;</hi> which cannot be the caſe where numbers of the <hi>people,</hi> who have a right to a ſhare in it, <hi>are excluded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſy enough for any party which gets into the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to keep their places there, by impoſing ſome <hi>condition</hi> which is either <hi>impoſſible</hi> or <hi>impracticable,</hi> on all the people of <hi>different</hi> ſentiments from themſelves, <hi>e. g.</hi> they may make the very <hi>point in queſtion</hi> between the two parties a <hi>term</hi> of admiſſion or excluſion of the civil privileges and franchiſes of the people.</p>
            <p>This is a ſhort way of cutting down oppoſing parties, and deſtroying their weight in ſociety, and changing the very eſſence of the Conſtitution from being the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>the people,</hi> to that of being a government of <hi>part</hi> of the people <hi>only:</hi> for there is a very wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a government by major vote of <hi>all the people,</hi> and a government by a major vote of <hi>part of the people,</hi> whilſt the <hi>other part</hi> are <hi>excluded</hi> from voting at all; for by this method of proceeding, the governing or voting part may, by repeated excluſions, reduce the government to a <hi>very ſmall number,</hi> a mere <hi>junto of a few,</hi> from which the <hi>main body of the people</hi> may be excluded; which is not the free
<pb n="483" facs="unknown:023972_0490_0FC2A50CE490EA88"/>
               <hi>government of the people</hi> intended by our Conſtitution, but a mere unchecked <hi>tyranny of a few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To effect all which, nothing more is neceſſary than this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> whenever there ariſes an oppoſition to any point car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a majority, for that ſame majority to require <hi>an oath approving the very point in diſpute,</hi> and impoſing a <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of excluſion from <hi>all right of voting,</hi> on ſuch as refuſe the oath, and ſo go on <hi>toties quoties,</hi> whenever an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes. This will effectually exclude the oppoſition from future voting; for men will often <hi>conform</hi> to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carried by a majority againſt them, who would by no means <hi>ſwear an approbation</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This may be repeated till there are but two voters left in the whole State, and then one of them has nothing more to do than to kill the other, and he will be <hi>ſold tyrant,</hi> and will be very ſafe, if he can get a ſtanding army to ſupport him: and this will not be difficult, if he has money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and this too will be eaſy; for the voting part of the community can always lay <hi>what taxes</hi> and <hi>raiſe what money they pleaſe,</hi> and the army which is to receive that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, can eaſily <hi>enforce the collection</hi> or payment of it.</p>
            <p>Nor is this any very unnatural, ſtrained, or extravagant ſuppoſition; for we have often ſeen <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> by the <hi>fatal errors</hi> of their policy, run into a <hi>monarchical</hi> and <hi>deſpotic tyranny:</hi> and the only ſure way to avoid the fatal conſequences of ſuch errors, is to <hi>nip them in the bud; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare principiis,</hi> to detect their principles, and reſtrain and correct the firſt beginnings of them, before they gain ſuch ſtrength as to be irreſiſtible. I am here almoſt compelled to offer to public conſideration one more propoſal, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>

After applying pretty liberally all the hard words he could think of, he gives the character of it as follows—"Of all publications hitherto exhibited in print, ſince the eſtabliſhment of our independence, this Eſſay is foremoſt in barefaced and undiſguiſed principles, to <hi>to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In my reply, publiſhed in the ſame <hi>Journal, Oct.</hi> 5, 1781, I urge that teſt-acts have no more connexion with the <hi>independent government of the Union,</hi> or the <hi>Conſtitution of this State,</hi> than with <hi>all other governments;</hi> but they may be neceſſary to <hi>toryiſm,</hi> as they have been generally moſt <hi>adopted</hi> and <hi>preſſed</hi> in the <hi>weakeſt</hi> and <hi>worſt governments;</hi>—that I do not diſpute <hi>the authority</hi> of any independent State to make teſt-acts; it is the <hi>expediency only</hi> of making them which I object to—that very many <hi>good</hi> men will <hi>refuſe</hi> them, and many <hi>bad</hi> men will <hi>take</hi> them—that the merits and qualities of citizens ought to be taken and eſtimated by their <hi>conduct or overt acts,</hi> not by the <hi>ſecrets of their hearts,</hi> which are cogniſable by GOD <hi>alone,</hi> not by the <hi>State,</hi> till <hi>by overt acts</hi> they are made <hi>known:</hi> the <hi>Conſtitutionaliſt</hi> ſays, that non-jurors are <hi>aliens,</hi> not <hi>citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;</hi> this I denied; for were they <hi>aliens,</hi> they could not be <hi>

            <head type="sub">[Firſt publiſhed in Philadelphia, April 25, 1781.]</head>
            <p>IN my ſeveral treatiſes on <hi>finance,</hi> I have all along en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to open and explain the great general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the ſubject, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>improvement</hi> of the revenue, and <hi>economy</hi> in the expenditures. In this Eſſay I mean to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf to <hi>one particular ſource or object of public wealth,</hi> out of which <hi>great revenue</hi> may be obtained by proper and timely wiſdom and care, I mean, <hi>our vacant, unſettled lands.</hi> I will endeavour to arrange, as clearly as I can, what I have to ſay on this ſubject, under the following heads, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>I. <hi>The whole territory or extent of the Thirteen States is the aggregate of them all, i. e.</hi> the territory or extent of each of the States added together, make the whole territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or extent of right and dominion of the United States; and, of courſe, whatever is comprehended within the boundaries of each State, now makes a part of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
            <p>This is to be conſidered as our <hi>preſent poſſeſſion,</hi> our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent decided right, which is guarantied to us by the treaty
<pb n="486" facs="unknown:023972_0493_0FC2A515CA7EF748"/>
with <hi>France</hi> (Article XI.) together with any 'additions or conqueſts, which our Confederation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore poſſeſſed by <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in <hi>North-America;'</hi> ſo that by conqueſt we may extend our dominion further, if we can; and, in this caſe, we ſhall have the guarantee of the treaty aforeſaid for our ſecurity; but if this cannot be done, our preſent poſſeſſions are abſolutely and unconditionally gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantied to us, with liberty, ſovereignty, and independence, abſolute and unlimited, in and over the ſame.</p>
            <p>And as the great intereſts of <hi>France</hi> and our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth will always make the <hi>perpetual union</hi> of them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſo theſe powers united will be able to afford ſuch a ſure mutual protection to the whole dominions of each other, as will render them wholly ſecure and free of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from any other powers whatever; ſo that we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compute on all the advantages of our preſent poſſeſſions, and turn our thoughts on the ways and means of making the beſt of them; while, at the ſame time, we have a rich and valuable chance of acquiring by conqueſt new domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and having, of courſe, ſuch new acquiſitions co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the ſame guarantee which now ſecures our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Nobody can pretend to deny that our preſent poſſeſſions comprehend <hi>all the lands included within the boundaries of the Thirteen States, as the ſame exiſted at the time our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence firſt began;</hi> but it will be ſtrongly urged that they cannot extend <hi>beyond them,</hi> ſo as to cover any lands not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the bounds of <hi>ſome one</hi> of the States, unleſs we can make a claim to a further extent <hi>by conqueſt;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I do not ſee how we can <hi>otherwiſe</hi> ſupport a claim to independence, ſovereignty, and dominion over any thing which was <hi>not within our bounds</hi> at that time: therefore, it follows,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That wherever we fix the <hi>exterior limit or bounds of any one of the States,</hi> there we fix the <hi>bounds of our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;</hi> and it will be urged againſt us, that all beyond is not our territory, our right, or dominion: and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="487" facs="unknown:023972_0494_0FC2A51989E606F0"/>
2. It is our intereſt <hi>to extend the exterior boundary of each of our States</hi> as far as we <hi>fairly can;</hi> and, of courſe, any attempt (ariſing from envy or any little diſputes) to <hi>abridge or reduce the limits of any of the States</hi> to lines ſhort of their true extent, and ſo prevent their <hi>covering the whole territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to which their original charters, or uſual preſcriptive ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, give them right, is the <hi>height of folly</hi> and <hi>abſurd policy,</hi> and operates directly againſt the great intereſt of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice of the madneſs, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted policy, and <hi>public miſchief,</hi> of a late pamphlet, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Public Good,</hi> which, by very weak and trifling argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, attempts to limit the territory of <hi>Virginia</hi> to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inconſiderable part of its original and true extent. I think ſome note of diſapprobation ſhould be fixed on that treatiſe, leſt it ſhould be produced in future debates, as a proof of the general ſenſe of the States at this time.</p>
            <p>There is, indeed, as is well known, ſome <hi>obſcurity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> to be found in all the <hi>ancient charters</hi> of theſe States, which, by that means, admit of a latitude of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; but moſt of theſe are reduced to a determinate certainty by <hi>ſubſequent acts, deciſions, uſages,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and, I conceive, that for moſt obvious reaſons.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The boundaries of the ſeveral States are to be taken and aſcertained from their original charters, ſuch conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as has obtained by ſubſequent uſage, judicial deciſions, or any other acts of the crown or the inhabitants, which tend to give them a determinate and fixed definition.</hi> If, in any caſe, no light can be drawn from ſuch uſage or ſubſequent acts, the particular boundaries muſt depend on the words of the charters, with ſuch reaſonable conſtruction as ſhall give them their <hi>greateſt effect,</hi> and be <hi>moſt adequate to the original intention</hi> of them, or, in law language, ſo <hi>ut res magis va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leat quam pereat;</hi> by which rule of conſtruction, there can be no doubt but <hi>Virginia,</hi> having boundaries ſufficiently fixed on the ſea-coaſt, is <hi>to extend weſt,</hi> and <hi>carry her breadth</hi> to the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> or at leaſt as far as the <hi>dominion of the crown extended, at the time when American independence firſt began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="488" facs="unknown:023972_0495_0FC2A51D62374ED0"/>
Two things are ſufficiently clear,</p>
            <p>1ſt. That all the States are ſo bounded on each other, that there are <hi>no ſtrips of land lying between any two of them;</hi> and,</p>
            <p>2d. That their weſtern boundary is <hi>the South-Sea,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>weſtern boundary of the dominions of the crown,</hi> at the commencement of our Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>So that the country or territory of the Thirteen States, is clearly bounded on <hi>the weſt</hi> as aforeſaid; on the <hi>ſouth,</hi> by the ſouth line of <hi>Georgia</hi> (about N. lat. 30° 22′) on <hi>the eaſt,</hi> by the ſea, including the iſlands lying in the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing of the coaſt; and <hi>north,</hi> by the north line of the Province of <hi>Maine, New-Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>the Maſſachuſetts State</hi> (about N. lat. 45) its <hi>length,</hi> north and ſouth, is about 1000 <hi>miles;</hi> and its <hi>breadth,</hi> eaſt and weſt (if it extends no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the <hi>Miſſiſſippi</hi> river) about 600 <hi>miles</hi> on the <hi>ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern</hi> part, and 1250 <hi>miles</hi> on the <hi>northern</hi> part.</p>
            <p>The contents of which are ſomewhat more than 810,000 <hi>ſquare miles;</hi> more than equal to thoſe of <hi>France, Spain, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and much more valuable in reſpect of air, climate, ſoil, timber, foſſils, fiſheries, harbors, rivers, &amp;c. with all conveniency for tranſportation, both by mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and inland navigation.</p>
            <p>It is further to be noted here, that with reſpect to <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and ſome other governments, which either never had any charters, or whoſe charters have been ſurrendered to the crown, that the <hi>ſoil and juriſdiction</hi> of them were <hi>both in the crown,</hi> and therefore the King <hi>ever</hi> claimed right to make new grants of ſoil, and carve out and eſtabliſh any new juriſdictions or governments which he thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and on this principle actually did carve <hi>Maryland</hi> and par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> out of <hi>Virginia;</hi> how juſtly I am not to ſay; but this does not hinder <hi>Virginia</hi> from taking her departure from her true eaſtern boundary on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, and covering all the lands within her limits (not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in theſe <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rvatures</hi>) to her utmoſt weſtern boundary.</p>
            <p>It is, indeed, to be obſerved here, that aſcertaining the boundaries of any State, does not prove the <hi>title or right of ſuch State to all lands</hi> included within ſuch boundaries.
<pb n="489" facs="unknown:023972_0496_0FC2A51EAF84AC40"/>
There is a diſtinction to be made between thoſe lands which have been <hi>alienated by the crown,</hi> the title of which, at the date of our independence, was not in the crown, but veſted in particular perſons, either ſole or aggregate, and thoſe which <hi>remained in the crown,</hi> the title of which the crown then held in right of its ſovereignty, which was a right veſted in the ſupreme authority, in nature of a truſt for the uſe of the public.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but every right and title of all perſons and bodies politic are as effectually ſecured and confirmed to the owners, to all intents and purpoſes, under the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> as they were formerly <hi>under the crown;</hi> but it cannot be admitted that any individual or bodies politic ſhould acquire <hi>new rights</hi> by the Revolution, to which they were not entitled under the crown, <hi>i. e.</hi> each State has right to claim, hold, or alienate whatever property or eſtate it had right to obtain, hold, or alienate, whilſt it was a colony under the crown; but cannot have right to claim, hold, or alienate any eſtate, the claim, tenure, or alienation of which was then the right of the crown.</p>
            <p>But every ſuch eſtate being then held by the crown in right of ſovereignty, or its ſupreme power, in truſt for the uſe of the whole community or body politic, of which it was the ſupreme power, muſt paſs, by the Revolution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſupreme power of our Commonwealth, <hi>i. e.</hi> into the Congreſs, and be veſted in them in truſt for the public uſe of the body politic, of which they are the ſupreme power; and the right of tenure and alienation muſt be veſted in them alone.</p>
            <p>Indeed, in all revolutions of government which have ever happened in <hi>Europe,</hi> and perhaps in the whole world, all <hi>crown-lands, jewels,</hi> and <hi>all other eſtate</hi> which belonged to the ſupreme power which <hi>loſt</hi> the government, ever paſſed by the revolution into the ſupreme power which <hi>gained</hi> it; and all ſuch eſtate always became veſted in the <hi>latter</hi> occupant, in the ſame condition and under the ſame limitations to which it was ſubject under the tenure of the <hi>former</hi> occupant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="490" facs="unknown:023972_0497_0FC2A52971E01100"/>
Nor can I ſee the leaſt pretence of reaſon, why we ſhould depart from a rule of right grounded on the moſt plain and natural fitneſs, adopted by every nation in the world under like circumſtances, and juſtified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the experience and ſanction of ages. I think that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our unacquaintedneſs with the heights to which we are riſen, the high ſphere in which we now move, and an incapacity of viewing and judging of things on a great ſcale, could give riſe to ſo extravagant an idea, as that <hi>one State</hi> ſhould be <hi>more entitled than another</hi> to the <hi>crown-lands,</hi> or any other property of the crown, which ever was in its nature public, and ought to continue ſo, or be diſpoſed of for the uſe and benefit of the whole public community; or that one State ſhould acquire more right, or property, or eſtate than another, by that Revolution which was the <hi>joint act,</hi> procured and perfected by the <hi>joint effort</hi> and <hi>expenſe,</hi> of the whole. We have too long and too ridiculouſly ſet up to be wiſer than all the world beſides, and too long refuſed to be inſtructed by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of other nations.</p>
            <p>III. The vaſt territory of the Thirteen States above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and containing ſomething more than 500,000,000 <hi>acres of land,</hi> is moſtly wild and uncultivated; a ſtrip only adjoining to the ſea, and not containing more than <hi>one-third,</hi> or at moſt <hi>two-fifths,</hi> of the whole, and that by far the pooreſt part of the ſoil is any how become private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and ſettled; the reſt remains a large extent of the richeſt wild lands in the world, to be diſpoſed of and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated in future time; and the part which I call ſettled, is ſo far from being filled with inhabitants, that it does not contain more than <hi>one-tenth part</hi> of the people which the ſoil, in a ſtate of perfect cultivation, would ſupport; the frontiers are every where thinly ſettled, and, of courſe, very liable to the inroads of the enemy, and very difficult to defend.</p>
            <p>IV. Six only of the States have a large <hi>weſtern extent</hi> of unſettled lands, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Maſſachuſetts, Connecticut, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, North</hi> and <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and <hi>Georgia;</hi> the other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are limited within <hi>much narrower</hi> bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="491" facs="unknown:023972_0498_0FC2A52E0ED97F98"/>
V. Tho' the <hi>title</hi> and <hi>right</hi> of the ſaid ſix States to their <hi>whole weſtern extent</hi> ſhould be indiſputable, yet the <hi>preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> of it <hi>are ſecured</hi> to them, and the whole muſt for ever <hi>be defended,</hi> by <hi>the arms</hi> and at the <hi>expenſe</hi> of the <hi>States-general.</hi> The <hi>quotas</hi> of this expenſe ought to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned</hi> to the value and extent of the thing ſecured and defended by it; <hi>qui ſentit commodum, ſentire debet quoque onus:</hi> but if the quotas of the ſaid ſix States ſhould be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed</hi> in proportion to the great <hi>extent</hi> of their territory, or even the <hi>value</hi> of the ſame, it would bring ſuch a very <hi>preſſing weight</hi> on the preſent inhabitants, as might be beyond their ſtrength, or at leaſt very inconvenient to them.</p>
            <p>For here it is to be conſidered, that the expenſe of the war is not to be eſtimated merely by the <hi>caſh</hi> it has coſt; but the <hi>devaſtations</hi> of the enemy, the loſs of <hi>lives,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi> are to be brought into the account; and when the eſtimate comes to be made on theſe principles, it will riſe very high on ſuch parts of the intereſt defended as could loſe <hi>no lives,</hi> becauſe it had <hi>no inhabitants;</hi> and was incapable of <hi>devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe it had <hi>no improvements</hi> which could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as all the States have exerted themſelves with <hi>equal ardor, danger,</hi> and <hi>effort</hi> in carrying on the war, it is but reaſonable they ſhould all ſhare <hi>alike</hi> in the <hi>advantages</hi> reſulting from it. To theſe might be added many more ſtrong reaſons why the ſaid ſix States ſhould cede or grant their weſtern uncultivated lands to the States-general, to remain a common ſtock, till they can be diſpoſed of for the good of the whole.</p>
            <p>But I deem it needleſs to urge this matter farther, becauſe I am informed that a general conviction of the expediency of this meaſure prevails thro' all the States, and that it is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed on the part of the ſaid ſix States, to make ſuch a <hi>ceſſion</hi> or <hi>grant</hi> to the States-general, as above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and that the ſame will ſoon be done.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The foregoing ideas and arguments were ſuch as were ſuggeſted at the time when this Eſſay was firſt publiſhed, and were matters of much converſation and diſcuſſion both in and out of Congreſs, but have all been long ſince adjuſted and ſettled.</p>
                  <p>The boundaries of the Union were defined in the treaty of peace with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1783, and extended much beyond the limits here propoſed.</p>
                  <p>And the affair of the great weſtern extent of the ſix States was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to general ſatisfaction, by <hi>ceſſions</hi> of ſuch parts of them to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> lay beyond their ſettlements, ſince which the lands ſo ceded have been conſidered as public property, and as ſuch ſubject to the diſpoſal of Congreſs, for the benefit of the whole Union.</p>

               <pb n="492" facs="unknown:023972_0499_0FC2A084846EF2E0"/>
We will ſuppoſe, then, that this is done, and the right and title of theſe weſtern uncultivated lands veſted in the States-general; what is to be done with them? <hi>i. e.</hi> how are they to be managed, in order to obtain the greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional benefit poſſible from them?</p>
            <p>Some people think we ought to <hi>ſell</hi> or <hi>mortgage them to foreign States,</hi> for money in our preſent diſtreſs. But I have many reaſons againſt this method. The firſt is,</p>
            <p>That it is capable of the moſt demonſtrative proof, that <hi>no importation of money</hi> can help us, even if it was <hi>given to us,</hi> much leſs if our lands are to be <hi>mortgaged</hi> for it. We are in much more danger from <hi>the plenty</hi> of money coming from all quarters in upon us, than from any <hi>ſcarcity of it;</hi> our ſalvation muſt ariſe from the <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> which abounds <hi>in the country,</hi> not in hunting <hi>abroad for money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, I abhor the very idea of <hi>ſtrangers</hi> having their <hi>paw on any of our lands</hi> in any ſhape whatever: and,</p>
            <p>Further, they would bring <hi>mighty little in</hi> this way, <hi>i. e.</hi> very little <hi>preſent</hi> benefit, tho' enough of <hi>future</hi> trouble; it would be like killing the gooſe that laid an egg every day, in order to tear out at once all that was in her belly. But every idea of this ſort is painful to me; I wiſh not to dwell longer on it, but beg leave to propoſe a method which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me more for our advantage.</p>
            <p>I. Let the <hi>ceded territory</hi> be divided from the unceded by the plaineſt lines, and let it be kept in its preſent unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſtate, and preſerved from the <hi>intruſion of any ſettlers</hi> whatever, by the moſt rigid and effectual prohibitions, till the <hi>lands adjoining</hi> are <hi>fully ſettled:</hi> then,</p>

II. <hi>Survey out townſhips of ſix, eight, or ten miles ſquare,</hi> contiguous to the ſettled country, and ſell the lands at ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due to the higheſt bidder, on the following conditions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That none be ſold at leſs than a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dollar per acre.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That every purchaſer be obliged to ſettle and improve his purchaſe within two or three years, or forfeit his lands; the particular regulations of which ſhould be publiſhed at the time of ſale, and be rigidly executed; and when the <hi>firſt courſe or tier</hi> of townſhips are ſold, and the <hi>ſettlement</hi> of them <hi>ſecured,</hi> lay out <hi>another tier,</hi> ſell them in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo on thro' the whole. This method will have the following advantages, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. All the lands ſold will bring at leaſt a dollar per acre; and if we admit, as above computed, thoſe 300,000,000 acres of our weſtern territory to become the public proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the States-general, and allow 100,000,000 acres for lakes, ponds, beds of rivers, barrens, &amp;c. there will remain 200,000,000 acres of good land to be ſold; which, at a dollar per acre, will produce 200,000,000 <hi>hard dollars</hi> for the treaſury of the United States; the annual intereſt of which, at 5 per cent. will be 10,000,000 dollars <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> a ſum much more than ſufficient to defray the whole public expenſes of the Thirteen States, in a time of peace, and, of courſe, a large ſurplus to be expended on a navy, roads, canals, and many other improvements of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with a ſufficient ſum to be laid up for a time of war.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This method will puſh our ſettlements out in cloſe columns, much leſs aſſailable by the enemy, and more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily defended, than extenſive, thin populations; there will be people here for defence <hi>near the frontiers;</hi> they will have the inducements of a <hi>near intereſt</hi> to animate them to the ſervice; their courſe of life and acquaintance with the country will render them much <hi>more fit</hi> for the ſervice, than people drawn from the interior parts of the country; and the neceſſary force may be collected and put into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>much quicker,</hi> and with much <hi>leſs expenſe,</hi> than if the ſame was drawn from diſtant parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="494" facs="unknown:023972_0501_0FC2A08EF098DF48"/>
Theſe and many more and great advantages will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſult from our puſhing out our ſettlements in cloſe columns, which cannot be expected or hoped for from a vaſtly extended fronti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> thinly inhabited.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that every new beginner makes his firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement <hi>in company of near neighbours,</hi> and at but <hi>ſmall diſtance</hi> from <hi>older ſettlements,</hi> much <hi>more eaſily</hi> than he could do alone in a wilderneſs, where he could receive <hi>no helps from neighbours,</hi> let his neceſſity be ever ſo great.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This method would obviate one abuſe very hurtful to new ſettlements, moſt injurious to the individuals who firſt migrate and bear the hardſhips of firſt cultivation, and which greatly retards the population and improvement of a new country, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>large quantities of land lying unimproved in the hands of non-reſidents or abſentees,</hi> who neither dwell on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and, nor cauſe it to be cultivated at all, but their land lies in its wild ſtate, a <hi>refuge for bears, wolves,</hi> and <hi>other beaſts</hi> of prey, ready to <hi>devour</hi> the produce of the neighbouring farmers, bears no part of the <hi>burden of firſt cultivation,</hi> and keeps the ſettlers at an <hi>inconvenient diſtance</hi> from each other, and <hi>obſtructs</hi> the growth and riches of the townſhips in which it lies; whilſt the owner, by the <hi>riſe of the land,</hi> makes a <hi>fortune</hi> out of the <hi>labor</hi> and <hi>toils</hi> of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring cultivators. This is a moſt <hi>cruel way of enriching one man by the labor of another,</hi> and ſo very hurtful to the cultivation of the country, that it ought to be reſtrained by the moſt deciſive meaſures.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This method will give every inhabitant of the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen States an equal chance of availing himſelf of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>procuring lands for the accommodation of himſelf or family;</hi> whilſt, at the ſame time, the ceding State will reap great benefit from the <hi>produce</hi> and <hi>trade</hi> of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining ſettlements, which will, at the ſame time, become a <hi>ſecure barrier</hi> to their frontiers, againſt the incurſions of an enemy on that ſide.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In this method we can <hi>extend our laws, cuſtoms,</hi> and <hi>civil police</hi> as <hi>faſt</hi> and as <hi>far</hi> as we extend our <hi>ſettlements;</hi> of courſe, our frontier people will enjoy every benefit of civil ſociety and regular adminiſtration of juſtice; which
<pb n="495" facs="unknown:023972_0502_0FC2A0962D662D58"/>
cannot take place with equal perfection in the great extent of a thin ſettled frontier.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another thing very neceſſary to be obſerved in the whole management of this affair is, <hi>to cultivate a good and friendly correſpondence with the Indian natives, by a careful practice of juſtice and benevolence towards them.</hi> They are an innumerable race of people, probably extending over a vaſt country to the weſt ſeas, and very great advantages may be derived from their trade, if we can gain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their confidence.</p>
            <p>Whereas nobody ever yet gained any thing by an <hi>Indian</hi> war. <hi>Their ſpoils are of no value; but their revenge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations are terrible. It is much cheaper to purchaſe their lands, than to diſpoſſeſs them by force; and juſtice in all caſes is more profitable than violence and wrong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be noted here, that many inhabitants are already on the lands ſuppoſed to be ceded. What is to be done with them? I anſwer—if their continuance is matter of <hi>uneaſineſs to the Indians,</hi> and is likely to produce broils with them, they are by all means to be <hi>removed.</hi> For it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that the public tranquillity ſhould be endangered for the ſake of the convenience of a few people, who, <hi>without the leaſt pretence of right,</hi> have fixed themſelves down on lands <hi>not their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this, if their continuance will not endanger the public ſecurity, let them keep their poſſeſſions on expreſs condition, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that, when the townſhips in which their poſſeſſions ſhall be included when the future ſurveys ſhall be made, ſhall be ſold, they ſhall pay as much for their lands as the other purchaſers of the ſame town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pay on an average for theirs, excluding every idea of favor, to which they may think themſelves entitled for their <hi>firſt migration</hi> and <hi>cultivation.</hi> For I eſteem all this very wrong and injurious to the public, which rather deſerves puniſhment than reward.</p>
            <p>But there is another objection more forcible, which, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will be pretty readily made to my ſcheme, <abbr>viz.</abbr> all the benefits of this ſcheme are <hi>future,</hi> are a great <hi>way off;</hi> but we want <hi>preſent</hi> ſupplies, to relieve the preſent neceſſities
<pb n="496" facs="unknown:023972_0503_0FC2A099C2699D60"/>
of our country. This was <hi>Eſau'</hi>s argument, when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old his birthright for a meſs of pottage, and is certainly a very good one, when really grounded on fact; for no doubt a man had better give his whole fortune for <hi>one meat</hi> of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, than <hi>ſtarve to death</hi> for want of it; but I think wiſe men will examine this fact very cloſely, and be very deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedly convinced, that the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> preſent neceſſity is <hi>really</hi> great enough to induce us to forego all the fore-mentioned advantages for the ſake of the pittance, the trifle of money which thoſe lands would now bring, if ſold or mortgaged at preſent for the utmoſt they would bring, attended with all the ſhocking and mortifying diſadvantages of giving any foreigners a footing in our country, and a claim upon our moſt eſſential and central intereſts.</p>
            <p>But I think the objection itſelf is grounded on an error; for I think the preſent advantages reſulting from my plan greater than could ariſe from any kind of mortgage or ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation of theſe lands; for I conſider them like a <hi>rich, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and ſure reverſion,</hi> which never fails to give the owner a great eſtimation, credit, and reſpectability in the eyes of his neighbours, tho' he receives no pernancy of preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> profits; but if this reverſion was ſold or mortgaged for a trifle, and ſoon diſſipated (as doubtleſs would be our caſe) the owner would appear in a light more contemptible, and in every view much more diſadvantageous, than if he had never owned the right.</p>
            <p>It cannot be too often repeated, that <hi>we are not capable of being ſaved, or even helped, by the importation of foreign money;</hi> it will deſtroy our <hi>induſtry,</hi> it will introduce <hi>luxury;</hi> the increaſe of <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>eaſe of acquirement will depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate it,</hi> and thereby defeat its own uſes.</p>
            <p>This is as true as the diurnal rotation of the earth, but, like it, not obvious to the perceptions of every mind. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy for us! the <hi>nature of money,</hi> and the <hi>radical eſſence</hi> of the <hi>public finance,</hi> depend on principles <hi>too latent</hi> for eaſy comprehenſion; and what makes the matter more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, like many deluſive appearances in the natural world, is, they ſeem to be perfectly eaſy and obvious, when they are leaſt underſtood; and therefore it has been obſerved in

all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they work like <hi>magic</hi> under the direction of unſkilful men, ever producing <hi>effects</hi> the <hi>leaſt expected,</hi> as well as failing of thoſe <hi>moſt ſanguinely</hi> computed upon.</p>
            <p>Their operations, like other doctrines which depend on an infinity of relations, are governed by ſo many co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating cauſes, that their delineation is very difficult, and their demonſtration intricate, and not to be underſtood without a long and deep attention.</p>
            <p>They make a part of the <hi>great law of proportions,</hi> which nature never fails to regulate and adjuſt with perfect exactneſs, but which the greateſt and ſtrongeſt intellects, with the moſt nervous attention, can but <hi>imperfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, in this, as in all other branches of phyſical knowledge, our ſafeſt cue and ſureſt principles muſt be drawn from experiment. But to return to my ſubject—</p>
            <p>I do not apprehend the actual pernancy of profits from our weſtern lands, when diſpoſed of according to my plan, ſo very diſtant as many may imagine. The argument of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, from what has been to what will be, is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be a good one. If, therefore, upon this rule of reaſoning, we may ſuppoſe that the increaſe of population in our country ſhall continue the ſame in time to come as we have experienced in time paſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the number of ſouls double once in 25 years, it will appear very probable that our own eyes may live to ſee the commencement of a great demand and rapid ſale of our weſtern territory. The number of ſouls in the Thirteen States in 1775, was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally computed at 3,000,000. [Some people of great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation were of opinion, this number was much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.] On the aforeſaid ſcale of computation, the number of ſouls in theſe States, at the end of the next century, will amount to 96,000,000; enough to extend over the whole territory of our Commonwealth, and more than <hi>Spain, France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> now contain.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I will here ſubjoin one thing more, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be thought worthy of ſome conſideration, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that in ſurveying and granting the weſtern lands, all ſaltlicks, and mines of metallic ores, coals, minerals, and all other
<pb n="498" facs="unknown:023972_0505_0FC2A0A39810B888"/>
valuable foſſils (in all which the country greatly abounds) may be reſerved and ſequeſtered for public uſe: a great revenue may grow out of them: and it ſeems unreaſonable that thoſe vaſt ſources of wealth ſhould be engroſſed and monopolized by any individuals. I think they ought to be improved to the beſt public advantage, but in ſuch manner, that the vaſt pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ſſuing from them ſhould flow into the public treaſury, and thereby inure to the equal advantage of the whole community.</p>
            <p>The foregoing conſiderations open to view ſuch great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuch proſpects of vaſt population and national wealth, as may at firſt ſight appear chimerical, illuſory, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. A great miniſter of ſtate was formerly ſo aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the very mention of the vaſt ſupplies predicted by the prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that he, with amazement mixed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, exclaimed, <hi>"If the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be!"</hi> But I mean to ſubject this Eſſay to the moſt rigid examination. Pleaſe to review eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry propoſition, and cloſely examine every argument and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference I make, and if they do not juſtify the concluſion, reject them; but if you find the facts alleged, true, the propoſitions juſt, and the inferences fairly drawn, do not ſtart at your own good fortune, or ſhrink from the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which Heaven pours on your country. The bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries herein deſcribed, by which the contents of our terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories are computed, are taken from <hi>Mitchel'</hi>s map, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1755, at the requeſt of the Lords Commiſſioners of Trade and Plantations, and is chiefly compoſed from draughts, charts, and actual ſurveys of different parts of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> colonies and plantations in <hi>America,</hi> great part of which have been lately taken by their Lordſhips' orders, and tranſmitted to the plantation-office, as is certified by <hi>John Pownal,</hi> ſecretary of ſaid office, and is perhaps a map of the beſt authority and greateſt accuracy of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. The facts are of public notoriety. The computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are all made on obvious principles, and may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by any body, if wrong. The ſentiments are my own, and are cheerfully ſubmitted to the moſt rigorous ſcrutiny that can conſiſt with truth and candor. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="499" facs="unknown:023972_0506_0FC2A0A4BAEFDC30"/>
is very large; I do not pretend to exhauſt it, or that this Eſſay is a finiſhed piece; it is a ſketch only, a draught of outlines, which, I hope, will be allowed to deſerve at leaſt a candid attention. I wiſh it might be ſufficient to produce a full conviction, that it cannot be the intereſt of the United States either, 1ſt. to ſuffer ſuch vaſt and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bleſſings to be raviſhed from us by our enemies; or, 2d. to conſent to their being ſold and alienated to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, for any little, trifling preſent conſiderations; ſuch fooliſh bargains muſt originate in very narrow views of the ſubject, and terminate in ſhame and loſs, and in every ſtage be marked with mortification, diſputes, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment.</p>
            <p>I will conclude by juſt obſerving, that this Eſſay is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confined to one branch only, to one ſingle reſource, of our public revenue; only one item of our national wealth: an income vaſt indeed, not drawn at all from the purſes of the people, but capable of being ſo conducted, that every individual who chooſes to be intereſted in it, may find a good profit reſulting from the concern. I do not doubt but if the whole great ſubject was properly ſurveyed by a mind capable of ſuch reflections, many other ſources of revenue might be found, of vaſt utility to the public, and in no ſenſe injurious, but highly profitable, to individuals. So to graft the revenue on the public ſtock, ſo to unite and combine public and private intereſts, that they may mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſupport, feed, and quicken each other, is the ſecret art, the true ſpirit of financiering; but we muſt never loſe ſight of this one great truth, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that all reſources of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic wealth and ſafety are only materials put into our hands for improvement, and will prove either profitable or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful according to the wiſdom or folly with which they are managed. Ruin may grow out of national wealth, as well as from national poverty. Perhaps it may require more great and good talents to ſupport an affluent fortune than a narrow one. Affluence has at leaſt as many dangers as indigence. All depends on the characters of the men who manage them. The happineſs and wretchedneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions depend on the abilities and virtue of the men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:023972_0507_0FC2A0A62EB55238"/>
in the direction of their public affairs. And I pray God to impreſs a due ſenſe of this great and moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant doctrine on the minds of all electors, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the appointment of public officers.<note n="*" place="bottom">
