            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It is some special sin of a people the Lord is most provoked with when he sends his Judgments upon a people, the Lord is a God of Judgment, <hi>by him Actions are weighed,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 3. And there are some sins cast the scale for some particular judgments, see <hi>Amos</hi> 1·3.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 2 4, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This sin must be known, as there can be no Repentance <hi>with out</hi> Conviction, so where it is only of generals, that is not true: there is some special sin end of a person that is leading &amp; ruling so among a people, this must be known in order to the Confession and Reformation of it as evident by the enquiry, <hi>v</hi> 8. and the Prophets reply to it, and by the charge the Lord gives about it, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.11·12</p>
            <p>Two things necessary to be known here.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The evil in the nature of it, <hi>v</hi> 8. Offence against God, and that of an heinous nature; it is a robbing of him, taking away by force.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the effects, the mischief it brings, its that curseth all your blessings, and that upon a whole Nation, by Gods violent taking away that which they had, fair hopes and expectation to have enjoyed, which they are to look upon as the fruits of the Curse for this sin: It is Gods seizing that which your sin had forfeited into his hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another part of true Repentance is deep humiliation, as for all, so especially for this sin, which though it is not so plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, yet it is fully implied in the <hi>Text</hi>; for there will be no tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Reformation when there is not a heart separated from it, Which is in this way.</p>
            <p>This lies in these three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 An humble and penitent Confession of it, <hi>Psalm</hi> 51.4· In self-condemning, and justifying God in all his Proceedings with you,

upon the provocation given, so great a part this is that it is som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time put for the whole, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3: 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9: It being the most difficult where it is sincere, and will certainly be attended with the rest.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Inward shame and confusion,</hi> Ezra 9 4 Jer. 3.22. Rom. 6.21 <hi>it speaks the sinner duly affected with the offence to God, and mischief to himself.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 <hi>Dislike and hatred of it, your self aborrence,</hi> Job 42 6, 7 Isai. 64 6 <hi>this is called the knowing the plague of the heart.</hi> 1 Kings 8.38, 39.</p>

            <p>Q 3 Why this is the sure and only Remedy.</p>
            <p>Answ <hi>That it is so is so fully attested in Scripture, and made good by Providence, and a subject you are so well acquainted with that I shall not insist upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 But that it is a sure way will appear,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Because this is the only Remover of the cause of the controversie; such Judgments are effects of Gods displeasure, which is not against his creature but the Sinner,</hi> Lam. 3.33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Creatures come to execute the curse upon a People of Gods Wrath, but where true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, they are not the Subjects it unvalidates their Commission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms them, his condition is changed where such a changed disposition is, Jer</hi> 50 20.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Two things are requisite in order to this:
<list>
                     <item>1 Enquiry into the cause of the Judgment, or to find out sin, that sin that God is most displeased with.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The first of these is that <hi>I</hi> shall endeavour to further you in, this being a great part of Ministerial work in such a day, <hi>Isa</hi> 58 1 To tell the people of their sins; as it is every christians to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Lord to show him his sin, <hi>Job</hi> 10.2 <hi>Job</hi> 34 32 sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out of sin is the great duty in days of affliction, and in that search, its the christians duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To acknowledg their own ignorance and darkness about sin, and especially those God is chastening for, the best may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and the humble Soul sees it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 To desire Gods teaching:</p>
               <p n="1">1 By his Word, that is the ordinary and visible way of Gods teaching in an Ordinance, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1.</p>
               <p>

               <p>To help on this work, we have a plain discovery in my Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>What is that Sin which provokes the Lord, to inflict such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as we are now under, why he sends Devourers to lay your fields waste?

In giving your selves up to God, and so to his people, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. when he had commended their liberality, he tells you the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, it was in giving themselves to God, and to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple according to his Will; all our offerings to God will not avail without this.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Then bring your offering, that which is yours,</hi> Mal. 3.10. <hi>bring your Tithes, that there may be meat in my house</hi>: And let this be done,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Chearfully, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. the Lord loves a chearful giver, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this case, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.16, 17, 18. that is of Gods giving, and is a singular mercy where it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Faithfully; do not withdraw any of what is Gods due, let there be meat in my house, let it be as the case needs. I might urge and move to this duty by considering,</p>
