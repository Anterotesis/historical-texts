            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Practice of this Nature abounds with the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Abſurdities, and ſtands emphatically explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even in the Time of the <hi>Moſaicddeck</hi> Law, by the Royal Pſalmiſt, in theſe Words: <hi>Unto the Wicked God faith, What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But alas! <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> prompts Men to turn a deaf Ear even to the moſt divine Expoſtulations, and unholy Perſons will, in deſpight of the moſt expreſs Prohibitions, continue to intrude themſelves beyond their Bounds; and will be ſtill buſying and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves about external Circumſtances and Ceremonies, while the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, Spirit and Subſtance of true Religion is placed above their Reach, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable by them, until it ſhall pleaſe God, in the exceeding Riches of his Grace, to cleanſe their Heart from all Unrighteouſneſs; of which Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we heartily wiſh for a nearer Proſpect than we can diſcern at preſent.</p>
            <p>We now return to the Author of the enſuing Narrative, who was another Sort of Preacher; a free Giver o what himſelf had freely received, a liberal and open-hearted Communicator of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Experiences unto all other Men, without Reſpect of Perſons.</p>
            <p>He directed all the Sheep of Chriſt to follow the Voice of Chriſt himſelf, the good Shepherd, whoſe Omnipreſence readers his Voice audible to every
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:008308_0005_102E87346DA93198"/>
one of his Sheep, however ſeparate or diſperſed throughout the World.</p>
            <p>His Converſation was free, generous and affable; neither did he ſhun the Society of thoſe whom he was ſent to convert; his Miſſion being ſomewhat correſpondent to that of his Lord and Maſter, who declared concerning himſelf: <hi>I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> Mat. ix 13.</p>
            <p>He was of a grave Deportment, and of a tall, comely and manly Aſpect: His publick Preaching was attended with ſuch a divine Authority and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Innocence, as commanded the Attention of his Hearers; and his Voice being clear, ſtrong and diſtinct, was capable of conveying his profitable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to the Ears and Underſtandings of a very numerous Auditory; of which a remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance appears in his Preaching at <hi>Jedburgh</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> mentioned in Page 46, 47, of his Account.</p>
            <p>His literal Accompliſhments were but ſmall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending little farther than to enable him to read the Scriptures in his Mother Tongue; yet by conſtant Uſe and Application, he became thoroughly verſed therein, and enabled by the Force of their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to confront and confute the Gain-ſayers of his Doctrine, which was in all Points ſtrictly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, and conſonant therewith.</p>
            <p>In the religious Society to which he was joined, he conducted himſelf as a Man of Peace and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:008308_0006_102E873718EC4B78"/>
chuſing to walk in the plain and middle Path, without declining to any Extream; ſo that he neither idolized Forms, nor contemned <hi>good Order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Eſtimation and Repute among his Friends and Neighbours, may appear by the Teſtimony of the Monthly and Quarterly-meetings of <hi>Bridport</hi> in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> to which he belonged, given forth ſince his Deceaſe, wherein they ſay, that <q>It pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord to endue him with a large Gift in the Miniſtry, in which he was a faithful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, and gave himſelf up for that Service; that he had a Gift of Utterance ſuperior to many, ſound in Judgment and Doctrine, and very convincing to the Underſtandings of thoſe that heard him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Teſtimony concerning him is true, and a Man of his Penetration and Capacity could not but diſcern his own Improvement in the Gift he had received: Wherefore he ſtood upon his Guard, leſt through Self-love and Conceit, he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that Humility, which is the Ornament of every Goſpel Miniſter, as in Page 38 he has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly obſerved.</p>
            <p>Which <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Virtue was generally his Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, during the Courſe of his Pilgrimage; and is remarkable in the Compoſure of this Account, in keeping it clear from, and unſullied with any the leaſt Tincture or Symptom of Self-Applauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:008308_0007_102E8739C34EE4B0"/>
As in Preaching, his Declarations proceeded from his Heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o in Writing his Relations of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and his Exhortations, ſprang from the ſame Fountain.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we recommend to thy ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration what he has written, as comprehended in that excellent Deſcription of a good Men, given by CHRIST himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 45. <hi>A good Man, out of the good Treaſure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is good.</hi>

What I obſerved was, though very young, how tender and broken they were; and I was very inquiſitive of my Mother, why they cried ſo much, (which we called Greeting) and thee greet too, (ſaid I) why did thee? She told me that I could not underſtand the Reaſon of it then, but when I grew up more to Man's Eſtate I might.</p>
            <p>Now to return to my Apprenticeſhip; I had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind loving Maſter and Miſtreſs, and I had Meat enough, and Work enough, but had little Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation about Religion, nor any Taſte thereof. On <hi>Firſt-days</hi> I frequented Meetings, and the greater Part of my Time I ſlept, but took no Account of I reaching, nor received any other Benefit than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there kept out of bad Company, which indeed is a very great Service to Youth. I took much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Diſcourſe, and was taken Notice of as a witty, ſenſible young Man: But often on my Bed I ruminated on my Way of Life with Reluctance, yet frequently fell into the ſame Way again: I never was given to Swearing, nor any very groſs Vice, but what I gave way to the moſt, was Jeſting, and Turns of Wit to provoke Mirth, which gave me often (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was over) a heavy Heart; and thus I went on for near three Years; but one <hi>Firſt-day,</hi> being at Meeting, a young Woman, named <hi>Anne Wilſon,</hi> was there and preached; ſhe was very zealous, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Eye upon her, ſhe with a great Zeal pointed her Finger at me, uttering theſe Words with mach Power, <q>A traditional <hi>Quaker,</hi> thou comeſt to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as thou went from it (the laſt Time) and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008308_0011_102E87446DAC4A90"/>
for thy coming, what wilt thou do in the End?</q> This was ſo pat to my then Condition, that, like <hi>Saul,</hi> I was ſmitten to the Ground, as it might be ſaid, but turning my Thoughts inward, in ſecret I cried, <hi>Lord, what ſhall I do to help it?</hi> And a Voice as it were ſpoke in my Heart ſaying, <hi>Look unto me and I will help thee!</hi> and I found much Comfort, that made me ſhed abundance of Tears. Then I remembered what my Mother told me ſome Years before, that when I grew up more to Man's Eſtate, I ſhould know the Reaſon of that Tenderneſs and weeping, and ſo I now did to Purpoſe. I went home with a heavy Heart, and could neither eat nor ſleep as I uſed to do, but my Work never ſucceeded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in my Hands than it did at this Time, nor my Mind never leſs in it; but my Conduct, as well as Countenance, was much altered, ſo that ſeveral in the Family were doubtful that I ſhould fall into a kind of melancholy Diſtraction; but I longed for the Meeting-day, and thought it a very long Week. When the Time of Meeting came, my Mind was ſoon fixed and ſtaid upon God, and I found an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Enjoyment that gave me great Satisfaction, my Underſtanding being opened, and all the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Mind ſo quick, that I ſeemed another Man; a divine and ſpiritual Sweetneſs abiding with me Night and Day, for ſome Time, and I began to ſee and underſtand the Scriptures, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of preaching the Doctrine of the Goſpel in the Power and Spirit, plainly ſeeing a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Preacher of the Letter and of the Spirit, which till then I was wholly ignorant of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008308_0012_102E8748432B9D70"/>
with, not having before that, the leaſt Degree that I could perceive of divine Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but then upon looking back, and conſidering what I had heard ſuch and ſuch Friends preach, which at that Time I did not underſtand, but now I underſtood it clearly, which was a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to me, that all divine Knowledge is from divine Light, which we can't comprehend, until we are aſſiſted ſo to do by a Viſitation from Heaven.</p>
            <p>And now the Scriptures, and Miniſtry from the Openings of the Spirit, ſeemed ſo clear and plain to my Underſtanding, that I wondered that any Body remained unconvinced, ſuppoſing them to ſee the Truths of the Goſpel in the ſame Light that I did; and that Saying of the Apoſtle, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 John v. 20</note> wherein he aſſerts his Knowledge of the Son of God being come, from <hi>their receiving an Underſtanding from him,</hi> was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered to me, ſo that now I plainly ſaw a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between the Children of Light, and of this World; the ſpiritual, and the natural Man; and that the natural Man could not receive the Things of the Spirit of God, being Fooliſhneſs to him; he can't know them, becauſe they are known <hi>only by the Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,</hi> as the Apoſtle aſſerts; <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Corinthians ii 14.</note> and I found myſelf much improved in divine Wiſdom and ſaving Knowledge. As I was going to Meeting walking alone, it came very livingly into my Mind, that if I was but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obedient to the heavenly Viſion, I ſhould ſoon be qualified to teach others, and more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I ſaw by Experience wherein my ſhortneſs had
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008308_0013_102E874B32473740"/>
been, in being contented and eaſy with a Form of Truth and Religion, which I had only by Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being brought up in Plainneſs of both Habit and Speech; but all this, though very good in its Place, did not make me a <hi>true Chriſtian;</hi> I was but a <hi>traditional Quaker,</hi> and that by Education only, and not from the Scriptures, becauſe they were a Book ſealed to me. And I now ſaw plainly that Education, though never ſo carefully adminiſtred, would not do the Work: although a pious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought by no Means to be neglected, but all Parents and Guardians ought to be ſtirred up to their Duty in that Reſpect; yet we muſt conſider, that it is not in the Power of Parents, or the moſt pious Tutors to confer Grace, which is the Gift of God alone; nor can any come into the true Fold but by <hi>this Door,</hi> as ſaid our Saviour <note n="‡" place="bottom">John x. 1, 2, 3.</note> concerning himſelf. Thus it plainly appeared to me, there was no other Way but this, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt alone,</hi> to attain to true Faith, which works by Love, and give Victory over our Infirmities and evil Deeds, working ſuch a Change in us, that we can in Truth from Experience ſay, <hi>we are born from above,</hi>
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">John iii. 3, 4, 5.</note> and by Virtue of that Birth only, is the <hi>true Knowledge</hi> of the Kingdom, and the Things of God <hi>attained,</hi> and by no other Way or Means although never ſo well contriv'd by human Art: And being experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally ſenſible of this Change wrought in my Mind, it look'd the more likely that I might in Time be qualified to ſpeak to others of my own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008308_0014_102E874CB7600680"/>
of the Operation of the Spirit, in my Mind, not thinking the Time ſo near at Hand, as it appeared when I came to the Meeting; for I had not ſat long therein, but a great Weight fell upon me, with ſome Words to ſpeak; but I conſider'd, (being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be my own Carver) it was too ſoon to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a Taſk, being hut an Inſtant in Religion; not remembring the ſmall Time between <hi>Paul</hi>

               </gap> for that Time, for theſe Reaſons give up, and the Burden was then taken from me: But after that Meeting it came upon me again with double Weight, and affected me ſo very greatly that I was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and my Countenance ſo altered with Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that my Maſter took Occaſion to enquire into the Matter, <hi>how it was with me?</hi> And I gave him as plain Account as I was capable of, which he was much affected with indeed, and broke into Tears: What I feared was, that I had by Diſobedience ſo much offended, that I ſhould be caſt off for ever: But with ſundry Exhortations from Scripture and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, he endeavoured to pacify me, not doubting but that I ſhould have the like Offer made me, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me in Mind of <hi>Gideon's</hi> Fleece,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Judges vi.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When next Meeting-day came, I went in great Weakneſs

and Fear, and could rather have gone elſewhere, than to Meeting that Day; however, ſome Time after I was in the Meeting, I felt the ſame Concern as at the Meeting before, and I ſat under the Weight of it till the Meeting was a moſt over, and then hardly knew how I got upon my Feet, but did, and broke out with a loud Voice in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him which is able to deſtroy both Body and Soul in Hell. I ſay, fear you him who will terribly ſhake the Earth, that all which is moveable may be ſhaken and removed out of the Way, that that which is immoveable may ſtand.</q> This was all I had to ſay at that Time. But oh! what Joy and Sweetneſs I felt afterward I can't expreſs, and the Pleaſure of my Mind appeared in my Countenance, ſo that my Maſter took Notice, and ſpoke of it ſo feelingly, that plainly demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he was a Partaker with me of the ſame Rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in himſelf, as at the Birth of an only Son: This was about the Year 1696, on that called <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> it falling that Year upon the Firſt-day of the Week.</p>
            <p>Thus having (as it may be ſaid,) broke the Ice, the next Time was not quite ſo hard, but I ſaid very little, and ſeldom appeared for a Year or two, having about three Years of my Apprenticeſhip to ſerve, which I did with Fidelity and Truth. The laſt Year of my Time, I found ſome conſiderable word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my Mind to viſit <hi>Scotland,</hi> being very rarely without ſome Degree of divine Virtue on my Mind, either by Night or Day; therefore I thought, if it was ſo with me then, it would be much more ſo
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008308_0016_102E875334337AC8"/>
when I had nothing to mind but divine Things; but I found it otherwiſe, of which in its Place. I may not omit, that ſometime above two Years after I firſt ſpoke in Meetings, I open'd the New-Teſtament at that Paſſage ſpoken of by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 28. to the ſame Effect with what was firſt open'd on my Mind, as mention'd above, which then I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, as being the Sayings of Chriſt to warn them againſt the Fear of Men; altho' no doubt I had read it, but had taken ſo little Notice of what I read, it was to me as if it had been never writ. But it was a great Comfort to me, that I was thus opened in a material Point of Doctrine of our bleſſed Lord at my firſt ſetting out.</p>
            <p>About this Time I had a Deſire to viſit a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Meeting called <hi>Yelland,</hi> it being the firſt that I ever had a Concern to viſit, and deſired my dear Friend <hi>Iſaac Alexander,</hi> to go with me. Agreeing upon the Time, I went to <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Brother's Houſe the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> Evening before, where <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived; and he and I went to viſit <hi>James Wilſon</hi> and his Parents that Evening: <hi>James</hi> was under Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not his Parents. We had ſome Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but being called to Supper, left off abruptly. After Supper I could not be eaſy without repeating my Viſit, and <hi>James's</hi> Mother being very quick in the Scriptures, ſhe deſired my Judgment on thoſe Texts in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Peter; Behold, I create new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and new Earth, wherein dwells Righteouſneſs.</hi> And my Underſtanding was opened to preach unto her the new Birth ſo effectually, that ſhe was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced, and continued an honeſt Friend

So we ſet out; <hi>Kendal</hi> being the firſt Meeting, and then to <hi>Preſton, Yelland, Height, Hawkeſhead,</hi> and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Part of <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> in about three or four Weeks. But the Poverty of my Spirit was ſo exceeding great and bitter, that I could ſcarcely bear it, but cried out aloud, and it was ſo ſurprizing to my Companion, that we being by ourſelves walking on Foot, he feared it would be too hard for me, for I complained that I was <hi>deceived</hi> or <hi>miſtaken;</hi> becauſe, while I was in my Maſter's Work, I rarely by Night or Day was without ſome Degree of divine Virtue on my Mind, but now I could feel nothing but the Bitterneſs of Death and Darkneſs; all Comfort was hid from me for a Time, and I was baptiſed into Death indeed. As we went along, I ſaid to <hi>Iſaac</hi> with a Vehemency of Spirit. <hi>Oh! that I was in my Maſter's Work again, and favoured with my former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of divine Life, how acceptable it would be!</hi> We came at our Journey's End, to one <hi>Miles Birket's,</hi> who was more than uſually kind to us; but alas!

he did not know my State and Poverty. Next Day we went to another Meeting at <hi>Hawkeſhead,</hi> it was a little better with me, but very poor; and ſo we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our Journey in about a Month, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Father's Houſe, and I to my Maſter <hi>Parat's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I being very loath to go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> having been proved with ſo much Poverty of Spirit, the Cup was ſo bitter I could hardly bear it; however, I kept my Mind to myſelf, and we ſet forward on Foot, viſiting Part of <hi>Cumberland</hi> in our Way, and I thought <hi>Iſaac</hi> had very fine Service, ſo much ſuperior to mine, that after him I was afraid to leſſen or hurt what Good he had done; and before him, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſtand in his Way. He was very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired indeed, and ſome were convinced by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: We accompliſhed that Journey in about two Months Time. At our Return Hay-harveſt came on, and I went to Mowing, and on the Meeting-days went juſt where my Mind led me, and grew in my Miniſtry very much, and the Lord let me ſee his Kindneſs to lead me through that State of Poverty, which was of great Service to qualify me to ſpeak to others in the like Condition, and that Trials of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Kinds were for my Improvement and Good, tending to my Eſtabliſhment in the true Root of a divine and ſpiritual Miniſtry, and the Doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles <note n="†" place="bottom">Matthew v. 3.

I ſeemed very poor and low, and blamed myſelf much for appointing another Meeting in ſo poor and weak a Frame of Mind; the Meeting came on, and proved better than I expected: But I was very low, and it being a clear Moon-light Night, I walked into the Friend's Orchard behind his Houſe, bemoaning myſelf very much, as having loſt my Guide, and fallen from that happy Condition I was in the Week before: The Friend of the Houſe finding I tarried, came out to meet me, having a Senſe of my low State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

Next Day I went to <hi>Swannington</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and there was a fine Body of Friends again, and I had not ſat long, before I felt, as I to ought, as good an Authority to preach as ever, and ſtood up, not doubting an open, ſatiſfactory Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But I had not ſtood above fifteen, if ſo many, Minutes, until all was ſhut up, and it ſeemed as though both the Sun and Air were darkened.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008308_0023_102E87622A55FB70"/>
and make the beſt of my Way to ſome Port in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſell my Horſe, and get Work (where I was not known) at my Trade: But then the Honour of the Monthly-meeting, that had given me ſo good a Certificate, would be affected by my ſo doing: And having conſidered of ſundry Ways to take, at laſt this preſented, to make away with myſelf in ſome River or Pond, as though it had been an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and this would cover all. Thus for a Time I was bewildered, not ſeeing where I was; but ſince it plainly appeared I was under the Influence of the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> Thus begging heartily for Help, I fell on my Knees, and prayed with that Fervency, that few under the Roof but were melted into Tears, and it was ſuch a Time as I never had before nor ſince in Prayer, as I remember: Thus that Meeting ended. Next I went to a Town called <hi>Hinckley,</hi> and there was a conſiderable Number of Friends and other People; I was extremely low and poor, but had a comfortable Meeting, that much healed me, and ſet me to rights again.</p>
            <p>Then I viſited <hi>Leiceſterſhire</hi> pretty generally, and there was a Woman of ſome Account (her Name was <hi>Jemimah Mountney)</hi> who was convinced, and ſhe was with me at ſundry Meetings, and was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender and loving, being throughly reached and ſatisfied. When we parted, ſhe was ſo open-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I was called aſide by her, and after having ſaid ſomething to me about her inward Condition, ſhe offered me ſome Pieces of Gold, which I told her, I durſt not touch; ſhe very courteouſly, and with a becoming genteel Mein, told me, <hi>ſhe was</hi>

               <hi>both able and willing, and as ſhe had no other Way, that ſhe could ſhew her Gratitude for that ſpiritual Good ſhe had received by my Miniſtry, ſhe could do no leſs than that,</hi> beſeeching <hi>that I would receive it, as the true Token of her Love and Reſpect.</hi> In anſwer, I ſaid, <hi>it was what I never had done, nor could I now do it, but all the Reward I deſired and expected was, that ſhe might carefully, with a ſincere Heart, endeavour that her Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience did keep pace with her Knowledge, the hearing of which would much rejoice my Soul:</hi> We parted in great Love and Tenderneſs. I heard that ſundry others were convinced in that Neighbourhood. A very honeſt Friend, whoſe Name was <hi>Brooks,</hi> took great Pains to get the ſeeking People to Meeting, and I was very much enlarged in pertinent Matter, ſuitable to the States of ſuch ſeeking Souls.</p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> being very well rewarded for the Bitterneſs I ſuffered before I came into it (which, as before, was as much as I could bear) I paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and had ſome good Opportunities in that Country, as at <hi>Warwick</hi> and ſundry other Places. I found I often hurt myſelf by ſpeaking too faſt, and too loud, againſt which I endeavoured to guard as much as I could; but oft, when I felt my Heart filled with the Power of divine Love, I was apt to forget myſelf and break out; I found it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therefore to ſtop, and after a ſhort Pauſe, with ſome ſecret ſnort Prayer for Preſervation, and that I might be ſupplied with Matter and Power, that might do the Hearers good. Thus I went on, and grew ſenſibly in Experience and judgment, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in ſome ſmall Degree ſkilful in dividing of the

Word. I had been ſtraitned in my Mind reſpecting ſearching the Scriptures, leſt I ſhould thereby be tempted to lean upon them, and by gathering either Manna or Sticks on the Sabbath-day, Death would enſue; but at laſt I had Freedom to examine the Text, and to conſider where the Strength of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument lay, both before and after the Words I had repeated: By which Conduct I ſaw I was often very defective, in not laying hold the moſt ſuitable Part to confirm the Subject or Matter I was upon, and this Conduct did me great Service: But then another Difficulty ſtood in my Way, which was this; ſome former Openings would come up, which I durſt not meddle with, leſt that by ſo doing I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come formal, and loſe that divine Spring which I had always depended upon; but the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhew me, that old Matter, opened in new Life, was always new, and that it was the Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit alone which made it new, and that the principal Thing I was to guard againſt was, not in my own Will to endeavour to bring in old Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without the Aid of the Spirit; and that if I ſtood ſingle and reſign'd to the divine Will, I ſhould be preſerved from all Error of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Out of <hi>Warwickſhire</hi> I travelled into <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> viſiting ſundry Meetings in that County, and found a freſh Supply every Day.

My Landlord thought he had ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſagreeable in his Conduct, and fearing it would be an Uneaſineſs to me, ſpoke very tenderly, and like a nurſing Father encouraged me, by ſaying <hi>I could not ſhew him a better Confirmation that I was anointed for the Miniſtry, than I had already done.</hi> So in the Evening, alter it was dark, he and many other Friends came; but my Landlord, the old Friend and I, went aſide, and I let him ſee what he deſired ſo much to ſee; he read it, being much pleaſed with it, and knowing ſundry Friends that had ſigned it, enquired after them. We went to our Friends again, who were much increaſed in Number, and we had a heavenly Seaſon, being throughly baptized together: We parted in great

Love and Sweetneſs, and the old Friend was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding kind.</p>
            <p>From thence I went into <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Part of that County, by <hi>Tewkeſbury</hi> to <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham, Glouceſter, Payneſwick, Nailſworth,</hi> and <hi>Tedbury.</hi> I had ſundry good Opportunities: One young Woman was convinced at <hi>Tedbury,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a very good Friend.</p>
            <p>From thence into <hi>Willſhire</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> as far as <hi>Ringwood,</hi> and to <hi>Pool</hi> and <hi>Weymouth;</hi> called at <hi>Wareham</hi> and <hi>Corfe,</hi> had a Meeting at each Place, but nothing worthy noting at either of them: So I travelled to <hi>Bridport, Lyme, Membury, Chard</hi> and <hi>Crewkern,</hi> and back to <hi>Somerton, Puddimore, Maſſon</hi> to a Funeral, and to <hi>Yeovil</hi> on <hi>Firſt-day;</hi> thus having viſited <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> I went away into <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire</hi> as far as <hi>Exeter;</hi> then turned up towards <hi>Taunton,</hi> taking Meetings in my Way towards <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but nothing happened of Weight.</p>
            <p>I ſtaid in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and viſited Meetings about the City near five Weeks, and from thence I found my Mind was much drawn to viſit <hi>Wales,</hi> and I took the Quarterly-meeting of <hi>Hereford</hi> in my Way, which was held annually at <hi>Amelly,</hi> and there I met with my dear Friend <hi>Iſaac Alexander:</hi> We were glad to ſee each other, as well as to hear each other, which when we did, it appeared to me that <hi>Iſaac</hi> was improved conſiderably, and he ſaid the ſame of me, obſerving, that I preached the practical Doctrine of the Goſpel, he thought, more than he did; for his preaching was very much in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons and Allegories, which he apprehended was

not ſo plain and eaſy to the Underſtandings of the Vulgar, as what I had to ſay. We had now an Opportunity of opening our Minds to each other, which was of great Service to us both, having ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Meetings together, and we had Drawings for the Yearly-meeting at <hi>Glannedleſs</hi> in <hi>Wales:</hi> This Opportunity ſeemed very agreeable to us; there were ſundry Friends of note, <hi>Benjamin, Bangs,</hi> and others out of <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> the People came, in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and at Times were very rude, but in the main it was a ſerviceable Meeting. After that I viſited <hi>Wales,</hi> appointing from the Yearly-meeting ſundry Meetings, as far as was thought proper at once, and a good old Friend, <hi>Philip Leonard,</hi> offered to be my Companion, which was of great Service to me. I was very poor and low at moſt Meetings in that Journey, by reaſon but few of the People could well underſtand what I ſaid in ſundry Places: But <hi>Philip</hi> ſtood up after I had done, and in part interpreted what I had ſaid, but I did not ſeem to be quite eaſy in my Mind.</p>

            <p>After this I had divers very acceptable Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>London,</hi> during the Time of the Yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and afterwards viſited Friends towards <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and in my Way thither had very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Service in both the Counties of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and at ſundry other Places.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Leeds</hi> I went to the Yearly-meeting at <hi>York,</hi> which was very large, and many public Friends; but I was hid, as it were, and made very little Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at that Meeting.</p>
            <p>From thence I travelled homewards, viſiting Friends as I went, and was gladly received by them. And I found my Miniſtry very acceptable; as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed upon me, I was very humble and low in Mind, knowing therein my Strength conſiſted, and Safety from Temptation.</p>
            <p>I was new in a Strait, what Courſe to take to get a little Money; my Linen and Woolen both wanting to be repaired, I met with a young Man newly ſet up in his Trade, with whom I propoſed to work, and he was ready to comply with my Offer, ſuppoſing it would be a Means to improve him: So we agreed, and I begun with him, and found it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered much better than Harveſt-work, ſo that I ſtored myſelf with a little Caſh ſoon, and worked hard all that Summer, and in the Fall of the Year prepared myſelf for a Journey with my good old Friend <hi>Joſeph Baines.</hi>

We ſet out the latter End of the <hi>Sixth Month,</hi> and viſited ſome Parts of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire, Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and we did very well together; only I was afraid, that Friends took ſo much Notice of me, he would be uneaſy; but he was ſo entirely innocent, and had ſo much of the Lamb in him, that he never did, that I could find, ſhew any Uneaſineſs, more than to give me a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Smile; <hi>Sammy,</hi> ſaid he, (for I was moſtly called ſo) <hi>thou hadſt need take care, Friends admire thee ſo much, thou doſt not grow proud;</hi> and indeed the Caution was very ſeaſonable, as well as ſerviceable to me; which I ſaw and did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This <hi>Joſeph</hi> was (it might be ſaid) an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, as meek as a Lamb, not great in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but very acceptable, eſpecially amongſt other People, having a meek, quiet, eaſy Delivery, moſtly in Scripture Phraſes, with which he was well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, repeating them with very little or no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, which ſome admired very much; and he had great Service at Funerals, being in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Manner qualified for ſuch Services: But he receiving an Account of ſome Troubles in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it brought a very great Uneaſineſs upon him and he returned Home. But I viſited moſt of the Meetings over again, and ſo I returned into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingtonſhire, Northamptonſhire,</hi> and ſo towards <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire,</hi> and <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> viſiting Meetings as I went through Part of <hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> I had many Meetings, ſometimes fourteen in a Week, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to Satisfaction. In almoſt every Pariſh where a Friend lived, we had a Meeting, beſides which
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008308_0033_102E877C6C2D3440"/>
ſundry offered their Houſes, who were not Friends, which we embraced. I came through Part of <hi>Hampſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> and to back again to <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> viſiting Friends, and had many Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Places where none had been, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were much inclined, who were not Friends, to have Meetings at their Houſes in many Places, and would deſire Friends to conduct me to their Houſes: So that although I was entirely unknown to moſt, yet there was very great Willingneſs to receive the Doctrine of Chriſt; and ſundry, I found afterwards, were convinced, by Accounts I received from Friends. The Teachers of the national Way, and Diſſenters alſo, were much diſturbed, and threatned what they would do, and that they would come and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and ſome of them came ſeveral Times, and got out of Sight, where they could hear and not be ſeen; but never any gave me the leaſt Diſturbance all that Journey; but ſome would ſay I was <hi>a Cheat</hi> (viz.) <hi>a Jeſuit</hi> in diſguiſe; others, that I was brought up for the Pulpit, and for ſome Miſdemeanor ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended; and ſo they varied, according to their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations: But I was very eaſy in my Service, and found my Heart very much enlarged; ſome of the People took me to have a good Share of Learning, which, although it was falſe, ſerved for a Defence againſt ſome buſy Fellows, who thought they could diſpute about Religion and Doctrine, which I always endeavoured to avoid as much as poſſible, ſeldom finding any Advantage by ſuch Work, but that it moſtly ended in cavilling, and a Strife of Words.</p>

I went through Part of <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> and at <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> an old Friend was ſick, and expected to get over that Illneſs, and it came into my Mind <hi>he would die of that Sickneſs,</hi> and that <hi>I muſt be at his Funeral, and preach with my B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides this, a young Woman, which afterwards became my Wife, had ſtrong hold of my Affections, and I had acquainted her Parents therewith, and had Liberty from them to lay it before their Daughter, which I did; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the ſame Tune it was upon me to viſit <hi>America</hi> before I entered into the State of Wedlock, which I alſo gave her to underſtand; for I had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in my own Mind, that it might be better to let it reſt until my Return, if I lived; but in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that, thus it appeared, that I might have ſome offers there that might be a Snare to me, and by this prior Engagement I might be freed from all Temptations or Offers of that kind; for if it once was known there, that I was already engaged, even that would command Silence on that Account; ſo on this Conſideration I made my Suit to her, who received it with ſuch Modeſty and Sweetneſs as was very engaging and obliging to me: But ſhe had an Uncle, on whom ſhe had ſome Dependance, who ſeemed much averſe to it, and would have his Niece left at Liberty, that if any Thing offered in my Abſence ſhe might embrace it; Which I very readily complied with; then he was pleaſed, only he
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008308_0035_102E8782F7CD2418"/>
would have me leave it under my Hand, which alſo I was very ready to do; and more, that is, to ſtand bound myſelf, and leave her at Liberty: To which ſhe objected, as <hi>unreaſonable</hi> on her Part to deſire ſuch a Thing from me. So we parted, and I went to <hi>Street, Glaſtonbury, Burnham, Sidcoat, Clareham,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> having let ſlip out of my Memory the old Friend's Sickneſs at <hi>Sherborne;</hi> but I had not been many Hours in <hi>Briſtol</hi> before a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came to deſire <hi>Benjamin Coole</hi> to attend the Funeral, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> came to me to <hi>Brice Webb's,</hi> where I lodged, and told me how it was, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to go; but I pleaded ſundry Excuſes, firſt, my Horſe was not fit, with other Objections, which were all removed. And accordingly I went to <hi>Bruton</hi> next Day, being the <hi>Seventh-day</hi> of the Week, and was at that ſmall Meeting on <hi>Firſt-day.</hi> The Funeral was on <hi>Second-day,</hi> which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding large. <hi>John Beere</hi> from <hi>Weymouth</hi> being there, had ſomething to ſay, but not much: Then, as it was with me, I pulled my Bible out of my Pocket, and opened it; upon which the People gave moſt Attention than they had done before, and I had a very acceptable Time, often in the Courſe of my Matter referring to the Text for Proof, and giving an ample Teſtimony of the Value We put upon the Scriptures, earneſtly preſſing the careful reading of them, and adviſing to conſider what they read, and to ſeek the Lord, by Prayer, for Aſſiſtance and Power, that they might practice what they read, which was the ultimate End of reading, as well as the hearing of Preaching, for
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008308_0036_102E87847B59E8A0"/>
without Practice, it would avail but little; with other Advice to the ſame Effect. And there being ſundry Teachers of ſeveral Societies, one of them a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> took hold of me after Meeting was ended, and deſired ſome Converſation with me: I looked at him earneſtly, and deſired to know if he had any Objection againſt any Part of what I had ſaid? if thou haſt, ſaid I, (ſpeaking with an audible Voice, that ſtopt many of the Company) this is the moſt proper Place, the People being preſent; for they thronged about us very much: This made him confeſs, that what he had heard was ſound, and according to Scripture, being very well proved from the Text; but he deſired ſome private Diſcourſe between ourſelves at my Quarters, if I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it. I told him he might, I quartered at <hi>Richard Fry's;</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> being preſent, told him he ſhould be welcome to come to his Houſe, and ſo we parted: And when I came to <hi>Richard's,</hi> he ſaid, we ſhould hear no more of him, for that he had in his Diſcourſes amongſt his Hearers, ſpoken many very unhandſome Things againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> endeavouring to unchriſtian them, and prove them <hi>Heathens</hi> in denying the Ordinances: (A common Plea uſed by all our Adverſaries) But this Upſtart carried the Matter farther than ſome others did, by adding, that we denied the Scriptures, and alſo would not allow of a Bible in any of our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor did our Preachers ever uſe a Bible to prove any thing there from, that we preached to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; (with more to the ſame Purport) and as many of his Hearers were there, my appearing with a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008308_0037_102E878726E181A8"/>
Bible, and ſo often referring to the Text for Proof, did no doubt put him and them alſo upon a Thought, what had been preached before by him, amongſt them, concerning the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which now appeared to be a manifeſt Untruth by what they had both ſeen and heard that Day: However, to be ſhort, as <hi>Richard Fry</hi> thought, ſo it proved; for he did not come at all near me, and ſo that went off well, and Truth was exalted above Lies and Falſhood.</p>
            <p>I returned back to <hi>Briſtol</hi> well contented, being filled with Peace and Conſolation. At my return I gave my Friends <hi>Benjamin Cook,</hi> and ſome others, a Relation of my Conduct, and <hi>Benjamin</hi> was much pleaſed I went there, and repealed what he had ſaid before to perſwade me to go, adding, he was pretty much aſſured it was my Place to go; but that if he had known how it came into my Mind to preach with the Book in my Hand, although in the Sequel it proved right, yet he ſhould have been afraid that more of Imagination than Revelation was in it; therefore that would rather have backened him, than have been any Argument for him to have preſſed my going ſo much as he did, by reaſon that he had found ſome Miſtakes committed from ſuch Sights, which proved to be but Imaginations: And he gave me very ſuitable Advice, to take care how I too eaſily embraced ſuch Things for Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Trial, and that it was not diſpleaſing to Heaven, <hi>to try the Spirit from whence ſuch Things proceeded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtaid in and about <hi>Briſtol</hi> three Weeks, Viſiting the Meetings round the City, but on <hi>Firſt-days</hi> I
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008308_0038_102E878C36273C48"/>
was moſtly in the City, and it being the Winter Fair, Meetings were very large: But on the <hi>Third-day</hi> Meeting in the Fair Week, there was a Man out of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> a Separate, named <hi>Arthur Iſmead,</hi> who ſtood up to preach, and was ſpeaking of the Light: He put forth a Queſtion about <hi>bringing our Deeds to the Light;</hi> adding, <hi>do I bring my Deeds to the Light?</hi> A worthy Elder, named <hi>Charles Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> anſwered, <hi>No, thou deſt not: If thou didſt, thou wouldſt not do as thou doſt.</hi> I ſat all this Time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very great Concern, and the Word was in me like Fire; ſo I ſtood up, and with a ſtrong and powerful Voice began to preach, he crying out, <hi>that he had not done;</hi> but I took no Account of that, but went on, and he ſoon ſat down and fell aſleep, and we had a bleſſed edifying Meeting that Day, and Truth was exalted above Error. After this Meeting I was clear of the City, and viſited ſome Parts of <hi>Gloceſterſhire, Worceſterſhire, Darbyſhire, Cheſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> but nothing happened wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any great note, ſave only, in many Places I had very large open quiet Meetings, and when I found myſelf very high and full, I then expected low Times again, for I but very ſeldom was drawn forth in Doctrine, and enlarged more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but <hi>Maplebeck</hi> would come in my Way, and the uncommon Temptation and Trial I underwent after that Meeting, which did not arrive to its Height until I came to <hi>Swannington</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> as is before hinted. I reached Home about the latter End of the <hi>Firſt Month,</hi> and ſtaid with my dear Friend <hi>Robert Chambers</hi> Part of that Summer, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him and his Brother-in-Law <hi>John Moore</hi> at <hi>Gale,</hi> mowing more Days this Year than I ever did in one before. But <hi>John Bowſtead</hi> and <hi>Peter Fearon</hi> had a Meeting appointed for them at a Place called <hi>Gooſe-green,</hi> between <hi>Kendal</hi> and <hi>Millthrop,</hi> to which Meeting there was a very great Reſort; and being deſired to attend it, I did, and in the Beginning of the Meeting I ſpoke ſomething of the <hi>univerſal Love of God to Mankind.</hi> After which a Friend went on with the ſame Subject, and inferred from the Text ſomething more than it would bear, ſo that a young Man who taught School at <hi>Beatham,</hi> (a ſmall Pariſh in that Neighbourhood) took him up after the Meeting was over, and having the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Argument, did endeavour to bear the Friend down. I was with ſome others gone to ſee the Horſes got ready for our Return, but being called, got with Difficulty into the Houſe, which was much crowded, (the Meeting being held in the open Ground without the Houſe) and when got in and heard them, I ſoon found where the Pinch was; the Friend had ſaid what the Text would not bear him out in, in quoting <hi>Obadiah</hi> the 10th Verſe, compared with <hi>Romans</hi> the 9th Chapter and 11th Verſe: I obſerved that he went too far in Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when I heard it, and repeating the Words more than twice, the young Man had them very plain. I waited ſome Time, and then deſired Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the young Man to aſk him a Queſtion, the anſwering of which might bring the Argument to a Point; adding, not that I thought myſelf ſo capable to maintain that Argument as my Friend wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Here the young Man, and my Friend <hi>Jopſon,</hi> ſearched both the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> agreeing that it was more proper to render it <hi>into the Name,</hi> than <hi>in the Name,</hi> &amp;c. Then, if that was right, as it was my Opinion it was, it was plain to me, that the Materials of that Baptiſm could not be <hi>elementary Water,</hi> therefore I could ſee nothing in this Text to prove the Practice of <hi>ſprinkling</hi> Infants, or <hi>Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> Here I war interrupted with great Warmth again: The Parſon urging, that <hi>the Diſciples, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Miniſters, and Apoſtles, all had a Commiſſion in</hi> Matthew xxviii. <hi>which by Succeſſion was to continue to the End of the World; and this Baptiſm was with</hi> Water, <hi>for the Apoſtles could not baptize with the</hi> Holy Ghoſt.

At this the Parſon ſtood up in a Paſſion, told us we were <hi>no</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>nor fit to be converſed with as ſuch,</hi> and left us in a Rage without any Ceremony.</p>
            <p>Now the young Man acknowledged, that the Miniſter (as he ſtiled him) was not able to defend his own Practice from Scripture, and deſired that we would lend him ſome Books treating on that Subject, and others, in which we differed from them and other Diſſenters in Point of Religion.

               <p>I Had for my Companion in this Journey, a young Man who had a fine Gift, his Name was <hi>Iſaac Thompſon:</hi> We viſited ſundry Meetings in our Way to <hi>Carliſle,</hi> finding our Underſtandings much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in the Openings of divine Truths, and our Service grew upon us, and we went on with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and chearful Minds, meeting in our Way with our dear and worthy Friend <hi>James Dickenſon.</hi> who was intending a Viſit into <hi>Ireland:</hi> And in our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Border to <hi>Dumfries,</hi> we had very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Converſation of good Service to us both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we, by reaſon of Youth, and want of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, were often very weak, and doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were right or not in the Work; ſo that this our dear Friend, by his tender and fatherly Care over us, and Advice to us, was of great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, in letting us know how weak and poor he often found himſelf; which ſo much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my Condition, that it was as Marrow to my Bones. When we came to <hi>Dumfries,</hi> after we had taken ſome Refreſhment at our Inn, <hi>James</hi> ſaid to us, <hi>Lads, I find a Concern to go into the Street, will you go with me?</hi> For he thought it might only be to ſhew himſelf, and was deſirous that we might go all together, being five in Number: ſo we walked forth, and the Inhabitants gazed upon us, for the <hi>Quakers</hi> were ſeldom ſeen in that Town ſo many

When he was clear, we retired back to our Inn, and divers followed us, who were very rude and wicked, but were not permitted to hurt us. We had ſweet Comfort and Refreſhment one in another at our Quarters. Next Morning we took Leave, and parted, he went for <hi>Port-patrick,</hi> and we viſited the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though very ſmall, until we came to <hi>Hamilton,</hi> where we were finely refreſhed with a ſmall Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulof living Friends; and ſo to <hi>Gloſgow,</hi> where the People were rude, but ſomething better than in Times paſt, not being ſo uncivil to us in the Streets; thence to <hi>Kinneel, Lithgew,</hi> and ſo over the Water on our Journey Northward, taking <hi>Boroughſtowneſs</hi> and <hi>Ury</hi> in our Way to <hi>Aberdeen</hi> Quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where we found Friend; in a ſweet Frame of Spirit, being in dear Unity one with another. We had ſundry Meetings with them to our good Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and had ſome other Meetings farther North, as at <hi>Inverary, Killmuke, Aworthies,</hi> &amp;c. Then back to <hi>Ury</hi> by <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> taking our Journey to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> viſiting the ſmall Meetings, and ſome other Places we inclined to viſit in our Way thither; we had but one little Meeting there, and then went for <hi>Kelſo,</hi> where we ſtaid with them two Meeting on the Firſt-day of the Week, and in the Evening Friends there laid before us the Deſire they had for our going to <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> a Town about ſeven Miles from them, and not much out of our Way to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> We conſidered the Matter, but not the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe

               <p>The chief Street was very broad, with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aſcent, and near the Head of the Aſcent was a Place made to cry Things on, to which we then walked, where we pauſed a little, but I had nothing to do there at that Time; returning back to the Market-croſs, which was at the Foot of the Hill, for that had an Aſcent of three or four Steps, and a Place to ſit on at the Top, where we ſat down; but we had not ſat long before a Man came to us with a Bunch of large Keys in his Hand, and took me by the Hand and ſaid, I muſt go into the <hi>Tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus we argued the Matter, he endeavouring to pull me up, and I to keep my Place, and when he found I was not eaſily moved, he turned to my Companion, who likewiſe was unwilling to be confined, and

then he went to <hi>Samuel Robinſon,</hi> our Guide, who was eaſily prevailed on to go; and the eaſier, for that he had been there but the Week before with two Friends, <hi>viz. John Thomſon</hi> and <hi>Thomas Brath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite,</hi> both of our County of <hi>Weſtmoreland.</hi> By this Time we had a large Aſſembly, and <hi>Samuel Robin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſuppoſing we ſhould have a better Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to preach to them in the Priſon, as the Friends afore-named had the Week before, we were conducted there, juſt by the Croſs where we held the Parly, and put in at the Door: But <hi>Samuel Robinſon</hi> ſoon ſaw his Miſtake, for the Week before the Windows of the Priſon were all open, nothing but the Iron Gates in the Way, the Windows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very large for the ſake of Air, but now all made dark, and were ſtrongly faſten'd up with Deals. We had been but a ſhort Time there, before a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger came to offer us Liberty, on Condition we would depart the Town without preaching; but we could make no ſuch Agreement with them, and ſo we told the Meſſenger.

               <p>By this Time the Day was much ſpent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding to ſtay that Night, we ordered ſome Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be got for us, for I found myſelf in want of it: It was ſoon got ready, and we invited our Hoſt to ſhare with us, who willingly did, the ſhewing his good liking to what had been ſaid; adding, he never ſaw the People ſo ſtruck, and give ſo good Attention; nor ever did he ſee ſo large a Multitude that heard all ſo intelligibly down to the very Foot of the Hill, which was, as he ſuppoſed, not much leſs than Two Hundred Yards in length, and I took, by Computation, the Street to be upwards of Thirty Yards wide, and all that Space much crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I gave him a Hint of his Fear, putting him in Mind that our Duty, in preaching to that Multitude, could not poſſibly be diſcharged by preaching to him and his Family, and he acknowledged it was right in us to do as we did.</p>
               <p>By this Time the Evening cloſed in, and ſundry Gentlemen ſent Word that they would gladly pay us a Viſit, if we would permit it, and the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, I ſaw, earneſtly deſired that we would, and

he had a very large Room, into which we went, and they ſoon came to us, and quickly fell into Converſation (for they are very full of Talk about Religion, and very tenacious in their Opinions upon it.) The firſt Article of Diſpute was, about <hi>the Rule of Faith and Practice;</hi> and this was argued (<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>) between them and our Guide <hi>Samuel Robinſon,</hi> near Half an Hour, who was a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible religious young Man, and had a good Share of Learning alſo; but I found they made nothing of it. Our Opponents would endeavour, in their Way, to make out the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be the only Rule of Faith, and that the <hi>Spirit</hi> we profeſſed to be guided by, muſt be <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to the Text. I hitherto had ſaid nothing, but now deſiring a few Words by way of Queſtion, the anſwering of which might bring this Diſpute to a Point; <hi>I thought not,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>that I ſhould take the Argument from my Friend</hi> Robinſon, <hi>whom I take to be more capable to ſupport it than I am.</hi> All were very willing to hear me; then I began to ſtate the Difference between us, thus: <hi>We all agree,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>that the</hi> Scriptures <hi>is a Rule of Faith and Practice: Do we not?</hi> this was granted. <hi>The Difference lies here then, if I take it right, we ſay it's</hi> a Rule; <hi>you ſay, it's the</hi> only Rule; <hi>this is the Point in Diſpute, is it not?</hi> this was likewiſe granted me. Then I proceeded thus: <hi>Allowing what you ſay to be true, it muſt be conſidered, that all inſtrumental Rules are made, whether they relate to ſpiritual or temporal Affairs, and muſt be contrived and adapted to anſwer the End for which they are made.</hi> This was allowed alſo. <hi>And as the Text is</hi> a Rule
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:008308_0057_102E87BD750D67D8"/>
                  <hi>made, contrived and adapted for ſpiritual Affairs,</hi> who made it ſo? <hi>ſince the Text could not make itſelf.</hi> Here was a long Pauſe; at laſt one replied, <hi>Holy Men writ as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Here was a Pauſe again; <hi>And,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>is this your Mind?</hi> It's the plain Words of the Text, ſaid another: <hi>Granting this; then it muſt by your Acceſſion be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the</hi> Spirit <hi>gave forth or made the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the</hi> Medium <hi>of holy Men; therefore the</hi> Spirit <hi>gave forth the Text: Now judge you, whether a Rule made, or the Author that made that Rule, be</hi> ſubordinate? There was a Pauſe for a little while, and one of the Company ſaid, <hi>You are dung, you are dung,</hi> (meaning they had loſt the Victory) <hi>the Scriptures muſt be</hi> ſubordinate <hi>to the</hi> Spirit <hi>that gave them forth.</hi> I replied thus, <hi>We believe concerning the Text, that it is</hi> a Rule, <hi>and the beſt external Rule we have; but that the</hi> Spirit, <hi>which gave it us by the</hi> Medium <hi>of holy Men, is the</hi> principal Rule <hi>of Faith and Practice.</hi> Thus this Debate ended, and they ſtarted another about <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but that was ſoon ended. Our Friend <hi>Robinſon</hi> was an over Match for them by far, about it. Then they had a few Words about the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine:</hi> That held but little Time, for they allowed theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to be <hi>external</hi> Parts of Religion. Then they came to <hi>Preaching,</hi> and ſtated the Queſtion thus; <hi>Our own Teachers, we know how they come by their Miniſtry, and by what Authority they preach:</hi> (Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Learning, and the laying on of the Hands, as they term it, of the Preſbytery at their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>But we want to know, how your Preachers</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:008308_0058_102E87C285673978"/>
                  <hi>come by their Miniſtry? And by what Authority they preach?</hi> Here, our Friend reaſoned with them ſome Time, but they either could not, or would not be convinced with his Words; ſo he told the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany plainly, <hi>that he never did preach, and therefore would have it to them that did, to give Account how they came by it themſelves.</hi> I was, all the Time that they banded this Affair, under a great Concern, fearing how we might come off; but when <hi>Samuel Robinſon</hi> had laid the Matter ſo juſtly and fairly at our Door, there was ſo conſiderable a Space of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that they expected nothing from us, but began other Diſcourſe, until I could no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; and beſpeaking their Silence and Attention, was willing to relate to them, <hi>how I came by my Miniſtry;</hi> at which, they all liſtened with cloſe Attention. Then I premiſed thus, as an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction before I came to the Matter itſelf, <hi>Although in the Thread of my Diſcourſe, ſomething might appear liable to an Objection, I entreated the Favour of them all to hear me out, by reaſon what might ſay after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would perhaps ſolve their Objections, without giving me or themſelves any Interruption.</hi> Which, with one Voice, they aſſented to, that it was a reaſonable and juſt Requeſt. Then I proceeded as follows,</p>

had near three Years of my Time to ſerve, which I did with great Faithfulneſs to my Maſter; and before the Time was expired, preaching a little at Times, but not very frequently, yet to the great Satisfaction of my Brethren, I found a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon me to travel abroad as <hi>a Miniſter;</hi> and I acquainted my Maſter therewith, who had been as a Father to me: He told me, Before I went on that Errand I muſt acquaint the Elders therewith, and lay it before the Monthly-meeting,</q> (enlarging on the peculiar End of thoſe Meetings, ſetting forth the Service thereof, to take Care of our Poor, and to deal with Offenders who were a Scandal by their ill Conduct to their Profeſſion, and ſundry other Matters cogniſable in thoſe Meetings) <q>that they might judge, <hi>whether my Concern was right,</hi> and give me a Letter of Recommendation or Certificate, to ſignify their Unity and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein: Which I did accordingly, and with ſome very ſuitable Advice to my then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Infant State as a Miniſter, they gave me a Certificate or a Letter of Recommendation, and ſigned it in the Meeting, as is uſual in ſuch Caſes: I accompliſhed that Journey, and was, at my Return, called upon to give Account thereof, and to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Here my Companion was full of Matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, by giving them an Account how he came by his Miniſtry, but let in a Fear, that what he might add, would hurt the Cauſe.

               <p>The Night (by the Time this was over) being far ſpent, it being ſome Time paſt the Middle, a Reckoning was called, and they would not allow us to pay any Part thereof, but took Leave of us with great Affection; and the Country Gentleman, that was aſſiſting to our Liberty, gave us a very kind Invitation to his Houſe, which we received very thankfully; but being engaged in our Minds for <hi>England,</hi> had not Freedom to go with him: So we parted in a very loving and friendly Manner. We being now left to ourſelves, I had an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to reflect on what had paſſed, and to examine my whole Conduct all that Day; a Practice I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed, after a more than common Day's Service, and indeed after every Opportunity of an Enlargement in my Gift, by Experience finding the beſt Inſtructor in my own Boſom, to ſhew where I hit the Matter or miſſed it: And conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why I began <hi>ſo low as my Father,</hi> ſetting forth my Manner of Education and Trade, which ſeemed to have no Relation to my Call to the Miniſtry, I ſaw the Reaſon thereof, and found it to be this, that they might not think my Miniſtry to have, in the leaſt, any Dependance upon <hi>Literature;</hi> a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification much depended on for the Work of the Miniſtry amongſt them, and ſome of them will not

Thus the Wiſdom of Truth, which I did not ſee ſo plainly at firſt, appeared to my Underſtanding very clearly: And on a cloſe and narrow Inſpection into this Day's Work, I found inward Peace, a Joy ſpring in my Heart that I could not ſet forth by Words. And my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had more Eaſe and true Content than I feared he could have, by reaſon of his not coming up in his Service, to let the Company know how he came by his Miniſtry, and by what Authority he preached.</p>
               <p>I have been more particular in the Relation of this Day's Work than I otherwiſe ſhould have been, as containing in it ſuch ſignal Marks of Providence; <hi>firſt,</hi> That we ſhould be detained in <hi>Hold,</hi> juſt till the People from the Country were come in. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> and then ſet at Liberty to ſay what the Lord gave us.

The next Morning we ſet out for <hi>England,</hi> and by the Evening got amongſt Friends in the <hi>Border,</hi> within the Compaſs of <hi>Sowport</hi> Meeting, and had ſome few Meetings, as at the <hi>Border, Scotby, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle,</hi> and ſome others. I came to my old Maſter <hi>Samuel Parrot</hi>'s, having no Place to retire to as a Home, but ſometimes I was at <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quartered with my Friend <hi>Robert Chambers,</hi> and ſometimes at <hi>Kendal,</hi> and at <hi>Gateſide,</hi> at honeſt <hi>William Simpſon</hi>'s, where I did ſometimes help them in their Buſineſs, he being a <hi>Blackſmith.</hi> But I was now preparing myſelf for a Journey into <hi>America,</hi> and was near ready: And I had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to take my Leave of the Neighbouring Meetings, as <hi>Dent, Garſdale, Sedburg, Grayrigg, Kendal, Preſton,</hi> with divers other Neighbouring Meetings thereabouts; but that at <hi>Preſton</hi> was the moſt memorable and ſolid, the Senſe whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with me all over <hi>America,</hi> at Times; I went thence to <hi>Yelland,</hi> and many Friends came to that Meeting from divers Places to take Leave of me, ſo that it was a very large and living Meeting; and I parted with my Brethren in great Love and Unity. I then came by <hi>Wray, Bentham, Settle</hi> and <hi>Airton,</hi> that great and good Man <hi>William Ellis</hi> being then living, and full of Power, having great and ſolid Experience concerning the Work of the Miniſtry, who was very edifying to me, by the wholſome Counſel he gave. <hi>James Wilſon</hi> was then with me, who was not at that Time a public Miniſter, yet of great Service in viſiting Families, being cloſely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Spirit for the maintaining good Order and

Diſcipline; and we being both very young in thoſe Things, this worthy Friend gave ſuch Advice to us both, with reſpect to a faithful coming up in our Services, that we could with good Reaſon ſay, that his Words <hi>were like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver;</hi> for a long Time after, the Senſe and Virtue of them dwelt on my Mind, to my great Advantage. We ſtayed with him one Night, and had a ſmall Meeting, in which the Preference and Value I had for him, together with an Awe that was on my Spirit concerning his great Services and Experience as a Miniſter, took ſuch Place in my Mind, that I was ſilent before him.</p>
               <p>Next Day we took our Leave, and he brought us on our Way a little, heartily praying at parting, that <hi>I might be preſerved in my Place, and return with Safety.</hi>

               <p>Having done this, I went by the Way of <hi>Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> and <hi>Hertford,</hi> viſiting ſundry Meetings, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Encouragement to go on: But I ſtill expected that I ſhould be ſtopt by the Morning-meeting, for want of a Companion. I came to <hi>London</hi> the latter End of the <hi>Tenth Month,</hi> 1701, being by Letters adviſed, the Ships would ſail in a Week's Time,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:008308_0068_102E87DB68A87A50"/>
or very ſhortly; but a War breaking out between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> an Embargo was laid on all Shipping for two Months, ſo that there was no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of getting off. I ſtaid in <hi>London</hi> about three Weeks, viſiting all the Meetings in and about the City, which gave the Brethren a thorough Taſte of my Service; ſome of my beſt Friends adviſing, that I ſhould not lay my Concern before the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I deſigned for <hi>America,</hi> until the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Monthly-meeting of Miniſters did come round, and in that Time my Service as a Miniſter would be generally known. I readily complied; and when the Time came, I went in great Fear to lay my Concern before that Meeting, being ſtill apprehenſive I ſhould not be permitted to proceed, for want of a ſuitable Companion; but as no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection did ariſe, they peruſed the Certificates that I had from the Monthly and Quarterly-Meetings, and did well approve thereof; and a Minute was made, appointing ſome Friends to prepare a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate againſt the next Meeting; which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done, brought there, and ſigned.</p>
               <p>All Things now being clear for my going the firſt Opportunity, it was thought proper to ſee for a Ship, which by the Aſſiſtance of ſome Friends was done, but no likelihood of going quickly, by reaſon of the Embargo.</p>
               <p>I had ſome Deſire to viſit the <hi>Weſt,</hi> in particular <hi>Dorſet, Somerſet, Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>Wilts,</hi> but at a Loſs for a Horſe, having ſold my own ſoon after I came to <hi>London;</hi> but the Friend to whom I ſold him, offered that I ſhould have him that Journey, which
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:008308_0069_102E87DF41271EC8"/>
I accepted, and ſo ſet out, having in Company a young Man that had been bred at a College, his Name was <hi>Samuel Criſp,</hi> a pretty meek ſpirited Youth, and rightly convinced. When we got forty or fifty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> he had ſtrong Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to go back. I made a kind of a running Viſit; and when I was at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> my Friends there were exceeding kind, and would willingly have had me gone from thence; but my prior Engagement at <hi>London</hi> would not permit it.</p>
               <p>I ſtaid there two Weeks at leaſt, and taking my Leave, ſundry Friends brought me on my Way to <hi>Bath, Bradford,</hi> &amp;c. They returned, and I went on for <hi>London,</hi> and quartering at an Inn at <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> (not being eaſy to take any more Meetings till I came to <hi>London</hi>) I fell in Company with a couple of Tradeſmen, who, when we ſat down to Supper, complimented each other about which ſhould <hi>crave a Bleſſing,</hi> at laſt they pulled off their Hats, and one of them did it in ſome ſort; but my ſitting with my Hat on was ſuch an Offence, that they began to reprove me very ſharply: I ſaid but very little for ſome Time, until they had ſpent their Reproach upon me, and then I ſpoke to this Effect, <q>That the Appearance they made, juſt before Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was brought to the Table, was ſo very void of Grace in their Hearts, that I could not think it my Place to pull oft my Hat to their formal Prayer: And beſides, as ſoon as the Words were out of their Mouths and over, it appeared to me that they were the ſame, and I ſaw by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that they did not underſtand the Nature of

                     <hi>true Prayer,</hi> which is to be performed both with the Spirit and Underſtanding; and if you had not wanted both, you could not paſs ſuch ſilly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments on each other about it.</q> I was now very quiet, and they ſaid no more to me. But as ſoon as Supper was over, and the Reckoning paid, they left me with free Conſent, for our Company was unſuitable.</p>
               <p>Next Day I went towards <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Newbury,</hi> where I ſtopt at a Funeral, and ſo to <hi>Reading,</hi> and by <hi>Maidenhead</hi> to the City, but found the Embargo not yet taken off. It being now pretty near the Middle of the <hi>Firſt Month,</hi> I viſited ſome Parts of <hi>Hertfordſhire,</hi> having my dear Friend <hi>John Tomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> part of the Time, and <hi>Samuel Criſp,</hi> who was a ſweet Companion, having received the Knowledge of the Truth the right Way.</p>
               <p>About a Week or two in the <hi>Second Month,</hi> Orders were given for the Merchants to get ready, and a Convoy was to go with them: But for all this, it was the latter End of the <hi>Third Month</hi> before we got off; ſo I had an Opportunity to viſit the greateſt Part of <hi>Kent.</hi> And after we ſailed from the <hi>Downs,</hi> we were put into <hi>Portſmouth</hi> Harbour by contrary Winds, and lay there two or three Weeks, which was very tireſome. But all this Time I never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered any Danger of being taken by the <hi>French;</hi> it did not ſo much as enter into my Mind, until I came into <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where hearing that <hi>Thomas Story, Richard Groves,</hi> and others, were taken ſome Time before, and carried into <hi>Martinico,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Iſland, I thought of it more cloſely.</p>

I left <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Third Month,</hi> 1702, about the Time of the Yearly-meeting, with inward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Peace of Mind, and wrote a few Lines to be ſent to the Meeting of Miniſters in <hi>Kendal</hi> or elſewhere, in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> my native Place; which I here inſert, being the firſt Fruits of that kind to my Brethren.</p>

                     <p>IN that Love which in Time paſt we have enjoyed together, do I heartily ſalute you, having in mind ſome few Things to impart, as Counſel and Caution to us all, including myſelf therein.</p>
                     <p>We who apprehend ourſelves called into this public Station of Preaching, ought cloſely to wait on our Guide, to put us forth in the Work. And <hi>dear Friends,</hi> I ſee great Need for us to carefully mind our Openings, and go on as we are led by the Spirit; for if we over-run our Guide and Openings, we ſhall be confuſed, not knowing where, or how to conclude: But if we begin and go on with the Spirit, we ſhall conclude ſo, that all who are truly ſpiritual will ſenſibly feel that we are right: Thus will our Miniſtry edify them that hear it.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>dear Friends,</hi> let us be ſingly and in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity devoted to the Will of God, whether to preach or be ſilent; for if we are not ſenſible of

ſuch a Reſignation, it is doubtful, that we may ſet ourſelves at work, when we ſhould be quiet, and ſo bring an Uneaſineſs upon our Friends, and a Burthen upon ourſelves: And this Conduct will ſhut up Friends Hearts againſt our Service and Miniſtry. And <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> every Time you appear in the Miniſtry, when it is over, examine yourſelves narrowly, whether you have kept in your Places, and to your Guide; and conſider, whether you have not uſed ſuperfluous Words, that render the Matter diſagreeable, or ſuch Tones or Geſtures as miſbecome the Work we are about, always remembring, that the <hi>true Miniſters preach not</hi> themſelves, <hi>but Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Let us bear this in mind, that neither Arts, Parts, Strength of Memory, nor former Experiences will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sanctification of the Spirit, do any Thing for us to depend upon. Let us therefore, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, keep to the living Fountain, the Spring of eternal Life, opened by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in our Hearts.</p>
                     <p>I alſo deſire, that you would not neglect your Day's Work, in viſiting the dark Corners of the Counties about you; but be mindful of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice therein, as the Lord ſhall make Way for it.</p>
                     <p>The Things above written have been on my Mind to communicate to you, <hi>my dear Friends,</hi> with Deſires that the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be with your Spirits, <hi>Amen.</hi> Hoping alſo, that I ſhall not be forgotten by you, in your neareſt Approaches to the Throne of Grace, in your Supplications to the God of the

rail and abuſe the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but he, being in the Commiſſion of the Peace, muſt (as <hi>Keith</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>) ſhew ſome Reſpect; withal adding, that <hi>John Faulkner</hi> ſhould bring me to his Houſe to dine the next Day: which <hi>John Faulkner</hi> would have excuſed, urging, that as they had a Value for me, ſundry Friends would be for bringing me on my Way farther; adding, we ſhould incommode his Houſe. He urged it the more, ſaying, <hi>we ſhould all be welcome.</hi> Accordingly ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral went with me there, and he was very kind, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us an Account of <hi>George Keith</hi>'s railing againſt us the Day before, and how diſagreeable it was to the Aſſembly. <hi>Keith</hi> left a broad Sheet printed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pretended to prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> no <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> out of their own Books; I had an Anſwer thereto in print, which Friends were glad of, and I left with them ſeveral to ſpread where he had left his.</p>
               <p>After we had dined, we took our Leave, and a Friend, my Guide, went with me, and brought me to a People called <hi>Labadeiſts,</hi> where we were civilly entertained in their Way. When Supper came in, it was placed upon a long Table in a large Room, where, when all Things were ready, came in, at a Call, about twenty Men or upwards, but no Women: We all ſat down, they placing me and my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion near the Head of the Table, and having pauſed a ſhort Space, one pulled off his Hat, but not the reſt till a ſhort Space after, and then one after another they pulled all their Hats off, and in that uncovered Poſture ſat ſilent (uttering no Words that we could hear) near Half a Quarter of an Hour; and as they
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:008308_0077_102E87F61D9424C0"/>
did not uncover at once, ſo neither did they cover themſelves again at once; but as they put on their Hats fell to eating, not regarding thoſe who were ſtill uncovered, ſo that it might be about two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes Time or more, between the firſt and laſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of their Hats. I afterwards queried with my Companion concerning <hi>the Reaſon of their Conduct,</hi> and he gave this for Anſwer, That they held it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to pray till they felt ſome inward Motion for the ſame; and that ſecret Prayer was more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than to utter Words; and that it was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for every one to pray, as moved thereto by the Spirit in their own Minds.</p>
               <p>I likewiſe queried, <hi>if they had no Women amongſt them?</hi> He told me they had, but the Women eat by themſelves, and the Men by themſelves, having all Things in common, reſpecting their houſhold Affairs, ſo that none could claim any more Right than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to any Part of their Stock, whether in Trade or Haſbandry; and if any had a mind to join with them, whether Rich or Poor, they muſt put what they had in the common Stock, and if they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had a Mind to leave the Society, they muſt likewiſe leave what they brought, and go out empty handed.</p>
               <p>They frequently expounded the Scriptures among themſelves, and being a very large Family, in all upwards of a Hundred Men, Women and Children, carried on ſomething of the Manufactory of Linen, and had a very large Plantation of Corn, Tobacco, Flax, and Hemp, together with Cattle of ſeveral Kinds. [But at my laſt going there, theſe People
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:008308_0078_102E87F8D4DEC218"/>
were all ſcattered and gone, and Nothing of them remaining of a religious Community in that Shape.]</p>
               <p>I left this Place and travelled through the Country to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and was there ſeized with a <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Ague,</hi> which held me about thirteen Weeks, and I ſtaid there till the yearly Meeting came on, which was very large, but my Diſorder of the <hi>Ague</hi> would not admit my being at one Meeting; <hi>George Keith</hi> with his Companions came, but the Diſturbance they gave was a conſiderable Advantage to Friends, and the Meeting ended to great Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Being recovered and pretty ſtrong, I left <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> and travelled through the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>After enquiring about her Relations at <hi>Ury</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and her Uncle <hi>Miller,</hi> ſhe then deſired to know my Buſineſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi> pretending to ſuppoſe me a Merchant that dealt in Linen to ſell in <hi>England;</hi> but I ſaw her Deſign was to lead me to ſome unwary An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for <hi>Keith</hi> and the reſt to find Matter of Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to. This put me upon my Guard, to make Reply cautiouſly, I freely owned I had no Concern in buying or ſelling of any ſort of Goods. <hi>Pray then,</hi> Sir, <hi>what was your Call there;</hi> I replied, that I thought it my place ſometimes to adviſe my Friends and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to endeavour ſo to live, that Death, when it comes, might not be a Terror to them; and doubt not but thou wilt count this a good Work, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done. She readily allowed, <hi>that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry needful,</hi> and the more ſo, <hi>for that the Age was now very wicked.</hi> Then ſhe proceeded to query the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my coming into thoſe Parts, pretending to ſuppoſe it was on account of Trade, as being a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percargoe, with ſundry trifling and impertinent Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as <hi>when I was in ſuch and ſuch Places?</hi> To all which I gave her Anſwers to the ſame Effect as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that my deſigned Buſineſs was the ſame in this Country as in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then ſhe proceeded to more trifling Queſtions, as <hi>when I landed? and where?</hi> and <hi>which Way I was going?</hi> All the Company at Table gave ear to our Dialogue, which appeared to me very weak in ſuch a learned Company as they

thought themſelves to be, and none ſo much as put in a Word between us. Dinner being ended, I deſired to be excuſed, for that Time called me away, and my Friends would wait for me at the Ferry, which we had to paſs that Evening. Thus <hi>Keith</hi> and I met and parted.</p>
               <p>Then taking Leave, I went to ſee my worthy Friend in her own Aparment, with whom we had a ſhort, but very agreeable Opportunity: We took our Leave and went to <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> where the next Day we had a Meeting, <hi>George Keith</hi> preached at <hi>Amboy</hi> the ſame Day, which Places are not far apart; we often interfered one with the other, but he no more gave me any Challenge to diſpute, but took another Method to put a Stop to my Travelling, as will appear afterwards. We came to <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and a Meeting was appointed for me at a ſmall Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Hampſtead.</hi> where <hi>George Keith</hi> alſo was, either by Accident or Deſign, and had at the ſame appointed to preach within our hearing, and between the two Appointments, there was a very large Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering; and I being young and ſtrong, my Voice was plainly heard by the People who were with <hi>Keith,</hi> ſo that they all left his Meeting and came to ours, (for we had Room enough for both Meetings, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very large Barn) except he that exerciſed as Clerk, and one <hi>William Bradford,</hi> who had been a <hi>Printer</hi> for Friends at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> but deſerting the Society, Friends took the Buſineſs from him. But ſome Time after, <hi>Keith</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Bradford</hi> agreed, that <hi>Bradford</hi> ſhould come and try if no Advantage might be taken at my Doctrine; accordingly he came,

The Child anſwers, my God-fathers and God-mothers in my Baptiſm, wherein I was made a Member of Chriſt. This is brave to be made a Member of Chriſt! Who would not have a little Water ſprinkled in their Faces? And what did your God-fathers and God-mothers then for your? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> They did Promiſe and Vow three Things in my Name; <hi>1ſt.</hi> That I ſhould renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.

               <p>Thus all Things were ready to be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſundry ſubſtantial People, not Friends, would have had me gone off, but that I could not do; therefore on the <hi>29th</hi> of the ſame Month, as I was at <hi>Fluſhing</hi> in <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> it being the Half-yearly Meeting, which was very large, <hi>Keith</hi> being expected there: When the Meeting was fully ſet, the High-Sheriff came with a very large Company with him, who were all armed; ſome had Guns, others Pitchforks, others Swords, Clubs, Halberts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they ſhould meet with great Oppoſition in taking a poor ſilly harmleſs Sheep out of the Flock.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008308_0088_102E8812D2EFEA68"/>
The Sheriff ſtepping up into the Gallery, took me by the Hand, and told me, <hi>I was his Priſoner.</hi> By what Authority? ſaid I: He pulled out his Warrant, and ſhew'd it me: I told him that Warrant was to take up <hi>Samuel Bowne,</hi> and my Name was not <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Bowne,</hi> but that Friend's Name is ſo; pointing at the Friend by me: We know him, ſaid he, that's not the Man, but you are the Man: Pray then; <hi>What's your Name?</hi> That, ſaid I, is a Queſtion that requires Conſideration, whether proper to anſwer or not, for no Man is bound to anſwer to his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; the Law forces none to accuſe himſelf. Thus we <hi>pro'd</hi> and <hi>con'd</hi> a little Time; and I got up from my Seat, and <hi>John Rodman, Samuel Bowne,</hi> and ſundry other Friends, and walked out of the Meeting, it not being proper to diſcourſe there at that Time; and they on converſing with the Sheriff, who in his Nature was a very moderate Man, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known Friends in <hi>England,</hi> eaſily prevailed on him to ſtay the Meeting, with all his Retinue; and afterwards they would conſider what was beſt to be done. They willingly laid down their Arms on the outſide of the Door, and came in, which encreaſed the Throng very much: The Meeting was ſilent a conſiderable Time, and the Sheriff's Company que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of one another privately, ſo as I heard it, <hi>Why I did not preach?</hi> others concluding that I ſhould preach no more, being now a Priſoner; that's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſilence him, ſaid they: But finding the Word like as a Fire, I could no longer contain, but ſtanding up, I had a very agreeable Service, both to myſelf and Friends, with the reſt of the Company;
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008308_0089_102E8816AFD90DD0"/>
the Sheriff himſelf, and his Company alſo, ſpoke well of it: It was the firſt Day of the Meeting, and the ſeventh of the Week. After Meeting was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſundry Friends went to <hi>Samuel Downe</hi>'s, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with the Sheriff, and he being very moderate, and in a very good Humour, ſpoke very mild and courteouſly, blaming <hi>Keith</hi> and <hi>Bradford,</hi> and gave Liberty that I ſhould ſtay with my Friends until <hi>Fifth-day</hi> following, there being two Days of the Meeting yet to come, and a Funeral of a noted Friend to be the Day after it ended: The Meeting encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the laſt was both largeſt and moſt open; it was ſuppoſed there might be near 2000 People the laſt Day, but <hi>Keith</hi> did not come there.</p>

               <p>There were four Juſtices, <hi>viz. Joſeph Smith, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burrows, John Smith</hi> and <hi>Jonathan Whitehead.</hi> This laſt was a very moderate Man, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to have ſet me at Liberty; but they had a Prieſt with them, who endeavoured to put the worſt Conſtruction on every Thing I ſaid: Beſides, they had ſhut a Man up behind in a Cloſet, to take in Short-hand the Examination, that they might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe the ſame to their own Advantage: But the Man

was ſo very drunk, that he loſt his Papers going Home, and a Friend providentially found them, to their great Diſappointment and Shame: Great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made about them among the People in vain. Having done what they thought fit in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining me, they turned me and my Friends out of the Room, to conſult what was to be further done; and alter a little Time, we were all called in, I to receive my Doom, and my Friends to hear it; and the Clerk, as Mouth of the Court, ſaid, <hi>Theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Juſtices have agreed, that you muſt enter into a Two Thouſand Pound Bail, Yourſelf in £ 1000. and two of your Friends in £ 500. each, or elſe be committed to the common Goal.</hi> I anſwered, I could enter into no Bond on that Account. Here one of the Juſtices queried, <hi>if the Sum was too large?</hi> I anſwered, that was Nothing to the Matter, if as ſmall a Sum as <hi>Three-halfpence</hi> would do, I ſhould not do it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Matter of ſuch a Nature that I could by no Means comply with. Then the laſt Juſtice offered to be bound for me, in what Sum they required. But not only I, but all my Friends, did oppoſe it with all our Might, giving them, as well as him, the Reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>It growing late the Court broke up, and this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice begged that he might have me to his Houſe, and he would ſee me forth coming on the Morrow; which they readily granted him, and then they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed till Ten o'Clock next Day, giving their Clerk Orders to provide my <hi>Mittimus</hi> by that Time.</p>

               <p>At the ſame Time the Court met, and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made as follows.</p>

               <p>Called over the Grand Jury, conſiſting of twenty two Men, and charged them to retire to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and the Attorney General ſhould ſend them Buſineſs.</p>

               <p>Accordingly the Grand Jury retired, and had a Bill of Indictment ſent them againſt me, but I could never get a Copy of it firſt nor laſt.

                     <hi>Now Mr.</hi> Wiſeman <hi>ſpeaks, but I tell you, you are not ſo ſworn, and I could find in my Heart to lay you by the Heels, and a Fine upon your Brethren.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> replied, he might if he pleaſed, but when it was done, it ſhould be expoſed with as much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition as the Caſe would admit in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall;</hi> for, <hi>adds he,</hi> Juries, neither Grand nor Petty, are to be menaced with Threats of Stocks or Fines, but they are to Act freely, according to the beſt of their Judgments on the Evidence before them.</p>
               <p>Now the Judge finding he had not Children to deal with, altered his Manner of Addreſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to flatter, and requeſted that they would take back both Bills, and reſume their Conſiderations upon them. On this the Jury was in Judgment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, but at laſt they all conſented, and then the Court adjourned till Nine o' Clock the next Day.</p>

               <p>Why? Says <hi>Clement!</hi> becauſe we can't be of the ſame Mind as the Court is: We would have you to know, that we deſire no other but that Juſtice may take place.</p>

                  <hi>chained to the <note n="*" place="bottom">A Man of War was then lying at YORK, ready to ſail Convoy for ENGLAND.</note> Man of War's Deck, like other vile Criminals, with his Crimes and Miſdemeanours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, which are of the higheſt Nature, and moſt dangerous Conſequence, as tending to ſubvert both Church and State.</hi> When an Account of this was brought me, I was under a great Cloud, and the Power of Darkneſs ſo very ſtrong upon me that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Death rather than Life, fearing that if I was ſo ſerved, I ſhould be an Object of Deriſion to all on board; and greatly doubting that I ſhould not be able to bear the Suffering which I muſt undergo in ſuch a Caſe, with that Decency and Honour that was requiſite in ſo good a Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Friends left me alone, and I having loſt all my Faith, which was ſtill worſe than being alone, I thought myſelf the moſt wretched among Men, and ſcarcely able to live under it, At which Time, an honeſt old <note n="‡" place="bottom">NOTE, he did not profeſs with us, but was almoſt we in Principles</note> Man (his Name was <hi>Thomas Hicks,</hi> who had been Chief Juſtice in the Province ſome Years, and well vers'd in the Law) came to viſit me, and on my ſtanding up to ſhew my Reſpects to him, he took me in his Arms, ſaluting me with Tears; thus expreſſing himſelf: <q>Dear <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Lord hath made Uſe of you, as an Inſtrument, to put a Stop to arbitrary Proceedings in our Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which have met with great Encouragement ſince his Lordſhip came here for Governor; (meaning the Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> who oppreſſed the People ſorely.)

Stand been made againſt it as at this Time: And now, they threaten to ſend you to <hi>England</hi> chained to the Man of War's Deck: Fear not, <hi>Samuel, adds he,</hi> they can no more ſend you there than they can ſend me; for the Law both here and in <hi>England</hi> is ſuch, that every Criminal muſt be tried where the Cauſe of Action is; elſe, why in <hi>England</hi> do they remove Criminals from one County to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take their Trials where the Offence was committed? But you may, after the Judgment of the Court is given againſt you, bring your Appeal againſt that Judgment; and you ſecuring the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch Fees as are commonly allowed in the like Caſe, they dare not deny your Appeal. But the Judge frets becauſe he cannot have his End a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you: And beſides, the Governor is diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, he expecting to have made conſiderable Advantage by it; but the Country's Eyes are now opened, and you are not now alone, but it is the Cauſe of every Subject; and they will never be able now to get a Jury to anſwer their End, the Eyes of the Country are ſo clearly opened by your Caſe. Had, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> ſtood as you have done, they had not ſo tamely left their Meeting-houſes to the Church: But that People had never ſo good a Hand at Suffering in the Cauſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as they have had in perſecuting others that differed from them.</q> Here he blamed that People very much, for being ſo compliable to all the Claims of the Governor, although never ſo unreaſonable and againſt Law.</p>

And this honeſt Man, as if he had been ſent by divine Commiſſion, by his Diſcourſe raiſed my droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirits, renewed my Faith, and I was quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man: And as he ſaid, ſo it proved.

               <p>But to return, I could never get a Copy of the <hi>Mittimus</hi> or Indictment againſt me, but the Judge gave the Sheriff Orders to keep me more cloſe. And I was accordingly put up in a ſmall Room made of Logs, which had been proteſted againſt as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful all Priſon two Years before; but that made no Difference: I was lock'd up there, and my Friends denied coming to me. I was now adviſed to <hi>demand my Liberty, as a Right due by Law,</hi> and I did ſo; but it was denied me, without ſhewing any other Reaſon, than that I might thank the Gand-Jury for my then Confinement. It was likewiſe thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to lay the Caſe before the Governor by <hi>Petition,</hi> and demand my Liberty of him alſo; which Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is omitted for Brevity's Sake. But all was in vain, for they were reſolved not to be ſo baffled by the Country, they ſaid, but they would bring me to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And <hi>Keith</hi> printed ſome Sheets, pretending to open the Eyes of the People, ſaying, that <hi>I had reproached the Church, the Ordinances and Government;</hi> aggravating the Caſe to the higheſt. But what he printed with a Deſign to make my Caſe appear the worſe, had quite the contrary Effect upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it being look'd upon as no other than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Envy and Revenge againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, and me in particular.</p>

However, that Court was adjourn'd for ſix Weeks; and finding myſelf more cloſely confined than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and not knowing when or how it would end, I began to be very thoughtful what Method to take, not to be chargeable to my Friends: And as I was full of Thought on my Pillow about the Matter, it came into my Mind to try if I could learn to make Shoes; and applying myſelf to a <hi>Scotch</hi> Churchman in the Neighbourhood, one <hi>Charles Williams,</hi> a good natured Man, I made a Propoſal to buy a Pair of Shoes of him, cut out for me to make up, and to give him the ſame Price as if made, withal deſiring him to let me have Materials and Tools to go on with the Work, requeſting that he would be ſo kind as to ſhew me how to begin and proceed in it: I acquainted him with my Reaſon for ſo doing. He replied, it is very honeſt and honourable in you: But, added he, if one of our Miniſters was in the like State, they would think it too mean for them to take up ſuch a diminutive Practice; though it were for Bread: And your Friends perhaps will not like it. However, he readily fell in with me, that if I could get my Bread with my own Hands, it was moſt agreeable with <hi>Paul</hi>'s Practice; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly next Morning he brought me Leather cut out, with Materials and Tools to Work with, and with his Direction I cloſed one of the Upper-leathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left me, and he put it on the Laſt for me, and by Night I finiſhed that Shoe; which when he came to ſee, he admired it was ſo well done, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me how to mend the Faults in the next, which I finiſhed the next Day: He then ſuppoſed I had done
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:008308_0100_102E8831391D0C48"/>
ſomething at the Trade before, but was miſtaken: And when I would have paid him, he refuſed it, and told me, he would not take any Money of me; ſo I propoſed, that if he would give the Leather, I would give my Work; and ſo by Conſent we gave the Shoes to a poor honeſt Man that did go on Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands for us both. I had then more Work of him, and he was ſo pleaſed with it, that he would allow me half Pay for making it up, and was ſo forward to advance my Wages in a few Weeks, that unleſs I would take full Pay, he chearfully told me, I muſt look out for another Maſter: I as pleaſantly replied, I did not deſire to change: Well then, replied he, I ſell the Shoes you make, for as much as any of the like Sizes made in my Shop.</p>
               <p>I made ſuch Improvement in this Buſineſs that I could in a little Time earn fifteen Shillings per Week, being three Shillings their Money for making a Pair of large Man's Shoes, which was my chief Work. Now their Shilling was about Nine-pence Sterling. This new Trade was of very great Service to me, by both diverting Body and Mind; and finding I now could ſupply my own Wants with my own Hands, it gave me great Eaſe indeed: But ſome Friends were uneaſy that I ſhould do it, as ſuppoſing it would be to their Diſhonour; but others again were glad, and thought it a great Honour to the Cauſe of the Goſpel; and they rejoyced with thankful Hearts that I ſucceeded ſo well.</p>
               <p>Going on thus ſome Weeks, my kind Maſter came one Morning, and did not bring ſo much Work as before. I aſked him the Reaſon? adding pleaſantly,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:008308_0101_102E8832BAEB57F0"/>
What doth my Credit ſink, that I have no more brought? He ſmiling ſaid. It's not beſt to truſt G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He added, you ſhall be a Maſter as well as I. How Can that be? ſaid I. He replied, you ſhall have Leather of your own, and by doing that, you may get Eight-pence, Ten-pence or a Shilling a Pair more profit than you do now. But I told him I had rather Work Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-work for him than do to ſo: For I knew not how to get Leather and other Materials, and when I had it, I was a Stranger to the cutting it out. Trouble not yourſelf about that, ſaid he, for I will do all this for you: And ſo he did with much Chearfulneſs, delighting to ſerve me effectually.</p>
               <p>I went on thus for ſeveral Months, and he came to me every Day once or twice, and was a very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, pleaſant temper'd Man, but too much addicted to take delight in ſome of his Neighbours Company, who too often were diſguiſed with ſtrong Liquor, and he would often ſay, if you were to continue here, I ſhould overcome it, and I verily believe ſhould be a ſober <hi>Quaker.</hi> I told him he muſt leave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he too much frequented; which he not Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I heard afterwards they proved very hurtful to him. We had very often ſerious Converſation about Religion, and it appeared to me, he had been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with an enlightned Underſtanding, and would confeſs, if there was any ſuch Thing as preaching Chriſt truly, it was amongſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for both <hi>Churchmen, Preſbyterians, Independents,</hi> and others,

all preach <hi>themſelves,</hi> and for their own Advantage in this World; ſo that if there was <hi>no Pay,</hi> there would be <hi>no Preaching.</hi> He frequently attended our Meetings for a Time.</p>

The Occaſion of theſe Adjournments was this; Judge <hi>Bridges</hi> was ill, and had been for ſome time declining, but was expected to be able to attend the Service of the Court, and take Vengeance on me and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought ſo fit for that Work as he; yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, but died ſome Months before I was ſet at Liberty.</p>
               <p>I had in this Time of Confinement ſundry Viſits, two of which were more remarkable than the reſt. The firſt was by an <hi>Indian</hi> king, with three of his chief Men with him; and the other by one <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> from <hi>New-London,</hi> and he ſtaid with me from the Time he came about ſix Days.

               <p>I ſhall firſt take Notice of the Conference with the <hi>Indian</hi> King, as he ſtiled himſelf; but his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was much waſted and almoſt extinct, ſo that he had but a ſmall People to rule. However, there was in him ſome Marks of Superiority above the other three who attended him, who ſhew'd ſome Regard to him as their Sovereign.</p>

of my Confinement: An Account of which I gave them as intelligibly as I could, finding they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Engliſh</hi> better than they could ſpeak it. The Conference was moſtly between the King and me, the reſt but very ſeldom put in a Word.</p>
               <p>The King aſked, <hi>if I was a</hi> Chriſtian? I told him I was. <hi>And are they,</hi> ſaid he, Chriſtians <hi>too that keep you here?</hi> I ſaid they profeſſed themſelves to be ſo. Then he and his Company ſhewed their Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that one <hi>Chriſtian</hi> could do thus to another. And then he enquired concerning the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and them. I replied, it conſiſted of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> my Adverſaries hold with ſprinkling a little Water on the Face of art Infant, uſing a Form of Words, and the Ceremony of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sign of a Croſs with their Finger on the Babe's Forehead, Calling this <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and urging it as <hi>eſſential</hi> to future Happineſs: And I with my Brethren, can ſee no Good in this Ceremony. Here they talked one with another again, but I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them not. After which they aſked me, <hi>if I thought there was nothing in this Ceremony of Good to ſecure our future Happineſs?</hi> I ſaid, I ſee Nothing of good in it. <hi>I was right,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>neither do we;</hi> Aſking, <hi>wherein do you further differ from them?</hi> I proceeded, That they held it needful to take at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Times, a Piece of Bread to eat, with a ſmall Quantity of <hi>Wine</hi> to drink after 'tis conſecrated, as they call it, which they pretend to do in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Chriſt our Saviour, urging this as <hi>neceſſary</hi> to our future Happineſs as the former, calling this the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> He told me, that they had ſeen

He aſſented, <hi>that this was good: But who can do it?</hi> ſaid he; <hi>when my Enemies ſeek my Life, how can I do other than uſe my Endeavour to deſtroy them in my own Defence?</hi> My Anſwer was, That unleſs we were under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a better Spirit than our Enemies, we could not do it; but if we are under the Government of the good Spirit, which ſeeks not to deſtroy Mens Lives but to ſave them, and teaches us to do Good for Evil, and to forgive Injuries, then we can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Providence,</hi> putting our Truſt in the great God to ſave us from the Violence and Wrath of our Enemies.

They ſaid, they did not look upon his Power <hi>independent</hi> from the <hi>good Monettay,</hi> but that what he did was by <hi>Permiſſion;</hi> nor indeed did they think he had any Power at all, but what was given or ſuffered for him to exerciſe over <hi>Indians,</hi> to bring about ſome good Deſigns of the <hi>good Monettay</hi> for their Advantage, to reclaim them when they were bad, and diſpleaſed the <hi>good Monettay:</hi> For they believed the <hi>good Monettay</hi> had all Power, yet he employed his Servants or Angels, as we Term them, to execute his Will. And the <hi>Indian</hi> that made the Circle, deſcribed four ſeveral ſmall Circles on the Edge of the great one, and they ſhewed their Opinion how their little Gods were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to chaſtize the <hi>Indians</hi> when bad, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and encourage them in Good: They likewiſe ſuppoſed the four ſmall Circles to anſwer to the four Quarters of the World; that they had Inferiors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them again to execute their Will when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Commiſſion from that <hi>great Mind;</hi> but that all derived their Power from the <hi>ſupreme Eye, Ear,</hi> and <hi>Mind;</hi> demonſtrating their Meaning by Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon thus: As ſuppoſing the <hi>Indians</hi> bad, the good Monettay <hi>ſees it,</hi> and he gives Orders to that in the North, and by him to them under him, whereby we are by hard Froſts, great Snows, and cold Winds in the Winter, very much afflicted with want of Food, and with Cold; and in the Summer, either

Thus they account for all reigning Diſtempers and common Calamities by Sickneſs or Famine; and on the other Side, Health and Plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in like Manner for War and Peace, <hi>viz.</hi> When two Nations are both wicked, they are <hi>ſtirred up</hi> to deſtroy each other, either by the <hi>Devil,</hi> or by ſome of theſe <hi>Monettay</hi>'s by him employed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I then proceeded to query, <hi>what Thoughts they had of a</hi> Future State <hi>after this Life?</hi> Firſt deſiring to have their Opinion. <hi>whether they did not think they had a Part in them that would never die?</hi> Which they readily granted, and gave me their Opinion, what both the State of the good and bad <hi>Indians</hi> would be in the other World; that the <hi>good Indians</hi> would go into the South and South-Weſt, where it was very warm and pleaſant, and Plenty of all Things both for Pleaſure and Profit: As ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they ſhould have the Delight of enjoying the Comforts of eating, drinking, hunting, and all other Pleaſures they enjoyed here, in a more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Way to ſooth and pleaſe their Deſires, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they could in this World. Thus they deſcribed <hi>Heaven,</hi> as beſt ſuited their natural Senſes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to inſtil into their Youth, as they ſaid, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples

of Virtue and Juſtice, that when they die, as to this World, they may be ſit and worthy of this good Country or Heaven, where it always is ſerene and quiet, no Night, nor Winter in this brave plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Country; but all Things are plenty, very good, well and comfortable. But then, the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>bad Indians,</hi> when they die, go into the North and North-Weſt, a Country extream cold, dark and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant; no Sun-ſhine; they endeavour to get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſatisfy their Hunger, but can't, for the <hi>Yeo-Cod</hi> are very poor, and they can't catch them; ſo in this Extremity they deſire to die, but can't; nor can they find any Means to put an End to this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearble and wretched Life, but they muſt continue in Sorrow and Trouble without any Hopes of End. Thus they deſcribed their Thoughts of a future State, either in Heaven or in Hell, according to their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both.</p>
               <p>I then turned my Diſcourſe and aſked them, <hi>what they thought of a good Spirit that was preſent with them in their Mind?</hi> (finding they had no Notion of Chriſt, as to his bodily Appearance) they readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that a <hi>good Spirit</hi> attended them, and did reprove, or make them ſorrowful when they <hi>did badly:</hi> They likewiſe did believe the <hi>bad Monettay,</hi> or Devil, did perſwade them in their Minds <hi>to Evil,</hi> and the more they ſtrove againſt the Devil, and prayed for Stength, by and from the good and <hi>great Monettay,</hi> the more they prevailed ever theſe evil and wicked Temptations of the Devil in their own Minds, which had, they ſaid, no Power to lead them into Evil, but by their <hi>own Conſent,</hi> nor could do

them any Hurt it they did not yield to his alluring and deceitful Temptations. I further enquired, <hi>if all the</hi> Indians <hi>were much of the ſame Mind in theſe Matters?</hi> but they could not reſolve me.</p>
               <p>I alſo enquired, <hi>whether any amongſt them were look'd upon as</hi> Inſtructors <hi>more than others?</hi> They ſaid, no; but the Head of every Family ought to do their beſt Endeavours to inſtruct their Families, but it was neglected; yet they retained the Practice of coming all together once in a Year, and the Elder did adviſe the Younger, what their Parents and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had told them, and thus they tranſmitted the Knowledge of former Things from one Generation to another, by having them repeated in theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>Here our Conference ended: And as I could treat them with ſome Refreſhment, I did, which they thankfully received; and we parted in great Friendſhip and Love, after a Stay of one Night and almoſt two Days.</p>

               <p>He gave me a large Account of the Conference he had with <hi>William Edmundſon,</hi> and told me that Nothing ever gave him ſo much Trouble and cloſe Uneaſineſs, as his oppoſing <hi>William Edmundſon</hi> at that Time did, deſiring me, if I lived to ſee <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam Edmundſon,</hi> to acquaint him with the ſincere Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that he had upon his Mind for that Night's Work.</p>
               <p>At my Return, I acquainted <hi>William Edmundſon</hi> therewith, who deſired me, if I lived to ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, to let him know that it was the Truth <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam Edmundſon,</hi> bore Teſtimony to that he oppoſed, and therefore it was no wonder that he was ſo much troubled for his fooliſh Attempt therein.</p>
               <p>He gave me an Account of his Convincement and Converſion, which was very large, and although at firſt it was agreeable and very entertaining, yet by his ſpinning of it out ſo long, he made it diſagreeable, for he ſtaid with me five or ſix Days, and it was the greateſt Part of his Diſcourſe all that Time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did ſundry Times ſtart other Subjects, which he would ſoon get off, and go on about his own Experiences.</p>

               <p>I queried with him, <hi>why they kept to the Uſe of Bread and Wine, and plunging or dipping into Water, ſince he taught his People to put no Confidence in thoſe Ceremonies, by ſuppoſing any Virtue or Holineſs in them?</hi> He replied, that they did it for the Sake of thoſe who were weak in Faith; adding, that if our Friends had taken thoſe two Sacraments along with them, they would have driven all before them.

This he did readily grant to be a great Truth; and ſo allowing, that the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were acted by <hi>divine Light,</hi> and being faithful to what was made known to them, had their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and their Succeſſors ſat down in that Form their Predeceſſors left them in, but did not regard that Power and Life by which they were acted, and ſo became Zealots for that <hi>Form,</hi> but oppoſed the <hi>Power.</hi> And this, ſaid he, is the true Cauſe of the ſeveral Steps of <hi>Diſſent</hi> one from another; and the Reaſon why there is ſo little <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Love, and ſo much Bitterneſs and Envy one againſt another, is their ſetting down contented, each in their <hi>own Form,</hi> without the <hi>Power,</hi> ſo that they are all in one and the ſame Spirit, acting their Part in the ſeveral Forms of Worſhip in their own Wills and Time, not only oppoſing the Spirit of Truth, but making it the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>

But we ſhall, ſaid I, digreſs too far from what we had in View; Thou alloweſt the aforementioned Friends to be <hi>Servants of Chriſt,</hi> and guided by his Word, and that they advanced the Reformation higher than any had done before them; and 'tis plain they had a Concern to lay aſide <hi>Fighting, Swearing, vain Compliments,</hi> as well as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> theſe <hi>two Sacraments,</hi> as you call them; and as you continue in the Practice of them, it muſt be in your <hi>own Will,</hi> and not in the Will of God, by thy own Confeſſion. <hi>How doſt thou,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>make that but?</hi> Thus, ſaid I; <hi>firſt,</hi> Thou alloweſt thoſe of our Friends to be true Miniſters, and declareſt thy Unity with them as ſuch, and they had a Concern to draw Peoples Minds from depending upon theſe <hi>Shadows</hi> to truſt in the <hi>Subſtance:</hi> Now how could this be ſo effectually done, as by perſwading the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>diſcontinue</hi> the Uſe of thoſe <hi>Shadows?</hi> for whilſt they did uſe them, though at the ſame Time they were told, there was <hi>Nothing in them,</hi> yet weak Minds would ſtill retain ſome Regard, as though they had ſome <hi>

                  <hi>that is indeed.</hi> Adding, we do not act ſo, for we ſay as you do, that <hi>there's Nothing in theſe Ceremonies but a Sign;</hi> it is the Power of an endleſs Life that we perſwade them to ſeek for <hi>in themſelves,</hi> and not to look on theſe as any Advantage in a ſpiritual Senſe at all.

Then I aſked him, if he thought <hi>either</hi> of theſe Ceremonies of more Uſe than the other: <hi>No,</hi> replied he; ſet one aſide, and ſet both, for there is no more Virtue in one than the other. I then queried with him, if ever he had ſeen a ſmall Treatiſe entituled the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſms,</hi> wrote in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Time by one <hi>William Dell?</hi> he never heard of ſuch a Book, he ſaid. I had it by me, and turning to the Preface in the laſt Paragraph, where the Author in a prophetick Way has theſe Words, <q>But becauſe I ſee this preſent Generation ſo rooted and built up in the Doctrine of Men, I have the leſs Hope that <hi>this Truth</hi> will prevail with them; and therefore I appeal to the next Generation, which will be farther removed from theſe Evils, and will be brought nearer to the Word, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to that People whom God hath, and ſhall form <hi>by his Spirit,</hi> for himſelf, for theſe only will be able to make juſt and righteous Judgment in this Matter, ſeeing they have the <hi>Anointing</hi> to be their <hi>Teacher,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> to be their <hi>Light.</hi>

He allowed there was <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſo to think. By this Time it was late, and I deſired him to take the Book, read and conſider it, and let me have his Thoughts the next Day.

And when he came, told me he had read it careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and conſidered it cloſely, confeſſing that it was the Language of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>true Doctrine.</hi> I told him, now I hoped that he was ſatisfied, that it was moſt ſafe for them to lay theſe <hi>Shadows</hi> aſide, and labour to bring their People to the <hi>Subſtance.</hi> He allowed that it might be <hi>proper to do ſo.</hi> But, added he, it muſt be done with great Care and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, leſt ſome ſhould be <hi>hurt</hi> by it. To which I replied, they would be more in Danger to be <hi>hurt</hi> by following theſe <hi>ſhadowy Obſervations,</hi> in which they could have no Benefit, and continuing in them might be a Means to lead them into <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and make them ſit down and take their Reſt in the <hi>Shadows,</hi> and ſeek no farther.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid what we could, both of us dropt it by Conſent; and after ſome ſhort Pauſe (for he could not long be ſilent) we fell on the Subject of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> he aſſerting, that ſaving Light and Grace was only given to the <hi>Elect,</hi> or <hi>true Believers,</hi> and the reſt were <hi>blinded.</hi> I alledged the <hi>contrary:</hi> That an <hi>Offer</hi> of divine Love was made <hi>to all,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> did not make good Uſe of it: So to Argument we went, and I requeſted the Reaſon for his Belief in this Doctrine? deſiring him firſt to explain himſelf, whether he thought that Reprobates were from

their Cradles or Births <hi>ſo fixed,</hi> that no Means or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained could <hi>alter</hi> it? He pauſed ſome Time, and at laſt ſaid, all Things with God are <hi>poſſible;</hi> but from the Doctrine of <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> ix. it plainly appears, <hi>ſays he,</hi> to be ſo, and that God is glorified by both, as in the Caſe of <hi>Pharoah.</hi> I replied, <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Caſe could not properly be adapted to this Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it was in itſelf peculiarly intended for the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as well as the <hi>reſt</hi> of Mankind, that he (GOD) was the only <hi>All Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God,</hi> worthy of Obedience, and that the Life and Power of Kings was in him; and to confirm that weak People the <hi>Jews,</hi> that if they leaned upon <hi>that God</hi> who had done all this before their Eyes, they need not fear the <hi>Wrath of Kings,</hi> though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>numerous Armies;</hi> for God, who had choſen them, could ſoon overthrow their Enemies, and ſave them by a mighty Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from their Rage and Wrath: But how this can be brought to ſupport <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> as now it's underſtood, and preach'd up by ſundry pretended Teachers, <hi>I ſee not:</hi> I therefore deſire that thou wouldſt explain it as thou underſtands it.

Verſe took off much of the Edge of what he had ſaid with reſpect to <hi>Reprobation;</hi> which I read, and he confeſt it did pretty much ſo. I further added, that the Doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> in the Way it is now expounded by thee, is very injurious, in reflecting on the infinite Mercy of God, and point blank <hi>oppoſing</hi> the chief End of the Goſpel, and coming of our Saviour, <hi>who taſted Death for every Man,</hi> and offers Life by his good Spirit and Grace <hi>to all.</hi> Beſides thy Way of expounding the Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, makes him quite contradict himſelf in other Places, where he clearly ſets forth the Love of God by and through Chriſt, to be <hi>univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> offered both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: And laſt of all, as thou haſt explained thyſelf now upon this Doctrine thou <hi>renders</hi> that great Duty of Prayer almoſt <hi>Impertinent,</hi> if not quite <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> with all other <hi>religious Endeavours,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that if thou canſt not make it out otherwiſe than this is, I may, I think, without any Breach of Charity, conclude thee <hi>unſound</hi> in thy Faith and Doctrine of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>died for all Men,</hi> and was by his Apoſtles preach'd the <hi>Saviour of the World</hi> to both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks:</hi> Therefore we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. after another Manner, ſo as to reconcile <hi>Paul</hi> with himſelf, where he plainly ſhews, God <hi>wills all Men</hi> to be ſaved, and to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as in the ſecond of the firſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and abundantly elſewhere, that we have already touched upon: But if thou wilt give me Leave, without Interruption, I will give thee my Thoughts on this Subject, which in ſhort are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

It is beyond all Doubt or Queſtion with me, that God <hi>wills all Men to be ſaved;</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Will, and Offers of Salvation to all, he has ordained the Means to <hi>procure</hi> the End by his own Son, who taſted Death <hi>for every Man,</hi> whereby <hi>all</hi> have it put into their Power, as free Agents, to make Choice for themſelves by applying to the Means ordained by God thro' his Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the <hi>obtaining</hi> that which he has <hi>willed for them, viz.</hi> Salvation! Now, if this is true, as the Scriptures aſſert, and our own Experience confims it to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then it follows, that <hi>all</hi> who are diligent, through the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Faith, endeavouring to make their Calling and Election ſure, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Means ordained of God, (<hi>viz.</hi> that Grace and Truth that is come by Jeſus Chriſt) for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that which he has <hi>willed for them,</hi> as I have ſaid, we may ſafely conclude <hi>all</hi> in this State, to be the Elect of God in Chriſt. But then <hi>all</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, neglect and ſlight, nay, ſuffer me to ſay, <hi>rebel</hi> againſt the inward Convictions of Grace and Truth in their own Minds, (which is the <hi>only</hi> Guide and Rule for doing better) and continue herein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are left and harden'd in their Sins and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, being given up to a Reprobate Mind, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Conſciences ſeared with an hot Iron, are paſt <hi>feeling</hi> of any Remorſe for their ungodly Deeds. Theſe I take to be in a <hi>Reprobate Condition,</hi> and this Reprobation is <hi>of themſelves,</hi> they having <hi>choſen</hi> it; for they had the Offers of the ſame Grace and Truth to aſſiſt them to do better, as the Elect have had, but would not apply themſelves thereto, but did
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:008308_0120_102E88679258EA28"/>
wilfully <hi>reject</hi> it. Now all this thou knoweſt may be fairly proved by the Scriptures, and thou canſt, I think, do no otherwiſe than allow it to be <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> to decide this Point; for 'tis plain, the firſt are the Children of God, made ſo by their <hi>co-working</hi> with the Spirit of Chriſt; and the other are Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and Children of Antichriſt, made ſo by <hi>their Rebellion</hi> againſt the Spirit of Truth and <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Spirit of Error: And here I conclude with the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 22. <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his Wrath, and to make his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or known, endureth with much</hi> long ſuffering <hi>the Veſſels of Wrath,</hi> (by their own Rebellion) <hi>fitted to Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>

               <p>About the Beginning of the <hi>Eighth-Month</hi> 1703, the Sheriff had an Order to call or warn eighteen Men for a Jury, to try their Succeſs a ſecond Time: But whether they went upon the old Indictment or a new one, I could not underſtand, but it was thought by ſome of the laſt Jury, to be the ſame Indictment that the firſt Jury went upon; but I was never admitted to ſee it: The Sheriff had private Inſtructions to get ſuch Men put into the Jury, as they thought would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their End, which he ſhewed me with <hi>Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> aſſuring me, he would never do it; ſo the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was fairly named, and they made no great Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about it, but in a ſhort Time (as their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had done before them) they came in with their Bill,

               <p>This was on the ſecond Day of the <hi>Ninth-Month,</hi> and the Court adjourned to the next Day, at which Time I was had into Court; which I was told, was not regular nor lawful to bring a Man to the Bar that had nothing laid to his Charge by his Peers, the grand Inqueſt; however, I was aſked, <hi>if I had any Thing to offer to the Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> I deſired my Liberty, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Wrong done me in taking it from me <hi>&amp;c:</hi> The Judge told me, <hi>I might have my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, paying my Fees.</hi> I replied, that I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was no Fees due, as the Caſe then was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law; but if there had, I ſhould not pay any, it being to me a Matter of Conſcience. The Judge ſaid, <hi>He believed ſo,</hi> and ſmiled, ſpeaking ſomething to thoſe near him, that was not heard by me: However I was ſet at Liberty <hi>by Proclamation;</hi> and a large Body of my dear Friends, from all Parts of the Iſland, came to ſee me Cleared, and had me away with them in a kind of Triumph, not being a little glad that I came off ſo honourably; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Country People who were not Friends, were there in abundance, and rejoiced exceedingly at my Enlargement.</p>
               <p>I was now at liberty, after having been a Priſoner one Year wanting three Weeks and about two Days; but having not Freedom to go away, I ſtaid ſome Time, viſiting every Corner of the Iſland, and had very large and open Meetings: The People were thoroughly alarmed, ſo that I ſound by Experience,

The next Day we went to the Meeting, and were a little late, by Reaſon the Tide and high Freſh-water obliged us to ride the fartheſt Way, and when we came into Meeting a Friend was preaching on <hi>univerſal Grace;</hi> but in a little Time he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>When we came to <hi>Dover,</hi> we had a pretty large Meeting, but we were both ſilent, at which I was ſomewhat amazed, it being new to me: However, another Meeting was appointed next Day, ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Diſtance from <hi>Dover,</hi> which was much larger: My Companion ſaid ſomething, but very little, and was uneaſy that he ſaid any Thing: I was quite ſhut up, and after Meeting I was exceedingly comforted,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:008308_0125_102E8873CC54A978"/>
being filled with divine Sweetneſs and heavenly Joy, that I was preſerved, and did not force myſelf to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. They appointed another Meeting the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, ſome Diſtance off, at which I found myſelf quite ſhut up, and held back as it were, from ſaying any Thing, and my Companion was alſo ſilent, who after Meeting look'd upon me very innocently, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, SAMUEL, <hi>What doſt think thoſe People will ſay, that we ſhould come ſo far to appoint Meetings amongſt them, and have Nothing to ſay?</hi> It juſt then livingly came into my Mind to reply, <hi>Fear not, have Faith, Nothing doubting but we ſhall have enough to ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we leave them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our next Meeting was to be in the Center of the Meetings which we had before, in a conſiderable large Houſe, but not big enough for the Company by far, and the Country was all alarmed, ſo that it was a very large Meeting indeed; and it being War Time with the <hi>Indians,</hi> the People brought ſuch Weapons as they had to Meeting, ſo that when we came to the Meeting houſe, I was ſurprized to ſee ſo many Fire-Arms, and other Inſtruments of War, ſtanding againſt the Meeting-houſe Wall. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I was before told, that it was the Cuſtom of other People to do ſo; and I found that thoſe Fire-Arms, and warlike Weapons belonged to other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not Friends, that were come to Meeting: A large Meeting it was indeed, and very quiet; we ſat a long Time in Silence, which put me on examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Conduct, and looking back to ſee how it was with me; but finding no Cauſe of Uneaſineſs from any Thing I had done before, to cauſe me to
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:008308_0126_102E887674681F58"/>
be thus ſhut up, I came to this Concluſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, that <hi>I was but a Servant, and could of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf do Nothing;</hi> ſecretly praying that the Lord would give me Patience not to be uneaſy, if he had No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for me to do, and if he had, there I was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to do it: And thus I ſettled down, diligently waiting for divine Direction. And in a little Time a Word came with Life, (and I ſtood up with it) to the Effect following: <q>The Lord's Time is the beſt Time, and let us not grow uneaſy to wait for it; for when he opens none can ſhut, and when he ſhuts none can open.</q> Enlarging on this Subject a little more; and we had a very glorious Meeting, in which I was largely opened in ſundry Branches of the Doctrine of Chriſt; and I had not ſeen very often greater Tenderneſs than was at that Time amongſt the People; for the War with the <hi>Indians</hi> had humbled them to ſuch a degree, that Truth had a very great Reach upon them indeed, and the Meeting ended well.</p>
               <p>Immediately I found an uncommon and weighty Concern to requeſt the Miniſters to come together which they very readily complied with, and they were an handſome Number, but not all thoroughly baptized into the Work. My Companion was very prettily opened, and we had a very ſuitable Service amonſt them, and ſaw clearly the Reaſon why we were ſo ſhut up in Silence; ſome of them were got into an Extream in Preaching and Praying, and would continue Meetings to an unſeaſonable Length, as likewiſe in their Preaching and Praying at Table; which gave great Uneaſineſs to ſome ſenſible Friends
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:008308_0127_102E887BD528FA18"/>
amongſt them, but they could not redreſs it till after this Opportunity. They themſelves ſaw they were wrong in doing as they had done, and got out of this Extream, which was a Degree of <hi>Ranteriſm,</hi> being attended with a Spirit of Oppoſition againſt the Order of Friends in Monthly and Quarterly-Meetings.</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed our Service, we returned back to <hi>Hampton,</hi> and had ſeveral Meetings, and ſo for <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> Yearly-Meeting, which was very large, and to good Satiſfaction.</p>
               <p>From thence I went by Sea to ſeveral Iſlands, as <hi>Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket,</hi> and ſome others; but in <hi>Nantucket</hi> I had great Satisfaction, for the People, not joined with Friends, were moderate <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and came generally to Meetings, their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er alſo with them, who after Meeting raiſed ſome Objections againſt us, that he had from our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Books and that which he pitched upon moſtly was about Prayer, that <hi>we did not pray to God in the Name of Chriſt, but in our own Names.</hi> I told him, we look'd upon it to be our Duty to pray to God in Chriſt's Name, and as his Name is underſtood to be <hi>his Power,</hi> we durſt not preſume to pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but as the Wiſdom and Spirit of Chriſt gave us Utterance. He ſaid, <hi>it was a Goſpel Truth in his primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor ſent for me, and we had a Time to confer about our Principles, and after a little Time he ſeemed much pleaſed with what I had to ſay: And having finiſhed my Service I returned to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and found ſome were contriving to
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:008308_0128_102E887D62417860"/>
have me taken up, by informing the Governor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, as tho' I was a Tranſgreſſor, by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they ſaid, againſt <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper of the Lord,</hi> as they call the Bread and Wine. But the Governor being at the Meeting himſelf where this ſuppoſed Offence was given, quickly ſaw that the Arguments uſed againſt the Preſent Practice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, as well as <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> had ſo much Scripture and Reaſon on their Side, that it was vain to attempt to confute them; he therefore thought it their wiſeſt Way to let it alone.</p>
               <p>After this, I made another Trip to the <hi>Eaſtward,</hi> my dear Companion being returned, and viſited in my Way back to <hi>Dover,</hi> Meetings as they came in courſe; and I viſited all the Meetings, where I had been before, and had ſat in Silence in ſome of them, but I had now large and good Service, and great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction amongſt them, and the more ſo, as they now ſaw it their Places not to preach in every Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to wait for the Conſtraint of the divine Word before they ſpoke.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to <hi>Strawberry-Bank,</hi> a Haven where much Shipping reſorts for Maſts, and when clear of thoſe Parts, returned to <hi>Hampton, Haverill, Exeter,</hi> and ſundry other Towns, where Meetings had not been kept, and amongſt them to <hi>Newbury:</hi> A Man that lived in that Place, being newly convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was very deſirous of a Meeting at his Houſe, which I conſented to; and when the Time came, his Wife, not being pleaſed that we came on the Account of a Meeting, would not permit us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Houſe, but kept the Doors lock'd againſt us,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:008308_0129_102E8880135FBB68"/>
being, as was ſaid, adviſed to it by ſome of their Teachers. I took a Turn round the Houſe, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to have ſome Conference with her at the Window, firſt aſſuring her, that we had no Deſign to put her Huſband to any Manner of Charge, but only to let us have Houſe-room for about two Hours to hold a Meeting; adding, that it did ill become a Wife to keep her Huſband out of his Houſe at ſuch a Time; promiſing her, that if ſhe would let in her Huſband, not one of our People ſhould come in with him. And by reaſoning the Caſe, ſhe, after a little while, opened the Door and would have us to go in, but I had not Freedom. Then the Place to hold the Meeting was got ready, being a large Place like a Barn, where the Friend and his Men built Boats for the Shipping, that being his Calling, and we ſat down, being a few Friends, and in a little Time many People came, amongſt whom, as it was ſaid, came ſix Preachers: And in ſome convenient Time a young Woman ſtood up who had a pretty Gift, but the People behaved very rudely, ſo that it put the poor Girl out of Countenance, and ſhe ſat down. Then ſtood up <hi>Lydia Norton,</hi> a famous Miniſter, none more ſo of that Country, and indeed ſhe had an excellent Gift, and knew how to conduct herſelf in it; but all this did not avail, the People grew worſe and worſe in their Behaviour; and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> having a very ſtrong manly Voice, extended it very loud, but all to no purpoſe, for the People were as loud as ſhe, calling for a Dram, and ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in their Folly, ſo ſhe ſat down; and a young Man, called <hi>Joſhua Puddington,</hi> ſtood up;
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:008308_0130_102E888402F79520"/>
they were rude to the Women, but worſe with him, raking up his former Faults, and calling for a Cann of Flip, for he could drink as well as they, they ſaid: And he having been a Companion with them in fiſhing, they made very free with him, ſo he ſhut up. By this Time the Meeting was exceeding nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and continued enlarging very much: It came into my Mind, to ſtand up and take out my Bible, which I did, (for I always travelled with one in thoſe Days, finding a conſiderable Service in it at times) and opened it, and put my Finger in it, as tho' I would take my Text, but I ſaid Nothing for ſome conſiderable Time, till all was quiet, for the People continued in a great Confuſion for a while, till ſome of them obſerved my Book; then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to quiet and ſtill one another, urging as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, that <hi>I had the Word of God in my Hand,</hi> ſuch a great Regard they paid to my Bible; and in a little Time all was quiet and ſtill: Then I opened my Mouth and ſaid, <hi>Behold, I am an</hi> Engliſhman; and enumerated the many Lands and Places I had travelled in, but had never met with any People of ſuch a Behaviour as theſe were; referring to them to adviſe me, <hi>what Account I muſt give of the People of Newbury</hi> at my Return into <hi>England?</hi> A good come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gentleman-like Man, in Excuſe for the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the People, ſaid. <hi>Sir, as for Womens Preaching we hold it unlawful, becauſe St.</hi> Paul <hi>hath forbid it, therefore we think it not proper to give them a hearing: And as for the Man, we know him perhaps better than you, and can't think him qualified for that Undertaking; but you ſeem to be a Gentleman of Senſe, and we will</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:008308_0131_102E8886AB640070"/>
                  <hi>hear you.</hi> I replied, that as for <hi>Womens Preaching,</hi> its allowed a diſputable Point from <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, yet nevertheleſs if any of you are (after this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is over) willing to hear what I have to ſay in Favour of it, I ſhall be willing to give you the beſt Account I can why I think it is <hi>lawful:</hi> And if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you can ſhew better Reaſons againſt it, I ſhall as willingly hear them. And as for the young Man, I grant you may, as he is a Neighbour, have had a much better Knowledge of his former Conduct in Life, than I can pretend to; but allowing that he may have, in Time paſt, been looſe, that argues not againſt giving him a Hearing: For how know you, but that as <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſame Gentleman replied, <hi>I ſaid very right, they ought to have heard him: But I pray you ſpeak what you have to ſay freely, and I charge all preſent to make no Diſturbance or Interruption, if they do, in the</hi> Queen's Name <hi>I will commit them.</hi> By which Words I found he was in the Commiſſion of the Peace: And then I began, <q>That Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without Righteouſneſs was uſeleſs, and could not profit thoſe who profeſt it.</q> And going on, I came in the Courſe of my Service to recite the great Improvement true Religion made on the Minds of thoſe who lived in it, in giving them Power over their Luſts and Paſſions, repeating that of <hi>James</hi> i. 26. <hi>If any Man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this Man's</hi>

                  <hi>Religion is vain.</hi> One out of the Throng ſaid, <hi>Sir, you impoſe upon us, there's no ſuch Text.</hi> I made a full Stop, and turned to it; and there were many Bibles then appeared. I repeated Chapter and Verſe, and they turned to it. Then I aſked them, <hi>if they had it?</hi> They replied, <hi>they had.</hi> Then I read both the <hi>26th</hi> and <hi>27th</hi> Verſes, and aſked, <hi>if it was ſo in their Bibles?</hi> They anſwered that it was. I then deſired them to conſider, whether I that repeated the Text, or he that ſaid there was no ſuch Text, <hi>was moſt in the right.</hi> Then I went on with my Opening, carefully mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Guide; and in the Courſe of the Doctrine I had in my View, I came to treat of <hi>Faith,</hi> and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed between <hi>true</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> Faith, ſhewing, that notwithſtanding we might give our Aſſent to the Truth of that called the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> or any other made and drawn up by Men, and that we might be zealous to diſpute and contend for the Truth of theſe Creeds, in the wording Part of them; yet for all that, if we did not lead <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Lives, we were ſtill but <hi>Unbelievers; for Faith without Works is dead,</hi> the Text tells us, At which laſt Words one cries out, <hi>you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon us, there's no ſuch Text.</hi> I immediately ſtop'd, and turned to it, and quoted it, and they all who had Bibles made Search. There being a profound Silence, I read the Text, aſking, <hi>if it was ſo in their Books?</hi> They all replied, <hi>it was.</hi> I made the ſame Remark as before; and then I went on, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between <hi>true</hi> and <hi>falſe</hi> Faith, plainly demonſtrating from Scripture, that Faith was much different from what many took it to be. And indeed Truth was eminently preached that Day, and there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:008308_0133_102E8889ECAB64F0"/>
Tenderneſs amongſt the People, and the Meeting ended well.</p>
               <p>When I came out, the Gentleman came to me and I acknowledged his Kindneſs towards us; and it ſuddenly came before me to Speak with a loud Voice in the Street, and to deſire, that if any one was at a Loſs, and did not underſtand any Part of what I had ſaid, or thought I had ſpoken any Thing not agreeing to Scripture, I would then deſire them to let me know it, and not miſrepreſent any Thing I had ſaid when I was gone, the Gentleman made Anſwer on Behalf of the People thus; <hi>None can have any Objection, for I never heard the Word better preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my Time.</hi> And then I told them I was ready to let them know my Reaſons, why I thought Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, properly and duly qualified, might preach <hi>lawfully,</hi> on Condition I might have their Reaſons to the contrary. The Gentleman, who undertook ſtill to ſpeak on Behalf of the Company (who ſtaid to hear and ſee) ſaid. <hi>Here is none here will undertake to diſpute with you upon this or any other Point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: But I deſire you will favour me with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to have another meeting here, and I will get ſome of the beſt Writers the Country will afford, to take down your Sermon.</hi> But he little knew, that this was no great Inducement to my coming there again: However he preſt it very cloſe, which I excuſed in the beſt manner I could, as not knowing that I ſhould or ſhould not: And after ſome earneſt preſſing of me to go to his Houſe to refreſh myſelf, which I likewiſe deſired to be excuſed in, by reaſon we gave Expectation to go to our Inn, and we could not ſtay
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:008308_0134_102E888B6F544988"/>
much longer, becauſe Night was come upon us; we parted in good Reſpect and Harmony to all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and my Heart was filled with Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Comfort that we got over that Day's Work ſo well.</p>
               <p>Now being clear of theſe Parts I returned, viſiting the Meetings of Friends, and ſundry other Places, as in particular <hi>Cape-Ann,</hi> where I met with great Oppoſition; the Caſe was thus.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Cape-Ann</hi> ſundry Friends were deſirous of a Meeting, and more ſo, becauſe that ſeveral young Men, who were Friends, reſided there while they built a Ship. Accordingly I went, and ſeveral Friends went with me, and we got there early on a <hi>Seventh-day,</hi> and gave Notice of a Meeting, which was to good Satisfaction, and it being a new Thing, it was very large; the People deſired another, which was granted: And between Meetings, ſome gave their Preacher Notice, who had but a ſmall Congregation that Day, adviſing him to look after his Flock, it being his Duty. Accordingly he came before the Meeting ended, with ſeveral of his Elders, and was very noiſy. Firſt, he would prove <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi> from the Text, to be an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> of Chriſt. I replied; what <hi>Form</hi> of Water Baptiſm would he prove ſo? To which he anſwered evaſively, not being willing to be tied to one more than another. But after ſome farther <hi>Pro</hi>'s and <hi>Con</hi>'s he was by his own People preſt to vindicate his own Practice, which was <hi>Sprinkling.</hi> Then he ſaid, that was plainly proved by our Saviour's Words, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhewed him
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:008308_0135_102E888E429FC890"/>
his miſtake; that without Perverting that Text, it could not be applied to <hi>ſprinkling</hi> of Infants in any wiſe: But our Saviour's Words in that Place refered to the State of <hi>Innocency</hi> that ſuch ſhould experience, to be like little Children in their Minds, as free from all Manner of Vice and Wickedneſs, before they were ſit and prepared for the Kingdom of Heaven, which <hi>ſprinkling</hi> with <hi>elementary Water</hi> could not do for them. Opening more at large the State of the <hi>New-Birth</hi> and <hi>Regeneration;</hi> in doing which, he would often break in upon me, but his own People cried <hi>Shame,</hi> for the Interruption he gave, adding, when I had done, he ſhould be heard. But he was ſo much out about the Proof of <hi>ſprinkling</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by our Saviour's Words, that I found he was very weary of the Diſpute, and willing to drop it, and would go on upon <hi>Perfection.</hi> I urged him to clear up <hi>Baptiſm</hi> firſt, as we were upon it; but he would break off from it, urging, that both he and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſatisfied about it; I then aſked him, <hi>why he did begin upon it?</hi> To ſhew us our Errors, <hi>he replied.</hi> So finding nothing was like to come of it, but Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Noiſe, we preſſed it no farther. Then he charged us wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h being in <hi>an Error</hi> about <hi>Perfection</hi> I deſired to know, <hi>wherein?</hi> he was very unwilling to ſhew <hi>wherein,</hi> and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ew off to <hi>Election;</hi> in ſhort he would ſtick to nothing. So that one of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers reproved him very ſharply, for his abounding in ſo many charges of <hi>ſuppoſed Errors,</hi> and proving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; adding that it did not ſuit his Station as a Miniſter, whoſe Work it was, or ought to be, to ſet People to rights and to ſhew them <hi>wherein</hi> they were
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:008308_0136_102E88935589EA80"/>
                  <hi>wrong,</hi> and not to heap up Charges of Errors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing of any thing of Proof that they were ſo, which could by no means be a Way to convince and inform thoſe in Error. At which pertinent Rebuke he left us, ſome, though very few, going with him. I then deſired the People to ſit down, and be ſtill; which they readily complied with; and after a ſhort Pauſe, it was with me briefly to ſpeak to each Point, explaining, as well as I could, in ſo ſhort a Time, the Doctrine of outward Baptiſm to be but a Figure of the <hi>Inward,</hi> as outward Circumciſion was of the <hi>Inward,</hi> viz. <hi>of the Heart:</hi> And likewiſe ſetting forth the <hi>new Birth</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> in as clear a Light as Time would permit; with <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation;</hi> all which, though but very briefly touched upon, took up a conſiderable Time, ſo that the Night was above half ſpent conſiderably. When I had done, the People were exceeding quiet and civil, and declared their Satisfaction, wiſhing their Miniſter had likewiſe ſtaid, for he could not have gain ſaid what was ſpoken to each Point. Some few of them ſtay'd a ſhort Time after, deſiring that they might have more ſuch Meetings, and we parted in much Love and Sweetneſs; in particular, that Elder who reprehended the Miniſter, as he called him, ſaid, <hi>Religion could never proſper, ſo long at it was made a Trade of to get Bread by;</hi> and he ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that both the Doctrine and practice of their People were <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with primitive Religion and our Saviour's Doctrine. And thus we cloſed our Conference and took Leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:008308_0137_102E88960326CEF8"/>
From thence I returned towards <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Leave, as not expecting to ſee them again this Journey.</p>

Then I went to <hi>Nara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet,</hi> and had two or three Meetings there, and took my Leave and came to <hi>New-London,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> and at the Eaſt End of it had ſome Meetings, where both Friends and others were very glad of my coming. I had many Meetings in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places, and there was great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>locking to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and very great Openneſs amongſt the People in thoſe Parts. A Friend told me, that <hi>George Keith</hi> had propoſed, as a Means to prevent the growth of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as he called it, the making of a Law to reſtrain Friends from travelling, ſave to their own Meetings; for he ſaid, it was the travelling Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that kept the <hi>Quakers</hi> up ſo ſtrong in Countenance. This was thought by ſome hot Biggots a likely Way to put a Stop to the Increaſe of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which had infected almoſt the whole Country; but by People of Moderation and Senſe it was hiſſed at.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:008308_0138_102E889787D29BF8"/>
But to the Matter; there was a very large Meeting at <hi>Weſtbury on the Plain,</hi> called. Yearly meeting, to which moſt of the Friends of the Iſland, and many of the better Sort of the Weſt End of it came, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known that I ſhould take my Leave there; and I was very much opened, in ſetting forth the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the true and falſe Miniſters, and the true and falſe Worſhip; and there being ſome of <hi>Keith</hi>'s Friends, they threatened to have me taken up again; but I found that Truth was over them, and they could do no more than ſhew their Teeth for they could not bite.</p>
               <p>After this Meeting I left the Iſland, and went into the <hi>Jerſeys</hi> by <hi>Stratan-Iſland</hi> to <hi>Woodbridge, Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Croſſwicks,</hi> and back to <hi>Egg-harbour,</hi> viſiting Friends, and ſo back to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to the Yearly meeting, which was very large, and I had good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in being there. Here ſundry of my dear Friends from <hi>Long-Iſland</hi> met me, in particular, my dear Friend <hi>Samuel Bowne</hi> and his worthy Wife, who was a good Mother in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> with this good Woman I left fifteen Pounds to defray ſome Charges my good Friends had deen at about my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for Chamber Rent, and a Preſent they made the Keeper, which I was unwilling to have them pay, having Money plenty, that I earned in Priſon by making of Shoes: But my dear Friends would not permit it, but returned it me by <hi>Samuel Bowne,</hi> who uſed ſo many Arguments, that it did not look well for them to ſuffer it, by reaſon it would be a Reproach on them, and look as though I did not Count them worthy to treat me as a Miniſter; ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

than bring an Uneaſineſs upon my Brethren, I took it again.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Philadelphia</hi> I accompanied theſe my Friends going on their Way Home, about thirty Miles, as far as <hi>Croſſwicks,</hi> viſiting that Meeting and <hi>Burlington,</hi> took my Leave there and came to the <hi>Falls</hi> Meeting, and ſo viſited all the Meetings on that Side of the River, down through the <hi>Welſh</hi> Towns to <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia;</hi> and taking my Leave there alſo, went to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> viſiting ſundry Meetings, making towards <hi>Maryland:</hi> A <hi>Welſh</hi> Friend, named <hi>Ellis Pugh,</hi> who propoſed to come over with me to viſit his Friends in <hi>Wales,</hi> was now with me, and we came into <hi>Maryland,</hi> and took our Paſſage Home with a Friend, whoſe Name was <hi>Daniel Maud,</hi> but be could not be ready to ſail under two Months; ſo my Companion returned to his Family, and I viſited <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Carolina,</hi> and had good Satisfaction. I took my Leave and returned to the Ship, and found my dear Friend <hi>Ellis Pugh</hi> labouring among Friends in <hi>Maryland.</hi> In a little Time the Ship fell down the Bay to <hi>Kickatan,</hi> where the Fleet made up, waiting for Convoy, and in a few Weeks the Fleet came together, being very large; but many Ships had taken ſo great Damage by ſtaying ſo long in the Country, that they could not bear the Sea, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral foundered, and ſome put back to unload, and have their Ships repaired. We had a long Paſſage but arrived ſafe, landing at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> in the <hi>Tenth-Month</hi> 1706, and viſited only a ſmall Meeting at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and took Coach for <hi>London,</hi> where I ſtaid to viſit the Meetings in the City, and afterwards went
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:008308_0140_102E889E6F237970"/>
down to <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Quarterly-Meeting, where was ſome Uneaſineſs amongſt Friends, but happily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
               <p>I then went into <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> to viſit my Friend, being under an Engagement of Marriage to her, as before hinted, where I ſtaid a few Weeks, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited ſundry Meetings in that Neighbourhood, and ſo for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where I ſtaid a Week or ten Days, then went pretty directly into the North, which I called my Home, and glad I was to be amongſt my old Friends again.</p>
               <p>Having viſited the Meetings in our own County, and delivered up my Certificate, giving an Account of my Travels, at next Monthly-Meeting I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friends with my intended Marriage, having a few Lines from under my intended Wife's Hand, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from her Parents, ſhewing all their Conſent. And I deſired a Certificate from the Meeting, and Perſons were appointed, as is uſual in the like Caſe, to make Enquiry of my Clearneſs: And in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim the Quarterly-meeting for <hi>Cumberland</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be at <hi>Carliſle,</hi> whither I went. The Meeting was exceeding large, and I had great Satisfaction in being there. I viſited a few Meetings in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> but was limited for time, being obliged to be at the next Monthly-meeting to have my Certificate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> in order to proceed towards my Marriage.</p>
               <p>By this Time the Spring was advanced, and my Worthy Friend <hi>James Wilſon</hi> offered his Company to go to my Marriage; accordingly we ſet forward, and took in our Way the Yearly-meeting at <hi>Middlewich,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:008308_0141_102E889FF1EBBD48"/>
which was very large, and ſundry weighty Friends were there, I had great Satiſfaction and Comfort in being there. So we took Meetings, as they ſuited, in our Way: And I found my Companion under a great Concern to ſpeak ſomething in Meetings, but very backward and loth to give up to it; but I gave him what Encouragement I could: And in <hi>Tewkeſbury</hi> Meeting, after ſome Struggle in himſelf, he ſtood up, and appeared very much to his own, and Friends Comfort, and ſo in every Meeting after till we came to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and indeed he appeared more like an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Work than a Babe. But at <hi>Briſtol</hi> he did not get through what he had before him to his lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſat down under very great Diſcouragement, but I cheered him up as well as I could, by giving him an Account of my Experiences: And when we came to the little Country Meetings again, he did finely, and gathered Strength and Experience in the Work very faſt.</p>
               <p>We came to my intended Father-in-Law's Houſe, and went to their Monthly-meeting, where I and my Friend propoſed our intended Marriage, which was taken Notice of. And then <hi>Briſtol</hi> Yearly-meeting coming on, we went thither, and met our worthy Friend <hi>Thomas Camm,</hi> who intended to be at our Marriage. After the Yearly-meeting was over at <hi>Briſtol, Thomas Camm</hi> took a Meeting or two in the Way, but my Friend <hi>James</hi> and I returned back, in order for me to get clear of the Monthly-meeting, and likewiſe to provide ourſelves Neceſſaries for the Wedding, which was to be accompliſhed the Week following, at a Meeting on purpoſe at <hi>Puddimore,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:008308_0142_102E88A17994AD48"/>
and it was a very large Meeting, ſundry Public Friends beſides <hi>Thomas Camm</hi> being there. The Yearly-meeting at <hi>London</hi> coming on, I ſtaid but a few Days with my Wife; I would have had her gone with me, but her Mother was taken ill of a <hi>feveriſh</hi> Diſorder, and was very weak, for which Reaſon ſhe was not eaſy to go; ſo I was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to leave her to nurſe her Mother, who in a few Days grew much better, but I had firſt a ſweet Opportunity with the Family, and one or two Friends more in her Chamber, and the Spirit of Prayer came or <hi>James,</hi> and he was drawn forth very largely, and very devoutly. After which (not without ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Reluctance) we parted for a ſhort Time, and <hi>James</hi> and I ſet out for <hi>London,</hi> and that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was very large, and Friends there were willing I ſhould give ſome Account of my Travels, which I was much afraid of; but being call'd upon in the Meeting, I did it, and came off much better than I expected; ſundry Friends expreſſing their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Meeting was over, dear <hi>James</hi> and I had a heavy Parting; but as I was going to my Wife, that helped to chear my Heart a little. I came directly Home without taking any Meetings, having my dear Friend <hi>James Salter,</hi> and ſundry others who had been at the Yearly-meeting, in Company. And now I ſtaid with my dear Wife, and went very little abroad for more than twelve Months, having very great Comfort and Satisfaction in my married State, my Wife being a true Sympathizer with me in all the Exerciſes which I often was under, of one
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:008308_0143_102E88A6929EFF90"/>
Kind or another; as ſometimes I feared <hi>how we ſhould go on in the World;</hi> and ſhe would often ſay, if we get but little, we will ſpend leſs; and if we ſave a little out of our Gettings. we ſhall do well enough, I am not at all fearful of it, neither would I have thee. Then I was jealous that my Miniſtry <hi>was not ſo living as it had been before I was married;</hi> and making my Trouble and Uneaſineſs about it known to my Wife, ſhe would endeavour to diſſwade me from ſuch Thoughts, adding, there was no Reaſon for it; ſo that I found her to be an Help-meet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
               <p>Then finding a Concern to viſit <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her therewith, and ſhe gave me up ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cheerfully, that it was a Cordial to me; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe expected I would often leave her, and that ſhe had reſolved in herſelf before Marriage, ſhe would never hinder my Miniſtry if ſhe could poſſibly avoid it, and ſhe hoped that the Lord would ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her, and make that eaſy to her.</p>
               <p>So accordingly about the <hi>Fifth-Month</hi> 1708, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Monthly-meeting for a Certificate, which I had, and then took Shipping at <hi>Minehead,</hi> and landed at <hi>Cork,</hi> where I ſtaid two or three Meetings to good Satisfaction: Then I went to <hi>Charlevill</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> viſiting the Meetings along that Side of the Nation to <hi>Colrain,</hi> and I found very hard Work in many Places, and in ſome Meetings was quite ſhut up; but I found, where the People who did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs with us came in plentifully, it was not ſo, but there was an open Door; and that worthy Friend, and heavenly minded, meek, and divine Preacher,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:008308_0144_102E88A946DA3620"/>
                  <hi>Gilbert Thompſon,</hi> was there at the ſame Time; and when we converſed about it, I found he was, much as I was, ſhut up, and found it very hard Work in ſome Places to get forward; and as he was in Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and Age much my Superior, I requeſted what he thought might be the Reaſon, <hi>why it ſeemed more dead amongſt Friends in this Nation now, than in ſome other Places?</hi> He gave this as a Reaſon, <hi>That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Truth in that Nation were very ſtrict and exact in ſome Things, and placed much in</hi> outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, <hi>but too much neglected the</hi> Reformation <hi>and</hi> Change <hi>of the</hi> Mind, <hi>and having the</hi> Inſide <hi>thoroughly cleanſed from</hi> Pride <hi>and</hi> Iniquity; <hi>for thou knoweſt,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Leaven of the</hi> Phariſees <hi>was always hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Life of Religion in all Shapes.</hi> Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we found a brave living People in that Nation, and great Encouragement there was to viſit freſh Places.</p>
               <p>I came from <hi>Colrain</hi> to <hi>Lurgan, Mount Allen,</hi> and ſundry ſmall Meetings thereabout, <hi>Hilſborough, Liſburn, Ruffer-Iſland,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Drogheda,</hi> Friends having a Meeting-houſe in that Town, but few came to Meeting, there being no Friends in the Town, except two Men. From thence I went for <hi>Dublin,</hi> then viſited the Meetings towards <hi>Wicklow, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and ſo to <hi>Cork,</hi> and had a large Meeting at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> it being the firſt Meeting in the Meeting-houſe that Friends had built there. Friends in that Kingdom are highly to be commended, in not ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charge for accommodating Meetings, either by building or hiring Places for that Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:008308_0145_102E88AAC8F92650"/>
By this Time the Half-yearly-meeting at <hi>Dublin</hi> came on, but Nothing very remarkable happened there. I took my Leave of Friends, and when clear I left the City, and my dear Friend <hi>Joſeph Gill</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied me about three Weeks. He did not then appear as a Miniſter in Meetings, but was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Exerciſe, and I was ſatisfied he was under a very conſiderable Influence of divine Goodneſs, which would be manifeſted by his coming forth in the Miniſtry in due Time, which accordingly came to paſs; for in a few Weeks after his Return, he appeared very acceptably in the Miniſtry, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a very ſerviceable Man in the Work.</p>
               <p>After we parted I went on for <hi>Cork,</hi> in order to take ſhipping Home, which I did, but the Wind not favouring us for almoſt three Weeks, gave me ſome Uneaſineſs, becauſe I wrote to my Wife, that I intended coming ſooner; and I heard afterwards ſome of our Neighbours had reported, that I with the Ship was taken into <hi>France;</hi> but my poor Wife bore up bravely under it. When the Wind ſprung up fair, the Maſter ſet ſail, but we were juſt but got clear of the River before it veered againſt us; ſo the Maſter purpoſed that we might fetch <hi>Waterford,</hi> and thought it would be better to do ſo than to go back to <hi>Cork;</hi> accordingly we all agreed, and got there by the Cloſe of the Evening, being <hi>Seventh-day;</hi> I ſtaid the <hi>Firſt-day</hi> Meeting, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to Satisfaction, and I was opened in the Excellency of the Goſpel. On <hi>Second-day</hi> we ſet ſail again, and got into <hi>Minehead</hi> in about forty eight Hours, and I poſted Home by <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and met
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:008308_0146_102E88AD7051A4E8"/>
with a hearty and kind Welcome from all our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more eſpecially my dear Wife, having ſpent in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſomewhat more than eighteen Weeks. It ſoon got abroad that I was come Home, and many Friends from ſeveral Neighbouring Meetings came to Viſit me and we had great Comfort in one another.</p>
               <p>Now I had nothing to do but Viſit the Meetings around me, which were pretty numerous: But one Thing came upon me pretty much, and that was, <hi>to put myſelf into ſome Buſineſs to get Bread.</hi> Some propoſed one Way, ſome another. <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi> were both propoſed, but I could not ſee my way to either of them; and what I ſhould do in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being ignorant of Farming, I ſaw not yet. At laſt it was propoſed that I might with a little Charge make a Conveniency to make a little Malt, in which, when an Apprentice, I had ſome Experience, being then uſed to it. I accordingly did, but my Stock was very ſmall, but ſome kind Friends lent me ſome Money, and I found it anſwer better than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that I was encouraged to proceed; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Years Time, I found it anſwered very well, ſo that I went on with Pleaſure, and to took great Care, and was very diligent in my Buſineſs and in attending all Meetings that I could reach in a Morning's Ride, as I found a Concern ſo to do; and the Comfort and Happineſs I enjoyed was great, for I could entertain my Friends with a Lodging, and other Neceſſaries in a plain Way, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to us both; and moſt Friends that came, took a Bed with me one or two Nights, as beſt ſuited their Conveniency in their Journey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:008308_0147_102E88B3F52DA1D8"/>
But in a little Time a Storm aroſe: The Parſon of the Pariſh having had Nothing from our Family for thirteen Years and upwards, of his ſmall Tithes, and other Church-dues, (as he ſtiled them) got a Summons for me to meet him before the Juſtice; but before the Time came I writ him a few Lines, to know his Demand, and he writ me a long Letter in anſwer thereto. And I replied to his Anſwer. All which are hereunto annexed. The Time came, and ſome other Friends were convened by other Prieſts from other Pariſhes at the ſame Time. When I was called, there were two Juſtices, one <hi>Edward Phillips</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Montacute,</hi> and—<hi>Harben</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Newton: Phillips</hi> was very rough and boiſterous in Words, and <hi>Harben</hi> altogether as mild, uſing ſundry Arguments to perſwade me to pay it myſelf, or ſuffer ſome other Perſon to pay it, being very earneſt that I ſhould ſuffer him to pay it for me, and he would not deſire to have it altogether; ſuppoſing that I might not ſo well ſpare what the Parſon demanded at once. I told him, I was very much obliged to him for his kind Offer, believing his Intention was to ſerve me in it, but I could by no means accept it, without Injury to my own Mind, it being a Matter that concerned my Conſcience, which I was deſirous to keep void of Offence towards God. He took me into another Room, and was very earneſt to have it made up; urging, <hi>that it was ſo much in Arrears, that it was beyond their Power to end it, and it muſt be put into the</hi> Exchequer, <hi>and that would be very charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>muſt fall upon you at laſt.</hi> I told him, that I could do Nothing to make it up:
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:008308_0148_102E88B579347478"/>
And having conferred ſome Time, we went in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and he ſpoke to the Effect following, <hi>that he was very ſorry he could not ſerve us, as we were both his Neighbours and Friends</hi> (meaning the Parſon and me and told the Parſon, <hi>it would be uneaſy to us both; and would have us end it between ourſelves.</hi> I ſaid, if it were a Matter of juſt Debt that I was ſatisfied was any Neighbour's Due, I ſhould ſoon end it with my Neighbour <hi>Ray,</hi> and be as willing to pay, as he was to receive it; but as it was not of that Nature, I could by no means do it. So I was diſmiſſed, and in a little Time ſerved with an <hi>Exchequer Proceſs,</hi> and in a few Months after, in the next Term, I was taken up in my Way for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where I was going about my Buſineſs, and put into Goal. But when the Parſon had got me there, he was very uneaſy indeed, ſo that he could not take his Reſt, and told his Attorney. <hi>If he loſt all his Claim, he could by no means keep me there, for he had no Reſt or Quietneſs of Mind Night nor Day.</hi> So accordingly the Attorney came to the Keeper in leſs than ten Days Time, in the Parſon's Name deſiring him to let me go Home to look after my Buſineſs: Which I accordingly did, and in a few Days went my Journey to <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and when I had done my Buſineſs there, took a little Turn into <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> and ſpent about two Weeks in viſiting ſundry Meetings, and ſo returned Home.</p>
               <p>Then I adviſed my Friends at the Meeting for Sufferings in <hi>London,</hi> how it ſtood; who adviſed me, that the Parſon could not proceed farther, as he had taken me up and put me into Goal: So I heard no more of it all that Winter: But in the Spring a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

Relation of our Family came to my Wife when I was from Home, and deſired her to lend him ten Pounds, for he was going to a Fair, being a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Grazier. She had no Thoughts about the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Demands, that being a much bigger Sum, and he being a <hi>Diſſenter,</hi> and having done me the like Favour, ſhe lent it him, and he gave her his Note ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. My Wife, when I came Home, told me what ſhe had done, and I ſaid, it was very well, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting Nothing of any Trick in the Matter; but as he came in my Abſence to borrow it, ſo in like Manner he came in pretence to pay it, addreſſing himſelf to my Wife to this Effect; <hi>Dear Couſin, if you can help me to that Note, I had beſt pay it; you know I borrowed it of you, and ſhall pay it to you.</hi> So ſhe very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently fetch'd his Note, and he tore it immediately; and putting his Hand into his Pocket, takes out and throws her down the Parſon's Receipt for the ten Pounds, in full of all Demands for Tithes to that Time. My poor Wife was under a very great Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, urging, <hi>it would be a very great Uneaſineſs to me.</hi> Your Huſband, ſaid he, is, we allow, a Man of Senſe, but in this he is a ſtubborn Fool; and I would have paid it out of my own Pocket rather than he ſhould have ruined you and himſelf, which this <hi>Exchequer</hi> Suit would ſoon have done if it had gone on; for his original Demand is fourteen Pounds and upwards, and he hath been at forty or fifty Shillings Charge already, and you muſt have paid that and ten Times more if it had gone on, which now I have cleared for ten Pounds; I think you are exceeding well off. <hi>Ay, but,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>we look at inward Peace
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:008308_0150_102E88BC5331F4A8"/>
more than all that, and I ſhall be blamed for being privy to the Contrivance, and beget a Jealouſy in my Huſband about other Affairs.</hi> Oh! my dear Couſin trouble not yourſelf about that, ſaid he, for I can clear you, that you are as innocent of it as a new-born Babe: And I know I could not have brought it about with your Huſband, for he would have ſtarted ſo many Queſtions, that I could not poſſibly have brought it about any other Way, than by ploughing with his Heifer. When my Wife told me of it, which was not preſently, it troubled me, to have my Teſtimony thus evaded by this undermining Trick, which was in the Man that did it, deſigned for our Good no doubt, and the Note that he gave for the Money being deſtroyed, I had nothing to ſhew under his Hand for the Money, and what to do in it I was at a loſs: But I thought it beſt to convene the Elders, and let them know how it ſtood, and to be adviſed how I might clear my Teſtimony, and my dear Wife and Self, from having any Hand in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Trick; which I accordingly did, and they were ſatisfied we were clear of the Contrivance, but did not know what to do to ſatisfy others about it; one Friend was for <hi>ſuing him</hi> that had thus trick'd me for the ten Pounds: But others thought ſuch an Act would do more Hurt than Good, and thought it by no means adviſeable to act any farther, than to go to my Kinſman and let him know, that what he had done in the Caſe, tho' by him intended for a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it had the contrary Effect on our Minds, ſo that altho' he intended to ſerve us, it proved a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, and to requeſt, that for the future he would
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:008308_0151_102E88BF0786D588"/>
never ſerve us ſo again. In due Time my Wife and I took an Opportunity, and diſcourſed the Matter over with him; and he to excuſe it ſaid, he little thought we would take it ſo much amiſs as we had, having, as he thought, no Reaſon for it, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that our Friends ſhould be ſo ſtubborn as to contend againſt Law; and he could not bear to think we ſhould be ſerved as Mr. <hi>Banton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tilly</hi> were; and indeed, if it were again to do, I ſhould do the ſame, <hi>ſaid he.</hi> Robert Banton <hi>and</hi> William Tilly <hi>were two very great Sufferers by</hi> Exchequer Proceſs, <hi>both very honeſt ſincere Friends.</hi> Thus was this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair ended.

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE been above thirteen Years in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and have not given your Family any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, though the Arrears which are due to me are conſiderable; ſo that you have no Reaſon to complain of hard Uſage from me, but rather to thank me for my Kindneſs, in bearing this Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo long.</p>
                     <p>You don't think, when you go to Law with one another, or with ſome of thoſe who differ from you, that you ſpoil their Goods, when you put them to Charges, that you may force them to do you Juſtice. And why, pray you, ſhould it be thought a Spoiling of your Goods, when we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than you do yourſelves, when you think you are wronged; that is, endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:008308_0153_102E88C5858EAF08"/>
our own? For I demand nothing of you but what I know to be mine before I receive it.</p>
                     <p>You might as well make an Entry upon our <hi>Glebelands,</hi> or upon any Thing elſe we poſſeſs, as to ſeize upon the Tithes, to which you have no more Title than to the other, unleſs you have bought them, as I am ſure you have not.</p>
                     <p>For every Body who underſtands theſe Things, will tell you, that when ſuch Lands as are Tithe-free, are ſold or lett, they are for that Reaſon valued at an higher Price, and the Lord or Seller makes the Tenant or Purchaſer pay for the Tithe, as well as for the reſt of the Eſtate: And that on the other hand, there is a proportionable Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made to the Purchaſers and Tenants of ſuch Lands as are liable to the Payment of Tithes. And there is very good Reaſon for it, becauſe in that Caſe, the Tithes being no Part of the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's Property, he cannot make them over to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or demand a Price for that which he has not ſold; and thoſe who Rent or Purchaſe his Eſtate, can claim no Title by Virtue of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance or Grant of his, but only to what he had a Right to diſpoſe of himſelf: So that if you will needs, in this matter pretend Conſcience, you ought not to occupy any Land but what is Tithe free.</p>
                     <p>But if you think that this would be very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and inconvenient, you ought, when you oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy Tithe-land, to permit us quietly to enjoy our Tithes, which are a Part of our <hi>Free-hold,</hi> and to which we have the ſame Title as we have to our <hi>Glebe,</hi> wherein you claim no Propriety, as indeed
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:008308_0154_102E88C82D0E8008"/>
you have no manner of Title to the Tithe. If you have, be pleaſed to ſhew it, and let us know from whom you had it. And if you have none, as I know you have not, don't go to pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for invading your Neighbour's Property.</p>
                     <p>For my Part, I do not ſee any Reaſon, why you ſhould not actively comply with the Law for Payment of Tithes, as well as with that for Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as your Friends have done over all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ever ſince the Revolution; and ſome of them have been Collectors, though the Title of the Act of Parliament did plainly ſhew that the Tax was for carrying on a War againſt <hi>France</hi> with Vigour: And yet your Friends, even thoſe who have been of greateſt Reputation among you, and the Champions of your Cauſe, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared as much againſt the Lawfulneſs of all War, as they have done againſt the Payment of Tithes; and ſometimes have carried the matter ſo high, as to refuſe the Payment of Money demanded of them for that Purpoſe as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> tells us, <hi>they ſuffered, becauſe they would not Pay for Drums and Colours, and other Military Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture.</hi> And this they did in the Time of Peace, when the Militia met only to make a Raree-ſhow, and had at the Place of Rendezvous no other Enemies to ſkirmiſh with but Butterflies. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſince the War againſt <hi>France</hi> began, your Friends have given the ſame active Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws for Payment of Taxes, as their fellow Subjects have done; and I hope, you for the future, will do for the Payment of Tithes, which,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:008308_0155_102E88C9EE2337E0"/>
according to your avowed Principles, is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the Payment of Taxes for carrying on a War with Vigour.</p>
                     <p>It is a vain Thing to pretend Conſcience to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Oppreſſion or Covetouſneſs, for it muſt be one or either of theſe, which makes any Man take Poſſeſſion of what is not his own, but his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's.</p>
                     <p>If we lived by the Alms-baſket, and could claim nothing but what we might expect from the Benevolence of thoſe from whom we make any Demand of this Nature, we could not blame you ſo much: But the Caſe is otherwiſe: for we deſire none of your Benevolence, and we know the Tithe is no Part of your Eſtate, and that you can claim no Right to it, either by Donation or Purchaſe. Therefore don't go to call that your own which is not; and being you diſclaim all Violence againſt, or Oppreſſion of Men upon the Account of their Conſcience, we may reaſonably expect ſo much Tenderneſs from you, that you would not oppreſs us, becauſe we differ from you, and that you would not, under a Pretence of Conſcience, ſeize upon our Eſtates, and then make an Outcry againſt us, when we deſire the Aſſiſtance of the civil Magiſtrate, for recovering any Part of our Properties or Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, as often as you unjuſtly invade them. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we might look for more Equity from you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are Members of that Church which in other Reſpects permits you the free Exerciſe of your Religion, and has confirmed the ſame
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:008308_0156_102E88CB714AD1F8"/>
by the late Act of Indulgence, agreed upon by the Biſhops, Lords, and Commons of our Communion. An Inſtance of ſuch Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as was never ſhewn to our Church by any other Sect who had us under their Power, whether <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or ſome violent and fierce <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters,</hi> who perhaps would handle us as roughly as our Predeceſſors were by them, if God ſhould again permit us to fall under their mercileſs Hands.</p>
                     <p>You ſay, <hi>You take it hard to be ſo treated by a Man of my Pretenſions, and if it was from ſome of the ſame Cloth, you would think it was like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> But why ſhould it be thought inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with my Pretenſions, to demand what I know to be my own? And why may I not ſay the ſame to you, that I take it hard to be ſo treated by a Man of your Pretenſions, who profeſs, that <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> againſt thoſe who differ from you, merely upon the Account of their Conſcience, is unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable; and yet, contrary to this your Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you ſeize upon that which is mine, mine by as good a Right as you have to your own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: For you cannot ſay that you have purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Tithes, or that any who had a Title to diſpoſe of them, did make them over to you; and yet for all that, you pretend Conſcience for the Diſturbance you give me, for no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe I am of a different Communion from you. If this was done by ſome who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Violence</hi> againſt Men of another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion is <hi>meritorious,</hi> and that <hi>Hereticks</hi> ought
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:008308_0157_102E88CF51E20C78"/>
not to be ſuffered to live, I ſhould think it was like themſelves; tho' from you I might expect other Things. But let that be as it will, I deſire nothing from you but the Profits of my own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, which you unjuſtly with-hold from me; and I am reſolved, whatever you think or ſay about the Matter, that I <hi>will have my Right.</hi> However, if you are willing to live peaceably, I ſhall be as moderate as you can expect, and for that Reaſon have referred this Buſineſs to Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> whom I have authorized to do as he thinks fit, and am, <hi>Sir,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <hi>1ſt.</hi> Thou art pleaſed to write, <hi>I ought to thank thee for forbearing with this Injuſtice ſo long;</hi> but I take the Refuſal of paying Tithes to be no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. <hi>Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="3">
                        <hi>3dly.</hi> He with whom I go to Law ſhall have no <hi>juſt Plea of Conſcience,</hi> becauſe if I can have no plain Demonſtration that he had of me a <hi>valuable Conſideration</hi> for which I make my Demands on him, I will not go to Law at all; therefore it's not a parallel Caſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <hi>4thly.</hi> If on ſuch a Foundation I go to Law, and force my adverſe Party to Juſtice by Law, I conclude with thee, <hi>it is not ſpoiling of Goods.</hi> But to go to Law, and by it take away Peoples Goods, without ſuch a <hi>valuable Conſideration</hi> as above, is <hi>Spoiling of Goods,</hi> in my Opinion, <hi>with a Witneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou writes me, <hi>I may as well ſeize of the</hi> Glebe-lands, <hi>or upon any Thing elſe we poſſeſs, as upon the</hi> Tithes. Under Favour, I am of another Mind; becauſe I have no Title to ſhew for thy <hi>Glebe-lands</hi> or any Thing elſe thou enjoys: But for my Land, the whole I take to be mine, without any Reſerve or exception whatſoever, as the Writings that give me my Title to it, do ſufficiently ſet forth and declare; and I have given for it a <hi>valuable Conſideration,</hi> which thou never did for the <hi>tenth Part</hi> thereof: Therefore, I am ſure I have more Right to it than thou canſt pretend to, in Juſtice, Equity and Reaſon; becauſe I have bought, without Reſerve, the <hi>Whole,</hi> and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:008308_0159_102E88D4A7E34DC0"/>
manured the ſame at my own Coſt and Charge; but thou haſt bought no Part thereof, nor been at any Charge about improving it, that I know of.</p>
                     <p>Thou further writes, <hi>that every Body that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands theſe Things, will tell me, when ſuch Lands as are Tithe-free are ſold, for that Reaſon they are valued higher.</hi> What Argument is that for the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of Tithes according to the Goſpel? I conceive none at all.</p>
                     <p>The next is, that <hi>if I occupy Tithe-lands, I ought quietly to permit you to enjoy the Tithes:</hi> That's the Matter in Diſpute, which ſhall in it's Place be ſpoken to.</p>
                     <p>Now I am come to thy Argument about <hi>Taxes,</hi> wherein thou endeavours to make us inconſiſtent with ourſelves, in <hi>actively</hi> complying with the Law <hi>for Taxes,</hi> but refuſing <hi>a Compliance</hi> with the Law <hi>for Tithes</hi> endeavouring thereby to lay Tithes and Taxes upon <hi>one Foundation:</hi> In this alſo I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thee; for I underſtand Taxes to be paid as a <hi>civil Debt, Tribute</hi> or <hi>Cuſtom</hi> to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> But Tithes are paid as a religious Act to God, and holy Church, as in its Place ſhall be farther ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>Indeed our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Render unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Things that are</hi> Caeſars; <hi>and unto God, the Things that are God's</hi> Mark xii. 17. Now if we muſt render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and unto God the Things that are God's, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be proved, that <hi>Tithes</hi> are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Due, before they be demanded as <hi>his Right.</hi>
                     </p>

But here's the grand Objection of <hi>Inconſiſtency;</hi> that becauſe we have ſuffered for refuſing to pay towards the Militia for <hi>Drums, Colours,</hi> &amp;c. and yet <hi>actively</hi> comply with the Law of Taxes, which is to carry on a War with Vigour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting on <hi>R. Barclay</hi>'s Words to ſtrengthen the Objection; we are ſtill of the ſame Mind with <hi>R. Barclay</hi> that <hi>Wars and Fighting are inconſiſtent with the Goſpel Principles; and when it's brought ſo near to us, that by Law we are obliged to act both in Perſon and Eſtate, we in this Caſe abuſe rather</hi> paſſively <hi>to ſuffer, than</hi> actively <hi>to comply, for</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake. And this is ſtill our Caſe, and a Suffering we lie under (with reſpect to the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia) in many Places, being careful to walk by the Rule of Chriſt's Doctrine; and yet do not hereby think ourſelves inconſiſtent in actively complying with the Law of Taxes, in rendering to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, and he may do therewith what pleaſeth him, we may not direct him; therefore, to uſe thy own familiar Simile, I take this Argument of Taxes to have no more Weight in it, in relation to Tithes, it being no parallel Caſe, than the <hi>Enemies that the Militia met with in their Rendezvous, at their Raree-ſhow.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou writeſt, that <hi>it's a vain Thing to pretend Conſcience to excuſe Oppreſſion or Covetouſneſs.</hi> I am entirely of thy Mind; ſo that where any Man pretends to refuſe the Payment of Tithes out of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> believing at the ſame Time in his Conſcience they are <hi>juſtly due;</hi> tis pity, I ſay, if that be his only Excuſe, but that he ſhould

               <p>After which, I was at a ſtrait what Courſe to take for ſome Time, being in Conſiderable Buſineſs, which I kept on that Winter, and in the Spring put it off to my Servant, and left what little Eſtate I had to him, putting off all Buſineſs, and went the next Summer into my own Country, the North, to viſit my Friends. I went to the Yearly Meetings at <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> in courſe as they came, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled from <hi>London</hi> through <hi>Hertſon ſhire Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> to <hi>Leeds,</hi> viſiting the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Friends as I paſſed along: I was at ſundry very large open Meetings in my Way to the Yearly-meeting at <hi>York,</hi> which was very large, and a great Number of Miniſters of both Sexes. I had no Time till the laſt Meeting, and the Time of that was far ſpent before I began, but then I took my Time pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoroughly, being opened very largely in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing between <hi>true</hi> and <hi>falſe Religion,</hi> ſetting them as it were Side by Side, that they might judge for themſelves of both the Worſhip and the Miniſtry, with their different Effects upon the Minds of Men and Women in regulating our Paſſions, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Minds; and opened pretty fully the Danger that Miniſters were in, to preach from the <hi>Letter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and that our former Openings and Experiences alone were not to be depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but our ſafeſt and beſt Support in that Work, was the immediate Ability of the Spirit, opening our Underſtandings in Matter ſuitable to every State, that our Words might be ſitly ſpoken, then they would
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:008308_0169_102E88EFF74B6928"/>
carry their own Evidence, and be ſerviceable to the Hearers: I was very large and particular on theſe Heads; and there being ſundry Clergymen, and Teachers of other Societies, I did not hear of any Objection made to the Doctrine they heard: But ſome of our Friends thought, what I had to ſay about the Miniſtry would have been better deliver'd in the Meeting of Miniſters; but that could not have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to well, as to the Teachers of other Societies, who might want Inſtruction in theſe Things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more than our own People did. This was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high Day, and I found in myſelf afterwards great Satisfaction and Peace.</p>
               <p>I now viſited Friends towards <hi>Kendal,</hi> and through Part of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having for my Companion a young Man from <hi>Sedburg,</hi> his Name was <hi>John Blamore.</hi> I found Friends in that Nation very much decreaſed in Number, above one Half, and ſundry Meetings quite dropt, unleſs when a Friend came to viſit them.</p>
               <p>I ſpent about ſix Weeks in that Nation, but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary happened: I returned into <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> viſiting moſt of the Meetings in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our Friends had at <hi>Cockermouth</hi> appointed a Meeting to be the Day after the Fair, at the Time call'd <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and it being in the moſt hot Time of the Oppoſition the <hi>Pearſons</hi> gave to Friends; <hi>Job</hi> and his Brother being at that Fair on their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, they gave out, that they would be at the Meeting the next Day, which gave an Alarm to both Town and Country People, ſo that it was a
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:008308_0170_102E88F3DEED9270"/>
very large Meeting; and as <hi>Job</hi> and I had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendly before he fell into theſe ranting Fits, ſome Friends thought he would ſhew me ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, more than he had done to ſome others, having been heard at Times to ſpeak in my Favour: But <hi>James Dickenſon</hi> being preſent, whom they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed ſo very much, ſaid, <hi>I ſhould be pleaſed to ſee a friendly Meeting between</hi> Job <hi>and my Friend, but I little expect i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> The Meeting came on, and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, and very open, and quiet, neither <hi>Job</hi> nor his Brother came, being otherwiſe employed; having ſome Concerns with ſome Country-men in the Fair, they went to an Ale-houſe to ſettle their Affairs, and differ'd ſo much about them, that from Words they proceeded to Blows, and this Fray held the Time of the Meeting, ſo we were free from any of their Diſturbance, and a ſweet, comfortable, quiet Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had to great Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Cockermouth</hi> I viſited the reſt of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that Part of the County, and ſo into <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> again, viſiting all the Meetings in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and through the Dales to <hi>Richmond,</hi> and <hi>York</hi> Quarterly-meeting the Winter Quarter, which was very large, conſidering the Seaſon of the Year. I had ſundry ſatisfactory Times amongſt Friends, both in Meetings of Buſineſs and amongſt the Miniſters, in very freely opening, and ſhewing my dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters, in the Openings of divine Life, the Experience and Knowledge that I had attained to in the Work of the Goſpel, finding my Spirit much enlarged in the ſetting forth thereof. But the laſt Meeting I was at in <hi>York,</hi> was on the firſt

day in the Evening by Candle light, and the Crowd in the Houſe was ſo very great, that the Candles would hardly burn, ſome died quite out with the Breath of the People; the exceſſive Croud made it very troubleſome for want of Room, and not to edifying as if the Company had been leſs.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to <hi>Bridlington Guſtwick, North<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <p>I travelled to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and had ſome Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in that County, and ſo on to <hi>

               <p>I now made a kind of a ſhort Viſit in my Way to <hi>London,</hi> which I viſited the thoroughly, ſtaid in the City four Weeks, and had very good Satisfaction: Returning through Part of <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> I had at <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> two very large Meetings, and ſo into <hi>Dorſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> having no Meetings after <hi>Reading,</hi> till I came there, and ſo to the Quarterly-meeting in <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> which being the Spring Quarter, was held at <hi>Glaſtonbury,</hi> very large it was indeed. Then back to <hi>Somerton</hi> Monthly-meeting, viſiting Meetings to and fro, being at ſundry Funerals, both before and after the Yearly-meeting at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which was this Year very large. From that Meeting I went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London,</hi> viſiting Meetings in my Way thither, and after Yearly-meeting was over I returned by

                  <hi>Alton, Allsford, Rumſey, Southampton,</hi> and the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and back to <hi>Ringwood</hi> to the Quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Hampſhire</hi> and to <hi>Pool</hi> Yearly-meeting, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there this Year. After which I came to <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> quartering at <hi>Caleb Hills,</hi> who married my Niece; and this Summer, before the Yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London,</hi> I had made my Addreſſes to the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <hi>Nichols,</hi> leaving the Matter to her Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now I renewed the Suit. And in the <hi>Eighth-Month</hi> with ſundry other Friends, went to ſollicit the Parliament for an <hi>Amendment</hi> of the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> in which Undertaking we were favoured with Succeſs, which was of very great Advantage to the Society, and the good Effects of it ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
               <p>I returned home in the Spring, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in my Addreſſes to the Widow, and we were married in the <hi>Second-Month,</hi> 1722, and we went to <hi>London</hi> Yearly-meeting together, which was to very great Comfort.</p>
               <p>I returned directly Home with my Wife, and being in a Coach, had no Opportunity of viſiting Meeting either going or coming. Being got ſafe Home, I applied myſelf to aſſiſt my Wife in her Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs as well as I could, attending General, Monthly and other Meetings on publick Occaſions for three Years: Then I had a Concern to viſit <hi>America</hi> once more, which my poor Wife could not at firſt with Eaſe conſent to, although I had laid it before her when I firſt made my Addreſſes to her, yet when it came to be put in Practice was not eaſily got over. But afterwards ſhe gave me freely up to go with my
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:008308_0173_102E88FBE94304D0"/>
Son-in-Law; and I got ready and went off, before it was thought of by almoſt any Body but the Friends in our own Neighbourhood. However, that it might not look like ſtealing away, I wrote to ſome of my choſen Friends at <hi>London,</hi> in the North, <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and elſewhere throughout this Nation, and to ſome few in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being willing to adviſe them where to meet me with Letters in that Country. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to do more, my Wife brought me on my Way to <hi>Pool,</hi> at which Place, before I went off, I received Anſwers to ſundry of my Letters, ſome of which, if Brevity did not require the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, would well deſerve a Place here.</p>

               <p>I Left my own Home the 22d Day of the <hi>Tenth-Month</hi> 1726, being accompanied by my dear Wife, a Kinſman, and a Son-in-Law, to <hi>Pool,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take Shipping there with my Son-in-Law <hi>Joſiah Nickleſon,</hi> but the Ship was not quite ready; and when it was ready, the Wind being againſt us, were obliged to ſtay there about five Weeks, ſo I had ſundry ſatisfactory Opportunities both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Friends and others.</p>

with a fair Wind and pleaſant Weather, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us a conſiderable Diſtance off the Land; but it held but three Days, and then we had very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hard Winds after that, which made me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſick, and other ways out of Order, ſo that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſpaired of my Life for a few Days, but had great Comfort and Peace of Mind, being ſatisfied I was in my Place, and in the Way of my Duty. I recovered as the Weather grew better, and the Sea quieter, but we had a very long and tedious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, being eleven Weeks and two Days upon the Sea, from Land to Land; and on the 14th of the <hi>Second-Month</hi> 1727, we landed at <hi>Hampton</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Kickatan</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and that Evening I got a Paſſage in a <hi>Pool</hi> Ship up to <hi>Sleepy-bole,</hi> and that Night about the 11th Hour I got to <hi>Robert Jordan</hi>'s, being very glad, tho' very weary, that I was got to ſo good a Place, where I had ſo hearty a Welcome, and had ſo great an Income of Peace and Comfort. This being on the Seventh-day of the Week, the next Morning I went to a Funeral about twenty Miles, which was a long Journey on my firſt Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and conſidering the Inhabitants are but thin, there was a great Concourſe of People on the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and I had a pretty open Time, conſidering I had not quite recovered my Weakneſs; beſides, the Motion of the Sea was very much in my Head, ſo that I had a great Dizzineſs and Swimming, that made me to reel like a Drunkard, as is common in the like Caſe.</p>
               <p>That Night I went with my Friend <hi>Robert Jordan</hi> to an Inn, near to the Place where his Son <hi>Robert</hi>

was a Priſoner, who was a pretty Youth, and had a very ſerviceable Miniſtry. The Father and I ſtaid with the Priſoner all the next Day, and in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went to lodge at the Priſoner's Houſe, his poor Wife being alone; and although her Huſband was confined, ſhe was chearful.

               <p>I then had a Meeting at the Weſtern Branch of <hi>Nanſemund</hi> River, and was at a Funeral of a young Man who was very much lamented.</p>

End, to run out Nature's Race, which was eighty Years.</p>
               <p>I went after this Meeting to viſit the Priſoner, and next day was at a Funeral, the People being very humble, by reaſon of a great mortality, ſo that preaching the Goſpel had a very great Reach upon them, and ſeveral were convinced: Next Day I went to <hi>Levy-neck,</hi> had a Meeting, and went next Day to <hi>Surrey</hi> Meeting-houſe to a Funeral, having been at four in about two Weeks. After this I took a Turn round again to <hi>Levy-neck,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Pagan Creek,</hi> and had a Meeting. Thence to <hi>Raſkers-neck,</hi> had a Meeting, and ſo round till the Quarterly-meeting was at hand; and then came on to the Priſoner's Houſe, <hi>viz. Robert Jordan's,</hi> to lodge. Next Day at the Meeting I met a Friend of <hi>London,</hi> his Name was <hi>Joſhua Fielding,</hi> who had viſited the Iſland, and <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> and had travell'd by Land to <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> about five Hundred Miles, in about three Weeks, moſtly alone, which was a difficult and hazardous Attempt: Some thought it too great an Undertaking, and ſeemed to blame him for it, but he got ſafe through, tho' he had no Proviſion but what he carried with him, and met with but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five Houſes or Plantations in all that five Hundred Miles Travel, which obliged him to lodge in the Woods frequently; but having a ſmall Pocket Compaſs, that was his Guide, when the Sun and Stars were hid from him. But I have ſince heard, that ſome others have travelled over this ſame Ground, (Plantations and Settlements being now placed at proper Diſtances) with leſs Hardſhip, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:008308_0177_102E89060698D3D8"/>
they having a Road mark'd out by the Government, and now they may accompliſh this Journey without ſo frequently lying in the Woods, as when this Friend came from thence. I was at the Quarterly-meeting which held the <hi>Seventh</hi> and <hi>Firſt-day,</hi> and it being very hot Weather, made it a little tedious to bear, there being a great Croud of People, but the Meetings ended well, and were of good Service.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to <hi>Levy-neck,</hi> and viſited all the Meetings up to <hi>Curl</hi>'s on the Bank of <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>River,</hi> had an open good Meeting there, though ſmall. Thence to <hi>Gerrard Elliſon</hi>'s and had a large and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Meeting. Thence to <hi>Rappahannock</hi> Ferry, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling ſixty Miles that Day: I lodged at a poor Widow's Houſe, no Friend by Profeſſion, but ſhe was exceeding kind. I had ſomething to ſay in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before Meat, with which ſhe was greatly affected, and broken into Tears very much, with ſome others of the Family. When we left her in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe would not be prevailed upon to take any Thing for our Quarters, but deſired that ſhe might be favoured with ſuch Gueſts often. I gave her Children ſomething, and we left her in much Love and Tenderneſs. Thence I travelled towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland,</hi> about ſeventy Miles, and had but one Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Way, where lived one <hi>William Duff,</hi> who was at that Time a very tender and ſerviceable Man. The Yearly-meeting in <hi>Maryland</hi> came now on, which held four Days, <hi>viz.</hi> Three for Worſhip, and one for Buſineſs. Many People reſort to it, and tranſact a deal of Trade one with another, ſo that it is a kind of Market or Change, where the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

of Ships and the Planters meet and ſettle their Affairs; and this draws abundance of People of the beſt Rank to it. It being in that called the <hi>Whitſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>week.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this Meeting I viſited the Province on that Side of the Bay, fully from <hi>Potuxant,</hi> and ſome Places where Meetings had not been, miſſing no Place till I came up to the Head of the Bay; but Nothing uncommon happened at thoſe Meetings, which were about eight in all. Then I ferried over the great River <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania:</hi> Some Friends came from thence into <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to meet me, and conduct me over that large Ferry, which was attended with pretty much Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it being a wide and very rough Sea, and I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more Danger than I was upon the Ocean in the greateſt Storm we met with, but through Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy we all got ſafe over, altho' with hard Labour and great Care and Difficulty; and the firſt Meeting that I had in that Province was in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and I had two in that Townſhip. Then I viſited the Meetings as they came in courſe, as <hi>New-garden, London-grave, Kinnet, Concord, Cheſter, Spring-field,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> A great Number of Friends came out of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to meet me, which gave me great Uneaſineſs, fearing I ſhould never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to anſwer the high Expectations that were raiſed by ſuch a Conduct; and it were better to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſuch Doings, for it is rather a Hurt than a Help. Now I ſhall give my Opinion of thoſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which were ſo very large, ſeveral of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to fifteen Hundred, and ſome more, and
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:008308_0179_102E8909F4F20808"/>
moſtly another Generation; but very few of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that twenty Years before were ſerviceable, zealous Men, were now living; and many of the riſing Youth did come up in the Form more than in the Power and Life, that their Predeceſſors were in; nevertheleſs, there was a fine living People amongſt them, and they were in a thriving good Way, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry young Miniſters being very hopeful, both Men and Women.</p>
               <p>I was at three Meetings in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large, more like Yearly-meetings than common <hi>Firſt-day's</hi> Meetings; after which I ſtaid but two Nights, being in haſte to reach a Yearly or Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, near 300 Miles further North, at <hi>New-port</hi> on <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> ſo I travelled from thence to <hi>Burlington, Croſſwicks, Stony-brook,</hi> and <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and had Meetings at all theſe Places. Then to <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> I was at a Yearly-meeting, as they call'd it, at <hi>New-town</hi> on the firſt Day of the Week; it was very large of both Friends and other People. There I found ſundry of my former Friends, as <hi>John Rodman, Hugh Copperthwaite, Samuel Bowne,</hi> and ſundry others, that had been of great Comfort and Support to me in my Impriſonment on that Iſland, and we were truly glad to ſee and enjoy each other in the Truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thence I took my Journey through <hi>Connecticut,</hi> near two Hundred Miles, to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and I went round from <hi>Newport,</hi> viſiting the Meetings, as at <hi>Seconnet, Cockſet, Dartmouth,</hi> and back to the Iſland, and ſo to the Quarterly-meeting at <hi>Newport,</hi> which was very large and continued three Days.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:008308_0180_102E890B9D6FE768"/>
I was largely drawn forth to the Elders and Miniſters, there being pretty many of them, and had very good Satisfaction in all their Meetings. Thence back to a Monthly-meeting at <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> which was very large; but a Narrowneſs of Spirit did ſome Hurt amongſt them, and produced ſome Uneaſineſs, which I endeavoured to remove, which was chiefly occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by a young Man's being, as ſome thought, too much in the Faſhion, although plain, compared with ſome others; yet ſome thought this Reaſon ſufficient to refuſe his Propoſal of Marriage among them, although well recommended from the Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting where he was a Member; upon which I ſhewed them, that as he was ſo well recommended by Certificate, they could not reject his Propoſal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Diſcipline. The Meeting, after we had ſome farther Conference about it, let the young People proceed, and Matters grew eaſy, and that Cloud of Difference diſperſed and vaniſhed, which was like to hurt both Monthly-meetings.</p>
               <p>From thence I went about five Miles to one <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Ruſſell</hi>'s, in order to take ſhipping for the Iſland of <hi>Nantucket.</hi> We met with ſome Difficulty in the Paſſage, and were obliged to put into the Iſland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Martha</hi>'s <hi>Vineyard,</hi> but had no Meeting in it. After landing on <hi>Nantucket</hi> on the ſixth Day of the Week, Notice being given, the next Day we had a very large Meeting in the Forenoon, and on <hi>Firſt-day</hi> it was much greater, eſpecially in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the Inhabitants generally inclining to Friends, there was great Love and Unity amongſt them. I deſired a ſelect Meeting of the Elders, to whom I

Thus expounding and illuſtrating the Doctrine of the Light, the People who were but a few, ſeemed much affected therewith, I had alſo in my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that Day laid down, the Kingdom of God or of Heaven to be <hi>within,</hi> and that it was equally <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> with the Light; but at that he cavilled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but made Nothing of it, for I had it upon me to open and ſet forth what the Kingdom in this

Place meant, and how it ought to be underſtood, plainly ſhewing, that by the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> was meant the <hi>divine Seed</hi> in the Heart, otherwiſe called the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> which, as every one makes the Rule of their Actions, in both a moral and religious Conduct, it teaches us our Duty to God and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, by which we are brought under the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nment of Chriſt, and thereby made Partakers of that Peace within, which may be juſtly term'd the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven within.</hi> So the Objections thus made by this forward Man, though weak and impertinent, gave Opportunity to explain the Doctrine of the Goſpel more clearly, ſo that altho' ſuch Objectors ſeldom intend any Good, yet Good often comes out of their Objections.</p>
               <p>From thence I travelled to <hi>Sandwich, Yarmouth, Scituate,</hi> and then to a Meeting where <hi>Michael Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> lived, and ſo for <hi>Boſton,</hi> viſiting the Meetings to <hi>Lynn, Marblehead</hi> and <hi>Salem;</hi> but nothing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at any of theſe Meetings worthy of Note.

up in his Trade, did endeavour to ingratiate himſelf this Way into the Minds of the People, but he loſt Ground by it greatly, ſo that as he could make No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it but Noiſe and Tumult, we parted; and I was told, that ſome of his own People blamed him much, for the Interruption he gave me, and for endeavouring to hinder the People from coming to hear for themſelves.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to <hi>Aimſbury, Hampton,</hi> &amp;c. it was <hi>Hampton</hi> Monthly-meeting, which held but one Day. I was concerned to ſtir up Friends to keep a faithful Record of all their Sufferings, to be made Uſe of as Occaſion might require, the Prieſts Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers making Spoil of Friends Goods to ſupport their own falſe Miniſtry, with which ſome People were ſo uneaſy and oppreſs'd, that Complaints in almoſt every Townſhip appeared againſt them.</p>
               <p>From thence I came to <hi>Dover,</hi> it was their Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting likewiſe: They were very raw, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged their Affairs but indifferently, chiefly occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of ſome better Hands to write and keep their Books in Order. I was likewiſe concerned here to put them upon recording their Sufferings, and in a Way how to do it; for they were Sufferers not only on Account of the hireling Preachers, to maintain them in their Pride and Idleneſs, but alſo on the Account of bearing Arms, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe pretty heavy upon them in ſome Towns; but then in others their Neighbours were moderate, and made not much ado about them: But ſome did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

very clearly, that they were wrong, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and for themſelves. We had a fine agreeable Time in Conference, and there appeared both great Sincerity and Innocency amongſt them; I was at their <hi>Firſt-day</hi> Meeting, which was very large, and to great Satisfaction. After Meeting, finding that ſome Miſunderſtanding was amongſt them about the Building of a Meeting-houſe, we got them together, (my dear Friend <hi>Nathaniel Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck</hi> from <hi>Nantucket</hi> being ſtill with me) and we endeavoured and perſuaded them to Peace and Love, in which we were ſucceſsful: We appointed a Meeting to be held there, which was attended by all, or the greateſt Part of Friends of that Monthly-meeting, and a fine comfortable Opportunity we had, and they ſeemed all very eaſy and reconciled one to another.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to <hi>Strawberry-bank,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> but it proved an unſuitable Time, becauſe all the Country was come together, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Part eſpecially, with all their Arms and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements of War, to proclaim King GEORGE the <hi>Second,</hi> (News being come three Weeks before, that his Father died on his Way to <hi>Hanover</hi>) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on Account of the Peace that was concluded with the <hi>Indians:</hi> However, notwithſtanding the vaſt Crowd and Hurry, we had a very quiet, though but ſmall Meeting; and Notice being whiſpered, that there was to be a Marriage at <hi>Dover</hi> on a Day appointed, many in Curioſity came to it, and the People ſeemed much pleaſed with our Way of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, few of them having been at any before. All
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:008308_0186_102E891D5C160870"/>
ended quiet, without any Diſpute. Then we had another Meeting at the new Meeting-houſe, after which I found a Concern to deſire an Opportunity with the Miniſters and Elders, which was very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted; and I was much concerned to requeſt and adviſe both the Miniſters and Elders, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep in the Unity of the Spirit amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they might be good Examples to the Flock, over which they were to watch, and to be ready and willing to adminiſter good Counſel, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>feeding of the Flock;</hi> and this he recommends to the Elders as their Buſineſs: And that the Miniſters look well to their Gifts, carefully avoiding either to abridge or enlarge in their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry beyond the true Opening of Life in themſelves, labouring with Diligence and Humility to evince the Truth of their Words by their own Conduct, that no Blemiſh or Spot might appear amongſt them, nor any juſt Ground to reproach them with teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others what they did not practiſe themſelves, being careful in Conduct, that their Words and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be agreeable; this would give Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to their Miniſtry, and attract Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from their Hearers.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to viſit the Widow <hi>Hanſon,</hi> who had been taken into Captivity by the <hi>Indians,</hi> an Account of which I took from her own Mouth, being in Subſtance as followeth: <q>Eleven naked <hi>Indians</hi> came with Violence upon the Family, and killed two of the Children juſt as they entred the Houſe; two little Boys more being at Play behind the Houſe, when they heard the Noiſe, came
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:008308_0187_102E892009E99518"/>
running in great Surprize, the younger of whom could not be prevailed with to moderate his Grief, whereupon one of the <hi>Indians</hi> with a <hi>Tomhawk</hi> (a little Hatchet) ſtruck him on the Head and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the poor Child, to rid themſelves of the Noiſe, and to prevent their being diſcovered, and to ſtrike the greater Terror upon thoſe in the Houſe. Then they rifled the Houſe of what they thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to carry away. They took the poor Woman, who had lain in but two Weeks, along with them by Force and Violence, with her little Infant, and two Daughters, one Son, and a Servant Maid; it being in the Afternoon, the <hi>Indians</hi> were in a great Hurry to force them away as far as they could that Night, for fear of being purſued, and the Priſoners retaken. Thus they travelled for twenty Days, paſſing through many Lakes and Rivers; notwithſtanding which they took no Cold, but their Health was preſerved.</q> The incredible and ſevere Trials the poor Woman and her Children went through, during their Captivity, I cannot here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the full, in all which they were remarkably favour'd by Providence, induring hard Labour, though they were drove to very great Straits for want of Proviſions, being neceſſiated to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After my Return to <hi>Europe,</hi> I ſaw at <hi>Dublin</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this extraordinary Affair in a printed Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, which was brought over by a Friend from <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now being eaſy to leave theſe Parts for the preſent, I returned towards <hi>Hampton,</hi> but in the Way had a
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:008308_0188_102E78BA9C05C848"/>

               <p>Then I returned to <hi>Lynn,</hi> where was a Yearly-meeting, which was very large, and I had good Service in it. Then to <hi>Salem,</hi> it being their Yearly-meeting for Worſhip, and Quarterly-meeting for Diſcipline, which was exceeding large; they had a Meeting of Miniſters and Elders, in which I was much enlarged in Advice to both: Then came on the Quarterly-meeting, in which for want of better Writers and Method, they were ſomewhat deficient in their Buſineſs, whereby it became tedious to themſelves; I endeavoured to put them in a better Method, which they took very kindly and well: And after this was ended, a Parting-meeting of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip came on, which was very large, and was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by abundance of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: I was very much drawn forth into various Branches of Doctrine, and the Meeting ended well; no Cavil or Diſpute ariſing, which they are but too liable to. I was informed, that what I had deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was taken down in Writing, but I never ſaw it tho' a Friend afterwards had a Sight of it, and the Writer ſaid, he did it with a View to have it printed by Subſcription, and get ſomething by it.</p>
               <p>Not finding myſelf clear, I returned back with Friends to <hi>Haverill,</hi> and next Day had a comfortable little Meeting: Thence to <hi>Hampton</hi> and <hi>Dover,</hi> it was Yearly-meeting there: They having in almoſt
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:008308_0189_102E89236D9B27D8"/>
every Place once a Year a General-meeting, which they call a Yearly-meeting, and by this popular Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle abundance more People come together, in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſomething extraordinary there to be met with; it held two Days, and was to very good Content. Next Day, I had a Meeting on <hi>Kittery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> in an old Meeting-houſe that the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> had erected, but not being in ſo convenient a Place for them, they had leſt it. Many, both Friends and others came, and before it was quite gathered, the Prieſt with a large Company came in, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately began to pray, continuing a long Time: But as ſoon as he had done, I ſpoke to the People with, ſome Authority, which ſeem'd to daunt the Prieſt, who it was thought intended to have taken up all the Time himſelf, and to have put us by; if he had ſucceeded, they would have gloried and triumph'd much, but therein they were diſappointed. In the Courſe of my Miniſtry, I inſiſted on the Danger of <hi>neglecting</hi> the Work of our Salvation, ſpeaking cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, that ſuch an <hi>Omiſſion</hi> might be irreparable. The Prieſt replying, ſaid, that ſhould be expreſs'd, <hi>will be irreparable.</hi> I deſired him not to diſturb us, for we did not him; and repeating my Words over again, with this Addition, I dare not ſpeak <hi>concluſively</hi> of the Mercy of God, who is able by Chriſt to ſave us at the <hi>Hour of Death.</hi> After this he was ſilent, only writing when he thought he had any Room to cavil, but he was ſoon weary, for I was very ſtrong both in Power and Doctrine, and great Tenderneſs was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, which was ſtrange to him, and Scripture came very apt to confirm my Doctrine;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:008308_0190_102E892882BE6098"/>
the Prieſt growing weary would ſtay no longer, but walked off, inviting the People to go with him, but very few went. We had a very good ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opportunity, the Meeting ended very quiet and well.</p>
               <p>Next Day I went to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> having been there before at an improper Time, but now we had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Meeting; then I was at the new Meeting-houſe, about which they had had ſome Uneaſineſs; we had a Meeting to very good Satisfaction, and Friends appeared well reconciled. Then I went once more to viſit the Widow <hi>Hanſon</hi> at <hi>Knox march,</hi> that had, as before, been taken Captive. From thence to <hi>Stratham,</hi> having had a Meeting there two or three Weeks before, and the People were then very much affected: But the Prieſt hearing of it, was very uneaſy, and went amongſt his Hearers, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and praying them not to converſe with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if they could avoid it, ſo that we had but few that came, amongſt whom was a Man in Drink, that did cavil, and would pretend to a Diſputation, but he was ſo much in Liquor that he rambled in his Diſcourſe, and know not what he ſaid; he went away in a Rage, curſing as he went along. Thence I came to <hi>Hampton,</hi> and <hi>Aimſbury,</hi> and had Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at both Places. Thence to <hi>Newbury</hi> and had a Meeting, to which the Prieſt was again invited, but he did not come near us. Next Day I was at their Monthly-meeting, which was but dull. Next Day I was up in the Woods, at a new Place, where there were many People, and we had a good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Next Day I was at a Marriage, which was

I told her, I would not treat her as a Diſputant, in an adverſe Temper, but as a Siſter and Friend in the ſame Faith in Degree: But ſhe complained much of the Bondage of her Education, and lamented her Caſe.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where was no Meeting ſettled, nor any Friend in that Place; the Prieſts did all that in them lay to hinder the People from coming to hear Friends, when any came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, if they knew it; however, we had a good Opportunity. Thence to the Meeting in that great Houſe, not far from <hi>Seth Aldrich</hi>'s, which was a fine full and comfortable Meeting. Then to the Upper Meeting-houſe, and ſo to <hi>Moſhantatuck,</hi> and to <hi>Warwick,</hi> and had Meetings in thoſe Places. I was deſired to ſtay to attend a Diſpute. One <hi>Hugh Adams,</hi> a Prieſt, had challenged Friends, he having undertaken to prove <hi>Infant-ſprinkling</hi> from Scripture, to be an Ordinance of Chriſt. But in the Proof he came off very lamely, <hi>Samuel Aldrich,</hi> an excellent and ingenious Diſputant, was by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to manage the Argument on Friends Side, and none elſe: But ſuch Arguments the Prieſt
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:008308_0193_102E892E69633700"/>
brought for their <hi>Sprinkling</hi> as were entirely new to the Audience; one was, the <hi>Spray</hi> of the Red Sea, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went through it, by the ſtrength of the Wind <hi>ſprinkling</hi> the Children, <hi>viz.</hi> Infants, as well as old People; and as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaid, <hi>They were all baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</hi> This was full Proof of me Point for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-ſprinkling,</hi> he ſaid. But <hi>Samuel</hi> made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſhort Diſcourſe on the Text, very much to the Purpoſe, and he had ſo much the Aſcendant in the Argument on every Branch, that the Prieſt loſt Ground, and ſeveral of his Brethren being there were much aſhamed of him.</p>
               <p>Then I returned back to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Coakſet</hi> Yearly-meeting, which was very large; and then to <hi>Dartmouth</hi> Yearly-meeting, which was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very large, and that Evening was a Meeting of Miniſters, wherein I had much to ſay on ſundry Heads proper to them: And next Day being the Yearly-meeting, it was very large, as before, there being a great Reſort of People many Miles round. It held three Days, and ended to the Satisfaction of moſt. This Evening, as I was going to Bed, about ten at Night, there was an exceeding great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, that made a Noiſe like the driving of Carts or Waggons on an uneven Cauſeway; it continued about two Minutes, to the great Surprize of the People. It was felt about fifteen hundred Miles, as was after computed, and as was thought by Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, was not quite three Hours in going that Space.</p>
               <p>From thence I went into the Iſland; and took my laſt Farewell of my Friends in that Part of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:008308_0194_102E8931250668A8"/>
the Country, having made a thorough Viſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. The Weather by this Time grew very cold, it being the Beginning of the <hi>Ninth Month;</hi> however, I proceeded to <hi>Connecticut, James-town, Kings-town,</hi> and to <hi>Greenwich</hi> Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting. From thence <hi>Seth Aldrich, John Caſey, John Earle,</hi> and <hi>Peleg Spencer,</hi> accompanied me, and we travelled into the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Country; and firſt, at a Town called <hi>Preſton,</hi> we had a ſmall Meeting, and hearing of a Funeral about three Miles off, we went thither; the People (who, as we apprehended were <hi>Baptiſts</hi>) ſeemed much ſurprized, and our not joining a young Man who prayed amongſt them, made them look more ſhyly on us; the poor Man ſeemed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: But when he had done, we had a fine Opportunity to good Satisfaction. Then we took our Journey towards <hi>New-London,</hi> and on the Way had a ſmall Opportunity amongſt ſome <hi>Preſbyterians;</hi> ſuch of them who were bigotted that Way, were hard to ſpeak to about the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Work,</hi> they could not receive it. Thence to <hi>New-London</hi> on <hi>Groton</hi> Side, to one <hi>James Smith</hi>'s who was one of <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Kind of <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> but his Wife was convinced, and they were under great Perſecution by the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> both in Body and Goods. I had a Meeting at <hi>John Rogers</hi>'s on <hi>New-London</hi> Side, and he objected againſt the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality</hi> of the Light that ſaves, and about Baptiſm; he had much to ſay for the Continuance of Water-Baptiſm, but at the ſame Time would allow, that there was <hi>no real ſpiritual Benefit</hi> in it at all; and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:008308_0195_102E8936271D7168"/>
he aſſerted, that that Light which condemns for Evil, was but the Tree of Knowledge and <hi>not ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> but Chriſt's Light which ſaves, was <hi>another Thing;</hi> endeavouring hereby to divide between the Light that <hi>condemns,</hi> and that which <hi>ſaves,</hi> making them two different Principles from each other. I took the Bible, and turning to the firſt of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, ſhewed him, that the Light there ſpoken of, as the Divinity of Chriſt the Saviour of the World, was the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that <hi>condemned</hi> the Diſobedient, and <hi>juſtified</hi> the Righteous; the Principle was not divided in itſelf, nor was it two Principles, but one and the ſame in all: And though the Operation of this one Light differed, that Difference, it was plain, was not in the Light itſelf, but in the different Object on which it did operate; as for Example, the ſame Heat of the Sun that <hi>ſoftens</hi> Wax, will <hi>harden</hi> Clay; but this argues not two different Qualities in the Heat of the Sun, though the Effect of its Heat is different on Wax and Clay: By which (although this, or but few Allegories will hold throughout) the People ſaw, that his <hi>Notion</hi> of two different Lights, one <hi>ſaving,</hi> the other <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,</hi> had no Foundation in the Text. Then as to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> he divided the Inſtitution into three Parts; <hi>firſt,</hi> from <hi>John; ſecondly,</hi> from the Apoſtles <hi>practiſing</hi> it; and <hi>thirdly,</hi> from <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 19. But I told him, as he had already allowed that there was no real ſpiritual Advantage in outward Water-Baptiſm, his imaginary Diviſion of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution fell of courſe; for 'twas againſt Reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:008308_0196_102E8937AC9237A0"/>
any Thing <hi>ordained</hi> or <hi>inſtituted</hi> by Chriſt, to be uſed in his Church by Believers, could be of no <hi>real Service;</hi> but thou alloweſt that Baptiſm with Water is of no <hi>real Service</hi> therefore it's <hi>no Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Chriſt: But to conclude this Head, we may comparatively with the Apoſtle ſay, That it's not the <hi>outward</hi> Part of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> will do any good to Believers, but in reality he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that is one <hi>inwardly:</hi> And Baptiſm is that of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and not that of the <hi>Letter,</hi> that is really <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable</hi> and <hi>ſaving.</hi> Thus we ended this Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but he was full of Words, and confuſed in his Notions.</p>
               <p>I had then another Meeting at <hi>Groton,</hi> though but ſmall; after that we had an Evening-meeting at one <hi>John Wood</hi>'s, which was the beſt we had amongſt that People, where ſome Objections were made againſt <hi>publick Prayer</hi> but their Objections were ſoon removed. And afterwards at <hi>Colcheſter</hi> and <hi>Hebron</hi> we had ſome good Meetings amongſt the People, tho' it was very difficult to get a Place to meet in at the former: But a Man of Reſolution offered a Place, and there being a Town-meeting that Day, we had a large Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who were very ſober, no Cavilling or Diſputes in the leaſt. Then we came to <hi>Sea-brook</hi> and <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſworth,</hi> and had Meetings amongſt a People who had ſeparated themſelves from the <hi>Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and inclined to the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and were gett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a lifeleſs Form of ſinging, and expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own Way and carnal Manner, which was likely to be a Snare to their Hurt: We ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:008308_0197_102F6D8340834578"/>
another Meeting amongſt them, which was but ſmall, all my Friends ſave <hi>John Caſey</hi> and <hi>John Earle</hi> having left me. We now ſet out for <hi>New-York,</hi> but had no Meeting till we came to <hi>Rye,</hi> which was about 81 Miles. I was glad and comforted to be amongſt our Friends again, having been ſo long from them, they being much more agreeable to me than other People. From thence I went to <hi>Marrineck,</hi> and over the Ferry to <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> and it being their Quarterly-meeting, which held three Days, the Meeting of Miniſters and Elders was of good Service, among them were ſome young Miniſters; at this Quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had a ſolid Time, a large Appearance of young Friends of both Sexes being there. After this Meeting I went with <hi>Joſhua Fielding</hi> a little on his Way to the Eaſtward; and on returning, I went to viſit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From thence I viſited <hi>Weſtbury</hi> on the Plain: Thence to <hi>Sequatogue, Huntington,</hi> and <hi>Oyſter-bay,</hi> and had good and very full Meetings. Thence to <hi>Mantinicock,</hi> and to <hi>Hempſtead,</hi> where I had but middling Times, tho' very large Meetings: I was

From thence to <hi>Hemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the Place where I had been ſo long a Priſoner twenty Years before, and had Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at both Places, but the latter was very ſmall for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thence to <hi>Freehold,</hi> and had a Meeting in the Court-houſe to good Purpoſe; although the People were of an ignorant Sort, who made no Profeſſion at all of any Religion, yet ſome of them were very well pleaſed with that Opportunity.

and Elders, (for there were there the greateſt Part of the Miniſters in the Province, and ſeveral from <hi>Jerſey</hi> Side) it was the biggeſt Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters I ever was at in thoſe Parts, the Time of the Year conſider'd, and I was very much enlarged in Counſel and Advice to them, being never ſo opened on ſundry Heads before; and in the Meeting of Buſineſs I was drawn forth to ſhew the Qualifications of a right and true Elder, and the Excellency of right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church, which muſt firſt be known in our own Minds; for ſuch who have not the Government of their own Spirits, are not fit to undertake the Government of others. And after this I had a Meeting at <hi>Middle-Town,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Providence</hi> General Meeting, but I had very little to ſay in either of theſe laſt Meetings. Thence to <hi>Darby,</hi> and had a ſmall Meeting, and ſo to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and had a brave Meeting, inſomuch that I was fill'd with Admiration at ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a Supply of new Doctrine every Day, which gave me great Cauſe to be more and more humble; and when ſome Friends would ſpeak in Favour of ſuch an Opportunity, or Branch of Doctrine, it would give me a Shock, leſt by any of theſe unwary Commendations, I ſhould take to myſelf that Honour which was due to the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> and ſo fall into a Robbery unawares.</p>
               <p>From thence I went to <hi>Plymouth, North-Wales, Buckingham, Wright's-Town,</hi> the <hi>Falls, Neſhaminy,</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and had ſatisfactory Opportunities tho'

                  </gap>d the Firſt-day Meeting, which was very large and ſerviceable; it was the Quarterly-meeting Time, and the Meeting of Miniſters and Elders, and I having had ſuch remarkable Times among the Miniſters occaſion'd theſe Meetings to be very large: At this Meeting I was divinely opened with freſh Matter, ſetting forth the Service of a divine, ſpiritual Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which was free from all Contrivance and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt of the Creature, in preparing itſelf, either with former Openings, or beautiful Collections of Texts, or Sayings from Books or Writings, all which Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings would bring Death, and could be no other in the beſt and moſt favourable Conſtruction, though well look'd on by ſome, than the Miniſtry of the <hi>Letter,</hi> under Pretence of the Miniſtry of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which is a Deception of the higheſt Nature.</p>
               <p>Then I came into <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to <hi>Wright's-Town,</hi> was at their Meeting of Miniſters, and had a very agreeable Time with them, wherein was ſhewn the Danger of Murmuring at the ſeeming Weakneſs of our Gifts to a Degree of Dejection, and Neglect to exerciſe ourſelves in them, ſhewing that every Gift of the Miniſtry was of great Service, though but ſmall in compariſon of others, and had a great Beauty in it, and that we ought by no means to flight and neglect it, but to think well, and be thankful that the Father of Spirits hath given us a Gift, though but ſmall. And on the other hand,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:008308_0203_102F6C0029D3B7C8"/>
to exhort ſuch as had a more elegant Miniſtry, not to overvalue themſelves upon their Gifts, but in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and with thankful Hearts render the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Praiſe where due, not looking with an Eye of Contempt on their ſuppoſed inferior Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters, but in Love preferring each other to themſelves, more eſpecially conſidering, that mean and plain Diet, handled by Perſons who have clean Hands, and clean Garments, though but mean to look at, yet the Cleanneſs of their Hands and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as alſo the Diet, though plain, put in decent Order renders what they have to offer very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and acceptable to the Hungry, and for others we need not be ſo careful. A Friend pleaſantly ſaid after Meeting, at his Table, <hi>I might freely eat, his Wife was a cleanly Houſe-wife,</hi> being willing to improve the Simile, to her Advantage, ſhe having ſomething to ſay, tho' but little, as a Miniſter, and her Huſband thought ſhe did not give way to her Gift as ſhe ought. The next Day was Quarterly-meeting in the ſame Place, which was pretty large, and I was drawn forth to ſet the Degrees of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as well as their different Services, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Light, under the Similitude of the various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments made Uſe of in the erecting of a Building, and that every Inſtrument or Tool had its Service, when uſed as Occaſion required, and every Builder to uſe them at a proper Time, and not otherwiſe.

I had it also to caution the Miniſters, in their Travels not to be hard to pleaſe with their Entertainment, but to ſhew themſelves eaſy and contented with ſuch as poor Friends could let them have, and to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt carrying Stories and Tales from one Place to another; and as ſoon as their Service was done, to retire Home again; for ſome, be ſtaying too long after their Service was ended, had much hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and been an Uneaſineſs to the Church. I had likewiſe to caution againſt appearing too often or too long in our own Meetings, but that Miniſters ſhould wait in their Gifts for the Spirit to put them forth; that they carefully mind their Openings, and not go beyond Bounds, for if we do, we ſhall loſe our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Minds of Friends, and our Service will be loſt; always guarding againſt ſeeking after Praiſe, or ſaying any Thing in Commendation of our own Doings, neither to be uneaſy when we have Nothing to ſay; as likewiſe to take Care at ſuch la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhew the Difference between the true and falſe Church, ſetting them Side by Side, that they might judge for themſelves. I ſtaid all that Week in Town, the Meeting not ending till <hi>Forth-day.</hi> I was at the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Third-day's</hi> Meetings following, and ſo took my Leave.</p>
               <p>From thence I came to <hi>Darby, Springfield, Merion, Cheſter, Chicheſtar, Chriſteen,</hi> and <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and had tolerable good Meetings: Friends being acquainted that I was now taking my Leave of the Country-Meetings were very large, and ſeveral of them to good Satisfaction, much Openneſs and Brokenneſs appearing amongſt Friends. Thence to <hi>George's-Creek, Duck-Creek, Motherkill, Hoarkills, Cold-Spring,</hi> and ſo back to <hi>Motherkill</hi> and <hi>Duck-Creek;</hi> had pretty good Satisfaction in theſe Meetings: The Friends in theſe Parts were but ſeldom viſited, and but very few public amongſt them. The Prieſts, both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> attempted to do ſomething, but the People being poor, and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſmall, they gave out for want of Pay.</p>
               <p>From thence to <hi>Cheſter</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> it was a Half-yearly-meeting, but the Weather being very unſeaſonable, made it but ſmall; it continued two Days, and the laſt Meeting was both largeſt and beſt.

I viſited a young Man in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, a pretty Miniſter, but in a declining Way; we had a comfortable Time with him, he being in a good Frame of Mind, fit to die.

Scarcity of the Proviſion both for Man and Horſe, and the great and thick Snow, with the Extremity of the Froſt, render'd that Journey hazzardous, if not impracticable, and to ſtay till the Winter broke up, I could not ſee it my Place; beſides which, by ſtaying ſo long I ſhould have loſt my Paſſage by the homeward-bound Ships, otherways I ſhould have been willing to have taken thoſe Meetings, if I could have ſaved my Paſſage, and accompliſhed it ſo as I might waſte no Time, but go on diligently as I had done before, for there were but very few of their Meetings but that I viſited two, three, and ſundry of them four, five, or ſix Times, ſeveral of them being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Now to return: In our Voyage, about 250 Leagues from Land as we thought, the Water ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a River after a haſty Storm of Thunder; on ſeeing it thus, our People were under Surprize, and in that Surprize tried with the Lead for Ground, but could find none; it was ſo uncommon a Thing, that the Sailors could not tell what to think of it:

great a Loſs of Water and freſh Proviſion, Things of Value, next to Life itſelf: All theſe Loſſes put together were Cauſe of Trouble, but by griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we could not help ourſelves, therefore we could with the Pſalmiſt, in ſomething of the like Nature, ſay, ſuch Trials put People to <hi>their Wits End;</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm cvii. 27.</note> howbeit, in turning the Mind to that divine Power and Providence which is preſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, ruling both by Sea and Land, and whom the Winds obey, I found Comfort in meditating on his Promiſes to care for thoſe who put their Truſt in him.</p>
               <p>Now our Men, who were all preſerved from any other Damage, ſaving the taking of Cold, which we all felt the Effect of to a great Degree, went about putting the Rigging to rights again, which took up a full Week before we could make Sail, the Wind blowing ſtrong and variable; and when they had got Things in a good Condition the Wind was againſt us for ſeveral Days, which made us thoughtful to take Care of what Water and Proviſion we had, that we might not be ſurprized with Want, when we had no Power to arm againſt it. The Men were all call'd up to hear a Propoſal, which was thus; Three Pints of Water a Man for twenty-four Hours, and five Pounds of Bread for a Man a Week, having other Proviſions, both freſh and ſalt, a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Stock, to the full Allowance. At this there was Uneaſineſs; but this Allowance would hold by our Calculation but for about four Weeks, ſo that

if we ſaw not ſome Hopes of getting in, in two Weeks, we muſt come to leſs Allowance again.</p>
               <p>The Wind continued ſtill againſt us till the 7th of the <hi>Seventh-Month,</hi> and then veered a little to the Southward, and we apprehending ourſelves to be too much to the North, were not willing if we could avoid it, to put into <hi>Ireland:</hi> But in about three Days after this we had a brave Wind, which laſted for ſome Days, and it gave us Hopes of ſeeing Land, which we much longed for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing threatned with Want of Proviſion, of both Bread and Water, but not Fleſh, if Providence did not interpoſe: Our Hearts were chearful, and Gladneſs appeared in every Countenance, but alas! it was but a ſhort-liv'd Joy, for in the Forenoon on the 13th the Wind ſcanted upon us again, and about five in the Afternoon we ſounded, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Ground, but found none; this made us all look pale, and Sadneſs of Heart appeared in every Countenance; beſides, our Ship being a dull Sailer, added ſomewhat to our Trouble, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we were farther from Land than we thought by our Reckoning, and the greateſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we had, was a good Ship under us, though a heavy Sailer, therefore we cheered each other with the Hope of gaining our Port in due Time with Safety and Comfort: And this I moralized to myſelf, by conſidering the Reſemblance of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Progreſs through this Life, ſometimes in a Degree of Proſperity, being under Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to preſs forward with a fair Wind, and anon

               <p>In two Days more we ſounded; and found Ground at eighty-two Fathom, judging ourſelves from the <hi>Lizard</hi> ſixty Leagues; but alas! the Wind veered and blew ſeven Days ſtrong againſt us, ſo that we were driven from Land, as we thought, a Hundred Leagues. This made us talk of ſhortening our Allowance again, but that Night about twelve o'Clock the Wind veered in our Favour, and the Sailors cried, <hi>A large Wind, a large Allowance;</hi> Nothing being more diſagreeable in its kind than a large Wind and ſhort Allowance. And the Wind being fair, we went on with Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and upon the Credit of this fair Wind ſome of the Men had not a Morſel of Bread left by Night, nor a Spoonful of Water, and had near thirty-ſix Hours of their Week to come: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we went along ſo agreeably, that every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy look'd pleaſant, and it was comely to behold; but alas! this laſted but about ſixteen Hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came right in our Teeth again, and blew very ſtrong. Such Ups and Downs we had, that the Sailors grew very uneaſy, and did curſe and ſwear, nay did not ſtick to blaſpheme in ſuch a Way, as made it very uneaſy, and unpleaſant to hear; but this did not laſt long before it was calm, and the Wind came up fair again, and we ſpeaking with a Ship outward bound, they gave us new Heart, by adviſing us that <hi>Scilly</hi> bore from us North-Eaſt about twenty-two Leagues Diſtance.

ſtrong and fair; then we found we ſtem'd the Tide and got a little forward, and when the Ebb was ſpent, the Flood with the Wind came in very ſtrong, though a Neap-tide, ſo that we raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Land very faſt, and about two in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon came a-breaſt the <hi>Eddiſtone,</hi> about a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot from it, and had a full View thereof, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with Pleaſure. In about a Quarter of an Hour after this, Pilots came off, ſeveral Ships wanting ſafe Conduct, and about nine we got ſafe to an Anchor, juſt by the Paſſage againſt <hi>Edgcombe</hi> Houſe, and on the 30th I landed at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and ſtaid in Town that Day, and was very thankful I was ſafe on Shore again, having been juſt nine Weeks on our Paſſage, and the laſt five of it was a very trying and afflicting Time, but the four firſt were very pleaſant and comfortable.</p>
               <p>Being now on Shore amongſt my Friends, I took Horſe the 1ſt of the <hi>Eighth-Month,</hi> and came to <hi>Exeter</hi> that Night. Next Morning, being the 2d of the Month and fourth Day of the Week, I came Home, and as I entered my own Houſe, oh! the inward Comfort and Pleaſure which I felt, raviſh'd my Heart, that I could ſcarce forbear to cry out, <hi>God! that God who judgeth Men, is juſt in all his Ways, and rewardeth Peace into the Boſoms of thoſe who fear and obey him.</hi> And being by all my Family and Friends kindly receiv'd, made my Return exceedingly delightful.</p>
               <p>In about twenty-two Months and odd Days I finiſhed this Journey, from the 22d of the <hi>Tenth-Month</hi> 1726, to the 2d of the <hi>Eighth-Month</hi>

1728, and in that Time I travelled by Land and over Rivers about five Thouſand three Hundred and twenty-two Miles, beſides paſſing and repaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Ocean; and as I had been out of that Country ſomewhat more than twenty-one Years, and found ſo great an Increaſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Truth, I had a Curioſity to examine a little into it, finding moſt of the old Meeting-houſes very much enlarged, ſome to hold double, and ſome treble, and ſome four Times the People that the old ones would in my firſt going thither, and even now ſome wanted to be either enlarged, or new ones built at proper Diſtances; beſides the Account of new Houſes built in that Time, in Places where were none, nor Meetings but what were kept in private Houſes, which grew ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that Neceſſity put them upon erecting Houſes to accommodate themſelves. In <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> are twelve: In the Government of <hi>New-York</hi> are ſix: In both <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Jerſey</hi> are nine: In <hi>Pennſylvania:</hi> thirteen: In <hi>Maryland</hi> four: In <hi>Virginia</hi> nine; and in <hi>North-Carolina</hi> three. In all, there have been fifty-ſix new Meeting-houſes built within theſe two or three-and-twenty Years paſt, and in theſe Provinces there are about ten Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more that want where they have none, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny old ones want to be enlarged, not having Room for Half the People. Now the extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Profeſſors is much to be attributed to the Youth retaining the Profeſſion of their Parents, and marrying ſuch: For chief part of the People in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> are of this Profeſſion, as well as in the

commending what he had heard more than I approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, wanting to know, whether I had not ſtudied that Sermon (as he called it) before I came there: My Anſwer to it was, <hi>I knew not when I came there, whether I ſhould have any I being to ſay or not, ſo far I was from having any Thing provided beforehand:</hi> He ſaid it was a very good Sermon, and very ſuitable for them who heard it. He was very loving, and ſo we parted.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Roſcombe</hi> I came to <hi>Long-Sutton,</hi> and had a ſmall Meeting; thence to <hi>Sherborne</hi> Meeting, the ſmalleſt I ever was at, or had in that Place, and to but little Satisfaction; the Smallneſs of the Number was much owing to the want of Notice to the Town's People; from thence to a Funeral at <hi>Yeovill,</hi> of an antient Woman of ninety-five and upwards; a large Company of Neighbours attended the Corps, and we had a good Time, the People being very ſerious, and ſeemed edified with what was ſpoken; from thence I came Home, it being the 16th of the <hi>Twelfth-Month</hi> 1747.</p>
               <p>I ſtaid at Home, and viſited the neighbouring Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings until the 2d of the <hi>Third-Month</hi> 1748, and then went towards <hi>Briſtol</hi> Yearly-meeting, but had no Meeting till I came there, except the Monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the North Diviſion of the County of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and though it was very ſmall, the Affairs thereof were conducted with Prudence and Judgment; thence to <hi>Briſtol</hi> Yearly-meeting, which was to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Briſtol</hi> I went to <hi>Bath,</hi> and had a ſmall Meeting, and ſo to <hi>Pickwick;</hi> I had a ſmall Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="235" facs="unknown:008308_0242_102F6CF660E37EA0"/>
Zeal to keep up the Teſtimony their Parents joyfully ſuffered for: We had ſeveral acceptable and edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Times, and the Affairs of the Meeting were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted in great Love and Condeſcenſion, and ended well; the laſt or concluding Meeting was very large, and the only one I had a particular Concern for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I left Home, but I was almoſt ſhut out, being ſo narrowed up for Time by thoſe who appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, that it ſeemed quite unſeaſonable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to hold the Meeting longer, and not like to comport with the Health of the People: but yet my Age and Infirmity conſidered, and it appearing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether I might have the like Opportunity, and being preſs'd in Spirit thereto, I ſtood up under great Fear and Weakneſs; but I was immediately ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the good Word of Life, through which I was helped, and came off beyond my Expectations, being afterwards filled with divine Peace and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which confirmed me that I was in my Place and Duty.</p>
               <p>I ſtaid in <hi>London</hi> over <hi>Firſt-day,</hi> but had no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in public Miniſtry, except at the Morning-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miniſters on <hi>Second-day,</hi> where I was very much drawn forth to the Miniſters, the Meeting being very large with Country Friends, and I was much comforted in that Meeting. Next Morning I went, with my worthy Friend <hi>Samuel Waring,</hi> by <hi>Eſher</hi> to <hi>Alton,</hi> and ſtaid their <hi>Firſt-day</hi> Meeting, and had a Meeting at <hi>Great-Fraile,</hi> and ſtaid the Monthly-meeting at <hi>Alton,</hi> which was comfortable and well, tho' not much Appearance of Service: From thence I went to <hi>Rumſey,</hi> but was taken very ill on the Road,

and was very much fatigued, but next Day was bravely recovered, and had a ſmall Meeting with the two Families, which was very comfortable; thence to <hi>Ringwood</hi> on <hi>Firſt-day,</hi> and had two open Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; the next Day was their Quarterly-meeting, where their Affairs were well conducted: The Day following was the Yearly-meeting of the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dorſet,</hi> pretty large both in the Forenoon and Afternoon, and were of good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Appearance.

the Subject of <hi>working out our own Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Means whereby it is attainable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Ipſwich</hi> I went to <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> it being the Quarterly-meeting for the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and there being ſome Uneaſineſs amongſt them, Friends were concerned to adviſe them to a Reconciliation, leſt by continuing in their Uneaſineſs, they ſhould be wounded by a Breach of Union and Affection. The Meeting, by Adjournment, held all Day, and Friends ſeemed in a tolerable Sweetneſs and Condeſcention one to another, though a party contentious Spirit had too much got in among them. Next Morning was a Meeting of Miniſters, to good Satisfaction; and then the Yearly-meetings of Worſhip followed, which were exceeding large, and the Parting-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Day following; they were all very much to Satisfaction: In the Parting-meeting I was much enlarged on the <hi>progreſſive Advancement</hi> in a living and ſaving Faith, which is the very Life of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and we had a ſmall Meeting the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being their Weekly-meeting.

the People in both Places; thence to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and had a pretty large Meeting to Edification; thence to <hi>North-Walſham,</hi> and had a ſmall Meeting to little Purpoſe; thence to <hi>Norwich</hi> Yearly-meeting, which was very large: I was enlarged on the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of true Miniſters, ſhewing, that without the divine Aid of the Spirit of Truth, that Work could not be rightly performed to the Edification of the Hearers.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Norwich</hi> I went to <hi>Lamas</hi> General-meeting, which was very large, too much for the Houſe to contain, but the People were very quiet; thence back to <hi>Norwich,</hi> ſtaid there the Week-day and <hi>Firſt-day</hi> Meetings following, where I had ten Meetings, though in two of them I had Nothing to ſay, and the Meetings were moſtly very large and to good Purpoſe, being full enough for my natural Strength to go thro' with; but thankful and glad I was, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inward Strength and Aſſiſtance every Day to help me through ſo well, to my own Comfort and his Praiſe, who is God bleſſed for ever; and he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me Faith to believe, that ſo long as he engages my Mind in the Work of the Miniſtry, he will give a freſh Supply of Strength, both inward and outward, adequate to his Requirings.

in the Opening of divine Virtue, that as the Bleſſing of Chriſt my Maſter, upon a ſmall Quantity of but plain and low Food, gave Satisfaction to a Multitude, more than we were like to be, ſo I found it beſt to retire to my Gift, and be ſtill: The Meeting was very large, quiet, and well, and I was concerned to ſet forth the Fully and Emptineſs of all Forms of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without the Virtue and Power of the Spirit of Chriſt, and was opened on this Subject very largely, much to my own Satisfaction, all being quiet and well.

and we cannot find that he kept any Account of his Travels, Labours and Services in the Miniſtry, from that Time to the Time of his Deceaſe, which was on the ſecond Day of the <hi>Fourth-Month</hi> 1753, during which Time he took no long Journeys, for being advanced in Years, his Hands ſhook and Eye-ſight failed him much, but he was very diligent in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meetings both at Home and in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, for twenty or thirty Miles round, as long as his Health and Strength continued; and his Miniſtry was lively and powerful to the laſt, to the Edification and Comfort of thoſe that were favoured with it, and his Removal was a great Loſs to Friends in theſe Parts, but we have Reaſon to believe it was his great Gain, for in his laſt Illneſs, which was very ſhort, he ſeemed quite ſenſible of his approaching Change, ſaying, that he could not ſtay long with us, and hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that kind Providence would be pleaſed to take him to himſelf.</p>

            <head>THE TESTIMONY OF FRIENDS belonging to <hi>Gisbrough</hi> Monthly-meeting, concerning our Worthy Friend JOHN RICHARDSON, who departed this Life, near <hi>Hutton</hi> in the <hi>Hole,</hi> the 2d of the <hi>Fourth Month</hi> 1753, in the Eighty ſeventh Year of his Age, and was buried in Friends Burying Ground at <hi>Kirby-moorſide.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS many of our Elders are removed, and but few left who had perſonal Knowledge of this our Friend in his younger Years, and early Part of his Service, we cannot give ſo full an Account thereof as otherwiſe might have been done.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, by Accounts tranſmitted to us, we have Cauſe to believe he was much devoted and chearfully given up to walk in the Way of his Duty, and therein was of great Service to the Churches where his Lot was caſt; as alſo an Inſtrument in the Divine Hand, in turning many to Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>As to the latter Part of his Life, we have this Teſtimony to give of him, That he was a Lover of Diſcipline and good Order in the Church, diligent in attending Meetings for Worſhip and Truth's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whilſt of Ability; a good Example therein, by ſitting in a ſtill, quiet, and unaffected manner in Silence, and when raiſed up to bear a publick
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:008308_0252_102F6D1724F3E278"/>
Teſtimony, was comfortable and acceptable to Friends.</p>
            <p>And when his natural Faculties were ſomewhat impair'd, and he confined at home thro' old Age and Infirmities, he appeared more and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded, and ſeem'd to grow in the Life of Religion, that we hope he is now at Reſt in the Fruition of that Happineſs prepared for ſuch as hold out to the End in well doing.</p>

This was before they had heard of the Name <hi>Quaker,</hi> os it was in a ſhort Time after given to the People which the Lord raiſed up to give Teſtimony of the notable and antient, yet newly revived and bleſſed Diſpenſation of Chriſt's Coming, and Manifeſtation by the holy Spirit, inwardly in the Hearts and Minds of the Children of Men, in order to enlighten, quicken, ſanctify, and ſave them from Darkneſs, Death, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Sin, that they might be made capable of obeying, worſhiping and glorifying the great God and Sanctifier of them.</p>

But having left the darſt Watchmen, of whom they uſed to enquire, they now met with their Beloved at home, in their own Boſoms; renowned be the great Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</p>
            <p>Thus the hearing and receiving the ever bleſſed Truth, was as the Seed, or Word of the Kingdom, ſown in the <hi>gold Ground,</hi> or honeſt Hearts of Men, which took Root downward and ſprang upward, and brought forth Fruit in ſome <hi>thirty,</hi> in ſome <hi>ſixty,</hi> and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He ſuffered patiently the Spoiling of his Goods, and Impriſonment of his weakly Body, in the great and more general Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment; he not only believed in Jeſus Chriſt, but ſuffered for him; he was a good Neighbour, a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Huſband, and a tender Father over all that was good, but ſevere to all that which was wrong, and was for Judgment, without Reſpect of Perſons, and

ſpared it not even to his own Children; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he was much concerned for me, <hi>for,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>I was the wildeſt of them;</hi> and as he lived well, and believed in Jeſus Chriſt, I doubt not but he has fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his Courſe in the Love and Favour of God, is entered into Manſion of Glory, and is at Reſt with all the Faithful who <hi>loved not their Lives unto Death,</hi> but rather hated them in Compariſon of that endeared and unfeigned Love the bore to God the Father, and to Jeſus Chriſt his dear and well-beloved Son; who died for them, and alſo for the whole World.</p>

            <p>I was young when my Father died, not above thirteen Years of Age, yet the Lord was at work by his Light, Grace and holy Spirit in my Heart, but I knew not then what it was which inwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted my Mind, when any Thing which was evil did prevail over the Good in me, which it oftentimes did, for want of taking heed to that of God in my

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008308_0273_102F6D56976AF6F0"/>
Way of managing Horſes by me; ſo I rid to the Meetings two or three Times, and then my Father aſked me, <hi>if the Mare did not carry me ſoberly?</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>ſhe did;</hi> then I muſt have her no more, he would make her his Saddle-Mare; ſo I betook myſelf to my Feet again, except ſome other ſuch like Turn came.

            <p>Now the laſt Stratagem my Father uſed to hinder my going to Meetings was thus; he took me in his Arms in great ſhew of Kindneſs, ſaying, <hi>if I would be as a Son to him, I ſhould find he would be a Father to me,</hi> expreſſing ſomething about his having no near Kindred, (and much more to the ſame Effect he ſaid to my Brother <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was an innocent, wiſe, and clean-ſpirited Lad) I reply'd to him, <hi>if in thus making me thy Son, thou intends to hinder me from going to Meetings, or to oblige me to go with thee to the</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian <hi>Meetings, or any Thing that is againſt my Conſcience, I cannot upon this Bottom be thy Son;</hi> and, for the ſame Reaſons, I refuſed to be his hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, although he offered to hire me, and give me Wages.

            <p>I write this partly, that all who do marry, may take ſpecial heed that it be done with great Caution, and under due Conſideration, and the Lord ſought to in it, that it may be done in his Counſel, and not only nominally, but truly <hi>in his Fear,</hi> and then no doubt but it will be well with both Huſband and Wiſe; and being equally yoked, ſuch will not only he mert and true Helpers in all Things belonging to this Life, but more eſpecially in Things appertaining to the World that is to come, and the Good of the immortal Soul, which to the faithful People of the

            <p>Now I return to the Matter about my being turned out of my Father's Houſe, which I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but was willing to keep this ſolemn Account entire, with Deſires it may be a Caution to all, in whom the Lord is at work in the ſame manner, not to reaſon or gainſay ſo much as I did, but to give up freely and cheerfully to the Will of God. When I ſaw I muſt turn out, I thought it expedient to acquaint ſome worthy Friends with it, leſt any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Reflections ſhould be caſt upon the Truth, or Friends, or myſelf, that if ſo, theſe Friends might be able to contradict them; ſo I acquainted <hi>Sebaſtian Ellethorp,</hi> and that worthy Man and Miniſter of the Goſpel <hi>Benjamin Padley,</hi> two of the chief Friends in <hi>Ellington</hi> Monthly-meeting, and they came to my Father's Houſe, and when they came, they began
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008308_0280_102F6D6FD1D66FD0"/>
to enquire about the Reaſons <hi>why I went away?</hi> and if my Father <hi>had any Thing againſt me concerning the Buſineſs he employed me in?</hi> and, <hi>whether I was not faithful and diligent in all his Affairs he ſent me about?</hi> He confeſs'd, <hi>I was; and thought none could exceed me.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>Well then, what is the Reaſon of that Miſunderſtanding which is betwixt thee and thy Son-in-Law? Is it about going to Meetings?</hi> When they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his Reaſons, which were not hard to do, they expreſs'd a Pity towards me that I could have no more Liberty; and they thought, as I was ſo diligent in his Buſineſs, if he would give me a little more Liberty to go to Meetings, it would be more Encouragement to me. At which he took Offence, and gave the good Men rough Language, and aſked, <hi>What they had to do with him and his Son?</hi> and bid them <hi>go Home and Mind their own Buſineſs;</hi> which they were much troubled at, eſpecially for my Sake, and much pitied me, and wondered how I had lived with him ſo long; for he ſaid in ſhort, <hi>that there was no Abiding for me there.</hi> But <hi>Sebaſtian Ellethorp</hi> told me, which was mightily to my Comfort, that my Father had nothing againſt me, <hi>ſave that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Law of my God.</hi> This is the Senſe, if not the Words, of theſe wiſe and good Men, which paſſed betwixt them and my Father, as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them to me; for I was not there when they were together.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I pleaded with my Father to let me ſtay until I could hear of a Place, he would not, though I was ſcarce fit for Service, being almoſt like an <hi>Anatomy</hi> (as the ſaying is) ſo that moſt who knew

me, ſaid, <hi>I would pine away in a Conſumption;</hi> but turn out I muſt, and did, though I was weak, poor and low in Body, Mind, Pocket and Cloaths; for I think I had but Twelve-pence in my Pocket, and very ordinary Cloaths upon my Back. Thus I took my ſolemn Leave of the Family, with my Heart full, but I kept inward to the Lord, and under Truth's Government; many Tears were ſhed in the Family, eſpecially by my poor Mother, when I left them; my Father ſaid little, but appear'd like one ſtruck with Wonder, to ſee ſo much Love mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted towards me by the Family, and ſo much wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I might not go away: But out I came upon the great Common aforementioned, where I had had many ſolitary Walks, but none like this, for this Reaſon, <hi>that I knew not where to go.</hi> I then thought of <hi>Abraham</hi> who was called out of <hi>Ur</hi> in the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as it is briefly mention'd by <hi>Stephen;</hi> but this was the Difference betwixt us, he was <hi>called,</hi> I was <hi>forced out.</hi> But as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Common, the Senſe of my weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not knowing whither to go, nor where to lay my Head, although I had many Friends, yet I could not be free to go to them, unleſs I had known they had Buſineſs for me, being not of a forward, but rather backward and ſhy Diſpoſition. I ſay, the Senſe and Weight of my Condition came over me to that degree, that it appeared to me as though my Way was hedged up on every Side, inwardly and outwardly; I even thought myſelf like a Pelican in the Wilderneſs, or as an Owl in the Deſart, there appearing to me ſcarce a Man in all the Earth in my

I ſaid, <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord:</hi> I believed, and it was a great Means to ſtay my Mind, and ſettle it in the Truth, with full purpoſe of Heart to follow the Lord, and obey his Requirings, according to the Knowledge and Ability given me; yet Reaſonings attended me; two Things eſpecially ſtood much in my Way, yea, three Things were a Lett to me, for ſoon after I came to the Friend's Houſe in <hi>South-Cliff,</hi> viz. <hi>William A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008308_0283_102F6D7C976DD938"/>
was bound, I found this good Man loved me, and I loved him to the Day of his Death; and he often ſaid, <hi>he was bleſſed for my Sake, and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto him;</hi> for when I went to him he was very poor, but he increaſed very conſiderably after I went to live with him.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Particulars which ſtood in my Way of anſwering the Lord's Commands ſo fully as ſometimes I ſhould have done; <hi>Firſt,</hi> a <hi>violent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> fell into one of my Legs ſoon after I was bound Apprentice, which I with others thought was much occaſioned by hard Uſage, Heats and Colds, and many Surfeits, even from my Infancy; which Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs held me about two Years, and I ſuffered much by the ſaid Leg, and it much diſcouraged and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Hinderance was, <hi>my low Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the Worlds,</hi> which very few knew of, becauſe the common Fame was (and not without ſome Truth) That I had rich Parents. I have given an Account already how they were circumſtanced, and ſo I leave them at preſent and proceed; but few knew the Straits I met withal; yet my truly religious Maſter, if he underſtood any Thing was upon my Mind to go to viſit any Meeting, or Meetings, he would ſay, <hi>take my Mare and go thy way, and be not uneaſy, neither about the Mare nor Buſineſs, nor do not haſten thyſelf.</hi> Theſe Kindneſſes made me often thoughtful how I might return ſuitable Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, and be duly grateful for the ſame: I was diligent in my Maſter's Buſineſs, not ſerving him with Eye-ſervice, but faithfully; believing it good and acceptable in the Sight of God, and I had
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008308_0284_102F6D7FD8C22668"/>
great Peace in it; my Maſter never found Fault with me for doing too little, but often for doing too much, and would ſometimes ſay, <hi>I think thou wilt cleave to the Beam; come off and let us walk into the Fields and ſee how Things are there.</hi> Now as to the <hi>third</hi> Hinderance, the Account of which I was not willing to have interwoven with Matters of leſs Moment, although the healing of my very ſore Leg I attribute to the great and good Providence of God; for in a ſhort Time after I gave up freely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to anſwer the Lord's Requirings, the Lord healed me of my Lameneſs; and when I cried unto him, that he would alſo heal my Tongue of its Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering, believing that the Lord was as able to take away the Impediment of my Tongue, as he was to ſtop the Violence of that Humour which had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my Body, and had a Recourſe to my Leg, and made it ſore from above the Ancle to the Knee: And notwithſtanding ſeveral Men had given their Advice, and had ſhewed their Skill, it all proved ineffectual, until I came to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and to preſs through all to him, and to touch the Skirt, or loweſt Appearance of his bleſſed Truth and Power, in which I found true healing Virtue to my Soul, and alſo to my Body, and to my Tongue, even to my Admiration; ſo that I did not only ſpeak plain in the Teſtimony the Lord gave me to bear, but alſo ſpoke plain in my common Intercourſe with Men.</p>
            <p>I was likewiſe in theſe Days under the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Openings and Viſions, and thought myſelf as it were upon <hi>Mount-Piſgah,</hi> and ſaw into the holy
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008308_0285_102F6BF2DC7DBF38"/>
Land, and into Things relating to God and his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, and into his Work and Way of bringing Man out of the Fail and Alienation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again, and into a heavenly State in Chriſt, as Man yields true Obedience unto the Leadings and Operation of his bleſſed Grace and holy Spirit in the Heart. But under ſuch Diſpenſations it is requiſite, yea, of abſolute Neceſſity, that Man be brought into true Self-denial, as alſo into a depending Frame of Mind, and true Reſignation of Will to the Will of God, and a daily ſitting as in the Duſt, as to the Motions and Workings of the Creature as ſuch; for all that is of Man's working, or Work, does but let or hinder the ſpiritual Work of God in the Heart; and we muſt come truly to know all fleſhly Motions, and the Workings in Man's own Will and Spirit, to be ſilenced, to hear the Voice of God, which is a ſtill ſmall Voice, and not to be heard in the Noiſe and Hurries of the World; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when the Mind is buſied with Things agreeable to our own corrupt Wills and depraved Nature.</p>
            <p>But although at times I had clear Sights into many heavenly Things, and alſo had at times comfortable Enjoyments of the living Preſence of God, yet I wanted to be more eſtabliſhed in the unchangeable Truth, which I had at times ſome comfortable feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of; and in crying to the Lord, I found he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined unto me, and, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>he heard my Cries, and pluckt my Feet out of the Mire and Clay and ſet them upon a Rock,</hi> that was higher than I, and in part <hi>eſtabliſhed my Goings, and put a new Song into my Mouth, even high Praiſes unto the Lord for all his</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:008308_0286_102F6D8885540768"/>
               <hi>tender Mercies to me</hi> in theſe trying Times; and now being more crucified to the World, and the Spirit of it, I witneſſed a more conſtant Indwelling of the heavenly Power and living Preſence, Light and Grace, I came to be brought into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, and it became moſt agreeable to my Condition to keep much in Silence, and wait upon the Lord for the Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Strength, that thereby I might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now theſe Things, before recited, are worthy of Commemoration, and proved great Confirmations to me in the Truth, in theſe Days of my Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and great Trials: Read and believe thou that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, for they are faithful and true Sayings. After the Lord had healed me, he ſent me forth in the Work of the Miniſtry, and the firſt Journey I took Southward was into <hi>Lincolnſhire, Nottingſhamſhire,</hi> and through <hi>Coventry,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Warwick</hi> to ſee <hi>William Dewſberry.</hi> One Thing is remarkable upon <hi>William</hi>'s Enquiry, <hi>what Way I came?</hi> In my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the particular Towns and Places I had paſſed through, I mentioned <hi>Coventry,</hi> which was the laſt and the worſt; for ſome of the rude People flung Stones at me, as I was ſpeaking in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with great Violence, ſo that had the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to have hit me, they muſt have ſpoiled me; but my Faith in the Lord, and the Strength of the Truth, bore up my Mind above Fear of the outward Man, or what wicked Men could do to me. After <hi>William</hi> had heard my Account, he fixed his
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008308_0287_102F6D8A4458D2D0"/>
Eyes on me and ſaid, <hi>Thou muſt go back again to</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry. I appeared unwilling, for two Reaſons; <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe I thought I had cleared myſelf of that People. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I thought it not ſafe to run my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into Danger of Suffering, unleſs I was ſatisfied the Lord required it of me. But <hi>William</hi> was po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and ſaid <hi>I muſt go, for there was a Service for me to do there.</hi> Upon a deliberate Conſideration of the Matter, and a ſeeking to the Lord to know his Will in it, I found my Way clear to go, and I had ſome Service and good Satisfaction, and left Friends nearer to one another than when I firſt met with them; for there had been a Miſunderſtanding amongſt ſome Friends in that City: So I came from thence to <hi>Tamworth,</hi> where there was a Difference, eſpecially betwixt two Friends; both of them had been ſuch as had made ſome conſiderable Figure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Friends: I felt it upon me to go to, the Man, to warn him of the Spirit of Prejudice and Envy, for it he gave Way to it, it would eat out his Love to Friends and Truth, and he would decline Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and come to nought, and turn his Back on the Truth; which came to be fulfilled, as I afterwards heard; for he became a looſe Man, and liſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Soldier. I was zealous for the Name of the Lord, and had a great Concern upon my Mind for the Promulgation of the Truth, and where I met with looſe Profeſſors of the Truth, it was a great Exerciſe to me.</p>
            <p>When I returned home from this, and indeed from all my Journeys, I took Care what I well could, ſo far as my weak Body was capable, to fall into
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008308_0288_102F6D8BC5BE5A28"/>
Buſineſs, and not to loiter away my Time, neithe abroad nor at home. My weak Conſtitution would not well bear the <hi>Weaving-trade,</hi> therefore I left it much againſt my Will; but I wrought upon Clock and Watch-work, and many other Things, which ſupplied my Neceſſities, the Lord allowing me as much Time at home as put me in a Condition rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably fit for Travel, and then I was inclin'd to go to viſit Friends. Many Things I omit, becauſe I am not willing to ſwell my Account too much. I travelled through moſt Parts of <hi>England</hi> four Times, and twice through moſt Parts of <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks,</hi> between the twentieth and twenty eighth Year of my Age.</p>
            <p>After the Lord had opened my Heart, and I came in part to underſtand the holy Scriptures, and to have a Feeling of that holy Spirit in which the holy Penmen wrote them, and a Sympathy with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Excerciſes of the Righteous therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I took great Delight in reading them, and having a good Memory, could thereby the better deal with Prieſts and with Profeſſors. I had many Diſputes and Reaſonings with Prieſts and Profeſſors, of ſeveral Denominations, both in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts in my Travels, ſo that through theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and much Reading, my Mind was rather too much in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and not altogether ſo much in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and in <hi>Power,</hi> as it ſhould have been; for which I met with a gentle Caution from the Lord, which was thus: I heard a Voice (from the Lord) as plain as if one had ſpoke to my outward Ear, <hi>The Fowls of the Air lodge in the Branches.</hi> This being repeated to me, I beſought the Lord to ſhew me what
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008308_0289_102F6D8F95B524E8"/>
was the Meaning of that Voice which I heard; and the Lord, the mighty God, ſhewed me in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending Love, that the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> even all of them which were written as the holy Men were moved of the holy Ghoſt, ſprung from the <hi>living Root;</hi> yet thoſe who reſted only in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and came not to be acquainted with, and live in, and miniſter from the ſame <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> are outward; dead, dry, airy and fooliſh. This gentle Check was of great Service to me; not ſo as to make me decline reading the Scriptures, but that I ſhould not have over much Dependency on them; and to caution me againſt the Neglect of waiting for the Help of the holy Spirit, the Root and pure Spring of the right and living Miniſtry which reaches the Heart, and carries the true Evidence with it to the Believers, that <hi>it is of God;</hi> which that of the Letter cannot do of itſelf. I tenderly deſire that all concerned in this great Work of the Miniſtry, may not be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Letter <hi>only,</hi> but of the Spirit alſo, and may ſpeak in the Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power. And <hi>let him that ſpeaketh, ſpeak as the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, and he that miniſtreth, do it as of the Ability that God giveth.</hi> This is the laſt and laſting Miniſtry, which is after the Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> and not after the Order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but in Jeſus Chriſt the High-Prieſt, the one Offering, which makes perfect for ever all who come to him through the Drawings of the Father; he is the <hi>one Lord,</hi> and there is but <hi>one true Faith</hi> in him, and but <hi>one true</hi> and <hi>ſaving Baptiſm</hi> into him, or into the Likeneſs of his Death; ſo <hi>as Chriſt died for Sin,</hi> we may truly

            <p>My writing thus, from this gentle Check, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Fowls</hi> and the <hi>Branches,</hi> &amp;c. is not with the leaſt Intention either to leſſen the holy Scriptures, or diſcourage any from reading them; for I would have all true Chriſtians encouraged to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in them; yet with this Advice, <hi>kind Reader,</hi> from thy Well-wiſher and true Friend, to breath to, and truly ſeek after the Lord for a Meaſure of his holy and bleſſed Spirit, the only Key and beſt Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor to open and truly expound them to thee, as by the ſame holy Spirit thy Mind and Underſtanding comes to be fitted and enlightened; and indeed the whole Veſſel muſt be brought into a Preparation to hold the heavenly Treaſure, and not to mix the pure with the corrupt and impure: For without this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, preparing, opening, and ſanctifying Gift of God's holy Grace and Spirit, Man can neither know the heavenly Power of God, nor yet the holy Scriptures aright, as he ought to know them; and for this Reaſon it hath ſeemed good to God to hide theſe Things from the Learned, Wife and Prudent

of this World, that they ſhould not pry into, nor find out the Myſteries contained therein, unleſs they are ſanctified, and called of God thereto; and <hi>as no Man knows the Things of a Man, ſave the Spirit of a Man that is in him;</hi> likewiſe <hi>the Things of God</hi> are not perceivable by Man, without the Help of the holy Spirit of God in Man.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord opened to me the true Meaning of the Parable of the <hi>Muſtard-ſeed,</hi> in this the Time of my Infancy as to the Miniſtry, with which he ſent me forth into the World, that my Faith might ſtand in the Lord alone, the Author and Finiſher, as well as Giver of the true and ſaving Faith, even <hi>that Faith which works by Love,</hi> and <hi>gives Victory over the World;</hi> it was by and through the Power, Virtue and Efficacy of true Faith, <hi>which is the Gift of God,</hi> that the Elders in former Ages obtained, and now do obtain a good Report; it was in and through this Gift, that worthy <hi>Abel</hi> with his Offering was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, although he was envied of his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and evil minded Brother <hi>Cain,</hi> and alſo by him ſlain.

Come, read thou that canſt, and underſtand thou that art redeemed out of (and haſt overcome) the Fleſh, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the firſt Nature, the World and the Devil, in a great meaſure, for thou knoweſt that it is by the Operation of this Gift that the Dead in old <hi>Adam</hi> are

raiſed to a new Life, and way of living in the new Man; and through this heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> that is known to theſe to be a quickning Spirit, agreeable to holy Writ. Through Faith the Violence of Fire was quench'd, the Mouths of Lions have been ſtopped, the Sword turned backward, the Armies put to flight, even ſuch as were Aliens or Strangers who outwardly fought againſt the Lord's People; which ſets before us, as in a Glaſs, how and what we are to overcome in this Goſpel-day, in which we are not to fight with Men, but with our Luſts, and overcome Sin and Satan; which is as great a Victory as he obtain'd that overcame the rampant Lions<note n="*" place="bottom">Daniel vi, v, 24.</note>, who had Dominion over the Wicked, as Sin and Satan have Power and Dominion over the Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to this Day. Conſider now in Time, thou that readeſt theſe Lines, whether Chriſt or Antichriſt doth moſt predominate in thee? Whether Grace or Sin moſt abound in thy mortal Body? Whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, that leads into all Truth, or the Spirit of Error, that leads into all Error and Untruth, is the moſt prevalent, and hath the greateſt Place in thy Heart? For to him whom thou art the moſt ſubject, and yields thy Members Servants to, his Servant thou art, and to him thou giveſt way and ſubjects thyſelf, and his Servant thou wilt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether come to be in time, and the Wages due to his Servants thou ſhalt have given to thee at the End of thy Work: Therefore conſider in due Time, while the Day of thy Viſitation is continued unto thee, and the Lord is following and calling by his ſecret and inward Checks and Reproof, by which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets

Read and learn to follow Chriſt <hi>by the Footſteps of the Flocks of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions;</hi> altho' it be through great Tribulations, yet it is the Way to have <hi>thy Garments waſhed and made white in the</hi> myſtical <hi>Blood of the immaculate Lamb of God: This is he,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>that taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi> Happy is every one that truly putteth on his Lamb-like Nature, his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Righteouſneſs and Purity, and is covered with his holy Spirit, and lives and walks in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence and Conduct thereof to the End of Time here, until we enter into Immutability.</p>
            <p>Now to return from this Digreſſion to the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Part. When I had travelled much of the Time between my going forth, which was from about the nineteenth Year of my Age unto about the twenty ſeventh, then finding ſome little Reſpite from the Weight of that Service, I inclined to ſettle a little cloſer to Buſineſs but had little to begin any Calling with, being neceſſiated to leave my Trade of <hi>Weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:008308_0294_102E8ABE90295FF8"/>
through Lameneſs, as before mentioned; and I had been a Sojourner ſome time at <hi>Whitby, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> and <hi>Bridlington;</hi> but upon ſeeking unto the Lord to know what Place I might now ſettle in, though my great Inclination was for <hi>Whitby,</hi> yet it ſounded as in my Ear, <hi>Brialington, Bridlington is the Place to ſettle in;</hi> and in the Croſs I repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſettled for ſome time, keeping a little Shop, and mended Clocks and Watches, as I had done for ſeveral Years paſt at times; it was of good Service my ſettling there, for the Lord began to work mightily, eſpecially amongſt the young Friends, ſo that in a few Years many had their Mouths opened in Teſtimony for the Lord, and a fine Spring of heavenly Miniſtry was in that Monthly-Meeting, the like I have not known in the like Bounds, (for it is but a ſmall Monthly-meeting and hath been ſo ever ſince I knew it.) For Truth did ſo mightily proſper, and Friends grew ſo in the Miniſtry, that it became a Proverb, that BRIDLINGTON <hi>was become a School of Prophets.</hi> This mighty Work of the Lord, in theſe Days, is worthy to be chronicled and remembred among his many worthy and noble Acts; we had many heavenly and good Meetings, praiſed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>We had but little <hi>Diſcipline</hi> when I firſt ſettled in that Place, but afterwards many Friends Hearts were ſtirred up in a holy Zeal for the Lord, not only to promote Meetings for Worſhip, but alſo for good Diſcipline in the Church, and they began to ſee a Neceſſity of coming up more in the Practice of this
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008308_0295_102E78CC6D9B52D0"/>
very needful Work; although there were ſome that ſaid, <hi>they could ſee no Need of ſuch cloſe Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline:</hi> Yet I found it to be my Way in the Truth to bear with ſuch, if they were not irregular in their Converſations; but if they were diſorderly, we dealt with them as the Lord opened our Way in the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Truth; and thus bearing with the <hi>Eaſineſs</hi> of ſome on the one hand, and encouraging the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and zealous on the other, until way was made, beyond my Expectation, for the ſpreading of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I had now travelled and laboured much in the Lord's Work at home and abroad for about ten Years, but had not in all that Time found my way clear to <hi>marry,</hi> although not without ſome likely Opportunities, and with ſuch as were a great deal richer than ſhe was whom I did marry; but I was afraid in this weighty Affair to miſs my Way, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great Difference there is between them who only profeſs, and they who poſſeſs the Truth, and them that are only in the firſt Nature and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated State, (and ſtrictly ſpeaking, <hi>but the Sons and Daughters of Men</hi>) and ſuch who are born again, not of Fleſh and Blood, nor indeed of any thing that is corruptible, but of that incorruptible Seed and living Word of God which leads into a lively Hope, and brings forth a new and heavenly Birth in Man, that takes delight to pleaſe and obey the Lord in all Things, and ſo become <hi>Sons,</hi> or <hi>Children of God,</hi> in a more ſpiritual and nearer Relation than that of Creation only; it is in and through this great, Work

of Renovation, and being born again, that ſuch live up to that holy Seed and regenerating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: And as the ſame doth predominate and rule in Man, in this State <hi>Man cannot ſin,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid, with this Reaſon annexed, <hi>becauſe his Seed (to wit,</hi> the Seed of God) <hi>remaineth in him;</hi> Thus walking in the light, and living in the Seed, Grace and holy Spirit, although the Terms of it differ, the Virtue and Nature of it are undividable; ſuch who come to be gathered to walk with, and truly love Chriſt the Bridegroom of the Soul, are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater Nearneſs, truer Sympathy and Unity of Spirit than the World knows of. Read this, you that are born again, and duly conſider it in its proper Time and Place. I believe, and therefore truly ſpeak it, the Lord gave me ſuch a Wife as really feared him, loved Truth and Righteouſneſs, and all ſuch as ſhe thought loved, and eſpecially ſuch as lived in the Truth; her Name was <hi>Priſcilla Cannaby,</hi> Daughter of <hi>James Cannaby;</hi> ſhe was deſcended of an honeſt Family in the Eaſt Part of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> the only Child her Parents left, they were <hi>Bakers</hi> by Trade, and gave her a commendable Education, though they did not leave her any great Portion; ſhe was under the Care of her Uncle <hi>Charles Cannaby</hi> of <hi>Bridlington,</hi> an honeſt Friend, who left ſomething behind him in Manuſcript concerning his Convince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truth, and Sufferings for the ſame; he was convinced early, lived to a great Age, and was a Man of great Service in thoſe Parts where he lived.</p>
            <p>I was in the twenty eighth Year of my Age
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008308_0297_102E89CC090F7158"/>
when I married my Wife, who was a Woman of an excellent Temper, very affectionate, ſober and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, loved Retirement much, and waiting upon the Lord, and the Enjoyment of his internal and living Preſence, and eſpecially with the Lord's People, that they might alſo be made Partakers with her of the like ſpecial Favours; this was as her Crown and Kingdom while in this World, even from her Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and to ſee Friends proſper in the Truth was Matter of great Rejoicing to her. When we had been married ſcarce three Years, the Lord raiſed her up to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She was taken from me when we had been married but about five Years, in the twenty eighth Year of her Age, and died in a ſweet Frame of Mind, and was ſenſible to the laſt, and her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Matters, it is my Deſire to avoid Prolixity, yet would take Notice of the moſt remarkable Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that have happened to me in the Courſe of this my earthly Pilgrimage; alſo, I have been much preſs'd by ſome, and not of the leaſt of my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Brethren; likewiſe, I believed it to be my Duty, to leave ſome Remains to Poſterity for their Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and Comfort in the Way and Work of the Lord. One Thing is worthy here to be inſerted, which had a ſtrange and aſtoniſhing Effect upon my Mind, which was thus:</p>
            <p>As I was walking in a plain Field in the fore Part of the Day, not far from the Sea, betwixt <hi>Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> and <hi>Broynton,</hi> my Soul was in a deep Concern, and at that Time exerciſed in Meditation on the Things of God, and alſo in fervent Prayers to him for Preſervation from every hurtful Thing; and a heavenly Frame my Mind was then brought into, for then I neither ſaw Cloud over my Mind, nor yet any in the Firmament, for it appeared to me <hi>a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Clouds;</hi> tho' I had paſſed under many Clouds. Soon after my Mind was brought into this heavenly Frame, and as it were ſwallowed up in the heavenly and internal Preſence of the Lord, I thought a <hi>bright Cloud</hi> came down and cover'd me, or caught me up into it; ſo whether I was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, walking, or ſet upon the Ground, or carried up into the Cloud in the Body, or out of the Body, I know not to this Day; yet Fear and Reverence, with bowing of Soul, did poſſeſs me before the great Majeſty; at the Glory of whoſe Countenance, as I had it in a preceding Viſion, Men and Angels fled
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:008308_0299_102E89D039423BD0"/>
and gave way, and could not ſtedfaſtly behold the Brightneſs and Glory of the Countenance of the Son of the Higheſt, with the mighty God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are one in Power, Greatneſs, Goodneſs, and Glory, who was <hi>before all Things,</hi> made <hi>all Things,</hi> and upholds and fills all Things that are good, with that which is truly good, or at leaſt is for a good End. Read this Myſtery thou that canſt, and learn to fear him <hi>that hath Power over both Soul and Body, to kill and to caſt into Hell,</hi> for one Time or another he will make thee fear him, when he brings thy Sins to Judgment, whether it be now or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: The Time hath been, is, or will be, in which the Lord, the Judge of both Quick and Dead, hath, doth, or will plead with thee, and all Fleſh, <hi>as in the Valley of</hi> Jehoſaphat; therefore beware left thou make him wroth, as he was upon Mount <hi>Perizim,</hi> but be thou ſubject to the Lord, as faithful <hi>Moſes</hi> was upon Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> or the <hi>Mount of God,</hi> when he obeyed his Voice, and put off his Shoes; do thou obey, if it be to the putting away of the Glory and Wiſdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> or what elſe is required of thee: Oh then thou art in the way to further Service, and wilt be enabled, as thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues faithful, to go through all to God's Glory, and thy unſpeakable Peace in the End.</p>
            <p>Now as to the laſt Part of the Rapture or Viſion, when I was ſwallowed up in the <hi>luminous Preſence</hi> to him that is <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt,</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> I heard a Voice, very intelligible to that Senſation I had then given me, ſaying, <hi>Doſt thou ſee how Pride and Wickedneſs abound in the Nation?</hi> I anſwered in
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008308_0300_102E89D20E8F7290"/>
much Fear, <hi>Lord, I do ſee it:</hi> The next Words which I heard in the Voice and in the Cloud were, <hi>The People are too many, I will thin them, I will thin them, I will thin them.</hi> I deſired of the Lord to ſhew me, whether it was his Mind I ſhould publiſh this in any Part of the Nation? The <hi>South</hi> was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, with this Caution, <hi>Where this is opened to thee in my Power, there ſpeak of it,</hi> and <hi>not otherwiſe.</hi> I gave up to anſwer the heavenly Viſion, and viſited moſt Parts of the ſouthern Counties, as alſo the nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts, and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and where the Lord opened my Mouth to ſpeak of what I had heard, as before, by way of Prophecy, I gave up, but did not ſo much inſiſt upon that Matter, as to ſuffer it to be a Means to miſlead me from that Work of the Miniſtry I was chiefly concerned in. I would that all, who are concerned in the like manner may be cautious in this great Affair, and look well to the Riſe and Original from whence they receive this Gift, and how; and alſo what Frame of Mind they are in, and that nothing of the Warmth of their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be ſet to Work or ſtirred up, either by Sight of the Eye, or hearing, or reading outwardly, but that the Mind may be redeemed from all Workings, from thoſe and the like Grounds, and purely purged, and truly adapted or fitted to receive this Gift or Spirit of Prophecy; and alſo be ſure to be very careful to be guidable in the Gift, or otherwiſe thou mayſt miſs, as to <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> &amp;c. I intend not to dwell long upon it, as there are other Services included in this of Prophecy, as <hi>Edification</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> &amp;c. but what I have been upon, relates to <hi>foretelling ſomething</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:008308_0301_102E89D5EC1BD308"/>
               <hi>that is to come;</hi> and, as once a worthy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſaid to me when I was young in the Miniſtry, <hi>It is a great Thing to know what, where and when;</hi> and I have ever found it true to this Day. Learn of him that is (as he always was) meek and low of Heart, and be not diſcouraged, but perſevere in Faith and Sincerity, and look not overmuch at the Difficulty, but look over all to him who hath called thee, and in ſome meaſure revealed his Son through the Spirit in thee: Although I know from ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, what it is to be exerciſed in the matter of Prophecy, for in the Journey touched of before, I was concerned to tell Friends at <hi>Kilmouck</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> eſpecially, <hi>that the Lord would take many of them away;</hi> which in a ſhort time came to paſs, for many died before that time Twelve-month, it being a time of Scarcity of Corn; and it was thought many died for want of Bread, the Year enſuing my being there: I had good Service for the Lord, and great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in theſe my long Travels, as I had in the like before, in divers of which there were ſome convinced of Truth.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Cromer</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> one <hi>Elizabeth Horry,</hi> when my Mouth was opened, deſpiſed my Youth, as ſhe confeſs'd afterwards; but what I had to ſay ſo reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Condition, that ſhe ſhed many Tears upon her fine Silks, and confeſs'd, before the Meeting broke up, that all might hear, in theſe Words, <hi>All that ever I have done hath been told me this Day, and this is the everlaſting Truth.</hi> And as I paſſed along from that Meeting, not far from <hi>Cromer,</hi> with ſome other Friends, it roſe in my Heart to ſay aloud, that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:008308_0302_102E89D8A5696098"/>
a Man who was watering his Horſe might hear, looking, and pointing my Hand towards him, <hi>That Man will be a Friend before he die;</hi> and, as he own'd after, he was ſo ſtruck with it, that he had no Reſt till he came among Friends, though he was then afar off, but he came to be a ſerviceable Man among us, and his Wife was alſo convinced of the Truth, and was a ſerviceable Woman. <hi>Samuel Hunt</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> was firſt reached at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> by the Teſtimony I had given me to bear in that Meeting at that Time, as he acknowledged afterwards; but I always gave God the Glory, and laid the Creature as in the Duſt, that Man, as Man, might not be too much accounted of.</p>
            <p>After my being caught up, and hearing the Voice (as before mention'd) I had many deep and heavenly Openings, ſome of which it may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>NOW the Time came on for my going into <hi>America,</hi> having had a ſight of it about ten Years before; I alſo acquainted my Wife therewith about a Year before ſhe died, and I found it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a very near trial to her; ſhe was a virtuous, good Woman, but was taken away, and left me three ſmall Children, the eldeſt not above four Years old, the youngeſt not much above one Month old, and I having but little of this World, reaſoned much about going, thinking my Circumſtances at preſent might excuſe me; my Intentions were good, in that I might not leave Things any way to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the Truth: My innocent young Child was taken away when about a Year old; and ſoon after, where ever I went, while I was awake, it ſounded in my Ears ſeveral Days and Nights, <hi>Now is the Time, New is the Time.</hi> My other two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Providence ſo ordered it, that they were

placed to mine and Friends Satisfaction: I went through many Provings that no Man knew of, but I believe, when I am gathered to my Place, I ſhall leave many Brethren behind me yet in mutability, that will read my Lines in their own Experience. I would not have any to miſunderſtand me, for as to my outward Circumſtances, I left no Debt, neither was I in a way of going backward in the World; for ever after I received the Knowledge of the Truth, I could not ſee what Pretence I could have to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if any ſhould loſe by me: I have often ſaid, and been hearty in my Intentions, that <hi>rather than Truth ſhould ſuffer on that Score, I would live upon Bread and Water, and wear very mean Cloaths, and work very hard if I were able, and upon any mean, if but lawful Calling.</hi> It hath been Matter of Wonder to me, how any that appear to carry any Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Religion, dare run ſuch great Ventures, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time beyond their own Bottoms or Abilities; which to me hath always appeared an unwarrantable Riſque; and, as I apprehend, Pride and Oſtentation is much the Occaſion of it, which are much againſt Truth, and Men are no better for their greatneſs, for the more plain, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Peradventure I may mention ſome Things that may appear to be of but little Moment, but I have ſeen the Divine Providence attend terrene Affairs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may appear of little conſequence to ſome; ſuch as do not duly conſider theſe Things, may make a wrong Application, and as the Courſe of my Travels hath afforded variety of Trials and Tranſactions, which are in ſome Things very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, from whence ariſeth variety of Accounts, ſo there hath been a Willingneſs in my Mind to favour ſome who have been deſirous of having me to leave a Journal of my Life, which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, as far as I can ſee my way clear in the Truth.</p>
               <p>Then we went on board of another Ship called the ARUNDEL, <hi>Splenden Rand</hi> Maſter, in which we embarked the 17th of the <hi>Ninth Month</hi> 1700, and after many Storms, and much Sea-ſickneſs, not without ſome Conflicts of Spirit, more than I am free to expreſs, and a long Paſſage, being near, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Weeks upon the Sea, we arrived in the River <hi>Patuxent</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> as near as I remember, the 5th or 6th of the <hi>Firſt Month</hi> 1701, and my Heart was glad, and filled with Acknowledgments and Praiſes to the Lord, for bringing us ſafe over the mighty Waters.</p>
               <p>Now we left the Ship and Maſter, who was but a churliſh, ill-natur'd Man. I was very weak and low when I landed, both in Body and Mind, but the Lord helped me, and made my Journey and

Labours comfortable to many, as well as to my own Soul. After the firſt or ſecond Meeting we were at, <hi>John Eſlaugh</hi> being now my Companion, as we came near a great Houſe in <hi>Maryland,</hi> I eſpied a little white Horſe, the Sight of which put me in mind of a Dream I had on board the Ship before I land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which I thought <hi>I had got a little white Horſe which carried me well, and many Miles;</hi> I ſaid to the Friends with me, <hi>let us call here at this Houſe,</hi> which we did, and upon Enquiry about a Horſe, the Man ſaid, <hi>he had none but a little white young Galloway,</hi> as he called it, which he was <hi>willing to ſell,</hi> and withal told us, <hi>it carried him one Day forty Miles,</hi> and aſked 8<abbr>

               <p>During our Stay in <hi>Virginia,</hi> one remarkable Paſſage occur'd, which it may not be amiſs to inſert here, and the Caſe was thus; I being at a Friend's Houſe, an ancient Widow, in order to go to the Meeting, obſerved as I ſate in the Houſe, ſeveral Perſons of note come into the Yard (a Store-houſe being near) to make, as appear'd afterwards, a Seizure for Rates for the Government and Prieſt, they not being diſtinctly charged, but a mixed Rate, occaſions Friends in thoſe Parts to be ſtraitned about

                  <hi>Sarah Clement,</hi> who were virtuous Women, and lived near the Kingdom, and were of good Service in their Travels, and grew in Truth, which while with them I was ſenſible of: We travelled under great Care and Circumſpection, both for our own good, and avoiding Offence, as became our Places, and holy Profeſſion, that in all Things we might adorn the Goſpel of the Kingdom, a Diſpenſation of which was committed to us to preach unto others. Good Service I had for the Lord, and great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in my own Mind in theſe Parts, the Lord helping me by his mighty Power through all my Trials, as my Heart and Mind was devoted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to anſwer his Requirings.</p>
               <p>I had great Openings in ſeveral Places in <hi>New-England,</hi> and it appeared clear to me, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I ſpoke openly of it, that the Lord would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great People to the ſaving Knowledge of the Truth in his Time, notwithſtanding what many of our Friends had ſuffered for the Name of the Lord, and Teſtimony which they held in their Parts, from the Predeceſſors of the preſent Inhabitants: The View of the State of theſe Things, eſpecially the great Sufferings of many of our faithful Friends, put me in Mind of that ſaying, that <hi>The Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church;</hi> and in this Caſe, I believe it will be fulfilled in its Seaſon.</p>
               <p>One Paſſage happened, which I think not fit to paſs over in ſilence: There came into one Meeting, eaſtward in <hi>New-England,</hi> a Man, who was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Prieſt, to oppoſe Friends, (who, as Friends ſaid, had been often very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:008308_0319_102E8A0627B63AB0"/>
in that Meeting) in the Beginning of the Meeting he deſired to have Liberty <hi>to aſk ſome Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> I being a Stranger, and not having ſo much as heard of the Man, nor any making Reply to him, I felt Liberty in the Truth to return the following Anſwer in behalf of the Meeting, <hi>That I did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it was the Deſire of Friends, inaſmuch as the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was appointed for the Worſhip of God, and not for aſking of Queſtions, or controverſies, that the chief Part ſhould firſt be anſwered; and I alſo thought the Meeting would be willing, in the Concluſion, to give him Liberty to aſk the Queſtions, if his Intent therein was for</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation <hi>or</hi> Satisfaction, <hi>and not for</hi> Contention. Friends were ſilent, and the Man ſubmitted to what was propos'd, and a good Meeting we had, the Lord's heavenly Power and living Preſence being with us, and the Subſtance was felt among us, and exalted over all the Shadows and Types; and Chriſt the true Bread and living Water, Light and Life of the World, was exalted that Day; and the mighty God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with his beloved Son, through the Help of the holy Spirit, was glorified, who is worthy for ever. Near the Concluſion of the Meeting, the Man began to ſpeak well of what he had heard, particularly touching that of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> which, he ſaid, <hi>he had nothing to object againſt;</hi> but as to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as he called it, <hi>becauſe little or nothing had been ſaid about it, therefore he concluded, we either denied or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed it;</hi> or Words to the ſame Purport. Then I ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>I did not remember that the Word</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>was in all the Bible; but,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I ſuppoſed he meant the</hi> Bread and Wine; he anſwered, <hi>he did;</hi> I
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:008308_0320_102E8A0B412A4760"/>
aſked him, <hi>whether he was of the ſame Mind, the</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal <hi>Church was of? If not of the ſame Mind he might ſay ſo; for they ſay,</hi> the Bread and Wine is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible Sign of an inward and ſpiritual Grace, <hi>&amp;c. what ſaid he to it?</hi> He was ſome Time ſilent; then I aſked him, <hi>How long he thought that Sign was to continue?</hi> He replied, <hi>To the End of the World.</hi> I anſwered, <hi>He did not read in all the Bible, that the Lord had appointed any Figure or Sign but what was to end in the Subſtance, which is to be witneſſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in this World, and not put off only to the End or Concluſion thereof, as his Argument ſeemed to declare,</hi> by his urging, <hi>that the Sign of that divine Subſtance muſt remain till the End of this World.</hi> I aſked him, <hi>What he could anſwer to that?</hi> He turn'd off with only ſaying, <hi>I was too great a Sholar for him, and ſo he would not meddle with me.</hi> He then was ſilent, and there being many People, I had a fine Opportunity to open to the tender-hearted, and Friends preſent, how <hi>that</hi> was at beſt but a Sign, which the People eat and drank outwardly, in Remembrance of Chriſt's Death until he came, but that I could now prove plenteouſly from the New Teſtament, that the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> was come, and urged many Proofs out of the Scriptures to the ſame Purpoſe: And when I had done, what I had ſaid ſo reached a good-like old Man, a <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> that he confeſs'd with Tears, <hi>he had heard much ſaid upon that Subject, but had never heard it ſo opened before;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he believed I was in the right.</hi> The Meeting broke up in a good Frame, and Friends much rejoiced that that Truth came over all, and the contentious Man was ſilenced: And when the Meeting was over, the goodly

goodly old Man took me to the Door, and aſked file; <hi>what a Man ſhould do in caſe of a</hi> ſolemn League <hi>and</hi> Covenant, <hi>he being entered into it?</hi> I told him, <hi>I needed not to direct him, for he had that in himſelf which would ſhew him what he would do; for if one ſhould make an Agreement or Covenant with Hell and Death, in the Time of Ignorance and Darkneſs, and now the</hi> true Light <hi>diſcovered it to be ſo; the ſame Light which diſcovered and manifeſted it to be</hi> wrong, <hi>as he was faithful to the ſame, would ſhew him how and when to</hi> break it, <hi>and every other wrong Thing; to which Light I recommended him,</hi> and bid him <hi>take heed to it;</hi> which he ſaid, <hi>he hoped he ſhould;</hi> and ſo I left him with Tears on his Cheeks, and paſſed on.</p>

               <p>I went to the Meeting under no ſmall Concern of Mind, but when I was come into the great Houſe, I was very much affected with the wiſe Conduct of the Man, to ſee in what excellent Order he had placed every Thing, ſo that I could not find wherein any Thing could be amended; and a heavenly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was, without any Oppoſition; and at the breaking up of the Meeting, this tender Man, whoſe Heart was broken and opened by the Power of Truth, ſaid audibly, <hi>His Heart and Houſe were open to receive me, and ſuch as me, let all ſay what they would to the contrary.</hi> But what the ſubject matter was at the firſt Meeting when he came in, I forgot; it was enough that we remember'd we had a good and heavenly Meeting, and were truly thankful for the ſame to him who was the Author thereof.</p>
               <p>I and ſome other Friends being in our Paſſage by Water in a Veſſel bound for <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with high and contrary Winds, we put into a

Creek ſome Miles diſtant from <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and deſired the People to procure us ſome Horſes to ride on, and we would pay them any Thing that was reaſonable but hoped they would not make a Prey of us, for we were Strangers, and they ought to do to us as they would be done by, if they were in a ſtrange Land, as we were; and there came up to us a goodly old Man, and aſked us, <hi>what People we were? if we were not</hi> Quakers? I told him, <hi>we were in Scorn ſo called, but we did not much mind Names, for there was but little in them.</hi> He was a briſk talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, and ſaid, <hi>there was a Man here lately that ſaid he was a</hi> Quaker, <hi>and borrowed a Horſe, and when he was gone ſome Miles from this Place, he offered to ſell the Horſe: I know not,</hi> ſaid the Man, <hi>but you are ſuch.</hi> I returned this Anſwer to the Reflection; <hi>That was a great Proof that we were an honeſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable People where we were known, he might aſſure himſelf of that; for when a Man is ſo wicked, as to become a notorious Cheat, he will cover himſelf under the beſt Name he can think of, otherwiſe he might have ſaid he was a</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>or a</hi> Preſbyterian, <hi>or an</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian, <hi>and deſired you to lend him an Horſe; but you mind not theſe Names, neither doth the wicked Man think he can paſs ſo well under any of theſe</hi> laſt, but under the <hi>firſt; and the Reaſon of it I leave thee to</hi> judge. The old Man aſked no more Queſtions, but uſed his Endeavours to get us Horſes, and a Man and Horſe to go with us, to have the Horſes back again, and we were well mounted; but before we ſet forward, the old Man took me to his Houſe and was very courteous to me, for though we had ſpoke

Then I told them, <hi>That in caſe we were as erroneous as ſome might inſinuate we were, that was not the Way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of our Errors, neither to bring us out of them, but rather to eſtabliſh us in them; and that was not the Way for them to gain Proſelytes, but the Way to loſe many from them, and increaſe Diſſenters; for what Convincement could there be by Noiſe and Clamour, and Hooting, as if they would ſplit their own Lungs? I had come a great Way to ſee them, and what Character could I give of them? I never thought to have ſeen ſo much Folly amongſt a wiſe and religious People as now I ſaw: Tell the Governor and chief of the Town, what the old</hi> Engliſhman <hi>ſaith; for I am aſhamed of ſuch Doings.</hi> It had a good Effect, for when I came

We have great reaſon to be truly thankful to the Lord for theſe, and all other his Mercies, that He the Fountain of all Good is pleaſed to favour us with: And as an Inſtance of the Lord's Mercy to many poor Sufferers, and to ſhew the implacable Envy of theſe People to Friends, the Caſe of <hi>Thomas Maulham</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> may ſuffice, in ſome meaſure, to ſet forth both, who was a great Sufferer in the Time of hot Perſecution, when the Perſecutors had ſtript him of almoſt all he had; their inſatiable Minds not content with that, they came with Axes and how'd down all the Apple-trees in his Orchard, it being a large one, and left the Stumps about the height of a Man's Knee, and, as <hi>Thomas Maulham</hi> ſaid, they took the Way as they thought to ruin him; but the Lord turned it into a Bleſſing, for the Trees grew to Admiration, and came to bear Fruit abundantly, and a finer Orchard I have not ſeen in all my Travels, for the Bigneſs of it; let the Lord be ſanctified by all his People, and admired by all them that believe.</p>

I hearing the Noiſe, as before, (and alſo the flowndering of the Horſes when tumbling into the Water) called to the Men, to be ſure to take care to free themſelves of all the Tackling of the Horſes, (as Bridles, Stirrups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and catch hold on my Horſe's Tail, and he would bring them both aſhore; but if they truſted to the other (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) when the Horſes ſwam they would fail them, unleſs very ſtrong; and to have them hold by the Bridle was the way to drown both Horſe and Man: This Advice was given while they had the Horſes in their Hands; the Boatman being a lively Youth, took my Advice, caught hold of my Horſe's Tail, it being long, (which I ever approved of among Rivers) and I calling to my Horſe, he came quickly with the Man aſhore, but left the honeſt old Friend <hi>Ezekiel Waring</hi> (to whoſe Houſe we intended to go that Night) in the River floating to the Neck, a hundred Yards from the Shore by Computation, yet watchful Providence did ſo attend, that his Life was preſerved to a Wonder; for it was ſo ordered, altho' he miſs'd taking my Advice, and caught hold of his Stirrup, and the Girth broke, as they are apt to do if they be tight when the Horſe begins to ſwim, which brought off the Saddle and

A Houſe there was on the other Side of the River, which was half a Mile over. The Ferryman did his beſt to get a Boat or Cannoe, and altho' it began to be dark, yet he found a Cannoe, (which is made of a fine Piece of Timber hollowed in the Form of a Boat, and generally will carry but two or three or four Men;) he coming near, aſked <hi>if</hi> Ezekiel <hi>was alive?</hi> I told him he was, but very weak, for I had often heard him blubber in the Water; I encouraged him, that he might not faint in his Mind, for I told him, <hi>I yet believed his Life would be preſerved;</hi> he would very faintly ſay, <hi>Unleſs Help came, be could not hold it long.</hi> I went on by the Waterſide, and laid me down often on the Land, not much regarding Wet or Dirt, ſometimes tumbling over Logs of Wood and Limbs of Trees, for ſo it is in theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated Places: I directed the Man with his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe where the poor Friend was, as near as I could tell by my laſt Obſervation, and withal deſired he would turn the Stern of his Cannoe to him, as he could not liſt him into the Cannoe; neither to let him lay his Hand upon the broad Side of it, but upon the Stern, leſt he ſhould overſet it, and ſo both be drowned: So he did, and brought him gently aſhore, to the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:008308_0329_102E8A22AB586B98"/>
great Joy of his loving Wife and us all. The Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as he owned, had found my Counſel good, and therefore would have me tell him what he might do now; I bid him fetch the Boat to ſhore by the Fowler or Rope, and then go and carry <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the Cannoe to the Inn on the other Side of the Water, that he might dry, warm, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf until we came; in the mean Time we clear'd the Boat of Water, which when done, we put two Horſes into it, and I towed my Horſe at the Boat's Stern to make Room for ſeveral, eſpecially the good Woman before mentioned, who were at this Time in my Company, not without their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any more than myſelf: We got well over, and then the Ferryman and Friend on the other Side brought the Horſes that were left, being three, which were enough for the Boat, and proved too many the firſt Time. We found the good old Friend finely and well recruited, and got to his Houſe about Midnight, where we were glad, and our Hearts were full of Praiſes to the Lord for this great and eminent Deliverance and Preſervation.</p>
               <p>In this firſt Viſit while in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> I met with ſomething worthy of thy Notice, if thou art ſuch a Reader as I wiſh thou mayſt, which was thus: Being in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> ſeveral Friends came to me in ſome of the Intervals of the Yearly-Meeting, (for it held ſeveral Days, both for Worſhip and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline) to enquire whether it was uſual to let the Young, and ſuch as had but appear'd little in Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in our Parts of the World, come into Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of publick Friends? I ſaid, <hi>Yes, if they were</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:008308_0330_102E8A255B7CD998"/>
                  <hi>of clean Lives, and what they had to ſay, approved; and it was very like ſuch might want Advice as much as thoſe who were come to more Experience in the Work of tie Miniſtry, if not more:</hi> This was ſome means of enlarging the ſaid Meetings of Miniſters now coming on. When I came into the Meeting, ſeveral of the Elders deſired me to go into the Gallery, which I refuſed, the Concern upon my Mind being ſo great, I thought it was enough that I could but get into the Houſe, and ſit down among the loweſt Rank.</p>
               <p>This Meeting was one not to be forgotten, becauſe of the eminent Viſitation from the Lord that was upon us in it; I have not often ſeen the like; I queſtion if there were any dry Cheeks for ſometime in it; and the Manner of the working of the heavenly Power was remarkable, in order to the ſanctifying and preparing Veſſels for the Lord's Uſe; and he broke us down by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from following flattering Fleſh, and the pleaſing Vanities of the World, and the ſubtle Baits of Satan, by the Tenders of his Love, and engaged us to follow the heavenly and inward Calls, Knocks, and Reproofs of his holy Spirit, and to obey the Dictates of the ſame. When the Lord prepares in a good Degree for this Work of the Miniſtry, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been unwilling to give up and obey, until they have taſted of the Lord's Diſpleaſure, and in part of his Judgments, which have brought them into a Submiſſion; after which they went out with their Lives ſometimes in their Hands, and became a Wonder to Men, bearing their Reproach, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear'd in great Congregations, ſometimes in
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:008308_0331_102E8A29451F7660"/>
Noiſes and Tumults, and ſometimes were in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Faſtings, in Wearineſs, Hunger and in Cold, with much more, for the Name of the Lord and his Teſtimony, and for the Enjoyment of Peace, and the internal Preſence of him that hath ſeparated us to this Work by the holy Ghoſt; and it is in and by our abiding faithful to the ſame, that we are preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Capacity of Perſeverance through all to the End, to the mutual Help and Comfort one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Renown of the Name of the Lord, who is worthy now and for ever.</p>
               <p>We alſo had a very large Meeting on this Iſland in an Orchard, where I had good Service for the Lord; and I remember I was much concern'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the two Miniſtrations, <hi>viz, John</hi>'s Baptiſm with <hi>Water,</hi> and CHRIST'S with the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> it being clear from <hi>John</hi>'s Words, that he ſaw to the End of his own Diſpenſation when he declared, <hi>he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, but</hi> CHRIST <hi>muſt increaſe;</hi> which is generally underſtood to reſpect their differing Diſpenſations; for the firſt Baptiſm was to baptize <hi>unto Repentance,</hi> the other to <hi>the purging of the Floor,</hi> and <hi>burning up of that which was combuſtible,</hi> viz. the Chaff and Stubble, which the Lord's Baptiſm burneth up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and which no elementary Thing can do; for if all the Eatings, Waſhings, Obſervations and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies under the Law, although to <hi>Iſrael</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enjoined by the Lord, could not make the Comers thereunto <hi>perfect,</hi> how ſhould theſe or any of them now, when not commanded, as they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were to us, <hi>perfect</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> World? So what I had upon my Mind, as I received, I went through
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:008308_0332_102E8A2BEF4C90F8"/>
with, and ſhewed the Beginning, Uſe and End of the watery Diſpenſation, and the Uſe and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of CHRIST'S ſpiritual Baptiſm to the End of the World. The Meeting broke up, and Friends went into an upper Room in an Inn; but I felt ſuch an Exerciſe upon my Spirit that I could not eat, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Friends to be eaſy, and I would eat as ſoon as I could; and while I was walking over the large Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alone, there came up three Men whom I knew not, nor what they were, but it ſprang livingly in my Heart to ſet my Eyes on them in the Lord's Dread, and ſo I did; they paſſed away, and I was told after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that they were three <hi>Baptiſt</hi> Preachers who had been at the Meeting and came once more to ſee me, with a Deſign to have a Diſpute with me; <hi>but,</hi> they ſaid, <hi>I look'd ſo ſharply they durſt not middle with me:</hi> Thus the Lord in a good Degree wrought for me, bleſſed be his worthy Name for ever.</p>
               <p>Now I leave the Account of my Travels in thoſe Parts, and enter upon my ſecond, with my honeſt Companion <hi>James Bates,</hi> who was born in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and travelled much with me through many Provinces, and ſome Iſlands; we had good Service together, and it was much with me, when on <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> to viſit <hi>Nantucket,</hi> where there were but very few Friends; <hi>Peleg Slocum,</hi> an honeſt publick Friend near <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> intending to carry us in his Sloop to the ſaid Iſland that Night; and <hi>Peleg</hi> thought we had been cloſe in with our deſired landing Place, but we fell ſhort, and Night coming on, and having but one ſmall Cannoe to help us aſhore, which would carry but three People at once, we went aſhore at
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:008308_0333_102E8A2D72DB16B8"/>
twice, and left the Sloop at an Anchor; and it being grown dark, we thought we were going up into the Iſland among the Inhabitants, but ſoon found that we were upon a Beach of Sand and Rubbiſh, where was neither Graſs nor Tree, neither could we find the Sloop that Night, though we ſought it carefully, and halloo'd one to another till we were weary, ſo that we were forced to ſettle upon our little Iſland, from the Center of which, one might caſt a Stone into the Sea on every Side; here we ſtaid that Night, not knowing but the Sea, when at the Height, would have ſwept us all away, but it did not; there I walked, and ſometimes ſat, until Morning, but ſlept none; at laſt the Morning came, and the Miſt went away, and we got on board again, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Iſland about the ninth or tenth Hour.</p>
               <p>The Maſter was willing, at our Requeſt, to land three of us, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> me, my Companion, and <hi>Suſannah Freeborn,</hi> a publick Friend, who had a Concern upon her Mind for ſome Time, (as ſhe ſignified to Friends in <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> where ſhe lived) to viſit the few Friends in <hi>Nantucket,</hi> and Friends thought this a proper Seaſon to pay that Viſit. She was a Woman well beloved, and in good Unity with Friends.</p>
               <p>We landed ſafe, and as we went up an Aſcent, we ſaw a great many People looking towards the Sea, for great Fear had poſſeſs'd them, that our Sloop was a <hi>French</hi> Sloop loaded with Men and Arms, who were coming to invade the Iſland: I held out my Arms and told them, <hi>I knew not of any worſe Arms than theſe on board.</hi> They ſaid, they were glad it was no worſe, for they had intended to have alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:008308_0334_102E8A2EF596D770"/>
the Iſland, it being a time of War: I told the good like People, for ſo they appear'd to me, that <hi>Peleg Slocum,</hi> near <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> was Maſter of the Sloop, and that we came to viſit them in the Love of God, if they would be willing to let us have ſome Meetings amongſt them. They behaved themſelves very courteouſly towards us, and ſaid, <hi>they thought we might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We then enquired for <hi>Nathaniel Starbuck,</hi> who we underſtood was in ſome degree convinced of the Truth, and having Directions to his Houſe, we went thither, and I told him, <hi>We made bold to come to his Houſe and if he was free to receive us, we would ſtay a little with him, but if not, we would go elſewhere; for we heard he was a ſeeking religious Man, and ſuch chiefly we were come to viſit:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>we were very welcome.</hi> And by this Time came in his Mother <hi>Mary Starbuck,</hi> who the Iſlanders eſteemed as a Judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, for little of Moment was done there without her, as I underſtood.</p>
               <p>At the firſt Sight of her it ſprang in my Heart, <hi>To this Woman is the everlaſting Love of God.</hi> I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her as a Woman that bore ſome Sway in the Iſland, and ſo I ſaid, and that truly, <hi>we are come in the Love of God to viſit you, if you are willing to let us have ſome Meetings among you:</hi> She ſaid, <hi>ſhe thought we might;</hi> and withal ſaid, <hi>there was a</hi> Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt <hi>Miniſter who was to have a Meeting, and they were going to it, and ſhe thought it would be the beſt way for us to go with them to the Meeting.</hi> I ſhewed my Diſlike to that for theſe Reaſons; <hi>firſt,</hi> we did not want to hear what that Miniſter had to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:008308_0335_102E8A31AEE86858"/>
ſome of us had tried them before we came there, (meaning the <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> of ſeveral Sorts) and if we ſhould go, and could not he clear without ſpeaking ſomething in the Meeting, he might take it ill; but as we underſtand there is another Meeting appointed at the ſecond Hour for the ſame Man, therefore, as the preſent Conſtitution of Things are we lock upon ourſelves to ſtand upon an equal Ground in a religious Capacity with other <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and if we ſhould appoint our Meeting at the ſame Hour, then the People will be left to their Choice to which Meeting they will go. The great Woman approv'd of the Propoſal, and ſaid, <hi>indeed that was the beſt way.</hi> The next Conſideration was, <hi>where ſhall the Meeting be?</hi> She pauſed a while, and then ſaid, <hi>I think at our Houſe.</hi> I from thence gathered ſhe had an Huſband, for I thought the Word <hi>our,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it ſome Power beſides her own, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently found he was with us; I then made my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation on him, and he appeared not a Man of mean Parts, but me ſo far exceeded him in Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Judgment, Clearneſs of Underſtanding, and an elegant way of expreſſing herſelf, and that not in an affected Strain, but very natural to her, that it tended to leſſen the Qualifications of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>The Meeting being agreed on, and Care taken as to the Appointment of it, we parted, and I lay down to try if I could get any Sleep, for I have ſhewed before what fort of a Night the laſt was with us; but Sleep vaniſhed away from me, and I got up and walked to and fro in the Woods until this
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:008308_0336_102E8A36B8C13878"/>
Meeting was moſtly gathered. I was under a very great Load in my Spirit, but the Occaſion of it was hid from me, but I ſaw it my place to go to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Order of which was ſuch, in all the Parts thereof. I had not ſeen the like before; the large and bright rubbed Room was ſet with ſuitable Seats or Chairs, the Glaſs Windows token out of the Frames, and many Chairs placed without very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, ſo that I did not ſee any thing wanting, according to the Place, but ſomething to ſtand on, for I was not free to ſet my Feet upon the ſine Cane Chair, leſt I ſhould break it.</p>
               <p>I am the more particular in this exact and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Order than in ſome other Things, for the Seats both within and without Doors were ſo placed, that the Faces of the People were towards the Seats where the publick Friends ſat, and when ſo ſet, they did not look or gaze in our Faces, as ſome I think are too apt to do, which in my Thoughts beſpeaks an unconcerned Mind: The Meeting being thus gathered and ſet down in this orderly and ample Manner, (although there were but very few bearing our Name in it) it was not long before the mighty Power of the Lord began to work, and in it my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion eſpecially did appear in Teſtimony in the fore Part thereof; and while he was ſpeaking, a Prieſt (not him before touched or, but another) flung out ſome Reflections upon him, and the People for his Sake, which I did not ſee the leaſt Occaſion for; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he went away, (but more of this in the Sequel.)</p>
               <p>I ſat a conſiderable Time in the Meeting before
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:008308_0337_102E8A3898DB9A08"/>
I could ſee my Way clear to ſay any thing, until the Lord's heavenly Power raiſed me, and ſet me upon my Feet as if one had lifted me up, and what I had firſt in commiſſion to ſpeak, was in the Words of Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> viz. <hi>Except a Man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God;</hi> with theſe Words, <hi>Nay, the natural and unregenerate Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as ſee the heavenly and ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, which ſtands not only in Power, but alſo in Righteouſneſs, Joy and Peace in the holy Spirit; and to be born again, was not to be done unperceivable, no more then the natural Birth could be brought forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trouble; and to pretend to be in Chriſt and not to be new Creatures, is prepoſterous; and to pretend to be new Creatures, and yet not able to render any Account how it was performed, was unreaſonable; for it could not be,</hi> as I urged before, <hi>without our Knowledge; for to be born again, ſignified to be quickened and raiſed into a ſpiritual and new Life, by which the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh is mortified, and we come to live a ſelf-denying Life: Thoſe who are crucified with Chriſt, they are crucified to their Sins, that as he died for Sin, we might die to Sin: In this State we live not after the Fleſh although we live</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid) in the Fleſh; but the Life which theſe (live, is through Faith in the Son of God; And to have all this, and much more wrought in us, and we know nothing <hi>of it, it unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As I was thus opened, and delivering theſe Things, with much more than I can remember, the great Woman I felt, for moſt of an Hour together, fought and ſtrove againſt the Teſtimony, ſometimes look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

up in my Face with a pale, and then with a more ruddy Complexion; but the Strength of the Truth increaſed, and the Lord's mighty Power began to ſhake the People within and without D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From this Time I do not remember one Word that I ſpoke in Teſtimony, it was enough that I could keep upon the true Bottom, and not be carried away with the Stream above my Meaſure.</p>
               <p>I might add much more concerning this Days Work, but I intend not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I return from this, which may ſeem a myſterious Digreſſion to the other Part of what did happen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Meeting, and come now to the breaking up thereof; and as extream Heats oft end in extream Cold, and as great Heights frequently center (as to Man in this Capacity) in great Depths, and great Plenty in great Poverty, which I have often ſeen to be good in order to keep the Creature low, in Fear, and in a Dependence upon the Lord, I ſoon

fell into ſuch a Condition that I was <hi>like to die away;</hi> and when it was ſo, I with my Companion made a Motion to break up the Meeting, but could not for ſome Time, for they ſat weeping univerſally; then I told the Meeting, eſpecially ſuch as were near me, <hi>that if I ſhould faint away, I would not have them to be ſurprized at it,</hi> for I was much concerned leſt that ſhould hurt theſe tender People; my Life was not dear to me in compariſon of the Worth of the Souls of the Children of Men; but all this did not break up the Meeting: But after ſome Time <hi>Mary Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buck</hi> ſtood up, and held out her Hand, and ſpoke tremblingly and ſaid, <hi>All that ever we have been build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all that ever we have done, is all pull'd down this Day, and this is the everlaſting Truth;</hi> or very near theſe Words. Then ſhe aroſe, and I obſerved that ſhe and as many as could well be ſeen, were wet with Tears from their Faces to the fore Skirts of their Garments, and the Floor was as though there had been a Shower of Rain upon it; but <hi>Mary,</hi> that worthy Woman, ſaid to me, when a little come to conſider the poor State that I was in, <hi>Dear Child what ſhall I do for you?</hi> I ſaid, a little would do for me; if thou canſt get me ſomething to drink that is not ſtrong but rather warm, it may do well: So ſhe did, and I went unto her Son's, where my Cloaths were, that I might ſhift me, for I felt Sweat in my Shoes as I walked.</p>
               <p>I mention this partly for the ſakes of ſuch of my Brethren, who may be at any time in the like Caſe, to take Care to keep out of the Cold, and beware of drinking that which is cold, neither is Brandy good, for

for it feeds too much upon the weakned Vitals; but in all Things endeavour to poſſeſs your Veſſels in Sanctification and Honour: And as it is not in Man's Power to make the Veſſel clean nor prepare it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Lord doth (with thy Obedience through the Work of his Grace and holy Spirit) fit thy Veſſel for his Work and Service, take this Caution; ſee that <hi>thou neither deſtroy, defile, nor hurt the ſame.</hi> But it may be, ſome or other have done all theſe, ſome one way and ſome another.</p>
               <p>I remember <hi>Peleg Slocum</hi> (before mention'd) ſaid after this Meeting, that the like he was never at; for he thought the Inhabitants of the Iſland were ſhaken, and moſt of the People convinced of the Truth: However, a great Convincement there was that Day, <hi>Mary Starbuck</hi> was one of the Number, and in a ſhort time after receiv'd a publick Teſtimony, as did alſo her Son <hi>Nathaniel.</hi>

               <p>After I was ſomewhat revived, my Companion having a Mind to ſpeak to the Prieſt, to know why he did ſo reflect on him, deſired me to go with him, which I did with ſeveral more, and coming to his Door where he was ſet upon a Bench, <hi>James Bates</hi> aſked him, <hi>why he did ſo reflect?</hi> He reply'd, <hi>he was in a Paſſion, and had nothing againſt him;</hi> then <hi>James</hi> forgave him, and they fell into ſome Debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Faith</hi> my Friend urged the Apoſtle <hi>James's</hi> Words, which are theſe, <hi>As the Body is dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, ſo is Faith without Works.</hi> The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>Dead Faith was nothing, and that it had no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World.</hi> I thought he appear'd to be in the Craft; and after they had tugg'd at it a while, I ſaid,

                  <hi>I found ſomething in my Mind to interpoſe, if they would hear me;</hi> they both ſhewed a Willingneſs to hear what I had to ſay; and then I aſked, <hi>what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or Faith that was the Devils had? for I did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but that although they believed there was a God, they remained Devils ſtill; therefore the Word</hi> dead, <hi>is a proper Word, and properly adapted to that which many may call</hi> Faith <hi>and is not operative, but a Notion that may be received by Education, by hearing or reading, and not</hi> that Faith which works by Love, and overcomes the World; <hi>and becauſe of its not working, being inactive and uſeleſs, is fitly called</hi> dead: <hi>What doſt thou ſay to that?</hi> He ſaid, I was too great a Scholar for him. I replied, <hi>there was no great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larſhip in that.</hi> He then invited me to ſtay all Night, and ſaid I ſhould be as welcome as his own Children, and he and I would diſpute about that between our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I declin'd it and ſhewed theſe Reaſons for ſo doing; <hi>If he declin'd the Debate</hi> publickly, <hi>I would not debate it</hi> privately; <hi>for then theſe Neighbours of his would want the Benefit of it;</hi> and ſo we parted, with my ſaying, as it immediately ſprang up in my Heart, <hi>Thou haſt been a Man in thy young Years that the Lord has been near, and favoured with many Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and if thou hadſt been faithful to the Gift of God, thou mighteſt have been ſerviceable, but thou Laſt been unfaithful, and a Cloud is come over thee, and thou art laid a ſide as uſeleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was altogether a Stranger to the State of the Prieſt, nor had I heard any thing of him, nor indeed of the State of the Inhabitants of the Iſland, but what I heard after moſtly from <hi>Mary Starbuck;</hi> for
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:008308_0343_102E8A47E43BB220"/>
as we walked from the Prieſt's Houſe towards our Quarters, ſhe ſaid, <hi>every Thing ſhe now met with, did confirm her in the Truth; for ſhe knew this was the State of the Prieſt,</hi> as I had ſaid, ſhe being acquainted with him in his beſt State, and then he had fine Openings, and a living Miniſtry among them, but of late a Cloud was come over him, and, as I ſaid, <hi>he was laid by and uſeleſs.</hi> She alſo put me in mind of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I had ſaid in the Meeting about <hi>Election,</hi> which as near as I can remember was thus: I had endeavoured to make <hi>one in the Election,</hi> and <hi>one born again,</hi> much the ſame; for I had laid waſte all claim to <hi>Election</hi> without <hi>being born again;</hi> for as Chriſt was the <hi>Choſen</hi> or <hi>Elect of God,</hi> who never fell, could ſuch who were in the Fall be the Branches of Chriſt, the pure heavenly Vine? Or ſuch who were found in the impure State, and in the Degeneracy, by Reaſon of Sin and wicked Works? Or would Chriſt be married to a People, and become as their Huſband, who were in an unconverted State? Could this be the true Church of Chriſt? Could this be the Lamb's Bride, who had departed from his Spirit, and was in the Pollutions of the World through Luſt, and runing after the Pleaſures and Fineries of the World, depending upon Ceremonies, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Things and Elements, which appear not to be <hi>eſſential</hi> to our Salvation, neither do we find Life in them, nor Converſion through them? I was of the Apoſtle's Mind, that <hi>neither Circumciſion nor Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any Thing, but a new Creature:</hi> And what Man in the World can ſay, that <hi>Water</hi> (although he may have been baptized or dipped into
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:008308_0344_102E8A4BBA294070"/>
the ſame) hath <hi>converted</hi> him, or changed his State From a natural to a ſpiritual, or from a dead to a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State in Chriſt? Or, who that have gone through the moſt celebrated Ceremonies (as ſome may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them) had thereby got <hi>Dominion</hi> over Sin and Satan?</p>
               <p>Having thus treated of Things, or to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, among them, I ſaid to <hi>Mary that ſhe warred and ſtrove againſt the Teſtimony for a Time:</hi> And as near as I remember, ſhe ſaid their Principle was, <hi>That ſuch who believed once in Chriſt, were always in him, without Poſſibility of falling away;</hi> and <hi>whom he had once loved, he loved to the End:</hi> And it was a Diſtinction they had given to their Church, to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Electarians;</hi> and as I ſaid, or near it, <hi>ſhe had no mind to be pulled out of her ſtrong Hold.</hi> But when ſhe ſaw the Glory of Chriſt, and the true Church, as the Queen of the South ſaw <hi>Solomon's,</hi> and the Glory of his Houſe; and as ſhe had her Queſtions and Doubts anſwered, <hi>ſhe had no more Spirit in her,</hi> or Doubts or Queſtions, but openly owned, <hi>This is the Truth, this is the Glory I have heard ſo much of:</hi> That Spirit of doubting and queſtioning was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up now, by her hearing and beholding for herſelf this greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> his Wiſdom and Glory, and the great Houſe that he had built (the Servants, the Attendance, and excellent Order, with the Aſcent unto the Houſe of God, which were all wonderful in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Houſe, carried in them a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſemblance of Chriſt, his Power, Glory and Wiſdom) as alſo that Order and Mean which is ſeen among his faithful Servants, his Church and People even ſuch as our ſpiritual <hi>Solomon</hi> rules in and over

               <p>A Paſſage is here revived to my Mind, which was thus: After a large Yearly-meeting, where were many able Miniſters, one of whom was worthy WILLIAM PEN, who taking me aſide after the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid <hi>The main Part of the Service of this Day's Work went on thy Side, and we ſaw it, and were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and eaſy to give away to the Truth, though it was through thee, who appears but like a</hi> Shrub; <hi>and it is but reaſonable the Lord make uſe of whom be pleaſes: Now, methinks, thou mayſt be cheerful,</hi> From which I gathered, that he thought I was too much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to be caſt down; therefore I gave him this true Anſwer, <hi>I endeavour to keep in a medium, out of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, as believing it to be moſt agreeable to my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> with this Remark, <hi>the worſt of my Times rather imbitter the beſt to me:</hi> WILIAM ſhook his Head, and ſaid with much Reſpect, <hi>There are many who ſteer in this Courſe beſides thee, and it is the ſafeſt Path for</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:008308_0346_102E8A4FF15A00B0"/>
                  <hi>us to walk in;</hi> with ſeveral other Expreſſions which beſpoke Affection.</p>
               <p>This worthy Man, and Miniſter of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding his great Endowments and excellent Qualifications, yet thought it his place to ſtoop to and give way to the Truth, and let the holy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony go through whom it might pleaſe the Lord to impower and employ in his Work, although it might be through contemptible Inſtruments. I ſincerely deſire this may prove profitable to thoſe whom it may concern, and into whoſe Hands it may come, that the Lord's Work may be truly, minded, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way unto, when it is opened; for ſeeing no Man can open it, let not any drive on the Man's Part to ſhut the ſame. I have at times ſeen ſomething of this Nature, which hath not been altogether to my Satisfaction; <hi>a Word to the Wiſe may ſerve,</hi> I would hope and may be ſufficient for a Caution, for what I have written is in the Love of God, and under a Concern that hath been upon my Mind at Times, for ſome Years, to leave behind me a gentle Caution to my tender Friends of both Sexes, to have an eſpecial Care in all things, to recommend not only their Gifts, but their Demeanor in them, as a alſo their Converſations after them, to every Man's Conſcience in the Sight of God, ſo that you may build up the Lord's Houſe (like the wiſe Woman) and always have a great Care, that nothing you ſay or do may any way tend to the Hindrance of the Lord's Work, or diſcourage the Weakeſt in the Flock of Chriſt, but labour to faſten every Stake, and ſtrengthen every Cord of <hi>Sion,</hi> and as much as you are capable, build
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:008308_0347_102E8A52A25EA138"/>
up the Tabernacle in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for as God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Soul of Man is a ſpiritual Exiſtence, and as the Soul and Body of Man become ſanctified and prepared, as a Temple for the Lord by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to tabernacle in, the Lord is to ſuch as a Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary to fly to, and reſt in, from Heats and from Storms: Here is the true Church's Rock, and Place of Defence (<hi>to wit</hi>) the Name and Power of the mighty God. Oh! that all the Inhabitants of the Earth were acquainted with this Name, and Rock of Defence, they would not then be ſo much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as they are, with the Power of the Enemy of the Soul, but live above his Region, which is in the Earth, or rather, in the earthly Hearts of Men. All you who have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, keep in your Tents, until the Lord moves and leads forward, and opens the Way, ſometimes as in a Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>Read and underſtand from whence theſe Things have their Riſe and Original, for there is the Church's Safety, and its Comlineſs too, in abiding in the Truth; this is your Place of Safety where the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my has no Power, where the Wiles of Satan and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of Man cannot reach, no Inchantment hath Power over theſe, renowned be the great Name of the Lord now and for ever.</p>
               <p>How comfortable, how eaſy and pleaſant are even all the Book, and Teſtimonies, and Exhortations, that are given forth in the Spirit, Love and Life of Chriſt! yea, the very Company and Converſation of ſuch who are preſerved in the Life, becomes a ſweet Savour of Divine Life to the Living; there is
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:008308_0348_102E8A57C0DBD940"/>
Edification, Comfort and Conſolation, a ſtrengthning and building up one of another in the moſt holy and precious Faith, ſo that I find the truly quickned Soul taketh great Delight to reſort to, and as much as may be, converſe with the awakened and truly quickned Souls who take up the Croſs of Chriſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and follow him in the Way of Self-denial, although it be a Way that is much ſpoken againſt, by ſuch who know not the Nature and Diſcipline of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Croſs, and deſpiſe ſuch who are true Followers of Chriſt. To feel this eſſential Virtue, Seed or Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Kingdom, or Salt of the Covenant (Chriſt) to work ſo effectually to the reſtoring of the Powers and Faculties of the Soul, into the firſt Rectitude and Purity, that all the Malignity may be throughly purged out, with all the Droſs or Tin, which defileth the Man; and makes him unfit for the Kingdom and for the Service of God, is a great Work. Neither is the Veſſel preſerved clean, (when it is in degree cleanſed) but through great Care, Watchfulneſs and Diligence in attending upon the Lord with great Devotedneſs, and Reſignation to his Mind and Will in all Things: Experience hath taught us, as well as what we read in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that there are many Combats to go through for ſuch as are engaged in this Warfare, before the above-ſaid State, <hi>viz. Deliverance from Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and a <hi>Sabbatical</hi> or <hi>peaceful Reſt in Chriſt</hi> can be obtained to the Soul.</p>

to God, and in and to all Things that may tend to his Glory and thy Duty, thou wilt become a Child of the Light, and receive the whole Armour of Light; this is that which will arm thee on the right Hand and on the left: Put off thy own Righteouſneſs, which it may be thy Breaſt hath been too much poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with, and put on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs as a <hi>Breaſt-plate,</hi> for it much imboldens in imminent Dangers, and alſo at approaching Death; wait upon him that hath Power, that thy Feet may <hi>be ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace;</hi> ſo that as the Goſpel-Power, and Goſpel-Miniſtry, all tend to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Ways of the Goſpel and of Virtue, thou mayſt not fail to be a Preacher of Righteouſneſs in thy Walking, and in thy whole Converſation; for this is one of the good Ends for which the Goſpel-Power hath reached and viſited thy Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>purge it and make it clean;</hi> and take care to have upon thy Head <hi>the Helmet of Salvation,</hi> which will be a Strength and as a Crown to thee, not only in thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Encounters, but more eſpecially in thy laſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with Death; and that thou mayſt have Faith <hi>as a Shield to put on,</hi> that thou mayſt overcome the World and have Victory; and above all things, take to thyſelf <hi>the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which is the Word of God, that through this excellent Armour of Proof, thou mayſt be able to <hi>quench all the fiery Darts and Temptations of the Devil.</hi>

               <p>Now leaving the Eaſtern Parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> and theſe fine tender People on <hi>Nantucket</hi> Iſland, with fervent Supplications and Prayers to the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he would proſper his bleſſed Work of Converſion which he had begun amongſt them, and in all ſuch upon the Face of the whole Earth, in the next Place I came to <hi>Lynn,</hi> to <hi>Samuel Collings,</hi> where I had not been long before I met with an unuſual Exerciſe, which I had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for ſome Time would fall upon me, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having heard of <hi>George Keith's</hi> Intention of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Lynn</hi> Monthly-meeting the next Day, (this <hi>Lynn,</hi> as near as I remember, lies between <hi>Salem</hi> in the Eaſt Part and <hi>Boſton</hi>) the Evening coming on, as I was writing to ſome Friends in old <hi>England,</hi> one came in haſte to deſire me to come down, for <hi>George Keith</hi> was come to the Door, and a great Number of People and a Prieſt with him, and was railing againſt Friends exceedingly. I ſaid, <hi>Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I underſtand this</hi> Lynn's <hi>Meeting is, although large, moſtly a newly convinced People,</hi> I adviſe <hi>you to be ſwift to hear, but ſlow to ſpeak, for</hi> George Keith <hi>hath a Life in Argument; and let us as a People ſeek unto, and cry mightily to the Lord, to look down upon us, and help us for his Name's ſake, for our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that none may be hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country was much alarmed; for, as Friends ſaid, <hi>George Keith</hi> had given Notice two Weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that he intended to be at this Monthly-meeting,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:008308_0351_102E8A6021F0D3D8"/>
and the People were in great Expectation to hear the <hi>Quakers</hi> run down, for <hi>George Keith</hi> had boaſted much of what he would prove againſt Friends. So after ſome Pauſe, Retirment and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Seeking to the Lord for Direction and Counſel in this important Affair, I went to the Rails, and leaned my Arms on them near <hi>George Keith's</hi> Horſe's Head, as he ſat on his Back, and many People were with him; but the few Friends who were come ſtood with me in the Yard. My fervent Prayers were to the Lord, that it he gave me any thing to ſpeak to <hi>George,</hi> it might go forth in that Power and Wiſdom which was able to wound that wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in which he appear'd, and boaſted over Friends after the following Manner, crying, <hi>Is here a Man that is a Scholar? Is here a Man that underſtands the Languages amongſt you? If ſo I will diſpute with him.</hi> I told him, <hi>It was probable that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue was moſt underſtood and uſed amongſt that People, and therefore I thought it was the beſt to keep to it.</hi> He went on and ſaid, <hi>that he was come in the Queen's Name to gather the</hi> Quakers <hi>from</hi> Quakeriſm, <hi>to the Mother Church, the good old Church of</hi> England, and that <hi>he intended to exhibit in our Meeting on the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row theſe Charges following againſt us, which,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he could prove we were guilty of, out of our Friends Books,</hi> viz. Errors, Hereſies, damnable Doctrines <hi>and</hi> Blaſphemies: <hi>Look</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to anſwer for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if you do not, the Auditory will conclude, that what I exhibit againſt you is true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was rouſed up in my Spirit in a holy Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his wicked Inſults and great Threatnings,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:008308_0352_102E8A62E1581E18"/>
and ſaid to him, <hi>That it was the Fruit of Malice and Envy,</hi> and <hi>that he was to us but as an</hi> heathen Man <hi>and</hi> Publican; (but more of this anon.) Then he began to caſt what Slurs and Odiums he could upon Friends, with ſuch bitter Invectives as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could invent. I ſtood with an attentive Ear and a watchful Mind; for as I ſtood leaning upon the Rails, with no ſmall Concern upon my Mind, I felt the Lord's Power ariſe, and by it my Strength was renewed in the inner Man, and Faith, Wiſdom and Courage with it, ſo that the Fear of Man, with all his Parts and Learning, was taken from me; and in this State <hi>George Keith</hi> appeared to me but as a <hi>little Child,</hi> or as <hi>nothing:</hi> Renowned be the moſt excellent Name of the Lord, now and for ever. But this great Champion (<hi>Goliah</hi> like, at leaſt in his Mind) I ſuppoſed fear'd not any there; he overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us all, and in the Pride of his Heart diſdained us; but the Lord of Heaven and Earth looked down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in a very acceptable Time, and helped us for his Name's ſake, and covered our Heads in the Day of Battle: Glorified be his great Name for ever.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes thought to omit ſome Part of this Account concerning <hi>George Keith,</hi> but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it opened very clearly in my Mind then, and I ſaid to him, <hi>That the Hand of the Lord was againſt him, and that he would pour forth Contempt upon him, for his Diſobedience and Wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to his Reflections; he ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>pretend to be againſt all Ceremonies, but he could prove that they uſed many Ceremonies, as</hi> taking one another by the Hand, <hi>and</hi> Men ſaluting one another,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:008308_0353_102E8A6463E8FA58"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Women doing ſo to one another, <hi>and,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>that Women did</hi> ſalute Men; <hi>yea, they had done it to him;</hi> as it was generally underſtood by thoſe who heard him, which I thought not worthy my Notice, (but more of this anon.) He went on and ſaid, <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended, to be againſt all Perſecution but they were not clear, for the</hi> Quakers <hi>in</hi> Pennſylvania <hi>and the</hi> Jerſeys <hi>had perſecuted him, and would have hang'd him, but that there was ſome Alteration in the Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then came out one of my Arrows which cut and wounded him deep: I ſaid, George, <hi>that is not true.</hi> Upon that the Prieſt drew near and appeared very briſk, and ſaid, <hi>I had as good as charged Mr.</hi> Keith (as he called him) <hi>with a Lye.</hi> I replied, <hi>Give me Time, and I will prove that which</hi> George <hi>ſaid, was</hi> not true, <hi>and then thou and he may ſake your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to reſcue him from that Epithet of a Lyar if you can.</hi> The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>I knew not Mr.</hi> Keith: I replied, <hi>If he knew him as well as I did, he would be aſham'd to be there as an Abettor of him.</hi> The Prieſt got away, and troubled me no more in all the Engagements that <hi>George</hi> and I had afterwards (altho' the ſaid Prieſt was with him.) Then I demanded of <hi>George, What Way our Freinds proceeded againſt him, and what Meaſures they took, as he would inſinuate, to bring him to the Gallows?</hi> But I perceived Fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſurprize the <hi>Hyprocrite,</hi> and he thinking by my Boldneſs I was an Inhabitant in thoſe Parts, and knew his Abuſe to Friends in theſe Provinces, and their peaceable Behaviour towards him, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let the Matter drop, and demanded <hi>my Name,</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:008308_0354_102E8A65E5E3DC10"/>
which was told him. I then aſked, <hi>How he could have a Face to urge ſuch a notorious Untruth in the View of that People who were much Stranger's to, and ignorant of the Troubles and Differences, chiefly created by him, among Friends in thoſe Parts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Meeting (as before mentioned) being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally newly convinced of the Truth, therefore I urged to have him come to the Particulars of Friends Proceedings againſt him, that even for very Shame, among thoſe Strangers he would ſet forth as far as he could in Truth, the Steps Friends had taken in perſecuting him, as he pretended; but he would not meddle in the leaſt with it. Then I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and the People, the Falſity of his Charge, and the Wickedneſs of his Spirit, and the Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Friends Behaviour towards him, and what great Affronts and Provocations they had put up with at his Hand, as I had it from thoſe who were Eye and Ear Witneſſes of it: For, as I ſhewed <hi>George Keith,</hi> I had ſearched into the Bottom of theſe Matters, and heard that when he ſtood before Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Aſſembly Men in their Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, when they were met about the Affairs of the three Provinces, he has tore open his Buttons and told them, <hi>His Back tickled for a Whipping,</hi> and <hi>could they not cut him into Collops, and fry, and eat them with Salt:</hi> And that <hi>he ſcorn'd they ſhould wipe his Shoes:</hi> All which, with much more, I told him <hi>I could prove againſt him.</hi> And when he ſaw he could not provoke Friends to give him ſome condign Puniſhment, <hi>which I thought,</hi> as I ſaid to him, <hi>none but Friends would have ſpared,</hi> eſpecially, <hi>when his,</hi>

               <p>I aſked, <hi>What he had to ſay to all this, for it was all provable?</hi> He did not object one Word againſt what I had ſaid, but vainly hoping for better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs relating to his Undertaking in old <hi>England,</hi> finding me (as he might ſuppoſe) (ſo well vers'd in the <hi>American</hi> Affairs, hoped (no doubt) that I had been more ignorant of the Affairs in <hi>Britain:</hi> But poor Man, he ſped as ill there alſo; for he boaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>Since it pleaſed God to open his Eyes to ſee into the worſt of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Errors; although,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Charity did oblige him to conſtrue every thing at the beſt whilſt in Fellowſhip with them, but ſince they were ſo opened,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>he had been inſtrumental to bring from</hi> Quakeriſm, <hi>to the good old Mother Church in old</hi> England <hi>five hundred People.</hi> I replied, <hi>that is not true:</hi> If he rightly conſidered what he had done in old <hi>England,</hi> he had little cauſe to boaſt; <hi>for,</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I thought about as many Perſons as he ſpoke of Hundreds, would make up the Number there; and if there was Occaſion, I could name all or moſt of them:</hi>

And withal told him, <hi>that ſome of thoſe few, whilſt among us, were grown to be neither honourable nor comfortable to us.</hi> I urged <hi>George,</hi> if he could, to name or make appear more in Number than I had mentioned, that he had ſo gathered, as he had falſly ſaid. This was a very great Stroke upon him, and put him to a Stand.</p>
               <p>He then began to aſk of my Country, and from whence I came? With the Account of which I hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured him; yet withal put him in mind of his great Brag, and importuned him to make ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appear towards that great Matter he had done in old <hi>England,</hi> even for very ſhame; for I was aſham'd for him, that a Man of his Learning, Parts and Pretenſions, ſhould ſo expoſe himſelf; but he went no farther about it. Then I ſhewed to the People what Sort of a Man he was, (as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not but ſee, who were impartial) and that he was not worthy of our Notice; for he cared not what he ſaid, ſo that he could but calumniate and abuſe us.</p>
               <p>By this Time he appeared ſomewhat glutted with the ſharp Sword and keen Arrow the Lord gave me, which cut and wounded deep, ſo that from this Time I did not find in our after Encounters, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at any time ſo bold and deſperately hardy, but rather expreſſed himſelf, altho' very wickedly, yet in a ſofter Tone. He was now for being gone, threatning us with what he would do on the Morrow; but I reminded him, that he was to us <hi>an heathen Man or a Publican,</hi> and that what he exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, being but the Fruits of Wrath and Envy,

as ſuch we ſlighted and trod it under our Feet as Dirt, and rather deſired his Abſence than his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: So away he went, only telling us, he would be with us in the Morning.

And inaſmuch as I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Defence of the Truth, it appeared the moſt clear to me, to load him with his own Lies, Miſtakes and Wickedneſs, and to do what we did, as much as in us lay, in the Lord's mighty Power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Shrubs; and, under a Senſe of our preſent State, I had like to have been diſmay'd, and my Faith had even like to have failed me, but I cried mightily to the God and Fountain of all our tender Mercies, that he would look down upon us, and help us in this Time of great Exerciſe, which was not hid from him, but his penetrating Eye ſaw, and his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence attended us, bleſſed be his Name for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ever. I continued my fervent Prayers and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to the Lord of Hoſts, that he would ariſe for his great Name's ſake, and work for us that Day, that the Enemies of Truth might not triumph or vaunt over us, and that none of theſe tender Plants, which he had brought to the ſaving Knowledge of the Truth, might be hurt.</p>
               <p>I had no ſooner thus heartily ſought to the Lord, but I felt renewed Strength come upon me, and the Fear of Man was taken away from me, and I ſaw evidently that Truth would have the Victory that Day, and my Faith and Confidence was greatly ſtrengthned in the Lord.

               <p>Being thus encouraged in myſelf, it aroſe in my Heart to ſpeak to Friends before we went into the Meeting-Houſe, and I adviſed them <hi>to be ſwift to hear and ſlow to ſpeak,</hi> and that <hi>what was ſpoken might be in the Lord's Power, for that wounds</hi> George <hi>the moſt, and ſlays that wicked and ranting Spirit in him, more than all the Wiſdom of Words without it;</hi> and let us <hi>maintain our Teſtimony of Denial againſt him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

with whom we had no Unity or Fellowſhip: And being thus caſt out, <hi>he became to us</hi> (agreeable to the Sayings of Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>as an Heathen Man or a Publican;</hi> and being thus disjointed, to expoſe us, what lay in his Power, to all Sorts of People, he choſe <hi>printing againſt us;</hi> wherein he hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed us, in leaving out many times the explanata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parts of Sentences, and coining Words to make the Meaning appear different from what was deſign'd and indeed, from what was moſt fair and genuine: Therefore, ſome of our Friends found themſelves concern'd to follow him in Print, for the clearing us from what he, through Envy, would have willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſten'd upon us, and to return his Self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Miſinterpretations, and Miſapplications of our Writings upon himſelf, and to clear our own Innocency, and manifeſt the Perverſneſs and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his Spirit: Neither do we, as a People, hold ourſelves to be under any Obligation to follow him into foreign Parts of the World, to anſwer his Arraignments and Charges, not being conſcious to ourſelves that we hold any thing contrary to ſound and orthodox Doctrine; and alſo knowing that what he exhibits againſt us, is the Fruit of Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, as ſuch we reject it, and trample it under our Feet; and were it not for your Sakes, who are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to theſe Things, we ſhould take no further No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>George Keith</hi> than to ſlight and reject him as a Man that cares not what he ſays, nor is he worthy of our Notice.</p>

and then my Companion; all this in much Weight and with good Demonſtration. After them it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord to open my Mouth, I think in as much Strength, Clearneſs and Demonſtration as ever, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the following Words, <hi>In that Way you call Hereſy do we Worſhip the God of our Fathers, believing all Things that are written concerning Jeſus Chriſt, both as to his God-head and Manhood;</hi> giving a ſummary Account of his Birth, working of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſome of his Doctrine, Sufferings and Death, Aſcenſion and Glorification, the Coming of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, or Comforter, to lead all thoſe who receive, believe, and obey it, into all Truth: Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Openings concerning the Law and Prophets, and the Beginning, Service and End of the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. The People appeared very much down and attentive, for the Lord's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly baptizing Power was amongſt us that Day: It was thought, many were there who had not been at any of our Meetings of Worſhip before, and the Preſence of the Prieſts there, opened a Door for all the reſt.</p>
               <p>I being clear, leſt them unto the Grace of God, and unto their free Teacher Chriſt, whoſe heavenly Power in the Appearance of his Spirit, the laſt and laſting Diſpenſation, was exalted that Day above all the ſhadowy and typical Things that ever had been in the World; A good Meeting it was, and Friends were mutually comforted and edified in the internal Preſence of the Lord.</p>

And as Friends entered the Meeting-houſe in the Lord's Power, even that Power which cut <hi>Rahab,</hi> and wounded the <hi>Dragon,</hi> which had been at work, kept down in a good degree the wrong Spirit in <hi>George,</hi> for he appear'd much down: But this buſy Prieſt called to him ſeveral Times to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to what I had ſpoke.

Drift was to infuſe an Opinion into them, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not commonly preach up Faith in the <hi>Manhood</hi> of Chriſt, as I had done that Day: I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the Auditory, whether they thought there was a Neceſſity frequently to preſs a Matter ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received amongſt Chriſtians, as <hi>Faith in the Manhood of Chriſt was?</hi> Yet we, as a People, had ſo often and clearly demonſtrated our Faith in the Manhood of Chriſt, both in our Teſtimonies and Writings, as might ſatisfy any unbiaſs'd Perſon, or ſuch who were not prejudiced againſt us; and we know not of any People who believe more ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Manhood of Chriſt than we do: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Grace, Light and holy Spirit, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in the Work of Man's Salvation, as well as what Chriſt did for us without us, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet much a Myſtery to many called Chriſtians, it pleaſes God to open, in the Courſe of our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, into the Meaning and Myſtery thereof, and to preſs the latter more than the former. To which <hi>George</hi> made no Reply, but began to exhibit his Charges againſt us (as mentioned before) and ſaid, <hi>he could prove them out of our Friends Books,</hi> naming <hi>George Fox,</hi> and <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> &amp;c. He had in a Paper a great many Quotations out of Friends Books, and a young Man with him had many Books in a Bag, <hi>out of which,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>he would prove the Charges he was about to exhibit againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was now crowded up into the Gallery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and the Rail, with a Paper in his Hand; and I ſtanding over him, and being taller, could ſee his Quotations and his Paraphraſes upon them, on

which I told him loudly that all the Meeting might hear, <hi>That he offered Violence to that Senſe and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which God had given him, and he knew in his Conſcience, we were not that People, neither were our Friends Writings either damnable or blaſphemous, as be through Envy endeavoured to make the World beleive and that be would not have Peace in ſo doing, but Trouble from the Lord in his Conſcience.</hi> I ſpoke in the Lord's dreadful Power, and <hi>George</hi> trembled ſo much as I ſeldom ever ſaw any Man do: I pitied him in my Heart, yet, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid once concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I felt <hi>the Wrath of the Lord go forth againſt him: George</hi> ſaid, <hi>Do not judge me;</hi> I reply'd <hi>the Lord judges, and all who are truly one in Spirit with the Lord, cannot but judge thee.</hi> So he gave over, and it appearing a ſuitable Time to break up the Meeting, Friends parted in great Love, Tenderneſs, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs of Heart; for the Lord's mighty Power had been in and over the Meeting from the Beginning to the End thereof, glorified and renowned be his moſt excellent Name, now and for ever, for his Mercies are many to thoſe that love and fear him who is the Fulneſs of all Good.</p>
               <p>This Meeting was not only for Worſhip, but alſo for Buſineſs, as I ſaid to the People at our parting; it was Friends Monthly-meeting, in which their Poor, Fatherleſs, and Widows were taken Care of, and ſuch other Things as concern them as a People.

                  <hi>George</hi> called to ſee me the next Day, and ſaid <hi>You had the Advantage over me Yeſterday, for you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to be quiet until you had done, and then you would not ſtay to hear me;</hi> neither indeed were we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any Obligation ſo to do: I told him, <hi>I hoped that Truth would always have the Advantage over thoſe who oppoſed it;</hi> and ſo we parted, but met again upon <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> the Governor of which Place, who was a friendly Man, having heard of my Intention of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, ordered the Deputy-Governor, when I came, to have me to him, which he did; and when he ſaw me at the Door, and after Enquiry heard my Name, he took me by the Hand and led me like a Brother, or rather more like a tender Father, into a Room, ſetting me down by him, and then began to ſay, <hi>I have heard much of you, and I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee you long, and am glad you are here.</hi> I find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him near me in Spirit, was very open in my Mind to him, and anſwered him with much Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Satisfaction. I remember he aſked, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I thought the Sourneſs in the Minds of the</hi> Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians <hi>againſt us, was not rather abated?</hi> I told him, <hi>I did believe it was; and if our Friends did but obſerve to walk wiſely, and live up to what they profeſſed, they would overcome it all.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>that was the way, and there was not another comparable to it; and,</hi> as he ſaid, and I believe it was ſo, <hi>he bad no other view in ſending for me, but to manifeſt his Reſpects to me, and</hi>

                  <hi>to do me any Service that lay in his Power:</hi> I told him, <hi>I was ſenſible of his Love, and wiſh'd I could be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of retaliating that which in Gratitude his Kindneſs to me called for:</hi> He ſaid, <hi>he deſired no more than when I came that way I would viſit him, if be was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> I told him, <hi>I intended ſo to do, if ever it was my Lot to come there again.</hi> I then deſired he would be at the Meeting next Day, <hi>George Keith</hi> propoſing to be there, in all likelihood it would be very large; which he promiſed he would, and accordingly came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> made little Diſturbance in the beginning of the Meeting, but commanded the Governor <hi>to quiet the</hi> Quakers: A prieſt ſaid, <hi>Mr.</hi> Keith, you <hi>ought not to command the Governor, but intreat his;</hi> well then, he intreated the Governor to quiet the <hi>Quakers</hi> that he might be heard; whereupon the Governor, like a Man of Juſtice and Wiſdom, ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>It was not in his Power to quiet the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; <hi>inaſmuch as the Houſe is theirs, and they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Meeting, it is but reaſonable they ſhould have their Liberty, and if they be willing, when they have done, you have your Liberty to ſay what you have to ſay to theſe who will ſtay to hear you:</hi> So the Governor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next me, lean'd his Hand, upon me, and went away in a ſober Manner. <hi>George</hi> was quiet, and we had a good Meeting, and ſo parted.</p>
               <p>After moſt of the Friends were gone, a Friend and I went to the Meeting-houſe Door, to hear what <hi>George</hi> ſaid; he held his Bible in his Hand, and ſaid it was promiſed, <hi>that the Goſpel ſhould be preached unto every Creature under Heaven; but if it</hi>

ſuch Security as Friends approved of; neither of which he was capable of doing: So he was ſlighted by all or moſt of the People, as well as by Friends, and this block'd up his Way to much that we had little or no Trouble with him in that Part of the World: But the Lord wrought for his Name's Sake, and the Preſervation of his tender People, Praiſes and Honour be given to his great Name, now and for ever. Thus ended this Engagement betwixt a poor Servant or Chriſt, and a <hi>grand Apoſtate,</hi> who appeared to fight againſt Reaſon, Senſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Think not, my Friends, the Account too long, for it hath ſeem'd to me, for ſome time, a Debt due to my Brethren, and a piece of Juſtice to the Memory of <hi>George Keith,</hi> for his <hi>Wickedneſs, Revolting,</hi> and ſad <hi>Apoſtacy.</hi> Few there are who can believe how great the Power of Darkneſs and Wickedneſs of that Mind and Spirit was, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and breathed through him; ſo great it was, that even the conſiderate and ſober People ſaid, <hi>they did not think that</hi> George Keith <hi>had been ſo wicked a Man as they now found he was upon Trial.</hi> Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Friend and Reader, hold faſt that which thou haſt receiv'd, that none may take thy Crown, for it is ſaid up in Store for the Righteous only, and ſuch who hold out to the End, in the ſame pure Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of Chriſt wrought and continued in Man, by the Operation and Indwelling of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, as Man abideth in Subjection and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Leadings and Dictates thereof.</p>
               <p>I told <hi>George,</hi> that <hi>I was much aſhamed of his</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimenting <hi>Great People;</hi> for I obſerved he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               </p>
               <p>This Account carries in it an Admonition to us, und to Friends in future Ages, into whoſe Hands it my come, to beware of letting in the Spirit of <hi>Envy, Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Pride of Heart,</hi> which I clearly ſaw was that which, with too much leaning to his <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abilities</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> was his <hi>Overthrow,</hi> he not keeping to the Lord's holy Spirit, the Life and Strength of his faithful People, and the Key of true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the good Remembrancer, and Leader into all Truth, which the Lord ſees meet in his Wiſdom to open and lead us into; without the Help of which Anointing and holy Spirit, we are apt to be cold and forgetful in our Duties towards God, and alſo in our Love and Duties one to another; but as the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this Spirit is faithfully kept to, and improved, we grow more and more fruitful in every good Work and Word, to the Glory of God and Comfort of our Souls, and, as the Salt of the Earth, help to ſeaſon thoſe who are not ſeaſoned.</p>
               <p>When I was in the Yearly-meeting upon <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> there was a Query concerning what Friends might do, in caſe there ſhould be a Lay or Tax laid

upon the Inhabitants for building ſome Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to provide Men and Arms for the Security of the Iſland? Such a Thing being then in Agitation, he, who was one of the chief Friends concerned in Church-Affairs, would have me give an Account what we did in the like Caſe in <hi>England;</hi> for, he ſaid, they in that Country looked upon themſelves but as the <hi>Daughter,</hi> and Friends here in Old <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> as their <hi>Mother</hi> and they were willing to act conſiſtent with us as far as they could, and would know how we did there in that Matter, whether we could pay to that Tax which was for carrying on a vigorous War againſt <hi>France?</hi> I was unwilling to meddle with it, as I ſaid; but the Meeting waited a conſiderable time for my Anſwer (as one told me) and was not willing to go forward without it; at laſt, when I could not well do otherwiſe, I ſignified to that large Meeting, <hi>That I had heard the Matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated both in ſuperior and inferior Meetings and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and the moſt general Reſult was this;</hi> Friends did not ſee an effectual Door opened to avoid the Thing, that Tax being mixed with the other Taxes; <hi>although many Friends are not ſo eaſy as they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: Neither have we any further Sway in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than only giving our Voices for ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein; therefore, as Things appear to me, there is a great Diſparity between our Circumſtances and yours here; for you have a great Intereſt here, and a great Share in the Government, and perhaps may put ſuch a Thing by in voting, conſidering the Body of Friends, and ſuch as are friendly, whom you have an Intereſt in; therefore look not for Help from the</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p>During my Stay in one of the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> a great Weight, more than uſual, ſeized upon my Spirit, as I ſat in a Meeting, under a Senſe of the ſame, my Cries aſcended unto the Lord, the Fountain of all tender Mercies, that he would pleaſe to <hi>ſhew me</hi> what was the Cauſe of that great Power of Darkneſs which did ſo oppreſs my Spirit; and it pleaſed the Lord to <hi>ſhow me,</hi> that a Man there had been guilty of ſome <hi>groſs Wickedneſs;</hi> and when it appear'd clear to me, to be required of me to expreſs it publickly, it became a very great Exerciſe to me, and ſome Reaſonings I had, before I gave up to make it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to that large Meeting of Friends and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; I laboured under it till towards the Concluſion of the Meeting, but finding my Peace concerned very nearly in the Matter, I ſtood up in the Gallery and ſaid, <hi>Under a Senſe of ſome groſs Wickedneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by ſome Perſon not far from me, hath my Spirit been borne down; which Wickedneſs will in a ſhort Time break forth to the Diſhonour of Truth, and Grief of Friends.</hi> A great Man who ſat in the Gallery by me, ſtarted up and ſeated himſelf upon the Rail of the Gallery, with his Eyes fixed on me, and I faſtned, in the Lord's Dread, my Eyes on him, and ſaid, <hi>We have a common Maxim in old</hi> England, <hi>Touch a gail'd Horſe's Back, and he will kick,</hi> and I am of the Opinion, <hi>he that kicks is not clear.</hi> He got down

as faſt as he could out of my way, for he not only prevented me from the View of the Meeting by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there, but his Uncleanneſs ſtood much in the way of my Service.</p>
               <p>After the Meeting was over, ſeveral worthy Friends expreſs'd to me the great Concern they were under, leſt he ſhould either by Money, or by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, conceal the Sin and Wickedneſs, if ſuch was committed; for I found there was a great Fear and Jealouſy in the Minds of Friends, that ſomething was wrong with the Man, but I was 'till then alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a Stranger to their Thoughts, and to the State of the Man; yet I adviſed that Friends ſhould have a watchful Eye over him and his Family, for I told Friends, <hi>my Spirit was eaſy in what I had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and I believed the Evil would not be concealed.</hi> So in my Return, his Houſe-keeper had brought forth a Child, and charged him with being the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it, which he deny'd not: Friends then aſked me, what they ſhould do in the Caſe? I ſaid, <hi>Let the Judgment of Truth go forth againſt all manifeſt Wickedneſs, without reſpect of Perſons, that the ever bleſſed Truth, and ſuch as live in it, may be kept clear and in good Eſteem before all Men as much as may be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something of the like Exerciſe I met with in a Meeting in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> repeating ſeveral times <hi>what Oppreſſion my Spirit was under, becauſe of ſome yet hidden Wickedneſs, which in a ſhort Time would be brought to light, to the Blemiſh of the Truth, and great Trouble to Friends.</hi> That Very Evening, after the Meeting, a Woman little thought on by Friends to be guilty of ſuch a Crime, went to a worthy Friend
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:008308_0376_102E8AA2078F5938"/>
and told him, <hi>She was the Woman that had done that great Wickedneſs I had ſo much complained of, and had borne ſuch a great Load becauſe thereof;</hi> and, as the honeſt Friend ſaid, ſhe wept bitterly, even in the very Anguiſh of her Soul. He came twelve Miles the next Day to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to acquaint me with the Matter, and aſk my Advice, which I gave to this Effect; <hi>If Friends find upon Enquiry, in the proper Seaſon, that the Woman continues heartily ſorry, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penitent for what ſhe hath done, for</hi> Godly Sorrow worketh Repentance, <hi>and if from ſuch a hearty and penitent Senſe</hi> (which is to he felt beyond Words) <hi>ſhe gave forth a Paper againſt her wicked Doings, not ſo much to ingratiate herſelf into Favour, as for the clearing of Truth and Friends, and for the Eaſe and Peace of her own Mind, and took the Blame and Shame to herſelf, then Friends may paſs it by; if not, Friends muſt ſet the Judgment of Truth over manifeſt Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,</hi> as before mentioned.</p>
               <p>I went to viſit a Meeting in that Part called <hi>North-Wales,</hi> which had not been long planted in that Place, where there was a fine tender People, but ſew underſtanding <hi>Engliſh, Rowland Ellis</hi> was my Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; a good Meeting it was, and Truth was over all: Some, by the Interpreter, expreſſed their great Satisfaction in our Viſit to that Meeting, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had not been counted as Friends, but ſince that have been taken Notice of, and grown into good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem with the Body of Friends.</p>
               <p>I found it much my Work to be concerned in the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Church which was very low in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places, yet I found there was a Willingneſs in
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:008308_0377_102E8AA5DE4A12F8"/>
many Friends Minds to be helped in that needful Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, for ſurely it is t good Fence, or a Help to keep the Righteous in, and hurtful and wicked Things and Doings out, if the ſame be rightly handled, and extended as it ought to be, in the Love and Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>There was one Thing I had like to have omitted, which happened when I was in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> viz. one <hi>Rogers</hi> came thither <hi>to offer</hi> (as he ſaid) <hi>his Gift in the Yearly-meeting amongſt Friends;</hi> but they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in a great Strait about him, although he had writ in Behalf of Truth's Principles, and ſuffered Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, and the taking away his Wiſe from him, and was not ſo much as ſuffered to come to converſe with his own Son, but under a Guard or Watch which was ſet over him, to hear what paſſed betwixt them, as he told me and ſome other Friends, which Friends ſaid <hi>was true;</hi> yet, under the Conſideration of the Matter, and Clearneſs of the Man's Converſation, Friends remained in a Strait <hi>what to do;</hi> and deſired that I would take the Matter upon me, and reaſon the Caſe with him, and try if I could perſuade him to be eaſy, and not inſiſt upon any ſuch Thing, as <hi>to promiſe to receive his Gift;</hi> for otherwiſe, he ſaid, <hi>he would go where it would be received.</hi> I ſhewed him, that it was a Thing impracticable amongſt us, and in itſelf unreaſonable, that we ſhould be by any Pre-engagement obliged to receive that which he might call <hi>a Gift,</hi> before we heard it; if he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he had a Gift, he might ſpeak, and, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaid, <hi>we might judge:</hi> For it was not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but he, who was a Scholar and a wiſe Man, and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:008308_0378_102E8AA760721378"/>
had a ſtrong Memory, might have gathered certain Paſſages out of the Bible or other Books, with what other Interpretations he might have ſtored up, and ſpeak of, and call <hi>a Gift,</hi> which we could not receive as <hi>a real Gift of the Miniſtry,</hi> which ſtands <hi>in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>in the Power,</hi> and if it be ſuch, it will make way for itſelf; if not, <hi>we cannot receive it.</hi> So he went away, and troubled Friends no more that I heard of.</p>
               <p>When I was at <hi>William Penn's</hi> Country-Houſe, called <hi>Penſbury,</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> where I ſtaid two or three Days, on one of which I was at a Meeting and a Marriage, and much or the other Part of the Time I ſpent in ſeeing (to my Satisfaction) <hi>William Penn</hi> and many of the <hi>Indians,</hi> (not the leaſt of them) in Council and Conſultation concerning their former Covenants, now again reviv'd upon <hi>William Penn's</hi> going away for <hi>England,</hi> all which was done in much Calmneſs of Temper and in an amicable way.

               <p>When much of the Matters were gone through I put <hi>William Penn</hi> in mind to enquire of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, it he could find ſome Terms or Words that Wight be intelligible to them, in a religious Senſe by which he might reach the Underſtandings of the Natives, and inculcate into their Minds a Senſe of

Which I did; and when I came to them, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I was come from a far Country, with a Meſſage from the <hi>great Man</hi> above (as they call God) and my Meſſage was to endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, <hi>that they ſhould not be Drunkards, nor ſteal, nor kill one another, nor fight, nor commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, nor put away their Wives, eſpecially for ſmall Faults,</hi> which (as I underſtood) is uſual with them to do <hi>for if they did thoſe Things, the great and good Man above would be angry with them, and would not Proſper them, but bring Trouble on them, but if they more careful to refrain theſe Evils</hi> (before mentioned) <hi>then would God love them, and proſper them, and ſpeak Peace to them,</hi> or very near theſe Words. And when the Interpreter expreſſed theſe Things to them in their own Language, they wept, and Tears ran down their naked Bodies, and they ſmote their Hands upon their Breaſts, and I perceived ſaid ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething to the Interpreter; I aſked <hi>what they ſaid?</hi> He told me they ſaid, <hi>all that I had delivered to them was good, and except the great Man had ſent me, I could not have told them thoſe Things.</hi> I deſired the Interpreter to aſk them, <hi>how they knew what I had ſaid to them was good?</hi> they reply'd, and ſmote their Hands on their Breaſts, the good Man here (meaning in their Hearts) told them what I had ſaid was all good.

Where is the Scribe? Where is the Diſputer of this World?</hi> All her briſk talkative Qualities were ſwallowed up in the feeling of the internal, enlightning Preſence of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When ſhe returned to her Maſter's (before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) he aſked her, <hi>If ſhe had got Satisfaction?</hi> meaning, Had ſhe had any Diſcourſe with me and was ſatisfied?

The Manner of the Working of the Truth is to humble the Creature, and bring it into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. Tenderneſs, and Fear, with true Self-denial.</p>
               <p>I come now to mention ſomething that happened in my going over <hi>James's River,</hi> towards a Yearly-meeting in <hi>Virginia:</hi> Alighting at an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by the River-ſide, where we refreſhed ourſelves there was a poor little Child cried ſo exceedingly, that I was

uneaſy to hear it, and aſked the Mother, what was the matter? She ſaid, it had cried moſt of the Time ſince it was born, and they were almoſt off their Feet with it, or to that effect. I told her, I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I could give the Child ſomething which would do good, and ſhe readily agreed to it, and I gave it a little of ſomething then, and order'd her to give it twice more in four or five Days time: But when I returned, the Child was better, and oh! how glad the poor Woman was to ſee me, and ſpoke more in my Commendations than was to my Satisfaction, and was kind to Friends afterward for my Sake.</p>
               <p>Now we came to ferry over the River, being, as I remember, five Horſes and nine People; there was <hi>Jane Pleaſant</hi> a publick Friend, and her Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant who rid before her upon a great Horſe, and high in Fleſh, and about the Midſt of the River, it being two Miles over, he roſe upon his hind Feet, and ſlung himſelf upon the Edge or Gunnel of the Boat, half into the River; the Fall of the Horſe, and the Motion of the other Horſes thereupon, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Boat to make ſuch Sallies that it took in Water, and was very likely to ſink: But before he could have Time to riſe again, or to make any more Springs, I took ſeveral young Men by the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and flung them upon his Neck to keep him down, and told them as faſt as I could, why I did ſo. Now I had to deal with the Ferry-man, who was about to ſtrip for ſwimming, and ſaid <hi>we ſhould all he drowned; but for his Part he could ſwim;</hi> and was about to leap into the River, <hi>for,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>the Boat would either break or ſink.</hi> I told him. <hi>It will

ſoon enough for him to ſwim, when he ſaw the Boat either break or ſink, and it he would not row, then I would;</hi> With much Intreaty he took the Oar again and rowed us to the Shore. But in our imminent Danger I looked over my tender Friends, (for ſo they appeared to me) and thought in my Heart what a Pity it would be, it all theſe were drowned! yet the Thought of my own drowning never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my Mind, until I was got over the River, which was a Mercy to me, and a great Means to keep out Diſorder and Confuſion, which commonly attend ſudden Surprises and Frights, or elſe they make People dead-hearted and almoſt ſenſeleſs.</p>
               <p>As I had now an Occaſion to obſerve, as well as in ſome imminent Dangers I had ſeen before, where I happened to be, I find it an excellent Thing to be as much as we can, always ready, and by being frequently thinking upon Death, it is not ſo ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when it does come: This is a great Point of true Wiſdom, <hi>to number our Days ſo, as to remember our latter End.</hi> The want of thus contemplating and truly thinking on what Preparation we are in to look Death in the Face, and to appear before the great Judge of both Quick and Dead, was the Cauſe of the Complaint, <hi>Oh! that my People were wiſe that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End.</hi> The great Remiſneſs of ſuch Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among People, beſpeaks Folly and great Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, and that the Heart is hardened through an Habit of ſinning; oh! that I might prevail with the Children of Men to awake.

to hear inwardly the Call of the Son of God, that your Souls may not only live here to ſerve God, but alſo may live eternally in Bliſs with him is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my Soul for the whole Bulk of Mankind; for my Life has often appear'd not dear to me, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the ſaving of the Souls of the Children of Men.</p>
               <p>I have often thought of <hi>Moſes,</hi> how far he went for ſaving of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and how far <hi>Paul</hi> went for the ſaving of his Kinsfolk after the Fleſh; it was a great Demonſtration, that theſe great and good Men had great Faith and Intereſt in the Lord, and alſo a very great Love to his People; and ſuch whoſe Eyes are truly opened, cannot but ſee it is the Love of God, and Love to the Souls of Men, that conſtrains us thus to take our Lives as in our Hands, and labour under many weary Steps, and many Perils by Sea and by Land, and in the Wilderneſs, Cold, and ſometimes in Tumults and Noiſes, ſometimes in Watchings and Faſtings, that we have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Spectacles to Men; but the Lord hath given us Faith and Patience to bear and overcome all, as we have ſingly ſtood in his heavenly Counſel, and been truly devoted to his Will in all Things.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs to mention a particular thing which happened to me before I left <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> viz. Knowing that my Landlady, <hi>Samuel Bowne's</hi> Wife, had a very ſore Breaſt, by which ſhe had much Trouble, and had no leſs than five Tents in it, and ſhe being a ſenſible and a ſerviceable Woman, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came with a Concern upon my Mind to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter unto her Breaſt, with a Belief <hi>it would heal

her:</hi> I reaſon'd about it until I had got one Foot into the Stirrup for mounting my Horſe, but I grew uneaſy for being dilatory in doing that which came into my Mind; ſo I went in again and ſaid, <hi>Mary, I am come back to adviſe thee what thou ſhouldſt do, by which, I believe</hi> thou wilt be healed, <hi>although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay to ſee it done. I believe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>and intend to follow thy Advice;</hi> but aſked, <hi>what would become of all thoſe Tents?</hi> I told her, <hi>the Poultice would draw them all out, and give her Eaſe;</hi> and accordingly I heard it did, for ſhe ſlept twelve Hours immediately after the Time of the Application, and when ſhe awoke the Tents were all drawn out, and ſhe had little further Trouble with it: So it is good to mind Truth and the Workings of it in all Things. I met with the great Doctor (as he was eſteemed) who had it under hand, and he ſaid <hi>I was a bold Fellow:</hi> I ſaid, <hi>it proved well.</hi> He Anſwered, <hi>it was well for me it did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Something more which I have before omitted oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to my Memory: When I was in that Part of <hi>Virginia</hi> towards <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> to viſit Friends, a very great Miſt aroſe, and we went wrong, until the Guides were ſo far loſt, that they confeſt, they knew not Eaſt from Weſt nor on which Hand we had left the Road, although it was in the fore Part of the Day, but neither Wind or Sun to be felt or ſeen; then I told them, <hi>I would try what I could do, if they did but know what Quarter we ſhould go to:</hi> They ſaid, <hi>we ſhould go towards the South;</hi> then I brought out my little Compaſs which I had made before I left <hi>England,</hi> and took it in my Hand and

ſteer'd by it, till we all came into the Road; for that inward Senſe I had, did perſuade me, that we were to the Weſtward of the Road, ſo leaning a little to the Eaſtward of the South Point, we came right as before, and when ſo, the Guides much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, and ſaid, <hi>I was fitter to be Guide in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs Country than they.</hi> My Compaſs was not ſo big as a <hi>Tailor's</hi> Thimble, which had often been of Uſe to me, and others with me.</p>
               <p>Now the Time came on for my leaving all my near and dear Friends in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that I have not only offered up my Liberty, but Life alſo, for thy Name and Goſpel's ſake;</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the Fear and Reaſonings about human Power was taken away from me.</p>
               <p>I being not well, and weary with walking from the Ship, ſat down to reſt myſelf unbidden, when there came a friendly well carriaged young Woman, who I ſuppoſed to be a Servant, and ſpoke kindly to us; I deſired her to do as much for us as to give us ſomething that was ſmall to drink, for we were very thirſty and had been much out of Health, and were not well recovered ſince we came from the Sea, having had rough Weather: She brought us Wine and Water, and a Thing to mix them in; ſo tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of a Glaſs of Water, and a very little Wine poured into it, I drank and was very well refreſhed. By this Time ſhe Governor called us into an upper Room, and as I came near to the Top of the Stairs, going but faintly, for Reaſons before given, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor put forth his Hand and reached to take hold of mine, and like a tender Father drew me up, and led me along towards a great Window, and ſtood and looked on me and ſaid, <hi>He believed he knew what I was, and my Buſineſs too,</hi> I reply'd, <hi>it might be ſo,</hi> and aſked, <hi>if he was the Governor of that Place?</hi> He ſaid <hi>he was,</hi> and bowed his Head. I then ſpoke to him in the Love of God and ſaid. <hi>Thy Countenance beſpeaks Moderation, and the Apoſtle ſaid,</hi> Let your Moderation appear to all Men, for the Lord is at hand; and it was with me to ſay to him, <hi>The Lord of Heaven and Earth bleſs thee and all thine?</hi> He bade us ſit down, and gave us each a Glaſs of Wine,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:008308_0399_102E8ADAB3FF6AA8"/>
and enquired <hi>from whence we came?</hi> I told him <hi>my Home was in Old</hi> England, <hi>but it was long ſince I was there; my Companion's was in</hi> Virginia, He wanting to know the Affairs in <hi>Europe,</hi> I told him, <hi>There was a Merchant belonging to the ſame Ship that we did, who was lately come from</hi> Europe, <hi>and I thought was a Man of Parts and Memory, and well verſed in the Affairs of thoſe Parts of the World, and when we came into this Place he was with us:</hi> The Governor then ſent for him, and when he came, he anſwered his Expectation in reſolving all or moſt of his Queſtions, for the Knowledge of the News appear'd to me to be the young Man's Talent. Having done with and diſmiſs'd him, he ſaid, <hi>he muſt now have ſome Diſcourſe with us:</hi> Then roſe up all the great Men who were with the Governor, to make way that I might come near him. I ſaid, <hi>If it was the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Mind, I had rather ſit where I was, for I ſat well in the Air, and that ſuited well with my preſent Weakneſs:</hi> So he bade them all ſit down, and they did ſo.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:008308_0401_102E8ADDB8DC3A88"/>
or by Land, for he had a Boat, and a couple of Hands ſhould carry us where we would; or if we had a Deſire to ride, he had two Horſes, we might take them and keep them as long as we ſtaid upon the Iſland. I endeavoured to perſuade him to let us go without troubling himſelf any further, for I was ſenſible of his good Will and Love to us, and having his Countenance, was more than we expected, and as much as we deſir'd. He ſtill urging to I know after what Manner we would chooſe to go? I told him, I was very ſenſible of his Generoſity to us who were Strangers, and if he would be eaſy and let us paſs, we had wherewithal to defray our neceſſary Charges either by Water or Land, as would anſwer beſt with our Conveniency. He preſs'd upon us to accept of his Offer, for he ſaid, he did not do it in Complement to us: Then ſeeing no way but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his generous Offer, I ſaid, Riding at preſent would be much more acceptable to me, conſidering how I had been lately fatigued at Sea, of which I was not yet well. He immediately gave Orders for the Horſes to be brought to the Door, which being done, and we having Notice thereof, I roſe up and made an Offer to go, and the Governor likewiſe roſe up and came and took me by the Hand, and ſo we went down the large Stairs into the great Room where we firſt entered in the Lord's Dread and holy Fear. Read this thou that canſt, and withal learn to underſtand, here I had reſign'd my Life and all to the Lord who gave it, and my Life at that time, as at many other times, was not dear to me for Chriſt's ſake; and being thus reſigned, I felt the
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:008308_0402_102E8AE06EE83590"/>
Love of God, and a Meaſure of that Life was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, in which I had Dominion over Men, Bonds, and over Death and the Powers of Darkneſs, bleſſed be the Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>Now coming to take Horſe, I looked out at the Door and ſaw two Horſes, and a Man holding them beyond the Pavement, and the Centry as before in the Street, and the Horſe next the Door, which I ſuppoſed I was to ride on, had a Saddle on the Back of it ſet about with three Rows of ſhining Silver Lace, I thought about two Inches broad each: The Governor holding me by the Hand and looking in my Face, its not unlikely but he might think, is I uſed to ſay, <hi>I looked very ſheepiſhly at it.</hi> He ſaid to me, I am apt to think you are not uſed to ride upon ſuch a Saddle as this; I told him, if he could let me have one more like myſelf (plain) without much Trouble, I ſhould like it the better, but if not, I could ride on it, I thought without much Straitneſs, in caſe of Neceſſity. He anſwered, he could not, for Horſes and Saddles too were ſcarce on that Iſland, for the one was that which he rode on, and the other was for his Man; but he ſaid, he would tell me how to prevent all this: If, ſaid he, you get over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of Water, though he queſtion'd it, becauſe the Wind blew very ſtrong in the Mouth or Inlet of the River; but, he ſaid, he ſpoke not this to hinder our taking his Horſes; but if we get over, he ſaid we ſhould come to <hi>Richard Stafford's</hi> an old Judge of Life and Death, and might aſk there for the Cover for his Saddle, which ties on with little Straps at each Corner, and hides all this, and then it will be
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:008308_0403_102E8AE451AE0810"/>
like yourſelf; but if the Ferry-man, ſays he, cannot carry the Horſes over, what Man ſoever you meet, white or black, if capable, tell him he muſt bring me my Horſes, he dares do no other but bring them; and be ſure you take no further Thought for them: And if we met with any thing in his Liberty that might trouble us, let him but know and he would help it, if it lay in his Power; and ſo with his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on us, we took leave of him and came to the Water ſide, but could not get the Horſes over, therefore ſent them back again, and intended to have ſtaid at the Ferry-houſe all Night, but the Boat was about going over as we lighted; and Notice being got ſome way or other to the Judge's Ear, that there were two Strangers on the other Side of the Water, he had ſent a Boat and a couple of Men for us, who ſaid we muſt go, for the Judge ſaid, he could not ſleep until we came; whatſoever the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, we know not, ſaid they: So we went, after aſking if they at the Ferry-houſe had been at any Coſt or Trouble on our Account in providing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for as yet we had not eaten any thing ſince we landed; the People ſaid no, they had not done any thing which we ſhould pay for: It grew dark and very ſtormy, and the Sea broke over the Boat, ſo that ſome of us were forced to hold our Coat Laps one to touch another on the Weather Side, to keep out the Breakers of the Waves, that they might not fill the Boat, and we came ſafe over to the Judge's Houſe, and no ſooner got into the Paſſage but his friendly Wife met us, and aſked us, <hi>If we were the Strangers her Huſband had ſent for?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>We are

               <p>As I entered the Houſe, I felt, the Love of God, and his Glory, I thought, ſhore in and fill'd every Room as I paſſed through them, and I ſaid, <hi>Peace be to this Place,</hi> and I felt it was ſo. He required of our Travels, and from whence we came, of which we gave him a brief Account; he alſo aſked if I knew any thing of the Family of <hi>Staffords</hi> at <hi>Laborn,</hi> near <hi>Haverford weſt,</hi> in <hi>South Wales?</hi> I told him all I knew about them, both of the Dead and of the Living; with which he was pleaſed, and ſaid, <hi>He had not heard of them many Years, and that Family were his near Kindred.</hi>

which he readily aſſented, if he was not worſe of his Diſtemper, and then ordered how we ſhould ride, and which Negro ſhould go, not only to help his Wife but us alſo, and take our Horſes when there was Occaſion, and do any thing he could for us; and indeed ſo he did, and appeared to me to run on his Feet without much Trouble, being a lively young Man.</p>
               <p>I omitted before, that the Judge aſked, <hi>If we had ſeen the Governor,</hi> and <hi>if he was kind to us?</hi> I told him he was very friendly to us, and ſaid, <hi>If we met with any Trouble in his Liberty that he could help us in, only let him know and he would right us.</hi> The Judge ſaid, <hi>It was very well, and he was glad of it.</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Judge was rather a Moderator of the Governor, he being an ancient wiſe Man, and had lived long as a Judge upon the Iſland, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (it is like) more fully the State of Things there than the Governor could be capable of, he being but a young Man, altho' he appeared to be a wiſe Man, and, as <hi>William Penn</hi> ſaid, came of an ancient and honourable Family in <hi>England.</hi> which he knew very well, whoſe Name was <hi>Bennett.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I told <hi>William Penn</hi> how it had fared with us on that Iſland, and eſpecially the Kindneſs of the two chief Men in Power there, and <hi>William Penn</hi> wept, and ſaid, <hi>He had not heard any Account of this Nature, that he had been ſo much affected with, as he remembred theſe many Years.</hi>

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:008308_0406_102E8AEC630FDC50"/>
but the Lord's heavenly Power bore me up over all, ſo that at Times I felt no want of any thing; Oh! Renowned over all be the Name of the mighty God, now and for ever. We went to Bed, and when Morning came, I with my Companion were ſtirring early, having eight Miles to the Meeting, and it being in the latter End of the Ninth Month, we were willing to be in ſuch Time, that we might give ſome Notice to the People. I was walking in our Lodging Room early, and the Judge's Wife came to the Door and aſked, <hi>if ſhe might ſpeak with us?</hi> I ſaid <hi>ſhe might;</hi> then ſhe came in and ſaid, <hi>She had a Meſſage from her Huſband to us;</hi> I queried, <hi>what it was?</hi> She ſaid, <hi>He deſired we would come and pray for him before we went away.</hi> I deſired ſhe would favour us ſo much as to lay before her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſomething which I had to ſay, and ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhe would: <hi>Well then, tell the Judge, that if he will ſuffer us to come into his Room, and ſit down and wait upon the Lord, as our Manner is in ſuch a Caſe as this, if it pleaſe the Lord to move us by his holy Spirit to pray we may; but if not, let not the Judge take it amiſs, for we are willing to be at the Lord's diſpoſing in all Things.</hi> She went, and I believe, as ſhe ſaid, laid the Matter before him as I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it to her; for ſhe was a Woman of a good Underſtanding, and came back again to us in a very little Time: I aſked, <hi>what the Judge ſaid?</hi> She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, he ſaid, <hi>Let the Men take their own Way, and whether they pray for me or not, I believe they are Men of God:</hi> So after ſome little reſpite, we being brought to the Judge's Bed-ſide, ſat down and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:008308_0407_102E8AEF2344BF60"/>
waited upon the Lord, who was pleaſed in his Love and by his mighty Power to break in upon us, and alſo opened my Mouth in his Gift of Grace and of Supplication, in which Gift, ardent and fervent. Cries went up to the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he would ſend Health and Salvation to the Judge, and alſo to all his Family, and to all People far and near, that all every where might repent, and come to the Knowledge of he Truth and be ſaved. The Judge wept aloud, and a mighty Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it was to his Family, and eſpecially to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his tender Wife. We left the Judge in a fine Frame of Spirit, and no doubt near the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, having his Bleſſing and earneſt Requeſt, that when we could reach his Houſe we would not fail to come to it, for we were very welcome; and I found and felt it ſo, and it was moſtly our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: His Wife and Foot-page went with us to all the Meetings, except one, while we were on the Iſland, which was about two Weeks, in which Time we had many good Opportunities among a ſober be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved and well carriaged People, amongſt whom we met with, no Oppoſition, but had large quiet Meetings.</p>
               <p>When we were clear, as we thought, of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, we went to take our ſolid Leaves of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, acknowledging his Civility and Generoſity to us Strangers, and I told him and the Judge. <hi>That they would not leant their Reward for what they had done to us, and ſuch who ſhould take their Lives as in their Hands, and come in the Love of God to viſit theſe remote Parts of the World, which we durſt

not have undertaken if we had not believed it required of us by Almighty, and our Peace concerned in it, as alſo the Glory of God, and the Good of the Children of Men; theſe are the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ves to thoſe our great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings:</hi> or Words to that Purpoſe. So we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in much Love with theſe great Men, eſpecially the Judge, with Tears on his Face, as alſo his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and friendly Wife, who had been very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to us in ordering Meetings and making way for us, and none like her in all the Iſland, that we met withal, ſhe being given up to that Service, for the encouraging Truth and Friends in what ſhe was capable of.</p>
               <p>Being invited to a Friend's Houſe to dine one Day, when we were ſat down at the Table, the Woman of the Houſe deſired <hi>that one of us would ſay Grace;</hi> from which I took an Occaſion to ſhew her, and ſeveral more in the Company, who appear'd not much more grown in the Truth than ſhe, <hi>that ſince we had been a People, we had both believed</hi> (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly practis'd) <hi>that</hi> true Prayer <hi>was not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the</hi> Help of the holy Spirit of God, <hi>and no Man could pray</hi> aright <hi>and</hi> acceptably <hi>without it; nor was it in Man's Power to have it</hi> when he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>therefore it is Man's Place to wait upon the Lord for the</hi> pouring forth of this Gift <hi>upon him, and alſo to know whether it</hi> be required of him to pray, <hi>ſo as to be heard by Man, or only to pray</hi> ſecretly, <hi>ſo as to be heard of God, as did</hi> Hannah, <hi>and many more have done; which, as they do aright, no doubt but as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples,</hi> their Father will hear them in ſecret, and reward them openly; or to this Effect: With which they all appeared ſatisfied.</p>

not only of the Man's Ignorance of us as a People, but of me in particular, and his Envy againſt me be made known;</hi> upon which I opened to her the Caſe of ſuch Journeys and Services, how we proceeded, and how the Meetings were conſtituted in which we did ſo proceed, and from whence we had Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, from Monthly, Quarterly, or Meetings of Miniſters to which we belonged, and from Friends in the ſeveral Provinces and Iſlands where we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if we deſired them, many of which I could ſhew the Judge if Time would admit; but ſhe ſaid, left we ſhould be called away in haſt, ſhe craved to ſee ſome of thoſe Certificates: I ſhewed her them, beginning at the firſt, wherein Friends of <hi>Kelk,</hi> now <hi>Bridlington</hi> Monthly-meeting in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> to Friends in <hi>America,</hi> ſhewed not only their full Unity with this my preſent Journey, but alſo with my Service for the Truth, and Converſation in the ſame, where I had lived and travelled; and that I had ſettled my outward Affairs to Friends Satisfaction, under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hands variouſly writ.</p>
               <p>When this great and wiſe Woman ſaw this, ſhe ſaid, <hi>I was enough;</hi> but I ſhewed her other Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates from divers Places, wherein Friends had ſignified ſufficiently their Unity and Satisfaction with me. I likewiſe informed her, that in caſe any Man, not approved by us as a Miniſter, did take upon him to impoſe his Preaching upon any who were Strangers to him, ſuch as knew him took Care to acquaint the Churches therewith, if his Intentions could be known, that no Impoſtor might do any Hurt: All which ſhe admired, and ſaid <hi>ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </p>
               <p>Having thus acquainted her with our Order and Diſcipline, and afterwards informed her of the Cauſe of our unexpected Return, I renewed my Propoſal of having my Accuſer before the Judge; ſhe told me, ſhe had good Place with her Huſband, and would endeavour to obtain it: And accordingly, after talking with him, ſhe let me know, that the Judge expreſſed his Readineſs to do me any Service which lay in his Power, and was of Opinion, my Accuſer durſt not face either him or me in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, but that if the Wind continued againſt us, he would try to find him out and bring him, which might be of Service; but if the Wind favoured, ſhe thought I might be eaſy to go; as indeed I was, and the more ſo, conſidering that our Captain <hi>Salter,</hi> who lived near the Judge on the ſame Iſland, had ſhewed a great deal of Patience and good Diſpoſition to us-ward for about two Weeks, yet would gladly be gone; ſo about Mid-night we were called to go on board the Ship, for the Wind was fair, if we were ready; I reply'd, <hi>we come quickly,</hi> and ſo we did, and took leave of all we ſaw of the Family, and remembered our dear Love, with grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the Judge, for all his Civility and Kindneſſes he had done to us, with Reaſons why we could not ſee him, for he had been afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome time with the Gout, and was now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſome Reſt, and we going very early away, were not at our own Diſpoſal.</p>

                  <pb n="158" facs="unknown:008308_0412_102E8AFD053ED5A0"/>
I admired the Lord's good Providence in all this, and there was ſomething of a Reach from the ſame watchful Providence, to order that to be put into my Certificate which did, ſo fully remove that Slur this Enemy would have faſtened upon me, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that <hi>I had broke in</hi> England, <hi>and could not pay my Debts,</hi> and therefore was come into theſe remote Parts of the World, where I was unknown, <hi>to preach for a Livelihood;</hi> but the contrary fully appear'd, that I was known and well beloved too, and had Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to diſcharge any juſt Demand upon me, bleſſed be the worthy Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</p>
               <p>Now I may lay ſomething of our Affairs upon the Sea in this Voyage: When Captain <hi>Salter</hi> had taken us in Paſſengers at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> it being a time of War, and People ſomewhat afraid of ſhipping Goods, he ſaid, he was to have two honeſt <hi>Quakers</hi> Paſſengers, and he did not fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by Privateers nor Pirates. I was troubled at his Confidence in us, and told him ſo, and that it was much if the Lord did not ſuffer us to be taken, that he might ſee Men were not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, but that we ought to depend upon the Lord alone for Protection and Deliverance: However, in much leſs time than was expected, Goods came, and we were loaded and gone. We had rough Weather before we came to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> (I have given an Account of <hi>Bermudas</hi>) eſpecially about the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> we had very high Winds, and I was extreamly Sea-ſick, and ſo was my Companion, and I could eat little, but was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with remarkable Civilities by the Captain; for
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:008308_0413_102E8AFFAFC77DB8"/>
in and about that Latitude there are Fiſh not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Herrings, which fly from Wave to Wave, and by dipping their Fins or Wings in the Water, they will fly a great Way, eſpecially when they are chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fiſhes of Prey, and almoſt every Morning there were of thoſe Fiſhes found on the Ship's Deck; and the Captain often ſaid, as his Manner was, Mr. <hi>Richardſon</hi> theſe are ſent for you, or for your Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and ſeeing it is ſo, I will dreſs them myſelf, for I know, ſaid he, my Cook is ſo greaſy you can hardly eat of his Cookery, which was very true; and therefore he would waſh his Hands, and lay a clean Napkin on his Arm, and tell me he would dreſs me my Breakfaſt in the beſt Faſhion he could. I aſked him <hi>why he would put himſelf to ſo much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> He ſaid, he never waited on a Man in all his Life with ſo much Pleaſure, and if I were going, into any Country where he was going, I ſhould not pay any thing for my Paſſage; ſo much Reſpect he ſhewed to me.</p>
               <p>Now it happened in the Courſe of this Voyage, when we were within a few Leagues of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> one Morning early as ſoon as Day appear'd, he that was aloft (upon the Watch to look out, as the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mariners is, eſpecially in the Time of Wars and Danger) eſpied a Ship which he and the reſt of our moſt knowing Men ſuppos'd to be a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Frigate, of conſiderable Strength; however, it was a great Veſſel, and appeared to have a great, many Guns: When we firſt ſaw her, ſhe appeared to be within Gun-ſhot. But oh, what a Surprize and Fright our Ship's Crew were in! I had not often ſeen the like. Our Veſſel being deep
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:008308_0414_102E8B038D2BC3E0"/>
loaded, although a good Sailer, was leſs than that which chaſed us, and to run for it appear'd the only way for us to eſcape, hauling as cloſe to the Wind as we could to keep the Sails full; and the Veſſel being ſtiff with its great Burthen, endured Sail well, and indeed they crowded ſo much Sail, that I told them I tear'd they would bring the Rigging by the board, ſo thus we laboured until Noon, and then our Captain had loſt all his Confidence in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and ſaid we ſhall be taken, for the Ship has gain'd upon us for ſeveral Hours, and we have done what we can, and are all ſpent: I walked upon the Main-deck under no ſmall Concern of Mind, and Truth fore, and I found it open in the Truth, <hi>that we ſhould not be taken:</hi> The Captain ſaid, binding it with ſome Aſſervations, we ſhall certainly be taken. I ſaid, <hi>No, we ſhall not, unleſs by our Miſmanagement.</hi> Alas! ſaid he, you are ſuch a Man as I never met withal; do you not ſee the Frigate, or <hi>Sallec-man,</hi> for that he called her, is juſt going to fire a Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide at us, opening the Gun Ports, and laying the Ship broad Side upon us, and levelling at her as well as they can? And indeed our Captain, altho' he was a ſtout Man, yet appear'd very ghaſtly and dead-hearted, and ſaid (in a Tone which beſpoke both Affliction and Trouble) to me, Go into my Cabbin, or ſome where under the Deck, for they will fire immediately; and that where I walked I could hardly eſcape either the Shot or the Rigging falling upon me. I ſaid, <hi>they will not fire; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to be eaſy, for we ſhould come to no Damage by that Ship.</hi> Well then, he aſked what they
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:008308_0415_102E8B063A4E0298"/>
ſhould do, for the Enemy was juſt upon us? I ſaid, <hi>I would peach them a Beatle or two, or more of my beſt Brandy, and they ſhould take as much as might do them good; but have a Care of more, and ply away a while and you will ſee they will fall back, and we ſhall leave them.</hi> The Captain ſaid, although there was no human Probability of eſcaping, yet for my Sake they would try, and to work they went. I think I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw Men on board of any Ship work like them for ſome Hours, and we ſoon perceived we outſailed them, and by the time it began to be dark we had leſt them conſiderably.</p>
               <p>Now all Fire and Light was forbidden, except what could not be avoided, and all Noiſe, and a Council was held, to conſult what Way to ſteer, whether the neareſt or moſt common way for the Iſland, or about; for it was reaſonable to conclude the Adverſary would way-lay us, if he could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came to the Iſland; and the Captain ſaid, what I ſaid in the Caſe ſhould be done: After ſome Deliberation I told him, <hi>I was moſt eaſy in ſteering the neareſt Courſe,</hi> which we did, and ſaw our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary no more.</p>
               <p>We came to the Iſland next Day in much Joy, that we had eſcaped ſo imminent a Danger, but I was very ill in a <hi>Fever</hi> when I landed, which had been growing upon me for ſeveral Days, (this being the Sixth-day of the Week, and 18th of the <hi>Tenth Month</hi>) I was ſo poorly, that ſeveral thought I muſt die; but I ſtood reſigned in the Will of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die or live.

                  <p>She was very clear in her Underſtanding, had a penetrating and diſcerning Eye, a great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſe of the State of a Meeting, as alſo of their ſeveral particular States.

                  <p>She appeared and behaved herſelf as became a ſanctified Veſſel, that was in a good Degree fitted and
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:008308_0432_102E8B34189C0C80"/>
prepared for the great Maſter's Uſe, and often appeared as one than had been ſecretly in ſome Intercourſe with Jeſus Chriſt in Spirit, where his Glory had more particularly ſhone in and over her Soul, not only becauſe of the Gravity and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of her Countenance, but alſo the Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Humility and Sweetneſs of her Mind and Spirit, Weightineſs of her Converſation, Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her Advice, Soundneſs of her Judgment, and Clearneſs of her Underſtanding, all which made her Company very acceptable while among the Living Her Heart was often fill'd with the Love of God, and early raiſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſpeak a Word in Seaſon unto many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Conditions, Whether of home or abroad, in her own Family, amongſt her Neighbours, or in the Church of Chriſt, in Teſtimony to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to the Worſhip of God, or in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Diſcipline, eſpecially in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her own Sex, where ſhe had a great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and will be greatly wanted.

Alſo her watchful and ſolid ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in our Meetings for Worſhip was remarkable,

with very little Motion that was perceivable; yet when the leaſt Stirrings of Life in her Mind were perceived, in order to bring her forth in Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Meeting was truly glad, and the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt us rejoiced at it, for her Appearance was with the Wiſe, and in the Language of the holy Spirit; which was a clear Demonſtration that the Work was the Lord's, and by and through his Spirit and Power; all which gave her a great Place in the Minds of faithful Friends and Brethren. But ſhe is gone in the Prime and Flower of her Age! which ſets before end is a Memento unto us to ſhew us the Uncertainty of our Time here, and to prepare for one Certain to come, that Death may not overtake us as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares before we are prepared for it.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Time of her long Weakneſs, in which ſhe was preſerved in great Patience, Steadineſs and Reſignation of Mind to the Will of God, even unto the End; and ſhe enjoyed much heavenly Comfort and Conſolation in the living Preſence of the Lord to her immortal Soul, ſo that when ſhe was aſked, Whether ſhe thought ſhe might recover or not?

               <p>IN the Year 1722 it was renewed upon me to go into <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Thoughts of it had been long upon my Mind, but now the Time ſeemed to be fully come, to pay that long thought of Viſit; and <hi>Joſeph Bunting</hi> of <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I had there many good Meetings, and alſo met with ſome hard ones (as is the Let of ſuch who are called to this Vocation) and the beſt way I have found, when I met with ſuch, is firſt to regard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Vocation into which we are called, and take ſpecial Care to have along with us the <hi>Company</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> of him that hath ſo called us; this is the way fully and truly to diſcharge ourſelves of that Truſt the Lord hath repoſed in us, to the mutual Comfort and Edification of the Churches of Chriſt, and alſo to the Peace and Conſolation of our own Souls.</p>
               <p>It is now with me to write the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on <hi>Ireland,</hi> which will not be remote to the State of Friends in many other Places, where there is a right, found, living Miniſtry preſerved, and good Diſcipline exerciſed, which moſtly go together: There Truth and Friends arc kept generally in good Eſteem, and alſo thriving; but where theſe fail, eſpecially the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> oh! how undue Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the Faſhions of the World, with many corrupting Things, creep in amongſt the Profeſſors of Truth, even unto the Reproach thereof, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of theſe who are ſo prevailed upon; and hearty Sorrow of ſuch as know and feel the Hurt of theſe Things: Oh! what a Hinderance this is to the Progreſs of the ever bleſſed Truth in the Earth; and indeed it hath been in my Mind, that the main Work in this our Day is to ſearch into the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and endeavour to bring them into ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that it may once more be ſaid, <hi>Fellow Chriſt as you have us for Examples;</hi> not only here and there one, but the Believers in general; ſo it will be, when we as a People all ſpeak the ſame Thing, or that which is agreeable, as well in our Practice (ſo often recommended) as in Faith and Doctrine; for I have ever underſtand <hi>Examples</hi> to be more

               <p>If we as a People ſhould follow ſuch Examples as I have touched upon, certainly we ſhall become an Hiſſing and a Bye-word to all Nations round about, who may have heard of us, and what great Things the Lord of Hoſts hath done for us ſince we became a People, as may, and has been ſeen and heard in Examples, Words and Writings from our faithful Friends and Brethren (the chief Promulgators of Truth and Righteouſneſs) in their unwearied La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Faith and Sufferings for the Cauſe and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Jeſs Chriſt; and what alſo was not leſs remarkable, by their exemplary Lives of Plainneſs, Humility, Sincerity, and Self-denial, with Works of Charity.</p>

               <p>Here is Work for ſuch as God hath ſet up as Watchmen over his People, to ſee that thoſe do not go on in Bye-ways, who profeſs Truth, and leave the Way of Truth unoccupied by them; here is Work for the true Judges, who have the Spirit of Judgment upon them: And not with ſtanding ſome, here and there, who may be found in the faithful Diſcharge of that Truth the Lord hath repoſed in them, may meet with ſome Oppoſition from ſuch as are unfaithful, and not willing to be bounded and girded by the Truth, no not ſo much as to an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conformity</hi> to the Plainneſs and Decency, ſo much and frequently recommended by the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by publick Teſtimonies, and alſo in our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for Discipline; for it is a considerable.

Now my tender and well beloved Friends, watch againſt and ſtrive to keep out the Enemy that <hi>he enter not;</hi> for what way ſoever he enters and gets Footing, he defiles God's Temple, and before thou witneſſed if the Lord to Deſtroy him and call him out again, thou muſt have many a ſore Combat, and ſome Warfare (perhaps more than thou art aware of) before thou gaineſt all the Ground thou haſt leſt, by giving way to the Adverſary of thy Soul; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep upon thy <hi>Watch-tower, watch unto the End, watch and pray continually, that he enter not into Temptation,</hi> ſaid our great Lord unto his Followers: for I have found by Experience, that it is harder to gain what we have loſt, than to keep it while we had it; and to improve our Talents, is not only the way to have them continued, but alſo to have them more abundantly added unto us; but ſuch as do not improve what is given unto them, even that which they have been intruſted with ſhall be taken from them: Oh! how deſolate and miſerable ſuch will be in the Day of Account, when Chriſt like a great Shepherd, divides the <hi>Sheep</hi> from the <hi>Coats,</hi> and between the <hi>Slothful</hi> and the <hi>Faithful Servants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>wife</hi> and the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and between all thoſe who adhered to, obey'd, and followed him according to the Meaſure of Light and Knowledge received, and thoſe who have rejected and diſobeyed the Strivings and Convictions of God's holy Light, and bleſſed Spirit, placed in the Hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men to enlighten, inſtruct, reprove, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and guide, according to the State of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Mind, as it is conformable or diſobedient to

               <p>We journeyed from <hi>Dublin</hi> towards <hi>Cork,</hi> and had ſeveral Meetings in our Way, as at <hi>Ballicane, Culladine, Wexford, Lamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>miſt</hi> Miniſter, and a Doctor of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> who were like to go all or moſt of the Way with me, as the Aſſizes were coming on, and would be at me with Arguments about Religion, which I ſoon, found true; for we were no ſooner got into a ſuitable Way but they began with me, which I endeavoured to prevent by telling them, I did not look upon myſelf to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for <hi>Diſputes;</hi> and withal I obſerved, that ſometimes Diſputants ended in a worſe Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of another than when they began, except they minded well to keep good Government; and now as we appeared free and friendly, how we might be when we had ended our Diſpute, was a Queſtion, therefore I had rather they would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear: But they turned the deaf Ear to all that I ſaid, and nothing would do with them, but a Diſpute we muſt have, I then aſked them what they would ſay? They queried, <hi>Whether all Men were placed in a Station capable of Salvation, yea or nay?</hi> I replied, if I ſhould give my poſitive Thoughts to your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we ſhall have Occaſion to go back to treat of the Nature, not only of the upright State Man was in before he fell, but alſo how he fell; and alſo in the Fall, how he ſtands as in Relation to his Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which brings us to the Queſtion. Although this be not the uſual Way of Diſputants, yet if you will ſubmit to it, it will either Anſwer your Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſet it in a clearer Light for an Anſwer. They aſked, <hi>How could that be?</hi> I replied, if it did not, they might ſay ſo. They then ſo far condeſcended
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:008308_0451_102E8B670BD148A8"/>
as to hear me, and I ſaid, <hi>firſt,</hi> we all agree in this that Man was made upright; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that he fell from, that Uprightneſs; the Queſtion then is, <hi>How? Anſw.</hi> By the Offence or Diſobedience of the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin entred and Condemnation came upon all who had ſinned. I then queried of the Diſputants, whether they believed that <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall did affect all thoſe who did not hear of it, as well as thoſe who did? For, I ſaid, there were ſome of Opinion, that thoſe who had not the explicit or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Knowledge of the promiſed Seed or coming of Chriſt, had not the Benefit of his Coming; and except they would firſt allow, that all were affected or hurt by <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, then ſuch as were not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Paradiſe to this Day, except they would make the Remedy leſs than the Diſeaſe, the Plaiſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> leſs than the Sore, and Chriſt's Coming leſs exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall. I argued, that upon the foot of Reaſon, as well as what we had in plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Chriſt's Coming was as extenſive as the Fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> for, <hi>by the Obedience of Chriſt, the Gift of God Came upon all unto Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I think, ſaid I, your Queſtion is ſet in a clear Light for an Anſwer, or elſe Anſwered; ſo take it at what End you will (laying aſide all Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling) I intend to join Iſſue with you, and prove that <hi>all Men are placed in a Station capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> or otherwiſe you muſt leave a great Part of the World in Paraoiſe, or make the Coming of Chriſt leſs extenſive than the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> I then queri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what they ſaid to all this? They anſwer'd, <hi>they never heard the like before, and they would not meddle</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:008308_0452_102E8B69C461C3E0"/>
                  <hi>with me, I was too great a Scholar for them.</hi> I ſaid, there was little of Scholarſhip in it; I offered, I thought, nothing but plain Scripture and ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and I told them, I had now as good as anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Queſtion, and had given ſeveral Reaſons to back my Anſwer, and as they appeared wiſe, well read Men, and as far as I had gathered, had been principled againſt <hi>univerſal Salvation,</hi> and <hi>univerſal Grace,</hi> for them now to drop the Matter ſo ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before me who appear'd but like a Child to them, was very ſurprizing: But they replied, <hi>they would not meddle with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I then commended them for their good Temper, and the Civility they ſhewed to me, for they were civil to me beyond what I could expect; and they invited me to the Burial of one of their deceaſed Friends, but I could not go, for I was in haſte to get to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> having ſome Buſineſs there that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened me. Now at parting with them, my Soul magnified the Lord, under a Senſe of his Goodneſs to me, in that he had opened my Way, and helped me through this Difficulty, with many other Trials and Afflictions I had met with.</p>
               <p>I had at another Time ſome Reaſonings with a <hi>Papiſt</hi> who was my Neighbour, about the <hi>Viſibility</hi> of their Church, and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> with ſeveral other Things. As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſhewed him, that <hi>the true Church, fled into the Wilderneſs, where ſhe was for Times, Times, and half a Time;</hi> in this State we do not read ſhe had any outward Character as a viſible Church; and that if they derived their Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, it was from ſome falſe Church, and not

through the true one. And as to the other, they took too much upon them, more than they could juſtify from Scripture, or clearly demonſtrate from Chriſt or his Apoſtles; for Chriſt never gave any of them ſuch a Commiſſion, as to <hi>convert Bread and Wine</hi> into <hi>real Fleſh and Blood,</hi> and then to call it <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You, ſaid I, by theſe Notions, deceive yourſelves and your Adherents; for Chriſt ſpoke unto ſuch as you by Parables, becauſe they were carnal, and did not underſtand the Meaning of his Sayings in this Caſe, no more than the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood what Chriſt meant, when he ſpoke of deſtroying <hi>this Temple</hi> (meaning his Body) which they underſtood was of that Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which they made a great Wonder at, and ſaid, <hi>How can this be, that he can deſtroy this Temple, and raiſe it up again in three Days, when it was Forty eight Years in building?</hi> Thus they reaſoned carnally, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (though a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the <hi>Jews</hi>) did concerning <hi>Regeneration</hi> or the <hi>new Birth;</hi> and as the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> did, from whence Chriſt ſhould have that living Water, which he ſpoke of, that <hi>ſhould be in Man as a Well of living Water, ſpringing up unto everlaſting Life;</hi> and as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you;</hi> they ſaid, <hi>How can this be, that he can give us his Fleſh to eat, and his Blood to drink?</hi> But this is a ſpiritual Eating and Drinking; even as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Out of the Belly of him that believes, ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters; which he ſpoke of the Spirit:</hi> In like manner it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelations, Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock, if any hear my</hi>

               <p>I need not ſay much here about <hi>Chriſt's being come;</hi> having ſhewed, in a Conference in <hi>New England,</hi> how he is come to anſwer his Eating and Drinking the Paſſover and laſt Supper with his Diſciples, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>he would drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, Until he drank it new with them in his I Father's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Now he that hath experienced what this Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Drinking is, is come beyond the outward Eating and Drinking, <hi>into the Kingdom</hi> which is <hi>within,</hi> which comes not with outward Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Eatings, Drinkings, nor carnal Ordinances, but the Kingdom of Heaven conſiſts in <hi>Righteouſneſs, Peace and Joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, read this thou that canſt, and learn to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand between the Thing that Points, and the Thing which is pointed at, and between the Thing ſignifying, and the Thing ſignifyed, and miſtake not the Shadow for the Subſtance any longer; for it is poſſible a Man may do all the outward Parts, and yet be ignorant of the Croſs of Chriſt, and of the heavenly Subſtance: But if he is come to the

End of theſe outſide Things, to the Holy of Holles, ſuch will know what it is to miniſter before the Lord in his Temple, and to ſerve and wait at the holy Altar, and live, and have that pure ſpiritual Life preſerved: For we read not of any <hi>Tithes</hi> that appertain to this ſpiritual Prieſthood, or Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; and what their outward Maintenance was to be, is ſhewed by Chriſt, beyond Contradiction, who ſent them forth.

on a little, and to labour in their reſpective Callings, like the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Miniſter of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> working with their Hands that their Miniſtry might not be chargeable, ſuch as <hi>Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Collectors of Cuſtoms,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Miniſtry being not their own, but received immediately from the great Shepherd of the Sheep, would not require much Time and Study to pen down, but coming from the Spirit of Truth immediately moving upon the Miniſter's Heart, would be more effectual to reach the Witneſs of Truth in the Hearts of their Hearers than all the laboured Diſcourſes of the moſt ſubtil Prieſt, though the Produce of much Pains and Study. Neither have I found in all my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, from any Obſervation I have made, that ever the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt became any great Burthen or Charge to the Churches; for I have ſeen the divine Providence attend the Lord's faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who thereby have been enabled to order their Affairs with Diſcretion, ſo as to want little.</p>

Reaſonings about my Age, and Declenſion as to Ability of outward Strength, concerning which I met with ſome inward Conflicts and Combatings which brought me very low for a Time; but the Lord helped me thro' theſe Difficulties, and cauſed his Truth to ſpring comfortably in my Heart, and his heavenly Preſence I witneſſed at Times to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my Soul in theſe Exerciſes unknown to many; and the Time being come for my preparing for the Journey, on the 15th of the <hi>Third Month</hi> 1731, I ſet forward from <hi>Hutton</hi> in the <hi>Hole</hi> to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> where I took ſhipping with <hi>George Widget</hi> for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and came thither the firſt Day of the Yearly-meeting, with which I was very well ſatisfied, and on the 25th Day of the <hi>Fourth Month</hi> went on board of a Veſſel bound for <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>America, John Wilcox</hi> Maſter, who was very civil and kind to me.</p>
               <p>On the 27th of the ſaid <hi>Month</hi> we ſet ſail, and had a good Paſſage in the main, excepting that we had one very great Storm, in which we were in Danger of being loſt; our Bolt-ſprit was broke, and the Maſts were in Danger of coming down, yet we were preſerved and in about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Weeks, being the 12th of the <hi>Seventh Month,</hi> I landed near <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to the great Satisfaction of Friends as well as myſelf, renowned be the great Name of the Lord for ever.</p>
               <p>I have many Times conſidered, that although it was my Place to leave my very near and dear Friends, Children and Relations, who in a tender Frame of Spirit were much concerned for me, and I for them,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:008308_0462_102E8B837AEA1B88"/>
yet I met with many tender-hearted Friends in my Travels, who were very near me in the ever bleſſed Truth; which fails not thoſe who truſt in the Lord, and are faithful, according to the Ability and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which the Lord hath given to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, and are devoted to anſwer the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Guidance of his holy Spirit, and willing to bear the Croſs, Burthen, or Yoke, which he ſees good to lay upon his Servants and Handmaids: And I intreat all ſuch who are called unto the Lord's great Work, to give up cheerfully and not grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and not to look back at what is behind, ſo as to haſten or hinder themſelves in that Work they arc called to, leſt they fall ſhort of that <hi>Penny,</hi> or <hi>Crown,</hi> which the Faithful will receive in the End of all their Labour.</p>
               <p>The Yearly-meeting at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was nigh when we landed, which was large, and a good Meeting, many Friends from ſeveral Parts being at it. Here I met with <hi>Henry Frankland,</hi> and we were truly glad to ſee each other, and went in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany together ſouthward towards <hi>Maryland, Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>North Carolina,</hi> and return'd to <hi>Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> and in a ſhort time after we parted: He came for <hi>England,</hi> and I travelled fur <hi>New-England</hi> through the <hi>Jerſeys, Long-Iſland, Rhode-Iſland</hi> and <hi>Nantucket,</hi> having <hi>Richard Waln</hi> of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, an innocent kind Man; we paſſed through all, or moſt part of the aforeſaid Provinces and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and had very large Meetings, and great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention there was in many to hear the Teſtimony of Truth, and an open Door both of Utterance
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:008308_0463_102E8B8758675080"/>
and in many Places of Entrance, for what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; yet not without Oppoſition in ſome Places.</p>
               <p>I had ſome Diſcourſe with a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace, in one of the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> (a Man whom I truly loved) and he told me that ſome of his Children went to our Meetings, and he did not hinder them; he appeared a tender ſpirited Man, and was of good Repute in theſe Parts where he lived, and very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in his Poſt; What we had moſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was touching <hi>Water-Baptiſm;</hi> I endeavoured to ſhew him the Uſe and End of all the <hi>ſhadowy Things,</hi> all which were ended in Chriſt the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> or Antitype; and that ſuch outward Materials or Elements appertained not unto his Kingdom, or inward and ſpiritual Adminiſtration; nor could they take away the Root or Cauſe of Sin, which is only effected by the holy Ghoſt and Fire, or the holy Ghoſt that worketh as doth Fire, to the cleanſing and purifying the Hearts of the Children of Men, as is the Nature of material Fire to cleanſe what it is properly applied unto.</p>
               <p>I met with the ſame Juſtice afterwards at <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> in <hi>Weſt Jerſey,</hi> he was glad to ſee me, and ſo was I to ſee him, for he was very loving and friendly. I likewiſe met with a Man who was a School-maſter upon <hi>Long Iſland,</hi> that appeared ſomewhat offended at ſomething I had ſaid in a Meeting where he had been, and he followed me to a Friend's Houſe, and appeared ſo full of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Vindication (as he thought) of <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> that what with his reading many Paſſages in the Scriptures, and paraphraſing upon them, he
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:008308_0464_102E8B8A06C8C548"/>
would not hear me for ſome Time; but when he was quiet I ſaid to him, <hi>Thou haſt not treated me like a fair Diſputant, to run on ſo long, and not to give me Time to make my Objections; it thou hadſt pitched upon any particular Scripture, and given me Liberty to have anſwered, it would have been civil and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</hi> He owned, he had not done fairly by me; but I deſired to know, what Church he pretended to belong to? He anſwered, <hi>To the Epiſcopal Church.</hi> I then requeſted he would anſwer me one Queſtion before we entered into any farther Debate, and he promiſed he would if he underſtood it. I told him, I heard he was a Scholar, and no doubt but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how to anſwer it, if he did but conſider the Matter; the Query was this, <hi>Whether the</hi> ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>a little Water in a Child's Face, would bear the Name</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>yea or nay?</hi> He ſaid, it would not. I anſwered, <hi>Thou haſt made a great Pother and Noiſe about little or nothing; for by thy own Confeſſion thy Church has</hi> no Baptiſm <hi>at all, for I know not of any other Way they uſe but</hi> Sprinkling. He would not enter into any farther Diſcourſe about it, but made uſe of the Words of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> in favour of the Work the Apoſtles were concerned in, ſaying, <hi>If this Work be of God it could not be overthrown, but if it was of Man it would come to nought.</hi> I told him, <hi>I was of his Mind; and the Lord hath ſupported me in this and the like Work, now between forty and fifty Years, and if I continued faithful, I had no Doubt at all in my Mind, but he would ſupport and ſtand by me to the End.</hi> And when we parted he ſaid, The Lord of Heaven and Earth bleſs you, for I believe you are an honeſt Man.</p>

By this we may ſee, that Truth ſometimes comes over Men, and the Witneſs which God hath placed in Men is reached, and Truth prevails many times beyond our Expectation, or what is by us foreſeen; therefore it is good to keep to the Guidance or Leading of the Spirit of Truth, for it is a bleſſed Remembrances, Inſtructor, and true Comforter to all ſuch as truly depend upon him, who ſent the Spirit of Truth into the Hearts of the Children of Men, to guide them into all the neceſſary Truths which we are to know and practice, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of ail Untruth.</p>
               <p>When we had gone through this Iſland, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited Friends there, and in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and had ſome Meetings in our Way, we went to <hi>Nantucket,</hi> where we met with many innocent plain Friends; alſo on <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and in many Places in theſe Parts of the Country, we found great Openneſs; in <hi>Boſton</hi> beyond Expectation, and there was ſome Convincement in that Town. We travelled up to <hi>Dover,</hi> and viſited Friends thereabout (which are the moſt remote Parts where Friends inhabit in that Quarter of <hi>New-England</hi>) where I met with a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian</hi> Prieſt: What his Deſign chiefly was in coming to the Friend's Houſe I know not, but thought it was to ſee, or rather ſpeak with me, for he ſoon began to aſk me ſome Queſtions; firſt, <hi>Whether I was not brought up a Scholar, and had been in ſome of the Colleges where I had my Education?</hi> And alſo, <hi>Whether I had not put on the canonical Gown, and preached according to the Manner of the Church of</hi> England? I replied, I had not received my Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:008308_0466_102E8B8E32C56408"/>
in any College, neither ever put on the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Gown, nor preached after the Manner of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He told me, <hi>I had been ſo repreſented to him;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>be ſuppoſed I had been at ſome Schools:</hi> I told him, I had been at ſeveral to learn when I was young; and ſaid, I did not know that I had given Occaſion at any Time, by what I had ſaid, whereby any Man might judge me to be a Scholar. He underſtood I came from old <hi>England,</hi> and began to aſk ſeveral Queſtions, as <hi>Whether our Friends increaſed or decreaſed?</hi> I anſwered, I could not poſitively tell; I thought there was no great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in my Time as to Number, for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in one Fart of the Nation, I thought might be made up by their Increaſe in another Part. He alſo aſked me, <hi>How the epiſcopal Miniſters dealt with us about their Tithes?</hi> My Anſwer was thus; As to that Part called the <hi>Praedial Tithes,</hi> they commonly either gather them themſelves or Family, or ſet them to Tenants who take care to ferch them away before us, knowing that we cannot be free to leave them on the Ground, as Hay and Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as to <hi>ſmall Tithes,</hi> there is an <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Tithes, for any Sum not exceeding forty Shillings, and ten Shillings Coſt;</hi> which is by Juſtice's Warrants. This is moſtly thought to be intended to prevent their Procedure by <hi>Exchequer</hi> Proceſs, through which great Havock and Spoil has been made of Friends Goods, and ſometimes their Bodies caſt into Priſon, where ſome have lain a long Time. He aſked, <hi>How our Friends did in</hi> Scotland, <hi>if they increaſed there?</hi> I told him, I heard that they did not increaſe, but ſome of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> were kind to our Friends, and would come to our Meetings, eſpecially if Strangers were at them: And I alſo told him, that Perſecution in our Part of the World was become hateful amongſt moſt ſober People. He ſaid, <hi>It was very well;</hi> and likewiſe mentioned, that <hi>we were refined, and not the People we had been.</hi> I aſked him, wherein he thought we were refined? He anſwered, <hi>in our Principles.</hi> I deſired him to name one, and he ſaid, George Fox <hi>denied the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead.</hi> I told him, <hi>George Fox</hi> did own a Reſurrection according to Scripture, as we do; but becauſe he and our Friends thought it not ſafe to recede from plain Scripture, nor to comply with the Way many People have of expreſſing it, which we think to be too groſs and carnal, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>ſame Body ſhall riſe,</hi> therefore they have aſſerted we deny the Reſurrection: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that Body that ſhall be, for it is ſown in Corruption, raiſed in Incorruption, ſown a natural, raiſed a ſpiritual Body;</hi> with much more that might be added: And how much ſuch a Change maketh a Difference between the preſent and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:008308_0468_102E78CF80977570"/>
in the Reſurrection, between natural and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Corruption and Incorruption, I knew not of any finite Creature that is able truly to determine; and therefore I think it is not conſiſtent with Charity, nor true Wiſdom, to differ about ſuch Things which exceed our Comprehenſion. He allowed it <hi>to be better to let them alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We parted very friendly, and Friends were glad of the Opportunity, he having the Character of being a great Scholar and a wiſe Man; but from all that paſſed, they believed he gained no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: However he behaved well; and before we parted, I told him, I thought the greateſt Reaſon why ſome think us refined was this, That formerly People were to prejudiced, that whatever was printed or ſaid againſt us, our Principles, Practice and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, was generally received and believed, though never ſo much diſguſted or covered with ſuch Dreſſes as might render us moſt odious, and were by many taken for the Standard of our Belief and Practice; but of late the Light hath mere appeared, and many are grown better diſpoſed towards us, and likewiſe Men, not willing to be impoſed upon any longer, have ſearched for themſelves into the State of the Controverſy between us and our oppoſers; and our Writings upon peruſal, appearing ſo clear and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what the Books of thoſe who oppoſed us charged upon us, cauſed many who read them with a good Deſign, and were willing to be ſet right, to ſay <hi>we were reformed, and not the People that we had been.</hi> The Prieſt ſaid, <hi>he thought there might be much owing to that:</hi> I told him it was undeniable, that
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:008308_0469_102E8B9677F43418"/>
there muſt be a great Difference between our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Doctrines and Converſations, truly ſtated and ſet forth in their proper Light, and when they were miſrepreſented, ſometimes with all the Art and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Malice that Men were capable of: And this has been the Way our Adverſaries have treated us, almoſt in every Thing we have believed, ſaid of writ, although it was very agreeable to the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>We returned back to <hi>Salem, Lynn</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> and viſited Friends in our Way, and at <hi>Rhode-Iſland, Long-Iſland</hi> and <hi>New-York;</hi> and we had many good Meetings and ſome large in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> where I had ſome Diſcourſe with a Juſtice of the Peace about <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> but he did not hold it long before he gave up; and I had another at <hi>Allens-Town</hi> with a <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> which held for ſome Hours, about <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and concerning <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> and he alſo ſoon give up as to the firſt; but when he began about <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> I ſaid, I thought it was the moſt pernicious Doctrine that ever was broach'd in the World, it did ſo oppoſe the very Nature of God, and his Deſign of creating of Man, which, with all his other Works, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced good and bleſſed; and that Man, as the Crown and Glory of all his Works which he had created, ſhould be deſigned for the moſt miſerable End, was unaccountable; I urged many Scriptures againſt that Doctrine, as alſo the Confuſion their were in about it, as that of their <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, wherein they ſay, <hi>That the Decree is ſo certain and definite, that one cannot be added to</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="unknown:008308_0470_102E8B992C8D9038"/>
                  <hi>the Number of the Elect, or diminiſhed from the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Reprobate;</hi> and yet you tell us, <hi>that God bath ordained the Means to effect his Ends:</hi> I then ſaid, this Suppoſition of a Decree for the Means, as well as the End, ſeems intended to make the Prieſts and their Service neceſſary; but yet if they cannot alter the Decree, what Benefit or Advantage can there be to Men by their Services or Performance? I hope none will think that a Service to Mankind, to ſtrengthen or confirm that Decree if it were in their Power to do it, which I am ſatisfied it is not; becauſe no ſuch Decree was made or is in being; the oppoſite appearing by plain Scripture (which he owned when I urged it) <hi>to wit,</hi> that the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> did affect all; and upon the Parity of Reaſon, the <hi>Coming</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did reach as far; becauſe, <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive;</hi> he taſted Death <hi>for every Man,</hi> was a <hi>Propitiation for the Sins of all;</hi> and where then wilt thou find a People that is not included? But if thou canſt find in, and prove by plain Scripture, that there is ſuch a People not included in theſe general Aſſertions, that <hi>Chriſt came to ſave,</hi> ſhew me who they are. Theſe and much more I urged againſt that Doctrine, and he with many others appeared much ſatisfied, and we parted friendly. He came next Day ſeveral Miles to a Meeting which I had appointed; the Man was counted a wiſe and ſober Man, and was under ſome Convincement, and behaved well.</p>
               <p>From thence we went to <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> and had many good Meetings in that Part, and being clear and willing to return, I took leave of Friends in a

loving and tender Frame of Spirit, and embarked on board a Ship, whereof <hi>Samuel Flower</hi> was Maſter, the 1ſt of the <hi>Third Month</hi> 1733 at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Briſtol</hi> the 18th of the <hi>Fourth Month</hi> following, and was glad we got ſafe to <hi>England</hi> having been ſeven Weeks in our Paſſage; I got, Home on the 6th of the <hi>Sixth Month,</hi> and was truly thankful to the Lord, who had preſerved me in theſe long Travels and Labours of Love, through many Difficulties; but the Lord's Power is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bear up and carry through all, Renowned be his worthy Name over all, now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A remarkable DELIVERANCE which happened to me, being omitted in its proper Place, I think ſit to inſert here, which was as follows.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1718 and the <hi>Twelfth Month,</hi> when <hi>John Dodgſon</hi> was viſiting Friends in our Parts, he lodged with me, and I went with him and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law <hi>Peter Buck,</hi> to be their Guide to <hi>Whithy,</hi> and ſtaid their Firſt-day's Meeting; and Second-day's Preparative Meeting; and on the Third-day I went on with Friends towards <hi>Scarborough,</hi> to have the better Road home, there having fallen a great deal of Snow while we were at <hi>Whithy,</hi> ſo that it was looked upon impracticable for me to return the ſame Way home that I came, it being a mooriſh, bad Way: But in our Way back, within a Mile or little more from <hi>Scarborough,</hi> we came to a Brook, which by reaſon of the exceſſive Rain and Snow
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:008308_0472_102E8B9FB98207D8"/>
was higher than ever I had ſeen it, ſo that we came to ride thro' it, <hi>Henry Levin,</hi> our Guide, firſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in, being mounted upon a very ſtrong large Horſe, and got over with ſome Difficulty, and I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; but when I came about the middle of the fording Place, it took my Mare off her Feet, and ſomething being in the was, it turned her upon her Broadſide, ſo that I was diſmounted and carried away by the Rapidity of the Stream; but there being a Foot-bridge a little below, about Knee deep under Water, and no Rail either to be a Guide, or to lay a Hand on, and the Water being reduced to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Compaſs, hurried me violently along, and drove me with my Breaſt againſt the Bridge with ſuch Force, that it very near knocked the Breath out of me; but before I touch'd the Bridge I happened to hold up my Hand, and <hi>John Dodgſon</hi> ſeeing the Danger I was in, jumped off his Horſe, and ran at a venture (ſeeing the Water ripple) to hit the Bridge, and juſt caught hold of my Fingers, and held my Head above Water, until <hi>Henry Levins,</hi> who was got over, came to his Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But by the Strength of the Water in my Boot-tops, they being large, and by a Nail in the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber under the Bridge) catching hold of my great Coat, which held me faſt, it was impoſſible for one Man to free me, and not without ſome Difficulty for them both to get me out, the Nail holding ſo faſt that it tore out a great Piece of my Coat, Lining and all; but upon <hi>Henry's</hi> diſmounting, his Horſe ran away to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> (and mine ſwam back to the Company) and when they had got me out, <hi>Henry</hi> an on Foot to get his Horſe, and found him at the
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:008308_0473_102E8BA19AA8FF38"/>
Stable Door where he uſed to ſtand, and in the mean Time <hi>John Dodgſon</hi> kept me in Motion by dragging me along, having very little or ſometimes no Hopes of my Recovery. When the Horſe returned, they got me back to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> but I was not ſenſible how, and they had me to <hi>Dorothy Jaques's</hi> Houſe, and when there, they could perceive my Lips move, but could not hear what I ſaid, until one laid an Ear cloſe to my Mouth, and ſo underſtood that I ſaid, <hi>If they gave me any Thing that was ſtrong, it would carry me off;</hi> which made them very cautious: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they ſtript me and changed my Shirt, and put me into a warm'd Bad, and applied warm Flannel to my Feet for three Hours together, which I knew nothing of, being then altogether Senſeleſs.</p>
