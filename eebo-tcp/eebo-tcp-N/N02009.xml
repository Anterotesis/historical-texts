            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>An ANSWER</hi> TO SOME <hi>Caſes of Conſcience</hi> Reſpecting the COUNTRY.</head>
            <byline>By SOLOMON STODDARD, A. M. Paſtor in <hi>Northampton.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>Queſt. I. <hi>WHEREIN doth the oppreſſion of the Country principally conſiſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> THERE is an oppreſſion of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers often ſpoken of in Scripture. But beſides that, there is an oppreſſion contrary to commutative Juſtice: this is committed principally in theſe three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN they make the advantage of the ignorance of others. Men that are otherwiſe, knowing Men, are ignorant of the worth of ſome Commodities; and Men take that opportunity to extort from them. Men that are ignorant of the worth of things, have a dependance on the Integrity of the Seller, who thereby hath an Advantage to gain more than is meet. Sometimes they get twice the value of it. Mens ignorance doth expoſe them to become a prey to greedy Men. The Seller knows that could ſell it cheaper; but the Buyer is ignorant, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. Sometimes Men ſell that which is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>h at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of that which is commendable. The Apothecary ſells his Drugs that have loſt their vertue through age, to ignorant Men. It is an eaſy thing for crafty Men to abuſe thoſe that are ignorant. And in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Towns. Men ſometimes give a ſhilling for that, which at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Town, might be had for ſix pence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002387_0002_0FDB350AC7B35040"/>
2. WHEN they make their advantage of the Neceſſities of particular Men: When there is a general Scarcity, the Market-price will inavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably riſe; but where there is no Market, particular perſons may be in great neceſſity; there be few in that Town that can ſupply them. If they go to another Town to buy, the charge will be conſiderable; the Man is alſo in a ſtrait becauſe ſtrangers will not truſt him, and the Seller takes that advantage to oppreſs him; the Scripture takes notice of the oppreſſing the poor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.31. It may be Lawyers may be guilty of taking exceſſive Fees.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHEN they take the advantage on the good nature &amp; ingenuity of other Men, by lying in Debt beyond the proper time of payment, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people in the Country are not beforehand, they ſpend their Money before they have it; the extravagancy of their expences forces them to lie in Debt; the inevitable Providence of GOD caſts ſome Men behind hand; in that caſe they ſhould compound with their Creditors: but ſome through a profuſe way of living, can't conveniently pay their Debts: Hereby the Creditor is reduced to ſtraits, looſes the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Eſtate; and ſometimes the Debt is loſt; the Debtor dies, and there is no Eſtate; the Creditor dies, and the Children can never recover their Father's dues. GOD was very ſtrict in requiring to pay the hireling his wages. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.13.</p>
            <p>Q. II. <hi>IS it lawfull for Men to ſet their Dwelling Houſes at ſuch a distance from the place of Publick Worſhip, that they and their Families cannot well attend it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> IT is lawfull to do it when a few make a beginning of a new Plantation under a proſpect of obtaining the Ordinances in a little time. But it is quite Unwarrantable, where there is no ſuch proſpect.</p>
            <p>WE read in Scripture of a <hi>Sabbath days journey:</hi> Acts 1.12. but that was a tradition, not an injunction. Some take it to be a Mile; ſome, two Miles, according to the different ſort of Cubits. It is tho't that the Armies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> incamped in the Wilderneſs at that Diſtance from the Tabernacle, <hi>Num.</hi> 2.2. They are ordered to pitch over againſt the Tabernacle; we read it, far off about the Tabernacle. This is thought to be 2000 Cubits; becauſe there was to be that diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tabernacle and the People, when they paſſed over <hi>Jordan, Joſh.</hi> 3.4. But ſuppoſing this to be, it will not prove that two Mile
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002387_0003_0FDB350C427DF468"/>was a Sabbath days journey. For there is reaſon to think that when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> encamped in the Wilderneſs, they took up the ſpace of Twelve Miles ſquare; ſo that ſome of them would be ſix Miles off from the Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. THE Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.1, 2. <hi>directed</hi> the woman of <hi>Shun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and ſhe ſojourned in the land of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſeven Years. And it is very probable, that thó the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were cut off from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the Temple, being commanded to ſacrifice at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> yet they had places near, where the law was publickly read, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Prayers made: yet ſhe is directed to live elſe where.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> THE Land of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> joined to the Land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhe might have opportunity by going two or three Miles, to join with ſome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Worſhip; yea the north-eaſt parts of the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> was not very far from the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhe might have better opportunity for Worſhip, than in her own Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. IT ſeems the Woman of <hi>Shunem</hi> was wont to travel on the Sabbath to Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> which was twelve Miles, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> IT doth not appear that it was ordinary for her to go thither on the Sabbath; thô poſſibly ſhe might on ſome extraordinary occaſions.</p>
            <p>Q. III. <hi>IS not the depreciating the Bills of Publick Credit matter of Provocation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> IT muſt needs be; for great wrong is done to many Perſons who have received them according to their denomination; and have been forced to put them off as if they were of leſs Value. Some Men are able to help themſelves, by getting greater wages for their Work, and advancing the price of what they bring to the Market; but others have been great Sufferers by this practice; and if ever the Bills are called in; ſuch as are in debt, either to the Publick, or to particular Perſons, will be great looſers. It may be, ſome of them will be undone thereby. The temptation to the Merchants was to get the Money into their own hands, that thereby they might make Returns to <hi>England.</hi> They would give thirty ſhillings in <hi>Eills,</hi> for twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Silver.</hi> And they may afford it, that have Sold, and do ſell, their Goods at execeſſive Rates. They are under no neceſſity to do thus: for they have the command of the Market, and might buy the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002387_0004_0FDB351006F76E98"/>produce of the Country at ſuch prices, that they might make as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Returns, as now they do.</p>
            <p>Q. IV. <hi>Is it Lawfull to wear long Hair?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> IT was the Cuſtom in <hi>England</hi> to cut their Hair all off, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> humour, as Dr. <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> off his Hair. This cuſtom continued for about threeſcore years: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by degrees. Men took a greater liberty; thô ſome Men placed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in it: yet in length of time, they were not ſo ſcrupulous as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. And ſome wore their Hair very long. And many of thoſe that wear Periwigs, uſe ſuch as are of a very great length. And the cuſtom doth now prevail among Pious People. But it ſeems utterly Unlawful to wear their Hair long; It is a geat Burden and Cumber; it is Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy, and a vaſt Expence.</p>
            <p>ONE Scripture that condemns it, 1 Cor. 11.14. <hi>Doth not even nature it ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you, that if a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> long hair, it is a ſhame to him?</hi> That which the light of Nature condemns, is a Moral Evil. The light of Nature is to be our Rule in ordinary caſes. The reaſon why it is a ſhame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> wear long Hair is, becauſe it is a Sin: the light of Nature doth condemn it; therefore it is ſinfull.</p>
            <p>THE principal Objection that is brought to evade the Authority of this Place, is. That by <hi>Nature,</hi> Cuſtom is meant. So Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>

One part of it, is ſurely Moral; <hi>They ſhall not ſhave their heads;</hi> therefore the other part is Moral alſo; <hi>They ſhall not ſuffer their locks to grow long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Command of GOD requiring the Nazarites to nouriſh their Hair, is no vindication of long Hair; but a forcible reaſon againſt it; which will appear, if we conſider two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. SUCH Actions, as under their <hi>ordinary</hi> circumſtances are Moral Evils; under <hi>extraordinary</hi> circumſtances, be very good: So for <hi>Brothers</hi> and <hi>Siſters</hi> to joyn in Wedlock, as <hi>Adam's</hi> Children did: For the <hi>Brother,</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to Marry his <hi>Brother</hi>'s Wife: So, for a Phyſician, to give an intoxicating Potion: to do that which ordinarily, is contrary to a Rule of Modeſty. One Command, in many caſes, muſt give way to another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Nazarites were to deny themſelves many comforts, to ſhew us that we ſhould be mortified to the things of this World. Upon a Religious account, they were to abſtain from Wine &amp; Raiſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and upon that account, they were to deny themſelves of that neatneſs and comelineſs in wearing their Hair, that was a duty in other Men.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN compliance with your deſire, I now ſend you my Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Periwigs.</hi> I cannot ſee ſufficient Reaſon to condemn them Univerſally. GOD does allow Man, by <hi>Art</hi> to ſupply the defects of <hi>Nature.</hi> Hair artificially prepared may ſupply as fully &amp; innocently, the want of Hair, as any other matter artificially prepared.</p>
                  <p>But yet I judge that there is abundance of Sin, in this Country, in wearing <hi>Perwigs.</hi> Particularly, in theſe two things;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When Men do wear them needleſsly, in compliance with the Faſhion. Their own Hair <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſufficient for all thoſe Ends that GOD has given Hair for. One Man's Hair is comlier than another's. And ſo it is with their Faces, and Bodies. Some cut off their Own becauſe of the Colour; it is <hi>Red</hi> or <hi>Grey;</hi> Some, becauſe it is <hi>Streight;</hi> Some, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>Frizel'd;</hi> and ſome, only, becauſe it is their <hi>Own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When thoſe that may have juſt occaſion to wear them, doe wear them in ſuch a Ruffianly way, as it would be utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to wear their own Hair in. Some of them are of an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have no certain way to paſs a Judgment upon this <hi>Practice,</hi> but by comparing it with ſuch general Moral Rules, as we are bound to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. It renders it ſomewhat <hi>Suſpicious,</hi> that the <hi>Practice</hi> did at firſt take it's riſe from very <hi>Corrupt</hi> Men; and that it was long, before it did obtain among thoſe that were <hi>godly.</hi> But if it diſagree with Moral Rules; it is altogether to be Condemned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Practice</hi> ſeems, to me, to have theſe four <hi>Evils</hi> in it:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is an <hi>Uncontentedneſs</hi> with that Proviſion that GOD has made for Men. GOD has generally given Men ſuch Hair as is co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly; and a ſufficiency of it. And when it is ſo, Men have cauſe to be well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. When GOD has given to Men ſuch Hair as is ſutable to anſwer the Ends of Hair; It ſeems to be a <hi>Deſpiſing</hi> of the Goodneſs of GOD, to cut it off, in compliance with a Vain Faſhion. If GOD lay Affliction upon them; they may uſe lawfull Methods, to moderate the Affliction: But theſe Men, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> GOD be Bountifull to them, <hi>are not Contented to be at His Finding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>Waſtifullneſs.</hi> Abundance of Money is <hi>needleſsly</hi> ſpent in maintaining this <hi>Practice.</hi> Some of the Men that uſe it, have need enough of the Money other ways; and lay themſelves under Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by this <hi>Extravagancy,</hi> either to oppreſs Men in their Dealings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thoſe Men that have more plentiful Eſtates, have no Liberty to uſe them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own Pleaſure. That Money that may be laid out to <hi>Advantage,</hi> ſhould not be ſpent <hi>Unprofitably.</hi>
                  </p>

                        </gap>;</hi> It is from an Affectation of <hi>Swaggering;</hi> it is an Affecting of <hi>Finery</hi> that there is no juſt occaſion for. They count it <hi>Brave</hi> to be in the Faſhion; crave the honour of being counted as <hi>Gallant</hi> as others. It is too much <hi>Flanting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is <hi>contrary to Gravity.</hi> There is a Maſculine Gravity that ſhould appear in the Countenances of Men, diſcovering a Solemnity of Spirit. But this <hi>Fractice</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Effeminat.</hi> Tho it make a <hi>Shew;</hi> yet it takes much away from the Preſence of Men. Such <hi>Curipſity</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers much <hi>Vanity</hi> in the Mind; and makes others to eſteem the more lightly of them; and not to ſhew that Reſpect to them. This <hi>Practice</hi> makes them look, as if they were more diſpos'd <hi>to Court a Maid;</hi> than to bear upon their Hearts the weighty Concernments of GOD's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>But I am fearful that the Stream runs ſo ſtrong this way, that no Endeavours will work a Publick <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Q. V. <hi>WHAT Night doth belong to the Sabbath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> THE Night before the Sabbath-day. Theſe two Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions clear it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT from the Beginning, the Sabbath began in the Evening. That Text, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.32.— <hi>From evening to evening, ye ſhall celebrate your Sabbath,</hi> doth immediately reſpect the day of Expiation; but that is to be kept as a Sabbath; from evening, to evening. But this doth further evidence it, becauſe the Firſt Sabbath began in the evening. When the Evening and the Morning had made the Sixth Day: as ſoon as the Sixth day was paſt, the Sabbath began: and ſo it continued,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002387_0008_0FDB35174F750030"/>during the Time of the Old Teſtament. And if the Chriſtian Sabbath began in the Morning, the ſeventh part of time is not kept.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THO' the Reſurrection of CHRIST made a change of the day; yet there is no reaſon that the Time of the day when He roſe, ſhould make a change of the Time of the day wherein the Sabbath ſhould begin.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) BECAUSE the Scripture doth not aſſure us in what exact Time CHRIST roſe: if GOD had appointed that we ſhould begin the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath then, He would have given us light to know when that Time was: for the Scripture is a perfect Rule. But none of the Pen-men do deſign to tell us the Exact Time when CHRIST Roſe.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) IT is not the manner of Men, when Solemnities are kept in Memory of ſome great thing that hapned on ſuch a day, to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Time of the day; as in keeping Princes Birth-days. So among the <hi>Jews,</hi> they had no regard as to the Circumciſing of their Children, to the Time of day when they were born. If a Child were born on the Sabb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, an hour <hi>before</hi> Sun-ſet, it might be Circumciſed the next Sahbath an hour <hi>after</hi> Sun-riſe, when it was not compleatly ſeven days old.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) WE have no reaſon to think that in the firſt Inſtitution of the Sabbath, GOD had a reſpect to the very Moment of Time when He ceaſed from the Work of Creation. The Woman was the laſt Creature that was made on the Sixth day; but we have no ground to think that She was made the laſt hour of that day. The ſixth day was a working day: but we have no reaſon to think, that GOD was creating all that day.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>AT what Time of the Evening doth the Sabbath begin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> JUST at Sun-ſet. There be ſome in this Country that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Sabbath in the dusk of the Evening, when the Darkneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails over the Light. They ground their Opinion on that Scripture, Neh. 13.19. <hi>And it came to paſs when the gates of Jeruſalem began to be dark</hi> before <hi>the Sabbath, I commanded that the gates ſhould be ſhut, &amp;c.</hi> But this place doth not prove their Opinion; For the word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is, <hi>When the gates of Jeruſalem begar to be ſhaded;</hi> which might be ſome conſiderable time before the Sabbath; <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being compaſſed with Mountains.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Undoubtedly it is. We may ſuppoſe that Magiſtrates and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, were they informed, would bear a due Teſtimony againſt Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Sabbath-breaking, and other fins. But ſuch things are ſeldom puniſhed, for want of information. Many perſons are bound by Church-Covenant to watch over others, and Officers are bound by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ath, to inquire into Diſorders, and give information. But many times there is a fame of ſuch things, but ſeldom Complaint is made to Authority. Poſſibly, ſome Perſons are obnoxious themſelves, and are afraid that if they bring out others, that they ſhall be brought out.</p>
            <p>BUT the great Reaſon of this is the want of a Spirit of Religion: Men are not concerned for the Honour of GOD, the preventing of Judgments, and the Recovery of their Brethren. They are aſraid that others will be diſguſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Q. VH. <hi>IS not the neglect of bringing others to the Profeſſion of Religion, a Provocation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> IT muſt needs be. It was foretold of CHRIST, that <hi>all nations ſhall call him bleſſed,</hi> Pſal. 72.7. <hi>GOD promiſed to Him that He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> give Him the Heathen for his luberitance,</hi> Pſal. 2.8. And it is a part of that Love and Duty which we owe to JESUS CHRIST, and to the Souls of Men, as we have opportunity, to be prevailing with other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give entertainment to the Goſpel. Great pains were taken that way in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and with great Succeſs: But there is great reaſon to fear, that we have not anſwered GOD's expecla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </gap>ay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE has been a neglect of bringing ſome of our own Nation to the Profeſſion of the Goſpel. Many in, and about <hi>Rhode Iſland,</hi> and in the <hi>Naraganſet</hi>-Country, have fallen into Hereſy; and ſome almoſt into Heatheniſm. And we have been too much unconcerned about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them unto the Right way: We have reaſon to reflect on thoſe Words to the Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 34.4. <hi>The diſeaſed have ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſtrengthned, neuber have ye bealed that which was ſick; neither have ye bound up that which was broken; neither have ye brought again that which was driven away; neither have ye ſought that which was left.</hi> There has been ſomething done of late Years, at <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e-Iſland</hi> &amp; the places adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and it has not been without Effect. But it was too long before it was taken in hand, and has not been followed with ſufficient Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If we had done much more, it would have been more Acceptable to GOD. When the Kingdom of CHRIST doth not flouriſh, Satan's Kingdom will prevail. Our Diligence might have prevented the growth of Atheiſm and Prophaneneſs, and have preſerved many from falling in with the Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE has been a neglect to bring the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Profeſſion of the Goſpel. Something has been done through the Piety of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men; and at the Coſt of ſome in <hi>Old England;</hi> But we are reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad for our Negligence. Many Men have been more carefull to make a Prey of them, then to gain them to the Knowlege of CHRIST. The King in the CHARTER ſays, that the Undertakens did profeſs it to be their principal deſign to bring the Natives to the Knowledge of GOD. But we have very much failed of proſecuting that Deſign to Effect. We muſt bring them to Civility and to learn our Language. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002387_0012_0FDB3521F687F218"/>the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> I <hi>ſeek not yours but you,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. The Reverſe is too true of <hi>New-England.</hi> It may be, on that account GOD hath made them to be a ſcourge to us. GOD ſays to <hi>Ecekiel, Thou art not ſent to a people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and of an hard language — Surely had I ſent thee to them, they would have bearkned unto thee,</hi> Ezek. 3.5, 6. We have reaſon to fear, that we are much to blame for their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in their Heatheniſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE have Neglected to bring <hi>Servants</hi> to the Profeſſion of Religion. Some Men are careful to make their Servants learn their Catechiſm, to make them attend Family, and Publick Worſhip. But Servants ſhould be brought to the Profeſſion of Religion; they need to practiſe Religion, as well as their Maſters; and their Maſters are bound to take care of their <hi>Souls</hi> as well as their <hi>Bodies.</hi> GOD required <hi>Abraham</hi> to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his <hi>Servants,</hi> as well as his <hi>Children,</hi> Gen. 17.12, 13. Here you may obſerve two things. 1. GOD ſays, <hi>They muſt needs be circumciſed.</hi> 2. GOD makes this to be a Token of his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; his Poſterity. If they had proper Helps, they might be as forward in Religion, as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> It has been the miſery of <hi>New-England,</hi> that under a fear of polluting the Ordinances; they have neglected pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to make Men godly.</p>
            <p>Q VIII. <hi>DID we any wrong to the</hi> Indians <hi>in buying their Land at a ſmall price?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. THERE was ſome part of the Land that was not purchaſed, neither was there need that it ſhould; it was <hi>vacuum domicilium;</hi> and ſo might be poſſeſſed by virtue of GOD's grant to Mankind, Gen. 1.28. <hi>And God bleſſed them, and God ſaid unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and repleniſh the earth, and ſubdue it: and have dominion over the fiſh of the ſea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> made no uſe of it, but for Hunting. By GOD's firſt Grant Men were to ſubdue the Earth.
