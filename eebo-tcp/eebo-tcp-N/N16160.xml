            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT is more ſolemn than to ſee a man die!—to ſee a fellow-creature, who muſt exiſt an eternity, take his departure immediately to the bar of God!—to have his ſtate unalterably fixed, either in eternal life, or in utter darkneſs, everlaſting puniſhment and deſpair!—Death is the king of terrours, though viewed in his moſt frequent and common forms; but to ſee one in health cut down in the midſt of life, by the hand of juſtice, O how ſhocking! this fills the mind with ideas which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expreſſed. At the repeated requeſt of ſuch an one, I am now to preach the laſt ſermon he is ever to hear! and, peradventure, the laſt which may ever be heard by many others in this aſſembly. What ſerious addreſs becomes this occaſion! Excellency of ſpeech, and artful words of man's wiſdom, ſuit not this ſolemnity. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at this time to be curious would be inexcuſably criminal; for if ever great plainneſs of ſpeech was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it is now. The words choſen for our text com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

the prayer of a poor publican—the penitent, earneſt cry of a broken-hearted ſinner, who went up into God's holy temple, but had ſuch a ſenſe of his ſin and guilt, that he dared not come nigh, and, ſtanding afar off, would not ſo much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but ſmote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his breaſt, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful to me, a ſinner!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, O <hi>Iſaac,</hi> is a prayer for you, in the moſt earneſt and penitential manner; let this be the cry of your whole heart, every moment you have to live.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing upon this ſubject, we ſhall obſerve the following method:</p>
            <p>I. Inquire what is implied in a ſinner's praying for mercy.</p>
            <p>II. Conſider what is compriſed in God's ſhowing mercy to a praying ſinner.</p>
            <p>III. Improve the ſubject with ſeveral remarks and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes.</p>
            <p>IN a ſinner's praying for mercy is implied,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A felt and unfeigned ſenſe of ſin. The publican realized his being a ſinner; his heart was affected with a ſenſe of it; and whoever heartily adopts his prayer, has a painful ſenſe of ſin againſt God—has become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and ſees he has done that abomination which the Lord hateth. His ſin appears to cover his head like a thick cloud, and to cry, even unto heaven, againſt him. He is convicted of tranſgreſſing the law of God—a law that is holy, juſt and good; and the conſequence of ſuch conviction muſt forever be what the Apoſtle confeſſed, <hi>I am carnal, ſold under ſin:</hi> He can offer no excuſe for his conduct—can plead nothing in his favour—can find no one circumſtance that could in the leaſt alleviate his guilt. Thus he ſtands condemned by God—ſenſibly condemned by his holy law—condemned by the whole bible. The law, with a voice like the thunder of Mount
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020721_0005_0FB0E2E238BD9E98"/>
Sinai, curſes him for not continuing in all things written therein, to do them. When he looks to the goſpel, he finds he has been guilty of the ſin of unbelief; and that he who believeth not is condemned already. He finds, yea, he now feels, the ſentence of condemnation in his own ſoul; for both reaſon and conſcience flaſh in his face. Heaven and earth are ready to witneſs againſt him, and judgment is before him. He apprehends God will immediately enter into judgment with him;—it appears amazing, and paſſing wonder, that he has not done it long ago. There appears no probability that his final doom will be delayed any longer; and if not, he knows he cannot ſtand in the judgment, but muſt fall under condemnation, to all eternity. He ſees he has no right to any thing temporal or ſpiritual: when he treads on the earth, he cumbereth the ground—he breathes not a breath but by mere ſufferance. It appears truth to him, that God could not puniſh him too much; that everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufferings are his due, and God muſt be juſt, do with him what he will. Such a ſenſe of ſin is occaſioned by a proper ſight of God's law; <hi>for by the law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin.</hi> The law makes ſin revive, and become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſinful. A true ſight of the law is a diſcovery of its holineſs and ſpirituality, as exhibiting the infinite glory of the bleſſed God; and until one has ſuch a ſight of the exceeding holineſs of this law, as ſets the glory of the divine perfections in the moſt awful and adorable view, he is in the ſame ſituation of mind with a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <hi>Saul—alive without the law;</hi> he has no true ſenſe of ſin, and no proper idea of his own real character: but when he is brought to ſee this, then ſin appears what it really is—a tranſgreſſion of the law, oppoſition to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and enmity againſt God. This lays the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020721_0006_0FB0E2E6942374E0"/>
of that painful and unfeigned ſenſe of ſin, which we have been attempting a little to deſcribe. Here we may obſerve, that in a true ſenſe of ſin, one is not affected bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the fear of puniſhment, or the ſufferings which are his juſt wages; but it is a ſenſe of his having ſinned againſt God, that breaks his heart; his having diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured a holy God, and injured his infinitely ſacred char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter:—this wounds his ſpirit! this gives him his greateſt diſtreſs! <hi>David</hi> ſinned, and ſhed innocent blood; and a dreadful ſentence from God proceeded againſt him—that the ſword ſhould never depart from his houſe; yet when he was brought to a true ſenſe of what he had done, he found ſomething in his conduct more diſtreſſing to his ſoul, than all his puniſhment; it was this, <hi>Againſt thee, thee only, have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight.</hi> And when the prodigal ſon came to himſelf, and returned to his father, he did not ſay, Father I have ſinned, and have undone myſelf—I have been ſtarving in foreign lands, and I am now periſhing with hunger:—no; there was ſomething in his conduct more affecting to his ſoul, than his own wretchedneſs—more painful, than his hunger—it was this—<hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon.</hi> The penitent ſinner is not inſenſible of his own miſery, neither is he at all indifferent as to his periſhing circumſtances. The publican cries for mercy, and the prodigal begs for the bread of an hired ſervant; but, at the ſame time, in a true ſenſe of ſin. The diſhonour and injury done to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appears comparatively ſmall, to the diſhonour and injury done to a holy God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN this prayer is implied, a realizing ſenſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God. The ſinner finds himſelf periſhing—that he has deſtroyed himſelf, and is ſinking under the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020721_0007_0FB0E2E9A82A0738"/>
inſupportable weight of his guilt—that help he muſt have, and ſuch help, too, as Almighty God alone can give. He ſees the abſolute impoſſibility of his helping himſelf—that he can make no atonement for his crimes—it would avail him nothing, ſhould he give his body to be burned for his tranſgreſſions, or the fruit of his body for the ſin of his ſoul—that <hi>Lebanon</hi> is not ſufficient to burn, nor all the beaſts thereof, for a burnt-offering; he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces all hope in himſelf, and looks to God, ſaying, with <hi>David, Help, Lord, for vain is the help of man.</hi> The ſinner who thus proſtrates himſelf at the throne of grace, is ſenſible, if God appears for him, it will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, pure ſovereign mercy, and if not, it will be juſt. Every gleam of hope is in the mercy of that God who hath a ſovereign right either to caſt off or ſave—to kill or make alive. He hath now but this one petition, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to me, a ſinner!</hi> and if this fail, he muſt ſink into deſpair—his mouth is ſtopped, for there is no other plea. God would be juſt in withholding his mercy from ſinners. He is under no obligation to manifeſt it to any one; though it is otherwiſe with man; it is criminal in us not to ſhow mercy to the utmoſt of our ability, for this plain reaſon, we have all, in a greater or leſs degree, received mercy at the hand of God. Every moment we have lived, every thing temporal and ſpiritual we have enjoyed, is the fruit of mere mercy; and if we have freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, we ought freely to give. We are under obligation to be like God. Does God forgive enemies? ſo muſt we. Does he do good to the evil and unthankful? ſo muſt we. Do we pray, forgive us our treſpaſſes? then we muſt forgive, from our very heart, all thoſe who have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt us. The ſervant, who had no compaſſion on his fellow-ſervant, was condemned; and the reaſon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020721_0008_0FB0E2EA83070258"/>
of his condemnation was, that, a little before, his Lord forgave him his whole debt. Hence we have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Be ye merciful, as your Father alſo is merciful.</hi> But God hath been laid under no ſuch obligation, <hi>for who hath firſt given unto him?</hi> And this is realized by him who feels his abſolute dependence on ſovereign mercy. O who can deſcribe the ſituation of one who ſtands guilty before God, having nothing but eternity in view—ſenſible of deſerving nothing but frowns—feeling himſelf on the brink of deſerved ruin, and there wholly dependent on the mere pleaſure of an angry Judge—an injured God—who knows what he has done, and now beholds his ſin with perfect indignation, and can, with infinite eaſe, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify himſelf in his condemnation! He pleads for mercy, but is ſenſible that he pleads for undeſerved, uncovenanted mercy. He repeats his requeſt, but feels himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, of all ſinners the moſt unworthy, of being heard. He knows he muſt periſh forever, if his ſuit is not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but, alas! it now comes freſh to his remembrance, how many times he has ſlighted this mercy. God hath called, and he hath refuſed; the Lord hath ſtretched out his hand, and he hath diſregarded; and that he might now laugh at his calamity, and mock at his fear. But notwithſtanding all this, he has no where elſe to go for help, but unto God; he is therefore reſolved to proſtrate his ſoul before the throne of all grace, and if he dies, to die at the feet of Sovereign Mercy. His final concluſion is this, <hi>Let me fall now into the hand of the Lord,</hi> and if I periſh, I periſh!</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS prayer implies an apprehenſion of the mercy of God. God is merciful in himſelf. He is a God of great and tender mercy. There muſt be a greatneſs in that mercy, which can reach a ſinner's caſe. Of this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020721_0009_0FB0E2EC112DFEB8"/>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſenſible, when pleading for a ſinful people; he ſays, <hi>Pardon, I beſeech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy.</hi> And again, <hi>Let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, the Lord long-ſuffering, and of great mercy.</hi> This is found in God. Here is mercy, of ſuch eminence, and infinite power, as removes every thing that lies in its way; it triumphs over ſin and guilt; it leaps over mountains of iniquity and tranſgreſſion, and makes its way into the ſtubborn heart. Many of the chief of ſinners have been made the joyful captives of this all-conquering mercy. We, of the human race, have had abundant opportunity to know, that the divine nature is ſuch as delights in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. We were miſerable—God pitied us. We were ſinful,—God deteſted us; yet though we were an abhorrence in his ſight, his mercy neither ceaſed nor abated: witneſs Chriſt's dying for the ungodly. This is the mercy craved in the text. The poor ſinner apprehends the glorious truth; upon this his eye fixes, whilſt he ceaſes not to implore this ſovereign help; and mercy! mercy! is his repeated cry.</p>
            <p>THE ſinner at this time apprehends a fullneſs in the mercy of God. If he has any hope, he muſt ſee enough in God to relieve him; and he who ſees himſelf, muſt ſee, that nothing ſhort of infinite is enough—yea, ſo far from being ſufficient, that all that men or angels could do for him, would not give him the leaſt poſſible relief. Nothing but an infinite fullneſs of grace—nothing but an arm abſolutely almighty, ſtretched out by infinite mercy, can reach down to the gates of hell, where he now finds himſelf ſinking; therefore he prays, <hi>God be merciful!</hi>—as much as to ſay, thou art merciful—an inexhauſtible ocean of grace is in thee.

infinite freeneſs of mercy, and thus appear for my help. <hi>David</hi> had this view of his own ſituation and others, when he called upon God in theſe words—<hi>Stir up thy ſtrength, and come and ſave us.</hi> He ſaw, if God did not appear in all his ſtrength, in all his omnipotence, they could not be ſaved. Such is the ſituation of every ſinner; and ſurely for God to appear in this manner, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a poor, periſhing ſoul, is a diſplay of infinite mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE prayer expreſſed in the text implies ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the method of ſalvation. The publican evidently conceived it poſſible for God to ſhow mercy in a way conſiſtent with himſelf, that he might be juſt in doing it; and this was his encouragement to pray—his only ſupport. For though God is merciful, yet if the way was not open, in which he might manifeſt it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to righteouſneſs and truth, it could never appear. This mercy is of too divine a nature, to have flown out in any way, that would in the leaſt have injured the holy law of God, his juſtice, or any of his adorable perfections; and if ſome method is not revealed in which this can be done, there is no hope. Fallen angels know God is merciful, but this gives them no hope; for they have had no intimations of any way being deviſed, in which God can be reconciled to them; therefore there muſt be ſome apprehenſion of the goſpel method of ſalvation, wherever a ſinner addreſſes himſelf to the throne of grace. This apprehenſion may be very dark, as we know it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was before the ſufferings and death of our Lord and Saviour; but God had even then, in various ways, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his name in relation to ſinners of the human race, the Lord God gracious and merciful. Ever ſince that early promiſe, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's

head,</hi> it has been known in our world, that God deſigned mercy for the fallen race of <hi>Adam.</hi> This hath been believed by true penitents, in all generations; and they have always been perſuaded, that in ſhowing mercy, God would take care of his own glory, and do it in a way that ſhould harmonize with all his perfections. This way of ſalvation, through a Mediator, is made clear and plain to us, in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who died, the j<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> for the unjuſt,</hi> and <hi>bore our ſins in his own body, on the tree</hi>—who fulfilled the law by his holy and obedient life, and ſatisfied divine juſtice by the ſacrifice of himſelf, and hath thus brought in an everlaſting righteouſneſs, that, through the redemption which is in his blood, we might be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified freely by the grace of God. This precious redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—this complete atonement, is the ſinner's refuge—is the grand pillar of all his hopes; on this is grounded that peculiar hope, which, as an anchor to the ſoul, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the veil, is ſure and ſteadfaſt. When once the true penitent has a view of this glorious method of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it appears ſo complete, ſo every way ſuited to his circumſtances, that he will hope—he cannot but truſt his immortal all in the hands of Jeſus; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, he can ſay, if I had a thouſand ſouls to ſave, I could truſt them all on this glorious foundation. Thus, weary and heavy laden with ſin and guilt, he flies to the faithful arms of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love; and O! what excellency appears in Chriſt! unto him <hi>he is precious—altogether lovely—the chiefeſt of ten thouſands;</hi> worthy to be loved, and adored with the whole heart, in time and eternity, on account of his own glories, he <hi>being the brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon.</hi> And notwithſtanding the great ſenſe he has of his ſinfulneſs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the mercy of God in Chriſt ſtrengthens his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020721_0012_0FB0E2F43A2FEB78"/>
ſoul, and afreſh ſupports him to agonize in prayer, and to cry with the moſt earneſt importunity, <hi>God be merciful to me, a ſinner!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhall now paſs to the conſideration of the ſecond general head of this diſcourſe; which was, to conſider what is compriſed in God's ſhowing mercy to a ſinner:—</p>
            <p>AND, in the firſt place, ſhall obſerve, this mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a pardon of ſin.</p>
            <p>THE publican undoubtedly had this, firſt, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, in view—that God, for his own name's ſake, would pardon his ſin; for, when he received a gracious anſwer, he went down to his houſe, juſtified.<note n="*" place="bottom">The publican's being ſaid to be juſtified rather than the other, who was a ſelf-righteous phariſee, muſt mean, that he was juſtified, and the other was not; for we know of no ſuch thing, as being juſtified in part, or pardoned in part; when the Lord giveth, he giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</note> And we conſider juſtification as an act of God's free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our ſins. When God juſtifies, he does it freely and fully: <hi>he will abundantly pardon</hi> the truly penitent. The publican aſked a pardon of all his ſins, and in his juſtification he received a full pardon, and went rejoicing home. Nothing ſhort of this would have ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied him, or in any degree have relieved his troubled ſoul. The pardoning grace of God extends to ſinners, only on account of the atonement made by Chriſt, which is received, and truſted in, as complete, and divinely ſuitable, as we have already attempted to deſcribe. This is goſpel faith, the ſubjects of which are conſidered as being in Chriſt; and as Chriſt <hi>hath finiſhed tranſgreſſion, and made an end of ſin, their ſins are taken away</hi>—their iniquities are <hi>blotted out as a cloud,</hi> and their <hi>tranſgreſſions as a thick cloud; for there is now no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Righteouſneſs, the glorious and complete righteouſneſs of Jeſus, is imputed unto them,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020721_0013_0FB0E2F5B5EFFBC0"/>
which preſents them faultleſs to the eye of holineſs itſelf. <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute ſin,</hi> to whom <hi>righteouſneſs is imputed</hi> by faith: this is free grace—this is mercy indeed!</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN God's ſhowing mercy to a ſinner, there is not only this act of free forgiveneſs, but there is alſo by the Holy Ghoſt an application of his pardoning love to the ſoul. <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart,</hi> which immediately removes the guilt of ſin; the heart is ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled from an evil conſcience. All ſin loads the conſcience with guilt, but <hi>the blood of Jeſus cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> A believing application of this gives inſtant freedom to the ſoul that is bowed down under a ſenſe of the moſt aggravated guilt. O! how heavy is the guilt of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood! it made <hi>Cain</hi> cry out, <hi>My puniſhment is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than I can bear. David,</hi> ſinking under this weight, cries out in agonies of pain, <hi>Deliver me from blood guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs, O God!</hi> His earneſtneſs is like one who feels, that if God ſhould not deliver him, he muſt ſink into hell. But here is deliverance; the atoning blood of Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves even the guilt of blood. Though innocent blood has a voice ſo loud as to reach heaven with its avenging cries, yet theſe cries, by an application of a crucified Chriſt, are ſilenced in a moment. We read, that the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> cried unto God, from the ground—it cried for vengeance againſt the murderer; but the blood of ſprinkling, the blood of Jeſus, ſpeaketh better things—it ſpeaketh peace! peace! and all is peace! The whole weight of guilt is gone—the wounded conſcience is healed—the deepeſt ſtains of ſin are waſhed away. This, even this, is compriſed in the mercy of God to ſinners.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DIVINE mercy does not ſtop here; it is ſo rich—ſo abundant, as to bring penitents home to God, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020721_0014_0FB0E2FB06C7AFF0"/>
adopt them as the children of his family. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God.</hi> God ſends forth <hi>the ſpirit of his Son into their hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</hi> When the prodigal repented and returned, he not only received a pardon, but was claſpt in his Father's arms; his pardon was ſealed with parental kiſſes; he was again called a ſon; the father ſaid to his ſervants, bring forth the beſt robe, and put it on him, and let a joyful feaſt be made ready: <hi>for this my ſon was dead, and is alive; he was loſt, and is found.</hi> So, likewiſe, when God has mercy on a ſinner, he ſeals his pardon with every tender expreſſion of love. <hi>After ye believed,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe;</hi> and the immediate effect of this is <hi>peace with God, joy and peace in believing.</hi> The poor ſinner is now made to rejoice with that joy which is <hi>unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. PERFECT holineſs, and the full enjoyment of God to all eternity, are compriſed in God's ſhowing mercy to a penitent, praying ſinner. When a ſinner is firſt brought to repentance, he is, in ſome degree, the ſubject of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for repentance implies hatred to ſin, and love to righteouſneſs, which is holineſs. After ſuch a change, his life is a warfare againſt ſin; he hates it in all its forms and deluſive charms; he groans earneſtly for deliverance; he looks on him whom he hath pierced, and mourns; whilſt he longs, and hungers and thirſte for righteouſneſs—to be holy like God and Chriſt. Theſe affections will increaſe, as long as he lives; and when death ſhall do his kind office, and lay his body aſleep in Jeſus, then he will live indeed; for, being freed from that body of death, under which he groaned while he lived, he comes to the full poſſeſſion of that promiſe in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>He
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020721_0015_0FB0E2FD5C764528"/>
ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> Now the ſcenes of ſorrow cloſe, and the ſcenes of joy and immortality open. Now, adieu to an alluring world and tempting devil—a long farewell to a ſpiritual warfare and manifold tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations—welcome life and glory. Thus being made free as a celeſtial, and bearing the image of the heavenly, he paſſes, as in a moment, to the paradiſe of God—the Jeruſalem which is above, to join the general aſſembly of the church of the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in the Lamb's book of life; there to be gueſt with ſaints and angels, and, what is more, to dwell in the eternal light, in the preſence of God, where there is fullneſs of joy; and at his right hand, where there are pleaſures forevermore. And the Lamb in the midſt of the throne ſhall feed him, and lead him unto fountains of living waters, and God ſhall wipe away all tears from his eyes: here <hi>the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and his weary ſoul is forever at reſt. Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them who love him.</hi> But, my brethren, by faith we may look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the veil, and behold the redeemed ſtanding on Mount Zion, clothed in white robes, having their Father's name in their foreheads, with crowns upon their heads, and palms in their hands, ſinging the new ſong before the throne of God and the Lamb: for by faith we ſee things which are inviſible.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus attended to the doctrinal parts of this ſubject, we ſhall now proceed to an improvement.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid, we may learn the great encouragement ſinners have to look to God for mercy. The Lord hath already looked mercifully towards ſinners. With an eye of tender pity and infinite compaſſion, he hath viewed our deplorable ſituation; for mercy hath
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020721_0016_0FB0E391ED0E06F0"/>
pleaſed him. A glorious work of redemption hath been ſet on foot by everlaſting love and infinite wiſdom, which have joined in planning and laying it out; and all things have been well ordered and made ſure by Almighty Power; and for a long while God hath been paſſing before ſinners, in the diſpenſation of the goſpel, ſaying, live! live! for I have found a ranſom. And there is not only a door opened, through which God may ſhow mercy to ſinners, but there is an appointed Mediator, in whoſe ever-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing name, we may come to the throne of grace, and plead for mercy, with the greateſt aſſurance; for he that cometh before God, believing the truth as it is witneſſed in Jeſus, <hi>ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Sinners may venture to draw near to God, through the glorious Mediator; yea, they have a good warrant to come; yea, more, they have a free and urgent invitation to come—<hi>The ſpirit and the bride ſay, come. And let him that heareth, ſay, come. And let him that is athirſt, come: and whoſover will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> The greatneſs of God's mercy is an encouragement; it is exceeding great; it paſſeth knowledge—is beyond all compariſon—nothing but God himſelf can repreſent it. The greatneſs and extent thereof can be meaſured only by infinite lines; where it is diſplayed, it ſnatches the ſinner from eternal miſery—it places him in eternal happineſs. The freeneſs and readineſs of this mercy is an encouragement; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the moment of diſtreſs. God is a preſent help in trouble. He looketh <hi>down from the height of his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, to hear the groaning of the priſoner, and to looſe thoſe who are appointed to death.</hi> He is more ready to give his holy ſpirit unto ſuch as truly aſk it, than earthly parents are to give bread to their own children. This mercy is not only great and free, but it is alſo ſure and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020721_0017_0FB0E393EC106D10"/>
effectual. The ſoul that receives it can never fail. <hi>The gifts and callings of God are without repentance;</hi> they are <hi>the ſure mercies of</hi> David. There is alſo this encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that God hath appointed repentance unto life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and, what is ſtill more, he hath exalted Jeſus Chriſt to give repentance, and hath added, even to this, his promiſe, that he will have mercy on ſinners, who truly repent. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> This, certainly, is encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it is offering mercy on the loweſt terms; for he who repents not, and forſakes not his unrighteous way, cannot inherit the favour of God, for it is an holy gift, and cannot be received or enjoyed by an unholy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent heart. Beſides, we have examples to encourage us. The poor publican found mercy; the prodigal, who only ſought for a maſter, found a father, and one too who had bowels and mercies. <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who filled <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> with innocent blood, was not out of the reach of God's pardoning mercy. O unmeaſurable, unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grace! Why then ſhall any one deſpair, or ever ceaſe to cry, <hi>God be merciful to me, a ſinner!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WOULD now addreſs a few words to this numerous audience, to look to God for mercy.</p>
            <p>MY dear fellow-mortals, we all ſtand in need of mercy, <hi>for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the wages of ſin is death.</hi> He that is to ſuffer this day, is not the only one in this aſſembly under the ſentence of death; for death hath paſſed upon all, for all have ſinned. <hi>Man goeth to his long home</hi>—born on by time's ſwift wings. We are going whence we ſhall not return. No more ſhall we return to our houſe; our place ſhall know
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020721_0018_0FB0E395C26B6668"/>
us no more. But it is not only <hi>appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.</hi> The ſolemn moment is faſt approaching, when all our ſtates will be fixed for an eternity; and he that is unjuſt, ſhall be unjuſt ſtill; and he that is filthy, ſhall be filthy ſtill; and he that is righteous, ſhall be righteous ſtill; and he that is holy, ſhall be holy ſtill. You ſee, my dear hearers, that at the her of God there is only this one diſtinction, holy and unholy, juſt and unjuſt; and it will there be decided, unto which of theſe claſſes we belong, and we muſt take our overlaſting portion accordingly, for from this deciſion there is no appeal. And can we be juſt, righteous, and holy, without the mercy of God? Can we be thus of ourſelves? No; it is the higheſt arrogance and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuppoſe it. Shall man be juſt before God? Shall any ſon of man preſume he is righteous? Folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all! <hi>What is man that he ſhould be clean?</hi> Behold! God putteth no ſuch truſt in his ſaints, and <hi>the heavens are not clean in his ſight—how much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water!</hi> Theſe are the words of everlaſting truth; and though by nature we are thus unholy, and far from righteouſneſs, yet, as truly as God liveth, without holineſs and perfect righteouſneſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord in peace. Do we not then ſtand in need of mercy, and infinite diſplays of mercy too? By God's free ſpirit we muſt have an application of the blood of Jeſus made to our ſouls, that our ſins may be waſhed away; we muſt have the love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts, that our conſciences may be purged from ſin and dead works, by an act of the free grace of God the Father; the glorious and complete righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be imputed unto us for our juſtification—And is not this mercy, for God to do all this for poor hell-deſerving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020721_0019_0FB0E397B797CFC0"/>
Therefore, in the name and by the authority of the Son of God, I muſt teſtify unto you all, who hear me this day, except you have all this done for you by the mere mercy of God, you muſt be everlaſtingly damned! O ſinners! be not angry with this plain dealing with your ſouls; if you will not believe this to be truth, you muſt run the awful hazard of your unbelief; but, for myſelf, I dare not ſhun to declare the whole counſel of God! O realize your dependence on God; remember your help is alone in the arm of Jehovah; all your encouragement is there. While then the door of mercy is open, be perſuaded to bow the knee—become beggars at the throne of grace. I know we may well bluſh to aſk ſuch favours from one we have ſo wronged, but neceſſity calls for it; therefore, let every one be importunate for this mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus; great as it is, you muſt all obtain it, or you cannot eſcape the wrath to come; yea, an eternity of happineſs depends upon your ſucceſs; go then, and take the publican's place, confeſs your guilt, and cry, <hi>God be merciful to me, a ſinner!</hi> Never give over your ſuit, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſcouragements you may apprehend in the way, yet, look towards the holy temple, and the Lord will ſend you anſwers of peace.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall now cloſe with a particular addreſs to the poor criminal, to look to God for mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſaac Coombs,</hi> I have now, for the laſt time, to urge upon your mind, theſe important and eternal realities and will you then take one more view of your ſituation? You have ſinned, and ſhed innocent blood, for which you are condemned by an earthly judge. You have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſentence of death! and are now within one or two hours of your execution, which will ſeparate your ſoul and body. To-day your probation for eternity ends!
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020721_0020_0FB0E39AB1100F00"/>
In a few hours, with you, time will be no longer! But there is ſomething in your ſituation more ſhocking than death! you have ſinned againſt an holy God; you have poured contempt on his ſacred authority; your heart has been ſtout againſt God; and, after your hard and impenitent heart, you have ſinned with an high hand, which you confeſs hath been againſt your own conſcience, and againſt ſolemn warnings and reproofs; this is what gives death his ſting, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin; for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men;</hi> and you appear to be now expoſed to this wrath. You have a ſoul of an infinite value, and as we wiſh the ſalvation of your immortal ſpirit, we muſt tell you plainly, you have not appeared to be a true penitent. Sometimes you have been affected with your ſituation, and we have been encouraged that you would lay it to heart; but, alas! theſe impreſſions have ſoon worn off, and you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a ſtrong inclination to thoſe very ſins which have been your ruin. We muſt, therefore, look upon you as being in the very <hi>gall of bitterneſs,</hi> and <hi>bond of iniquity.</hi> Life and death hath been ſet before you—the way of repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath been pointed out to you, and there is no other way. Therefore, if you do not repent—hate ſin, forſake it, and turn to God, you cannot be ſaved. For though God is merciful in Chriſt, to ſuch as truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, yet he is a God of ſtrict juſtice, he <hi>will, by no means, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the guilty.</hi> His law is exceeding broad. <hi>Whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the judgment: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, thou fool, ſhall he in danger of hell-fire.</hi> Theſe are the true ſayings of God. O then! how great is your deſert! you are going to appear before the Judge of all, to know theſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020721_0021_0FB0E39B94B139D8"/>
truths from the bar of God; and if you are not there found intereſted in Jeſus, you muſt immediately ſink down amongſt the ſpirits in priſon, to ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire, to dwell with everlaſting burnings. Your poor ſoul will be ſentenced by the Judge of quick and dead, to welter out an eternity under his ſcorching wrath. If <hi>Cain,</hi> for ſheding the blood of a brother, muſt <hi>be avenged ſeven fold,</hi> truly, if ſtrict juſtice takes place in thee, for ſheding the blood of a nearer relation, thou muſt be avenged <hi>ſeventy and ſeven fold.</hi> Think how much blood there is in your caſe. You confeſs the people of God have cleared their garments of your blood. Chriſt Jeſus hath ſhed his blood to make an atonement for ſinners; and, except you are intereſted in this atonement, by faith; that blood you have ſhed, your own blood, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will all reſt upon you head. This puniſhment will be greater than you can bear. Repent, therefore, O repent! repent! that your ſins may be blotted out, and refreſhing might come to your ſoul, from the preſence of the Lord. In thyſelf thou art loſt, utterly loſt; O <hi>Iſaac!</hi> thou haſt deſtroyed thyſelf, but in the Lord Jeſus there is help; he is all ſufficient for thee; look unto him, and be thou ſaved. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſin of the world;</hi> he <hi>is the end of the law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi>—Jeſus Chriſt, that beloved Son God, in whom he is well pleaſed, came into the world, and lived an holy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life; he was condemned at <hi>Pilate</hi>'s bar; he died upon the croſs, on Mount Calvary; he roſe again from the dead, and aſcended into heaven, and is ſeated at the right hand of the Father, there exalted to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins. Our Lord ſuffered and died, <hi>that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting

life.</hi> He roſe from the dead <hi>for their juſtification; he liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Now, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> if you want pardon, look to a crucified Chriſt; if you want juſtification, look to a riſen Saviour; if you want to be waſhed and made fit for God's right hand, <hi>the blood of Jeſus cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> Finally, look to Jeſus for all you want; there is enough in him. In the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood of Jeſus put your hope—on this glorious found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation reſt your ſoul. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved;</hi> and <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> What thou doeſt, do quickly! <hi>Iſaac,</hi> I bid thee farewell! until we meet at the bar of God! and the Lord have mercy on thy never-dying ſoul!</p>
