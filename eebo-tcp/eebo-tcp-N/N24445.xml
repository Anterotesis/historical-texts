            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the words now before us, we are taught the following intereſting leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, That having made uſe of all the means in our power, to guard againſt the evils to which we are expoſed, our dependence muſt be placed on the Providence of God.</p>
            <p>As this truth will apply univerſally, in all caſes of danger and trouble, in the following Diſcourſe I will call your attention to ſome of the dangers and evils, to which large towns and cities are particularly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I will then ſuggeſt a few conſiderations, tending to impreſs on our mind the important leſſon expreſſed in the text.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, our attention ſhall be given to ſome of the dangers and evils, to which large towns and cities are particularly expoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032358_0004_0FF1F0604C621310"/>
Large towns and cities are more expoſed to the calamities of war, than leſs populous places.</p>
            <p>People are invited to ſettle in towns and cities, by the advantages which they offer to commerce, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures, and the uſeful arts. The wealth of towns and cities bears a general proportion to their extent and population. In times of war, therefore, the largeſt towns and cities will be objects to which an enemy will give the firſt attention. The conqueſt of ſuch places has a double effect: It weakens the country invaded, and by adding wealth to the conqueror, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him to make farther depredations.</p>
            <p>In all countries, where invading armies are ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, large towns and cities have been expoſed to the greateſt calamities. I need not be particular in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating inſtances. The hiſtorical part of the Bible,— the hiſtories of modern nations, and of the age in which we live, are full of them.</p>
            <p>Large towns and cities are more expoſed to the calamities ariſing from ſedition and rebellion, than leſs populous places.</p>
            <p>Experience teaches, what indeed would be natural to expect, that the fermentation of party zeal has been more violent, and productive of more ſerious conſequences in large towns and cities, than in ſmall places. In towns and cities, men of reſtleſs temper and ſeditions ſpirits can have frequent communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and having deviſed miſchief, they can with more expedition and effect execute their purpoſes, than in places where accomplices are ſpread over a conſiderable ſpace of country.</p>
            <p>Large towns and cities are more expoſed to infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and peſtilential diſeaſes, than leſs populous places.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032358_0005_0FF1F06206C31C10"/>In places crowded with inhabitants, the air which is inhaled, is charged with noxious vapours.</p>
            <p>In ſome places, fatal diſorders are generated by the action of heat on bodies capable of diſcharging a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal poiſon: In other places, if diſeaſes of the worſt kind are not generated, the conſtitutions of people may be prediſpoſed to receive infection, when it is brought to them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who make the healing art their ſtudy have noticed the malignancy of particular diſorders, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular parts of crowded cities.</p>
            <p>Large towns and cities are more expoſed to the rage of devouring flames, than ſmaller places. The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from this evil may be conſiderably diminiſhed by the uſe of ſuch materials, in the conſtruction of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as will reſiſt the flames: It is however next to impoſſible, to erect houſes, fit to be inhabited, without having a certain portion of the materials, of a combuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible nature.</p>
            <p>Such is the conſtitution and frame of our body, that it is equally neceſſary to guard againſt the effects of cold and damp habitations, as againſt the danger of fire: ſo that by carrying our caution to an extreme againſt fire, we might poſſibly expoſe ourſelves to other evils fatal to our health and comfort. The danger of fire, however, cannot be too watchfully counteracted in a town like <hi>this,</hi> in which we live, where the greateſt part of the buildings conſiſt of materials highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible. The danger is conſtantly before our eyes: we ſeldom paſs a ſeaſon, without beholding the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſome of our neighbours and friends on fire. Although the deſtruction of property, by this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemy, has not been ſo great during the laſt twelve
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032358_0006_0FF1F063D7FF7A78"/>months, as in ſome former ſeaſons, the cry of fire has been unuſually frequent ſince the year commenced, and attended, in ſome inſtances, with circumſtances peculiarly alarming.</p>
            <p>We add, once more, Large towns and cities are more expoſed to incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, and robbers, than ſmaller places.</p>
            <p>In large towns, the proportion of abandoned char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters is greater, than in places more thinly inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The baſeſt of mankind find it more eaſy to hide themſelves; and they find more opportunities to ſpend the fruits of their wickedneſs to their mind, in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous places, than in country villages.</p>
            <p>To people in the induſtrious and peaceful walks of life, it will appear almoſt incredible, that any of the human race can be ſo vile as to break open your dwelling place when you are at reſt, and rob you of the property which you have laid up for your comfort, and the comfort of thoſe who depend on the fruits of your induſtry. But to the diſgrace of human nature, we find there are people ſo baſe, ſo loſt to all ſenſe of moral rectitude, ſo vile and abandoned, as to wander about in the night time, like beaſts of prey, ſeeking what they can find, and whom they may devour.— There are people, who, when the virtuous and good are aſleep in their beds, deviſe miſchief againſt them, and endeavour to find out ways to enter their houſes and rob them. There are people, who, when perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating ſuch acts of violence, would, if poſſible, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe who oppoſe, or venture to arreſt them.</p>
            <p>Inſtances of night-robbery and murder, in countries long ſettled and full of inhabitants, have not been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common. From thoſe elder and more corrupt parts
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032358_0007_0FF1F065D74E9168"/>of the earth, ſome of the baſeſt of men have found the way to America.</p>
            <p>It has been ſuſpected, that the late devaſtations by fire, in ſeveral of the ſouthern States, were occaſioned by ſome wicked perſons, who have come among us. Strong ſuſpicions have been entertained, within a few weeks, that incendiaries and robbers have found the way to Boſton; and within a few days paſt, we have had alarming evidence, that our ſuſpicions were not without reaſon.</p>
            <p>Several houſes have been broken open in the night, and the inhabitants put in danger of their lives. One of thoſe daring enemies of our peace, ſeized in the very act of robbery, and with a deadly weapon in his hand, is now under ſentence of death, and in a few days muſt be removed from among the living.</p>
            <p>But the ſolemnity of the trial, which brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a vaſt crowd of people, was not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other ſinners, who were at the time lurking in our borders, from crimes equally atrocious.</p>
            <p>On the very night after the trial, two other houſes in the town were broken open; to one of which fire was kindled, and had the inhabitants remained igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their danger a few minutes longer, they muſt have periſhed in the flames.</p>
            <p>Imagination cannot deſcribe the conſternation we ſhould have felt, had not the increaſing flame been diſcovered juſt at the moment. From the combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature of the building to which the fire was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, and of the buildings in the neighbourhood,— from the <hi>force</hi> and the <hi>direction</hi> of the wind, on that night, it is not probable the fire could have been
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032358_0008_0FF1F069ED9AC248"/>checked, in its dreadful progreſs, until it had laid in ruin a large portion of the town. We thank God for the wonderful preſervation!</p>
            <p>I ſhould expoſe myſelf to the juſt reſentment of my fellow citizens, did I attempt to excite their fears, and diſturb their repoſe, without ſufficient reaſon. But the repeated inſtances of houſe-breaking and robbery, and of attempting to ſet fire to the town, afford painful evidence, that ſome of the worſt and moſt dangerous of mankind are now among us: The utmoſt vigilance and exertion of the inhabitants are called for on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned ſome of the dangers and evils to which large towns and cities are more particularly expoſed, it will be natural to inquire, What is to be done?—will it be adviſable to abandon the cities, and ſpread more thinly over the country?—or, can we think of any means of guarding againſt the dangers and evils to which populous places are particularly expoſed?</p>
            <p>Towns and cities grow up with commerce and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures: They cannot be abandoned, therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing violence to the natural courſe of things in ſociety. There are evils in <hi>ſociety,</hi> and there are evils in a <hi>ſtate of nature:</hi> There are evils peculiar to large and crowded places; and there are advantages in ſome meaſure to balance them. Evils we ſhall find, more or leſs, in all ſituations and employments of life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we determine to ſhift our ſituation and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall do well to make uſe of all the means in our power, to ſecure ourſelves againſt the evils which attend them; and then, after comparing all circumſtances, we may determine, whether a change
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032358_0009_0FF1F06DC3BD6D90"/>of ſituation and employment would, on the whole, give us a greater proſpect of happineſs. But after all we can do, let our ſituation be what it may, we are taught to place our hope in God, both for ſucceſs in the buſineſs of life, and for protection in danger and trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Except the Lord keepeth the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſacred words teach us to hope in God as our protector and refuge in trouble; and they teach us that we ourſelves alſo muſt be active and vigilant. We muſt <hi>watch,</hi> as well as <hi>pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this place I would beg leave to mention a few particulars, to which we ſhall do well to give heed, as we wiſh to leſſen the dangers and evils incident to large and populous places.</p>
            <p>The limits of the preſent diſcourſe will only admit of <hi>Hints,</hi> which I will venture to ſuggeſt under each of the particulars already mentioned; the propriety of which I ſubmit to the judgment of my fellow cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens.</p>
            <p>1ſt. Large towns and cities are more expoſed to the calamities of war, than ſmaller places. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, therefore, if they are wiſe, will endeavour to keep peace with all thoſe powers which are able to injure them: They will be careful not to give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by threatening ſpeeches, or by any unrighteous conduct, either to their neighbours, or foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to make war upon them.</p>
            <p>But as the rulers of the nations are more generally governed by paſſion and ſelf-intereſt, than by reaſon and equity, and people who were the moſt inoffenſive
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032358_0010_0FF1F06FA3919B28"/>have been invaded, the inhabitants of rich towns and cities will do well, even in profound peace, to provide for their defence: But in the preſent reſtleſs ſtate of the world, when nations riſe up againſt nations, and the fury of war creates innumerable wants, thoſe who are not particularly connected with the contending powers need to be on their guard, and fortify againſt lawleſs invaders. <note n="*" place="bottom">Note 1ſt See Appendix.</note>

            <p>2dly. Large towns and cities are more expoſed to the calamities ariſing from ſedition and rebellion, than leſs populous places. The wiſe and virtuous, therefore, will endeavour, by all prudent means, to counteract a factious ſpirit: They will unite, and come forward with alacrity and firmneſs, to ſupport government and withſtand the turbulence of unreaſonable men.</p>
            <p>3dly. Large towns and cities are more expoſed to infectious and peſtilential diſeaſes, than leſs populous places. Wiſdom and the healing art will at all times lend their aid to prevent the ſpread of fatal diſorders, and guard the inhabitants of crowded places againſt the maladies to which they are particularly expoſed. The removal of all putreſcent matter—cleanlineſs, and a free circulation of good air, are certainly among the firſt things neceſſary to the preſervation of health in large towns and cities. <note n="†" place="bottom">Note 2d. See Appendix.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4thly. Large towns and cities are more expoſed to devouring flames, than ſmaller places. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of large and crowded places are therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be particularly watchful. Much may be done to guard againſt this calamity by brick walls, and the uſe of ſuch materials for covering, as are not
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032358_0011_0FF1F0717948EEA8"/>combuſtible: But after all that can be done, in the ways above mentioned, under Providence, ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends very much on the habitual attention and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>5thly. Large towns and cities are more expoſed to incendiaries, and robbers, than ſmaller places.</p>
            <p>To leſſen the danger, from the enemies now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, it will be neceſſary that the government of large towns and cities be ſufficiently vigorous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and confine, all ſuſpected perſons.</p>
            <p>As towns and cities increaſe in population and wealth, it is found neceſſary that the government be more vigorous, and that it proceed with more firmneſs and diſpatch, than in the earlier ſtages of ſociety. <note n="*" place="bottom">Note 3d. See Appendix.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But as I only mean to give a few hints, tending to our ſecurity againſt the dangers and evils incident to populous places, I would leave them with my fellow citizens, and go on, according to promiſe,</p>
            <p>To ſuggeſt a few conſiderations, in order to impreſs on our mind the importance of truſting in God as our protector and refuge in danger and trouble.</p>
            <p>Having done all in our power, we ſtill need the protection of Omnipotence. The leſſon contained in the text cannot be too frequently inculcated: The important idea cannot be too deeply engraven on our heart: <q>Except the Lord keep the city, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man waketh but in vain.</q> The enemies of our peace and ſafety may be working in ſecret places, where the moſt vigilant eye of man cannot ſee them. But while their deſigns are hidden from us, and we know nothing of them, all their wicked plans are known to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032358_0012_0FF1F0776D46E970"/>God. There is no ſecret corner—no dark retreat, where the thief and incendiary can hide from the eye of Him who knoweth all things.</p>
            <p>He beholds the kindling ſire, which, if blown up to a flame, might conſume us and our dwellings together. His good providence hath ſaved us. To him we give thanks, that the meditated deſtruction was diſcovered, and that ſome who deviſed miſchief againſt us have been detected and confined.</p>
            <p>We derive unſpeakable conſolation from the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we have, that a Being of infinite perfection governs the world, and that he is able to counteract and fruſtrate the deſigns of our moſt dangerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. To a God of infinite power and goodneſs we may look: on him we may place our hope in all times of danger and trouble.</p>
            <p>When invaded by foes from abroad, God can fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate their deſigns: He can turn their councils into fooliſhneſs: He can ſcatter them by ſtorms; and in a variety of ways prevent their executing the thing, which they may have purpoſed againſt us. If God is, pleaſed to defend us, we are ſafe; and we may hope he will be our defence, if we are careful to do the things which pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>When reſlleſs and wicked men combine for ſeditious purpoſes, and ſay in their heart, Let us break the bands of ſociety and caſt away the cords of government, He who ſitteth in the heavens can make them aſhamed, and bring the miſchief which they had purpoſed for others, on their own heads.</p>
            <p>When contagious and mortal diſeaſes break out, and begin to ſpread calamity and death through our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032358_0013_0FF1F07AF6CDC518"/>ſtreets, He who commandeth the winds and they blow, and governeth the ſeaſons according to his pleaſure, can inſtantly change the ſtate of the atmoſphere, and remove the threatening evil. Fire and vapour, and all the elements, are under his control. And He who controls the winds;—He who maketh the flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire miniſter to his purpoſes, controlleth alſo the <hi>paſſions</hi> of the children of men. <q>He maketh the wrath of man to praiſe him; and the remainder of wrath he reſtraineth.</q> The moſt vile of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the bloody-minded aſſaſſin, the incendiary and murderer, are under his authority: they cannot move, when he is pleaſed to exerciſe his power, to reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>To men of religion, ſuch conſiderations as thoſe which have now been ſuggeſted, are highly pleaſing. What can afford us more ſolid comfort, than to be aſſured, that all things in the heavens and on the earth, yea, all the events which have taken place, and which ſhall take place throughout the unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable <hi>univerſe,</hi> are under the control of inſinite wiſdom, and infinire goodneſs!</p>
            <p>Let us rejoice that the Lord reigneth; and as the government which he execiſeth over his rational creatures is juſt and equal, let us always ſubmit to him. In humble obedience to his will, let us commit all our important concernments to his providence: And when the ſcenes of time and nature ſhall change no more, may we be admitted to thoſe peaceful regions, where no threatening enemy ſhall ever come near us: where the ſons of anarchy and licentiouſneſs ſhall never diſturb us: where diſeaſe and death ſhall never
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032358_0014_0FF1F07CC13BEB00"/>invade us: where the flames ſhall never reach our manſions: where the incendiary and robber ſhall never interrupt our repoſe. In thoſe peaceful regions may we unite with the general aſſembly of the wiſe and good, in adoring the perfections of God, and the wiſdom of his government, forever and ever.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX, CONTAINING An Account of ſeveral daring Attempts to ſet Fire to the Town of BOSTON, and rob the Inhabitants; together with HINTS tending to the Security of populous Towns and Cities againſt the Evils to which they are more particularly expoſed.</head>
            <p>TO whatever cauſe or cauſes it may be owing,— whether to the unuſual commotions among the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean nations, and the Weſt-India iſlands,—or to <hi>falſe</hi> notions of liberty and equality which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by people void of underſtanding,—or to the efforts of certain modern apoſtles of infidelity to break down the reſtraints of religion, and remove from the mind of man all apprehenſion of an <hi>hereafter,</hi> certain it is, that the American States have of late been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to threatening and unuſual calamities, from law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and wicked men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heretofore</hi> there have been but few inſtances of <hi>arſon,</hi> or houſe-burning, attended with night-robbery, in this country: But of late, inſtances of perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or of attempting to perpetrate thoſe crimes, have become alarming.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032358_0017_0FF1F08C379A7388"/>
According to promiſe, and in compliance with the wiſhes of ſome of my fellow citizens, I will now give an account of ſeveral daring attempts to ſet fire to Boſton, and rob the inhabitants. In a few notes, I will then enlarge on the <hi>Hints,</hi> in the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, tending to the ſecurity of populous towns and cities againſt the evils to which they are particularly expoſed.</p>
            <p>But before I relate the attempts which have been made to ſet fire to Boſton, I would juſt obſerve, that ſuſpicions have been ſtrong, that the fires which ſpread deſolation through the capital of Georgia and of South-Carolina, ſome months ago, were the effects of wicked deſign. Thoſe ſuſpicions, we are informed, have been confirmed, and ſome have been executed for the crime.</p>
            <p>Whether the incendiaries who began at the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came on towards the North; or the ſame evil ſpirit has operated on wicked people, in different parts of the country, in ſucceſſion, we cannot ſay.</p>
            <p>There is ſufficient evidence that many attempts have been made (and in a number of them with fatal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) to ſet fire to buildings in New-Jerſey, in New-York, in Connecticut, and in ſeveral towns in Maſſachuſetts, within the laſt three or four months.</p>
            <p>The firſt inſtance of robbing and attempting to burn which I ſhall mention in <hi>this town,</hi> was on the night of Feb. 22. In an advertiſement in the Centinel, Mr. Marriott ſets forth, that his houſe in Winter-ſtreet "was broken open, robbed and fired." The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032358_0018_0FF1F08E28F7F210"/>teſtify, that Mr. Marriott and his wife being from home, they ſaw an unuſual light in the chamber, and on entering the ſame, they found the fire had done conſiderable damage, and that the houſe in a few minutes would have been conſumed, had they not given "the timely aſſiſtance."</p>
            <p>On the ſame night, the ſhop of Mr. <hi>Holmes</hi> in Union-ſtreet was broke open; and to the ſurpriſe of the owner, when he entered it in the morning, he ſaw fire had been placed on one of the ſhelves, which ſpread ſeveral feet,—burned the wood work to a coal, and then went out.</p>
            <p>On the night of the 7th of March, the houſe of Mr. <hi>Solomon Hewes</hi> was entered and robbed of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſum of money; and on the ſame night the houſe of Mrs. <hi>Lee</hi> was robbed of money, plate and other valuables.</p>
            <p>On Sunday morning March 5th, the town was alarmed with the fire which broke out in the houſe occupied by Mr. <hi>William Turner.</hi> The fire had made ſuch progreſs before it was diſcovered, that no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſufficient to ſtop its rage. In a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes the building in which it was firſt diſcovered, and the elegant ſtable of the late Governor Bowdoin, were in flames. Although there were at the time ſome ſuſpicions of wicked deſign, no proof could be obtained, until a <hi>black man</hi> was apprchended for anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er crime of the ſame ſort, in whoſe poſſoſſion were ſound ſeveral articles, the property of Mr. Turner, which were taken from his houſe, on the night in which it was burned.</p>
            <p>The next inſtance I ſhall mention is that which took place ar the houſe of Capt. Enoch Ruſt, in Prince-ſtreet.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032358_0019_0FF1F09069E4CAE0"/>It appeared on the trial of the criminal that the houſe was violently entered between the hours of two and three in the morning. Four or five locks were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the lower part of the houſe, but as the robbers did not find all the money which they expected, one of them, with a deadly weapon in his hand, entered the lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chamber of Capt. <hi>Ruſt,</hi> jun. and with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening language of a murderer, demanded his money. The young gentleman, with great ſpirit, ſlew upon the robber, and fortunately indeed, laid him on the floor. He was ſoon confined, has ſince had his trial, and is now under ſentence of death <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap> was executed on the ſixth of April</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the night of March 16th, the houſe of Mr. <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Goldſbury</hi> was broken open and robbed of ſeveral pieces of plate. The wretch who was guilty of the crime, before he left the houſe, perpetrated another much more dreadful. He kindled a fire in a part, the moſt convenient to communicate with the lodging chambers; and had not the inhabitants been awoke by the ſmoke, the ſlames would ſoon have rendered their eſcape impoſſible.</p>
            <p>A <hi>black man</hi> who had ſerved in the family was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and ſearch being made, plate and other articles were found with him which had been taken, both from Mr. Goldſbury, and from Mr. Turner. The unhappy creature, who, it appears, had been confined for ſome crime in Nova-Scotia, not many months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is now faſt bound in chains, and kept for the time of trial.</p>
            <p>On the ſame night that the burglary and arſon were committed in the houſe of Mr. Goldſbury, the houſe of Mr. <hi>Rallion,</hi> in State-ſtreet, was entered
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032358_0020_0FF1F09B841C9CC0"/>by a thief, who was taken before he could make his eſcape, and is alſo committed. On the ſame night a Mr. Tufts was robbed of his money, by three men, as he was paſſing over Winter-Hill.</p>
            <p>Fire has alſo been ſat to a building in Middle-ſtreet, belonging to Mrs. <hi>Beals;</hi> which having burned ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to diſcover the wicked deſign, went out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther injury.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, for ſeveral weeks, almoſt every news-paper has given an account of freſh inſtances of ſetting fire to buildings of one kind or another, either in our neighbourhood, or in ſome parts of the country. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr.Williams's barns and corn houſe in Roxbury were burnt on the 2d of April.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The inſtances now mentioned, are ſufficient to ſhow, that ſome of the worſt of the creation are lurking among us, and that the utmoſt vigilance and exertion are neceſſary to guard againſt them, and if poſſible to detect and confine them.</p>
            <p>IF any apology be neceſſary for laying before my fellow citizens the following Notes, in addition to the Hints already given, I have only to ſay, they are offered with a good deſign.</p>
            <p>Note 1ſt. <q>In the preſent reſtleſs ſtate of the world, thoſe who wiſh to live in peace, and are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly connected with the contending powers, need be on their guard, and fortify againſt lawleſs invaders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:032358_0021_0FF1F09F03110CA8"/>
The political ſituation of the American States at the preſent day, is peculiarly difficult. It is certainly our wiſdom to keep out of the quarrels of the European quarter of the world: But while thoſe kingdoms are angry with each other, they may not be diſpoſed to treat <hi>neutral countries</hi> with impartiality and juſtice.—As God hath kindly placed us three thouſand miles from the preſent great theatre of quarrel, we are in no great danger of hoſtile armies: But ſhould the war continue to rage, our ſea-ports may poſſibly be inſulted by armed cruiſers.</p>
            <p>It ſeems as neceſſary that our towns and cities, near the water, ſhould be fortified againſt lawleſs invaders, as that our houſes ſhould be barred and bolted againſt thieves and robbers. It is as neceſſary that a lock ſhould be fixed to your <hi>harbour,</hi> as to the <hi>cheſt</hi> which contains your money:—As proper that the <hi>key</hi> ſhould be in the hand of the ſupreme authority, as that the key of the family treaſures, be in the hand of the head of the family.</p>
            <p>Note 2d. <q>The removal of all putreſcent matter,— <hi>cleanlineſs,</hi> and a free circulation of good air, are certainly among the firſt things neceſſary to the preſervation of health, in large towns and cities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is now univerſally acknowledged, that ſome of the moſt diſtreſſing maladies, which ſpread deſolation and death through large and populous places, are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the noxious vapours which the inhabitants inhale.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing therefore which requires the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of people who live in large and crowded places,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032358_0022_0FF1F0A0C7DA1608"/>in order to preſerve health, is to remove as much as poſſible, every kind of ſubſtance which tends to poiſon the air.</p>
            <p>The atmoſphere in which we live, is never entirely pure: it is a compound of <hi>healthful</hi> and noxious fluids. By the laborious experiments of Dr. <hi>Prieſtly,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ingen-Houſz,</hi> the late celebrated <hi>Lavoiſier</hi> and others, it hath been demonſtrated, that the quantity of <hi>noxious gas</hi> in the atmoſphere, is always much greater than the <hi>pure vital air.</hi> The proportion of <hi>noxious</hi> to the <hi>vital air,</hi> in a ſtate of the atmoſphere favourable to health, is found to be as 72 to 28. On the preſervation of <hi>this proportion,</hi> or ſomething near to it, we depend for ſtrength, for health, for ſpirits, and life itſelf.</p>
            <p>The diſcovery of this proportion of <hi>vital air,</hi> and of <hi>noxious gas,</hi> in the atmoſphere which we breathe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the means of <hi>increaſing,</hi> or <hi>diminiſhing</hi> the one or the other, as occaſion may require, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly among the moſt important diſcoveries of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern times.</p>
            <p>If I can aſſiſt my fellow-citizens in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe diſcoveries, for the purpoſes of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the evils to which large and crowded places are particularly expoſed, I ſhall feel happy.</p>
            <p>It is well known that the vapour from ſtagnant water, particularly in hot weather, from dirty ſtreets, dead carcaſſes, and all putreſcent bodies, is unfit for reſpiration. Such vapours, riſing about us, and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the air we breathe, deſtroy the healthful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion abovementioned: When the quantity of <hi>nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious gas</hi> is great, and long continued, it will produce
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032358_0023_0FF1F0A7DFBA5080"/>ſome of the moſt fatal diſorders, under which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of large and crowded places are ever doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>To prevent thoſe evils, the firſt attention muſt be given to <hi>cleanlineſs.</hi> If individuals in large and crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed places, neglect, or refuſe to remove filth from their houſes and doors, eſpecially in the ſummer ſeaſon, the common ſafety certainly will juſtify the interpoſition of authority.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Mitcheli,</hi> of New-York, in his ingenious and very uſeful <q>attempt to aſcertain the true nature of contagion,</q> has the following obſervation to the preſent purpoſe;— <q>While puddles of putrid naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and piles of reeking dung are inceſſantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling their poiſonous ſteams, that <hi>magiſtracy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults very imperfectly the public health, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects the removal of ſuch common nuiſances.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>gaſeous oxyd,</hi> or noxious vapour from ſtagnant water, and the filth which is too long ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſtreets and lanes of populous towns, is heavier than good air, it is diſpoſed to ſettle in low places: and accordingly the loweſt parts of Philadelphia and of New-York, were the places where the <hi>yellow fever</hi> raged with the greateſt violence. In low and dirty parts of a populous town, thoſe fevers which are occaſioned by bad air, may be always expected to put on the worſt appearances.</p>
            <p>Having done all in our power to prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of bad air, our next attention ſhould be given to promote the increaſe of that which is good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:032358_0024_0FF1F0AD7B561428"/>
The moſt certain means for this purpoſe, and at the ſame time, the leaſt expenſive, is to adorn the places in which we live, with <hi>thriſty trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Trees, during the whole time they are covered with green leaves, are found to take up, as their food, the <hi>nitrogene gas,</hi>—the corrupted air which has ſerved the purpoſes of combuſtion,—which has paſſed the lungs of animals, or has been exhaled from putrid bodies; and in the kindeſt manner, to return ſtreams of <hi>good air,</hi> from the upper ſurfaces of their leaves, expoſed to the light of the ſun.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to finiſh this note with a part of the ſpeech delivered before the Royal Society of LONDON, by Sir <hi>John Pringle,</hi> at the giving a prize medal to Dr. <hi>Prieſtly,</hi> as an honourable teſtimony of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of that learned body, of the labours which he had beſtowed on the doctrine of air.</p>
            <p>
               <q>From theſe diſcoveries, ſays he, we are aſſured, that no vegetable grows in vain, but that from the oak of the foreſt, to the graſs in the field, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual plant is ſerviceable to mankind; if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtinguiſhed by ſome private virtue, yet mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the whole, which cleanſes and purifies our atmoſphere. In this the fragrant roſe, and deadly night-ſhade co-operate: nor is the herbage, nor the woods that flouriſh in the remote and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled regions, unprofitable to us, nor we to them; conſidering how conſtantly the winds convey to them <hi>our</hi> vitiated air for <hi>our</hi> relief, and for <hi>their</hi> nouriſhment. And, if ever theſe ſalutary gales riſe to ſtorms and hurricanes, let us ſtill trace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032358_0025_0FF1F0B14943FA90"/>the ways of a beneficent Being, who, not fortuitouſly, but with deſign, not in <hi>wrath,</hi> but in <hi>mercy,</hi> thus ſhakes the waters and the air together, to bury in the deep, thoſe putrid and peſtilential effluvia, which the vegetables upon the face of the earth, had been inſufficient to conſume.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Note 3d. <q>As towns and cities increaſe in popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wealth, it is found neceſſary that the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment be more vigorous, and that it it proceed with more firmneſs and diſpatch, than in the earlier ſtages of ſociety.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of this obſervation cannot be called in queſtion. Populous towns and cities, will find, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the neceſſity of changing or improving their <hi>police,</hi> as their circumſtances alter: Thoſe regulations which anſwer the purpoſes of ſmall villages and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try towns, will be found inſufficient for large commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial places, eſpecially when they become the reſort of foreigners, bringing with them the habits of different nations, of different modes of education, and of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent religions.</p>
            <p>A great part of the inhabitants of Boſton, I believe, are convinced that the government of the town wants energy, and that the <hi>police</hi> eſtabliſhed by our venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fathers, may be improved to advantage.</p>
            <p>Some new regulations are wanting, or additional force and ſpirit given to ſuch as have been already made, to prevent the evils we ſuffer from <hi>vagrants,</hi> ſtrolling <hi>mendicants,</hi> and people of ſuſpicious, and of bad char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.</p>

A complete remedy of the evils now mentioned, can be expected in nothing ſhort of the <hi>confinement</hi> of perſons, of the above deſcription, in ſome place of puniſhment or induſtry, where they ſhall be prevented doing miſchief, and if poſſible, be obliged to earn their living.</p>
            <p>The aſtoniſhing relief given to the city of <hi>Munich,</hi> by our countryman Sir <hi>Benjamin Thompſon,</hi> now <hi>Count of Rumford,</hi> when it was infeſted with a multitude of impudent mendicants, and people of the moſt vicious character, is ſufficient to ſhow what may be done; and to encourage like attempts in other parts of the world.</p>
            <p>A houſe of <hi>Induſtry</hi> was provided, with ſuitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations and employments; and under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of that enterpriſing and benevolent officer, <hi>Munich</hi> was, in one day, delivered from 1200 miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, ſunk in vice, and peſts of ſociety.</p>
            <p>Nor will the expenſe of ſuch an enterpriſe, as that which was carried into execution by <hi>Benjamin, Count of Rumford,</hi> to put an end to the evils of <hi>mendicity</hi> in Bavaria, be at all diſcouraging, when it is conſidered, that he prepared a very wholeſome kind of food for 1200 people in the houſe of induſtry, for £ 1.7.6. per day, which is but a little over <hi>one farthing</hi> for each perſon; and by a great improvement in the conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kitchen fire-place, the fuel neceſſary to cook food for 1000 people does not coſt more than <hi>four pence half penny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What has been done by <hi>Count Rumford</hi> in Bavaria, may be done in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>

Conceive now of the relief we ſhould experience from an inſtitution ſimilar to that which we have been conſidering!—Such inſtitutions in our large towns and cities, would go far to prevent the evils which we ſuffer from <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> perſons, who are conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrolling about, and of late, have ſpread alarm both in town and country.</p>
            <p>Such an inſtitution, executed with ſpirit, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a frequent <hi>return</hi> to an office of <hi>police,</hi> of the names of all perſons who put up at lodging houſes, and houſes of entertainment of every deſcription, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the general ſtate of the ſeveral wards into which the town now is, or may be conveniently divided, would do more towards our ſecurity againſt <hi>thieves</hi> and <hi>incendiaries,</hi> than the <hi>nightly watch</hi> and <hi>patrol</hi> of a large number of the inhabitants.</p>
