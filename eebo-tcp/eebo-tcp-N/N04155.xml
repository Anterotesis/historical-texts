            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unhappy one on the <hi>careleſs Multitude,</hi> as it is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.10-11.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parable,</hi> in which our <hi>Text</hi> is contained, is a ſhort, and very wonderful Repreſentation of the great Affair of our Salvation. We are taught what vaſt Preparation God has made for the Recovery, and Happineſs of a ſinful, periſhing World, intimated in the 16 Ver. by <hi>a certain Man making a great Supper: Matthew</hi> tells us, that <hi>a certain King made a Marriage for his Son,</hi> in his 22 Chapt. By which we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf, the <hi>great King</hi> of Heaven, and Earth, who has made a great Supper, and a Feaſt of fat Things, in the Goſpel, for hungry and periſhing Sinners. And when <hi>all Things were made ready</hi>; when a Saviour was provided; then many, even the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation were invited to come to this Goſpel-Feaſt. The <hi>Servants</hi> of the Moſt High <hi>GOD,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> were ſent forth to intreat them to accept of the rich Proviſion <hi>God</hi> had made: but <hi>they all excuſed themſelves</hi> (or the greater Part of them); one had bought a Piece of Ground and he muſt needs go and ſee it; another had bought five Yoke of Oxen; and he muſt go and prove them; a third had married a Wife and he could not come. Hereby not only is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Diſpoſition of the <hi>Jews</hi> pointed out to us; but alſo of the <hi>greater Part</hi> of Men under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; who have their Hearts and Affections ſo much engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Cares of the World, that they cannot conſult the Intereſt of their immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> had thus ſlighted the Invitations of a merciful <hi>God,</hi> and rejected the <hi>Saviour</hi> of their Souls: Then the Offers of Pardon and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are tendered to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Chriſt then ſends forth his Servants, the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Miniſters of the Goſpel into the <hi>Streets and Lanes of the City</hi>; that is, the <hi>Gentile World,</hi> to bring in hither the Poor, the

Maimed, the Halt, and the Blind: And the <hi>Lord</hi> of the Supper repeats his Command to his Servants with the greateſt Earneſtneſs; <hi>go out into the High Ways, and Hedges, and compel them to come in:</hi> Take no Denial of them; don't be eaſily put off by them: perſwade; yea bring them contrary to their Wills if poſſible; and I will make them willing: Gather in great Numbers that <hi>my Houſe may be full</hi>:</p>
            <p>We have three Things intimated in the Words of the <hi>Text.</hi> 1ſt The <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Church of God</hi> pointed out by the Term <hi>Houſe,</hi> which ſignifies to us the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py State and Condition of all ſuch, who are brought into the Kingdom of Chriſt: They are like Men in a Houſe protected from the Storms and Tempeſts: They may reſt and refreſh themſelves: they may take their Pleaſure, feaſt and regale themſelves in this Houſe. The Kingdom of God is compared to <hi>a great Houſe</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2.20.</note> where there are <hi>Veſſels,</hi> ſome for <hi>Honour</hi> and ſome to <hi>Diſhonour.</hi> 2dly, We have the <hi>miſerable State of the Gentile World</hi>; and of <hi>all thoſe</hi> who are out of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> ſet forth to us by thoſe who are in the High Ways and Hedges, who are Poor, Maimed, Halt and Blind. They are like Men expoſed to the Storms and Severities of the Weather, who have no Houſe nor Home to repair to, who are ready to periſh with the Hunger and Cold; and are ſo lame and maimed that they cannot help themſelves nor go any where to ſave their Lives: Sinners are poor, maimed and helpleſs, expos'd to all the Storms of the Diſpleaſure and Wrath of God. 3dly, We have the <hi>Pity and Compaſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>But it is my Deſign to conſider the Words before us under theſe two general Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Salvation</hi> of a <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>miſerable World,</hi> is a Matter, which our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt is much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt</hi> ſhould alſo have the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Sinners much upon their Hearts:</hi> And ſhould uſe all <hi>reaſonable</hi> Methods to <hi>compel</hi> them into the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Salvation</hi> of a <hi>ſinful and miſerable World</hi> is a Matter which our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt is much enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So he is repreſented in the <hi>Parable,</hi> as willing to take no Denial; <hi>Compel him to come in</hi>; dont be turn'd off by their Refuſals; but intreat, and perſwade them over and over again. The Salvation of Sinners was a Work, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had his Mind upon from all Eternity: and he took great Delight in the Fore-thoughts of it: <hi>His Delights were with the Children of Men</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Prov. 8.31.</note> above what they were with the holy Angels of Heaven; but this could be upon no other Account but that of his being their <hi>appointed Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi>: He foreſaw all he was to do, and ſuffer for them to bring them to <hi>God</hi> with Pleaſure. And the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating our Bleſſed Lord, ſays <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Pſa. 69.6.</note> The <hi>Zeal of thine Houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> He was ſwallowed up with a Concern for the <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi> So much was the Mind of Chriſt in this Work, that he was <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Luk. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>ſtraitned until it was accompliſhed</hi>: Nothing could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him from his Work. He would hearken to no Suggeſtions of going back from the Sufferings which were before him. And when the <hi>Apoſtle Peter</hi> once ventured to tell him, when ſpeaking of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sufferings, that ſuch Things ſhould not happen to

               <hi>Get thee behind me Satan thou art an Offence unto me.</hi> I will hear no ſuch Thing from thee; for I am ſet upon finiſhing the Work I am come into the World upon. His Heart was ſo much ſet upon it that he could deny himſelf of his Eaſe and Comfort that he might fulfil it: he could faſt and pray whole Nights for Sinners, who had no Prayers to put up to God for themſelves. He was ſo intent upon his Work, that he forgot his Food: or rather he made it <note n="(g)" place="bottom">John 4.33, 34.</note> his <hi>Meat and Drink to do the Will of his heavenly Father,</hi> in ſaving Sinners. He lived, as it were, upon his Work, he took ſo much Delight in it, and was ſo much concerned to finiſh it. But the Engagedneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this important Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of our Salvation will more fully appear from the Conſideration of theſe following Particulars.</p>

The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> moſt <hi>freely,</hi> and <hi>readily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook for Sinners</hi>; became obliged to pay the <hi>Price</hi> of their Redemption, and recover them from a State of <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> propoſed the Recovery of a Number of the <hi>fallen</hi> Race of <hi>Adam</hi>; and made known the Deſign he had of a rich Diſplay of his Grace in their Salvation; and declared, that in Order to this, ſome one muſt become a <hi>Surety</hi> for them, and pay the <hi>full Price</hi> of their Redemption: Then it was there was Silence among the <hi>Angels</hi>: no one dar'd to ſtep in between an <hi>offended God</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man:</hi> Nor was any Man found, who could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this great Work: But now, behold the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs and Readineſs of the <hi>Son</hi>! how freely does he offer himſelf on our Behalf! and ſay to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Heb. 10.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Lo! I am come to do thy Will.</hi> Here, <hi>I,</hi> thy <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> am; place all their Debt to my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: I will pay thee all: Turn all the Strokes of

thy Diſpleaſure upon me: I will bear them. Don't pity nor ſpare me; but ſhoot thine Arrows at me; Cauſe thy Sword to awake againſt me. I will obey the Law they have broke. I will endure all that Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment thine holy Law threatens for their Sins. I will ſatisfy thy Law; and reſtore that Honour to thee which their Sins have took away. Now, if it were a Matter of Indifference with the <hi>Son of God,</hi> whether we were ſaved or not, would he ſo readily have ſtept in, and become obliged to pay the whole Price of our Redemption? Would he have bound himſelf in a Covenant of Redemption to endure all that Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to Sinners; if he was not much engaged for our Redemption? He was under no Obligation to us. He might have left us to periſh in our Sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Injuſtice to us. Nor did he ſtand in any Need of us; or the Services which he expects from us, whom he has redeemed; for he was infinitely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the <hi>Boſom of his Father</hi> and could not be made more ſo. Nor did the <hi>Father compel</hi> him hereto: It was his own <hi>voluntary</hi> Act: No ſooner did the <hi>Father</hi> make known his Purpoſes of Grace but the <hi>Son</hi> freely offered himſelf to ſtand our <hi>Surety</hi>; and become obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pay the Debt we had contracted.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, The <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſhews us, <hi>how much the Work of our Redemption</hi> was upon the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Son of God.</hi> It was an infinite Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who was equal with <hi>God</hi> in all his divine Perfections, to take upon him the <hi>Seed of Abraham</hi>; and be made <hi>like unto ſinful Fleſh.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had a full View of all the Miſeries which ſhould befal him in <hi>our Nature,</hi> when he came down, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed <hi>Fleſh</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>; but yet, theſe did not terrify him: When the Fulneſs of Time was come, that he ſhould come forth into the World, he readily leſt his <hi>Father's Boſom,</hi> parted with the Joys and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

of that happy World above; he became Man, and veiled his Glory in <hi>Fleſh</hi>: and with what agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wonder and Surprize, ſhould we contemplate this <hi>great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the Fleſh?</hi> It is with Pleaſure the holy Angels deſire to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and underſtand this wonderful Tranſaction. And had not the Salvation of Sinners been a Thing of the greateſt Concern with the <hi>Son of God,</hi> would he have become Man? been made under the Law, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come expos'd to the Reproaches, and Blaſphemies of a ſinful World? would he have ſubjected himſelf to the Condemnation and Threatning of a broken Law; and by being made Man become neceſſitated to ſuffer and die in our Stead? As the <hi>Son of God</hi> foreſaw all theſe Things when he became <hi>Man</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So nothing but infinite Love and Pity to us could move him to it.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The <hi>Laboriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>fulfilling</hi> his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> whilſt here on Earth, diſcover to us, how <hi>much engag'd</hi> he was to <hi>redeem loſt</hi> and <hi>periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners.</hi> He was inceſſant in his Labours, unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his Pains to do good to the <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men. He went about from City to City, ſeeking all Opportunities of relieving miſerable Men. He bore the Griefs and carried the Sorrows of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men. He never turned aſide from any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Objects who ſought his Compaſſion, refuſing to help them. How induſtrious was he to reveal the great Purpoſes of divine Grace to Sinners, and the Way and Manner of our recovering the loſt Image, and Favour of God: he took the utmoſt Pleaſure in acquainting Men with the Miſeries of their natural State, in convincing them of the Neceſſity they were under of obtaining Pardon and Reconciliation with an offended <hi>God.</hi> He did not ſpend his Time in Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; but was careful to finiſh the Work he came

to do (k) before the Night come upon him wherein no Man can work. He was willing to ſpend and be ſpent in his Work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He did not ſpare himſelf; but encountered all Hardſhips and Difficulties; when they ſtood in the Way of our Salvation: and what was it ſtirred him up to all this Labour and Diligence but a <hi>Concern</hi> to finiſh the Work of our Redemption? this made him ſo zealous in all the Matters of God's Houſe. This it was made him deny himſelf of his Sleep, and forget his Food.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, That <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>deep Concern</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> had for <hi>hardened</hi> and <hi>ſecure Sinners ſhews how much their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation lay upon his Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However ſtupid and ſenſeleſs Sinners were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a moſt tender Pity for them; however unconcerned they were about their own Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> was full of Thoughtfulneſs about them. When they rejected his gracious Invitations, and ſleighted his meaneſt Offers; Then <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Mark 3.5.</note> he was grieved at the Hardneſs and Impenitency of their Hearts. <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Luke 19.41, 42.</note> He <hi>wept</hi> over a ſinful wretched World, who were neglecting the Things of their Peace. Our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> knew what Miſeries, and Torments Sinners were haſtening upon themſelves; it fill'd him therefore with Pity to ſee them refuſing the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for their Souls, and going on obſtinately in the broad Way to everlaſting Ruin, and this made the Son of God ſo affected for them, his being ſo much concerned for their Salvation.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſo readily undertaking all <hi>thoſe ſevere Sufferings</hi> which he endured for Sinners, ſhows us <hi>how much his Heart is upon this Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sorrows were multiplied upon the <hi>Son of God.</hi> His whole Life was a Scene of Suffering and Sorrow.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005119_0011_1016AA20C25F9310"/>
Hence he is ſtiled <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Iſaiah 53.3.</note> 
               <hi>A Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief.</hi> He was filled with inward Grief for our Sins and Follies: and he ſuſtained outward Troubles of various Kinds. He became a Reproach of Men, and the Song of Drunkards: he had not where to lay his Head; although the Earth and the Fulneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was his. But why do I tell of theſe; they were light compared with what he met with in the <hi>Garden</hi> and at his <hi>Death.</hi> The very Fore-thought of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings was ſo great that he <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Luke 22.44.</note> 
               <hi>ſweat great Drops of Blood</hi>: The very Veſſels of his Body burſt under the preſſing Agony: how great was the Diſtreſs of his Mind which had ſo great Power on his Body? And from hence let us follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Place of his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and <hi>Crucifixion</hi>: he was apprehended by a Band of Ruffians; who treated him in a moſt barbarous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; who buffeted him; crowned him with Thorns, ſpit in his Face, bowed the Knee before him in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: they ſet him at Nought, and laid moſt wicked Things to his Charge, ſuch as he knew not: and when they had condemned him, they led him away, obliging him to carry the very Wood upon which he was to be crucified: and when he came to the Place of his Crucifixion, they lifted him up upon the Croſs, they nailed his Hands and Feet; and put him to the moſt exquiſite Torments: and his <hi>Soul</hi> was filled with the Diſpleaſure of God, when he hid his Face from him; then he cried out in the greateſt Diſtreſs <note n="(p)" place="bottom">Mat. 27.46.</note> 
               <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Sufferings were ſo very mighty, that the human Nature was ready to ſhrink back at the Approach of them; and pray that the Cup of his Sufferings might be taken from him: yet with what Chearfulneſs did <hi>Chriſt</hi> meet them, and with what
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005119_0012_1016AA24ADCF2470"/>
wonderful Patience did he endure them! <note n="(q)" place="bottom">Iſaiah 53.7.</note> he was <hi>brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Shearer is Dumb, ſo he opened not his Mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He never murmured, nor complained under all his Sufferings; for they were what he was ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to fulfil: but would Chriſt have endured ſo many bitter Things from the Hands of Sinners; if their Salvation was what he was not much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about?</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, <hi>Chriſt's Patience</hi> with Sinners, and his <hi>repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Suits</hi> to them to accept of tendered Mercy, <hi>ſhow how much concerned Chriſt is for the Salvation of Sinners.</hi> It is aſtoniſhing Grace indeed that one Offer of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhould be made to a convicted and condemned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel: but how much more wonderful, that the Son of God ſhould lay aſide his dreadful Majeſty, and put on the Supplicant to beſeech Sinners to accept of eternal Life? Would he ever ſtand knocking at the Door of their Hearts, <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Rev. 3.20.</note> begging for Entrance, <note n="(s)" place="bottom">Cant. 5.2.</note> till <hi>his Locks were wet with the Dews of the Night,</hi> if his <hi>whole Heart</hi> was not in this Matter? Would he ever bear ſo many Repulſes from Sinners, and renew his moving Calls and Intreaties, if it was a Matter of Indifferency with him whether <hi>Iſrael be gathered?</hi> No verily, he would turn from them and leave them to periſh in their Unrighteouſneſs: he would ſay to them, let him that is <hi>filthy be filthy ſtill;</hi> but the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſeems to be willing to take no Denial from Sinners; he leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens out his Patience from Day to Day that he may have an Opportunity to be gracious to them.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly, That the <hi>Salvation of Sinners</hi> is a Matter of the <hi>utmoſt Concern</hi> with the <hi>Son of God</hi> is evident from his <hi>appointing ſuch a Variety of Means</hi> and his <hi>ſending forth his Miniſters to beſeech Men to be reconciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005119_0013_1016AA2633E2E9C8"/>There are all thoſe Means, and Helps provided for Sinners, which they can reaſonably expect or wiſh for, to recover them from Sin, and fit them for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. Our bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> has committed the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> which he hath brought from Heaven, to <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>; that we may daily ſtudy it, and be made wiſe to Salvation: The <hi>Sabbath</hi> is inſtituted to ſolemnize our Hearts, and recover our Affections from the World by the religious Worſhip of <hi>God.</hi> There is <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to put us in Mind of our Need of being <hi>ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt</hi> to cleanſe us from all our Filth, and ſpiritual Pollutions; and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is appointed to affect our Hearts with a Senſe of the Sufferings of the <hi>Son of God</hi> for us. The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel are ſent forth in <hi>Chriſt's Name</hi> to teach Men the Way of Life, and perſwade them to return to <hi>God</hi>; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> has promiſed his <hi>Preſence</hi> with them: and when he foreſaw that the beſt Means and moſt able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters could of themſelves do nothing without a divine Power, co-operating with them; he was pleaſed, at his <hi>Aſcention,</hi> to ſend down his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to guide, and aſſiſt his Miniſters; and work in the Hearts of Sinners 'till they are transformed into the glorious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>God.</hi> And now would Chriſt have appointed ſuch Means, would he ſend forth his Servants to urge Sinners to Salvation? Would he ſend forth his <hi>Spirit</hi> to ſupply his Preſence here, if the Salvation of Sinners was not much upon his Heart?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The powerful, and conſtant <hi>Interceſſion of</hi> the <hi>Son of God</hi> in <hi>Heaven ſhews how much he is engaged in his Work of redeeming Sinners.</hi> He who was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with wicked Hands and put to Death is riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, aſcended into Heaven, and ever lives to make Interceſſion for his People. <note n="(t)" place="bottom">Heb. 7.21.</note>

            <p>Should any now ask, whence it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt has the Salvation of Sinners ſo much upon his Heart?</hi>

            <p>It may be anſwered, it is not becauſe he ſtands in any Need of us, or would not have been happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Salvation.

            <p>But the Son of <hi>God</hi> had entred into Covenant with the <hi>Father,</hi> and became obliged to redeem a certain Number <note n="(w)" place="bottom">John 6.39.</note> whom the <hi>Father</hi> had <hi>given</hi> to him, for that End: he was made by Agreement <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Heb. 7.22.</note> a <hi>Surety</hi> for us: His Truth and Faithfulneſs were engaged for our Salvation, and whatever Difficulties were in the Way he muſt go thro' and not give back; leſt he become falſe, and unfaithful to the <hi>Father</hi>; but he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf: he will fulfil all his Compact with the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and nothing can fail on <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Part.</p>

Nothing was too much for him to do or ſuffer that he might glorify his Father.</p>
            <p>Nor was he only concerned for the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> but being <hi>Man,</hi> and partaking of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> with us; he had the moſt tender Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the Children of Men.

            <p>And our <hi>Lord himſelf</hi> had much depending upon the Succeſs of this great Work of Redemption.

            </p>
            <p>But I proceed now to the Conſideration of the <hi>ſecond general Propoſition,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould alſo have the <hi>Salvation of Sinners much upon their Hearts,</hi> and ſhould uſe <hi>all reaſonable Methods to compel</hi> Men into the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>Is <hi>Chriſt</hi> the great Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls ſo much concerned for the Salvation of Sinners? And ſhall not his Miniſters, according to their Meaſure, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate him in Zeal for the Glory of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Men? <hi>Chriſt</hi> has ſet his <hi>Miniſters</hi> an Example <note n="(b)" place="bottom">John 13.15.</note> and requires them to do as they have ſeen him do. He expects his Servants ſhould be fervent in Spirit in this great Truſt, which he commits to them. He does not allow them to be ſlothful in Buſineſs; but they muſt be Men of Life and Reſolution, concerned <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> to ſave themſelves, and them that hear them. They muſt ſpend their Time and Strength for this End that they may win Souls to <hi>Chriſt</hi>: They muſt uſe all their Talents and the Gifts conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that they may perſwade and compel Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of <hi>God.</hi> But under this Propoſition I deſign Firſt to ſhow <hi>how</hi> it is <hi>Miniſters</hi> are to <hi>compel Men into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Secondly, Give <hi>ſome Reaſons</hi> why they ſhould have the Salvation of Sinners ſo much upon their Hearts.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But here, we are carefully to obſerve that our <hi>Lord</hi> does not require his Miniſters to compel Men into his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in a Way, and Manner that he elſewhere condemns. We are not to ſuppoſe, our <hi>Lord</hi> would have his Miniſters uſe <hi>external Force,</hi> and Violence with Men: he gives them no Liberty to afflict and torment their Bodies, in order to make them his Diſciples. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will have free and voluntary Subjects; ſuch as ſubmit to him out of Choice, and not ſuch as are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into Subjection; whilſt they hate his Laws, and Government. There has been ſomething of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in all Ages of Chriſtianity, to uſe Power to make Men Chriſtians: So our <hi>Lord's</hi> Diſciples would have had him <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Luke 9.54, 55.</note> commanded <hi>Fire from Heaven</hi> to conſume ſuch as would not receive him; but he told them they knew not what <hi>Manner of Spirit they were of:</hi> that is, how contrary to the Nature of his Kingdom ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Means were; for he aimed to rule over the Minds and Conſciences of Men.

            <p n="1">1ſt, In <hi>teaching</hi> and <hi>inſtructing</hi> Men in a plain and <hi>forceable Manner</hi> in the great Truths of the Goſpel. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent forth his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and ſo he now ſends forth his Miniſters, to teach Men: they are naturally ignorant of <hi>God,</hi> and divine Things; and they ſtand in Need of being taught the firſt Rudiments of Chriſtianity. Miniſters are to teach Men who <hi>God</hi> is; how he is to be ſerved: what Duties we owe him; and where we are to look for Help to diſcharge them. They are to teach <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> to the World: And how Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is to be had by Faith in him: The Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be <note n="(h)" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3.2.</note> apt to teach; prepared and diſpoſed to inſtruct Men. And they ſhould endeavour to teach with ſuch Plainneſs and Demonſtration that it may force the Aſſent of the Underſtanding; and the Sinner be obliged to confeſs theſe are Things which cannot be ſpoken againſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Miniſters are to compel Men by <hi>ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> They ſhould compare one Thing with another; and ſhow the Fitneſs and Propriety of the ſeveral Parts of Religion, how they are all ſuited both to advance the <hi>Glory of God</hi> the Author, and the <hi>Happineſs of Man</hi> the Creature. It is not eno' that Miniſters fling out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moving and affecting Words at Random: but they muſt treat Men as <hi>rational</hi> Creatures; for ſo did <hi>God</hi> himſelf; and ſays <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Iſa. 1.18.</note>

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be Men of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> for they are to preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a moſt <hi>reaſonable Goſpel.</hi> And they ſhould <hi>reaſon</hi> ſo cloſely to the Conſciences of Men, that they may be wrought into a Compliance. If Miniſters lay aſide their Reaſon as uſeleſs; and treat Men as void of it, they can't expect their Hearers will have much of it; and if ſuch Miniſters make Men Chriſtians, they may be <hi>paſſionate</hi> ones; but they never will be very <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>ſtable</hi> in the <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, The Embaſſadors of Chriſt are to <hi>compel</hi> Men into the Kingdom of God by <hi>ſtirring up the Affections and Paſſions of the Mind.</hi> Theſe are termed the <hi>Feet of the Soul,</hi> and if they are dead and unmoved, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> be convinced the Man will not be in Earneſt for his own Salvation: When a ſuitable Degree of Knowlege is laid in the Underſtanding; and the Reaſon has been improved; then it is proper to rouze the Paſſions, that the whole Soul may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to avoid the approaching Vengeance of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, it is the Buſineſs of Miniſters to awaken Men's <hi>Fears</hi> by diſplaying the Miſery of their State, whilſt out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and under the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fiery Law. Men muſt have the Torments of the Damned ſet before them; and be informed, how dreadful, and inſupportable the Vengeance of that <hi>God</hi> is, who is a conſuming Fire: they muſt be put in Mind of the Worm of Conſcience, which will always accuſe and torment them with a Remembrance of their paſt Sins, <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Mark 9.44.</note> and of the Fire that never can be quenched; that Fear and Trembling may take hold on Sinners; and they may enquire in earneſt, what they ſhall do to be ſaved?</p>
            <p>And when they are thus awakened with a Senſe of their miſerable Eſtate; then their <hi>Hope</hi> of obtaining
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005119_0020_1016AA3B036E8E28"/>
Salvation muſt be encouraged: They will take no Pains to avoid Miſery, if they have no Hope of its being poſſible. We have no ſuch Example in the Word of <hi>God,</hi> of uſing all poſſible Meaſures of hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men on to <hi>deſpair</hi> without ſetting before them the <hi>great Encouragements</hi> they have to ſeek Salvation. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> told Sinners <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Luke 13.3.</note> that unleſs they repented they would periſh: but he alſo ſaid <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Mat. 11.28.</note> that if they would come to him he would give them Reſt for their Souls. So the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were mindful to inform the World, of an approaching Judgment and the Wrath of <hi>God</hi> to be poured out on an ungodly World; but at the ſame Time they encouraged Men to hope and ſeek for his Mercy. And deſignedly to avoid all the Encouragements of the Goſpel in our preaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Pretence they will lull Men aſleep, is what we cannot learn from the Word of <hi>God</hi>: Men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſeek; but will they ever do it if they have no Encouragement ſet before them.</p>
            <p>So alſo Miniſters muſt inſiſt upon the <hi>Lovelineſs</hi> and <hi>Deſirableneſs</hi> of divine Things; that the Love, and Deſire of the Soul may be drawn out towards them. It is the Buſineſs of the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to inform Sinners of the <hi>Lovelineſs</hi> of the <hi>Son of God</hi>; of than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Fulneſs</hi> there is in him: of the unſpeakable Joys and Glories of an heavenly World: that they may long and deſire to be united to the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and be entitled to the Bleſſedneſs of an heavenly State.</p>
            <p>The Art of moving the Paſſions conſiſts in theſe two Things. Firſt, A ſuitable Repreſentation of the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Law</hi> to awaken Sinners, and then Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A ſeaſonable exhibiting the <hi>Encouragements of the Goſpel</hi> to encourage Men to ſeek and ſtrive with the utmoſt Diligence. And he is a wiſe Scribe indeed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005119_0021_1016AA3C8B5D4188"/>
who can ſo time theſe, and blend them together; that on the one Hand the Sinner ſhall not be drove into Deſpair; nor on the other be encouraged, in his Sins, and ſtrengthened in his Iniquities.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Miniſters of the Goſpel are to <hi>compel</hi> Men into the Kingdom of <hi>God</hi> by convincing them that they are <hi>themſelves in Earneſt for their Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Salvation of Sinners is a Matter of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Importance, ſo Miniſters are to engage in it with the <hi>utmoſt Fervour</hi>; that Sinners may ſee it is not a Matter of Indifferency with them whether they are ſaved or not: If Miniſters are careleſs about the Souls of their People, they will be ſo themſelves; but if they are all Life, and appear to be willing to ſpend and be ſpent for them; then it is likely Sinners will ſtir up themſelves; and this is one Way of compelling Men; by treating the great Affair of their Salvation with the utmoſt Earneſtneſs: <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Rom. 9.1—4.</note> So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to compel the Jews to receive the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Laſtly here, The <hi>Servants of Chriſt</hi> are to <hi>compel</hi> Men into his Kingdom by a due Exerciſe of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt in his Church,</hi> and the moſt <hi>fervent Prayer to God for his Bleſſing</hi> upon all their Labours and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. Miniſters are to reprove and rebuke the Sinner that they may pluck him as a Brand out of the Burning. And the impenitent obſtinate Sinner muſt <note n="(p)" place="bottom">1 Cor. 5.5.</note> be <hi>delivered over to Satan to be buffetted, for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Fleſh; that his Soul may be ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, the Servants of Chriſt muſt remember that all their Teaching, Reaſoning, all their Warnings, Invitations, Reproofs and Cenſures will be ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, without the <hi>gracious Influences of the divine Spirit</hi>; and they muſt wreſtle with <hi>God in Prayer</hi> for the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005119_0022_1016AA3E6166A4D8"/>
out of his <hi>Spirit</hi> on their People to work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their Hearts, and bring them into Subjection to the Son of God: and here it is we can moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually compel Sinners to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>praying down the Holy Spirit of God into their Hearts,</hi> 
               <note n="(q)" place="bottom">John 16.8.</note> whoſe Work it is to <hi>convince</hi> them of <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come.</hi> In the <hi>Cloſet</hi> it is Miniſters may moſt powerfully compel Men into the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by pleading with <hi>God</hi> for a Bleſſing on their Labours.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to ſhow <hi>Secondly, Why</hi> it is that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ought to have the Salvation of Sinners ſo much upon their Hearts, and ſo earneſtly to perſwade Men into the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, This is the <hi>Command and Direction of God</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Iſai. 58.1.</note> that they ſhall cry aloud and ſpare not. They are ſet as <hi>Watchmen</hi> over <hi>God's</hi> People, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to warn them to repent of their Sins, they are <hi>Shepherds,</hi> and they muſt pluck the <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs</hi> out of the Mouth of the Lion and the Bear. <hi>God</hi> has very fully charged his Miniſters to lay themſelves out, and improve all their Talents this Way; that <hi>Iſrael may be gathered.</hi> And it is open Contempt of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority for them to neglect their great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſuffer Sinners to periſh: if we have any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the divine Authority and would not be found diſobedient to the great <hi>God,</hi> we muſt apply our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our Work with the greateſt Diligence and Reſolution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Servants of <hi>Chriſt</hi> have the <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> to excite them to the greateſt Diligence and Carefulneſs in their Miniſtry. Never was ſuch Induſtry, Laboriouſneſs, and Concern manifeſted in any Affair as <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſcovered in this
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005119_0023_1016AA4049C32928"/>
great Affair of Man's Redemption. He was careful to finiſh his Work, to glorify his Father and ſave mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Men. <note n="(s)" place="bottom">Luke 10.21.</note> He mourned and grieved when his Labours were not ſucceeded. And he rejoiced in Spirit when he had Succeſs. He denied himſelf all the Comforts of Life, that he might redeem Men from the Slavery of Sin and Satan. He could ſpend whole Nights weeping and praying over Sinners. And ſhall his Miniſters think of the Labour, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their <hi>Lord</hi> in his Work; Of his deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for Sinners; And yet be ſlothful in their Miniſtry, and unconcerned about thoſe immortal Souls that are committed to their Charge? Had we a Senſe of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Engagedneſs for the Salvation of Sinners, how would it quicken us to the greateſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>infinite Worth of the Souls of Sinners</hi> is a ſufficient Reaſon for Miniſters to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about them. One Soul is of more Worth than the whole World.<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Matth. 16.26.</note> The Souls of Sinners are immortal: and if they are not brought home to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they muſt be for ever miſerable beyond all Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is a vaſt Eternity before us, whither all Men are daily haſtning; and as there is a Heaven of Joy for pious and holy Souls; ſo there is a Hell of Miſery for all the Ungodly; and this ſhort Life is the only Opportunity Men have to ſecure the one, and eſcape the other: <note n="(u)" place="bottom">Eccl. 11.3.</note> As they are at Death ſo they will be to all Eternity: <note n="(v)" place="bottom">Rev. 22.11.</note> he that is filthy at Death will remain ſo. If Men die in their Sins they muſt periſh in them: There is no Hope for them; for God will take no more Pains with them, and make no more Offers to them. And when Miniſters think of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005119_0024_1016AA46E5C265A8"/>
this, that they have immortal Souls to ſave which are of more Value than Millions of Worlds, is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſpirit them to the utmoſt Pains that they may bring them into the Kingdom of God? Can they willingly ſuffer ſuch precious Things to be loſt? Will they not pray and weep over them Night and Day as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, that they may not finally periſh? We are unwilling a Houſe ſhould be conſumed with Fire, and can we be willing an immortal Soul ſhould burn in the Flames of God's Wrath?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When Miniſters conſider, that <hi>they muſt anſwer for all the Souls which periſh through their Neglect,</hi> is it poſſible they ſhould be indifferent whether Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſaved or not? The Souls of Men are ſome of thoſe precious Talents which are committed to Miniſters. And their Lord will demand them of them another Day: When he ſhall come to judge every Man, and give him according to his Works, then he will demand of his Miniſters, what are become of the Souls committed to their Charge. Then he will ask this and that Servant of his, where is this and that Soul which was committed to thy Charge. And what Plea can thoſe Servants make who have not been faithful to their Truſt? If Miniſters have not taught Men their Duty; if they have not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them againſt Sin; nor urged them to make ſure of eternal Life; <note n="(w)" place="bottom">Ezek. 3.18.</note> if they periſh, their Blood will be required of them. But how awful is this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Miniſters muſt give an Account of the Souls of their People? Is not this eno' to fill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters with the deepeſt Concern, that none may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh through their Neglect? Is not this enough to quicken Miniſters to teach with all Diligence, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort with Earneſtneſs, and pray without Ceaſing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:005119_0025_1016AA48A1490EA0"/>Laſtly, When we conſider the <hi>great and abundant Promiſes, Chriſt has made to all his faithful Miniſters,</hi> who are induſtrious to perſuade Souls into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we ſee what ſufficient Reaſon they have to be concerned to ſave Sinners. Every Soul, they are the happy Inſtruments of ſaving, will be an Addition to their Joy, and a bright Gem in their Crown. <note n="(x)" place="bottom">Dan. 12.3.</note> The more Souls are gathered to <hi>Chriſt</hi> under their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, the greater their Happineſs will be.</p>
            <p>Could we obtain an earthly Crown by liſting many Soldiers to ſome earthly King, would it not enliven us to compel Men into his Service? And ſhall we not be as much concerned to fill up the Kingdom of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſince he will beſtow on us not earthly Crowns, which ſhall fade away; but unfadea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crowns of Light and Glory? He who does moſt for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and immortal Souls will have a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reward in that heavenly World. And are not theſe Things enough to fill the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel with the greateſt Concern that they may fill up the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and Church of <hi>God</hi>? That Sinners may not be left to periſh in the High Ways and Hedges, whilſt there is room enough in the Kingdom of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The APPLICATION of the whole may be in the following Uſes.</p>
            <p>USE I. Of <hi>Information,</hi> and from what you have heard you may learn theſe following Things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Salvation of Sinners is a Matter of the <hi>greateſt Importance,</hi> and <hi>abſolutely neceſſary for them.</hi> The Son of God never would take ſuch vaſt Pains therefor, and be ſo much concerned about it, if it were a Trifle, and a Thing of Indifferency, whether they
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005119_0026_1016AA4E4E309568"/>
are ſaved or periſh. Would the Son of God ever have come down from Heaven, veiled his Glory in Fleſh? Would he voluntarily have ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Law and become obliged to obey it, who himſelf was the Author and Giver of it to Mankind? Would he ſo freely entered upon a Life of Labour, Pain and Sufferings amongſt Men? Would the eternal <hi>Son of God,</hi> who was the <hi>Brightneſs of his Father's Glory,</hi> ſo readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſubjected himſelf to the Curſes and Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Men, if he is not engaged in this great and important Work of our Salvation? It was attended with the greateſt Difficulties; and the moſt bitter Sufferings muſt be endured before ever it could be compleated; all which the <hi>Son of God</hi> had a full View of, when he undertook it: and who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that ſo great a Perſonage as the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſhould have his Mind from all Eternity upon this Work: That ſo wiſe Counſel ſhould be held about it; that ſuch vaſt Preparations ſhould be made for it; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould take ſuch infinite Pains to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, and ſuffer more than is poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of, if it were a Trifle and a Thing of no great Concern? No verily the <hi>Son of God</hi> would never have born Reproach: He never would have faſted and chaſtiſed his Soul; he never would have been grieved at the Hardneſs of Men's Hearts, nor would he have wept over ſecure Sinners, had he not ſeen their Salvation to be a Thing of the laſt Importance.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. From what you have heard, you may ſee what <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> we owe the <hi>Son of God:</hi> That he ſhould be ſo much concerned, and do ſo much for our Redemption. A Pity and Concern for others, and a Readineſs to help, and relieve, naturally commend Love and Eſteem in other Caſes; A poor Man loves the rich, when he ſees him condoling his Poverty,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005119_0027_1016AA4FD7FB8E90"/>
and ready to feed and clothe him: a ſick Man loves the Phyſitian, who has Compaſſion on him under his Pains and Diſeaſes, who is ready to adminiſter for his healing: So whatever our Calamities be, our Love and Eſteem is drawn out to ſuch as have Bowels of Compaſſion for us, be it ſo they only ſpeak comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Words to us; how much more when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us? But how much more is <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be loved by us, who is concerned for us in Things of infinite Moment? who has pitied our miſerable Souls under their ſpiritual Poverty, and dreadful Diſeaſes; Who has purchaſed at the deareſt Rate for us all we want to remedy our miſerable Circumſtances; Who offers us the Food of eternal Life, and Streams of living Water that we may never hunger and thirſt more; Who tenders the ſpotleſs Robes of his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to cover our Nakedneſs; who tenders Gold tried in the Fire that we may be rich, who will heal all our Plagues and Infirmities and raiſe us to the higheſt Dignities and Honours, even to be Kings and Prieſts to the Moſt High <hi>God</hi>; who is concerned for us that we ſhould not deſpiſe theſe Offers of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; earneſtly knocks at the Doors of our Hearts until his Locks are wet with the Dews of Night: And beſeeches us to hearken to him; that we don't periſh. Shall <hi>Chriſt</hi> do ſo much for us and we have no Pity for our ſelves, and no Love to him for it? This is brutiſh and moſt horrid Ingratitude indeed!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the <hi>Son of God</hi> is ſo much concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Salvation does it lie ſo much upon his Mind, then certainly we ought to be concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it our ſelves. Shall he faſt for us, and we live in the Gratifications of the Fleſh ourſelves? Shall he pray till his Soul is ſpent and melted within him, and we reſtrain Prayer before <hi>God</hi>? Shall he weep and mourn over us, and we have no Tears to ſhed for
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005119_0028_1016AA52992C9868"/>
our ſelves? Shall he agonize and ſweat great Drops of Blood for us, and we not wreſtle and ſtrive to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Enemies of our Souls? Can this be and yet we have any Senſe of our State and the dreadful Miſery haſtening upon us? Let us all be up, and about our Buſineſs, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſet us an Example: Let us all endeavour to awaken in our own Minds the moſt lively Concern for our eternal Well-Being by ſerious Meditation and fervent Prayer to <hi>God</hi> to realize ſpiritual Things to our Souls. Let us often reflect upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Labour, his Prayers and his Tears for us. Let us often wonder and admire that he ſhould have ſuch Concern for us; and we be no more concerned for our own precious immortal Souls, which muſt be happy or miſerable, according to the Proviſion we make for them in this ſhort Life to all Eternity. We can't be too much concerned for them; We can't do too much for their Well-Being, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while we have to live here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Has <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Salvation of Sinners ſo much upon his Mind, then you ſee what Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Sinners have to ſeek Salvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi>: He will aſſuredly <note n="(y)" place="bottom">Heb. 7.25.</note> ſave all that come to the <hi>Father</hi> in and by him, <note n="(z)" place="bottom">John 6.37.</note> nor will he caſt out any that come to him for Life. He ſtands with open Arms to receive repenting Sinners: He holds out a Scepter of Grace to them that they may come to God, with Boldneſs in this Way of Acceſs by the <hi>Blood of Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> will reject none; but aſſures us that all ſhall be welcome. Whoſoever will let <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rev. 22.17.</note> him come, is the Language of the <hi>Son of God</hi> to Sinners. <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot deny himſelf: he will fulfil all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſuch as depend upon him for Salvation. He is not only able to ſave Sinners, but he is willing to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005119_0029_1016AA54553BAB40"/>
undertake for them and reſcue them from the Jaws of Deſtruction: his Heart is ſet upon this Work, he needs no large Intreaties to grant Salvation to you: are you but willing to be ſaved by him and give divine Grace the Glory, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ready: There is not the leaſt Backwardneſs on his Part: his Delights are with the Children of Men: He has paid the Price of your Redemption: he has ſatisfied the Law, and appeaſed the incenſed Wrath of <hi>God,</hi> he has ſuffered the whole Penalty due for Sin: he has ſhed his Blood to cleanſe your Souls and waſh out the Stains of Sin: and is it poſſible after all this that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould deceive and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint you, and turn you off with Coldneſs when you come to him? No verily, Heaven and Earth may paſs away but not the leaſt Jot of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fail: If <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſo much engaged in this Work; Here is all the Encouragement you want. What can you ask for more? He is able to ſave you; he has all you want, and he is perfectly willing. Let none therefore ever excuſe themſelves in their Sloth and Negligence in ſeeking Salvation under any Pretence they have not Encouragement enough.

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If this is the Buſineſs of Miniſters to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Souls into the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> and if it is thus required of them to improve their utmoſt Endeavours to bring Souls to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then they may juſtly cry out with the <hi>Apoſtle, Who is ſufficient for theſe Things?</hi> Who is it knows, in all Reſpects, how to deal with immortal Souls in the momentous Affairs of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Who is that <hi>Scribe</hi> inſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, who can bring out of his Treaſure Things new and old, who can give to every one his Portion in their Seaſon? Who is it knows how and when to inſiſt upon the <hi>Terrors of the Law,</hi> and diſcover the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005119_0030_1016AA5841878E48"/>
terrible Wrath of God to the Sinner; and point out to him the Miſeries and Agonies of the damned: and then can ſo intermingle the <hi>Gentle Motives of the Goſpel</hi> as to excite the <hi>Hope of the Sinner.</hi> So that, on the one Hand, he may be ſuitably concerned to ſave his Soul, and on the other, may not be hurried on to deſpair of Mercy? How few can ſo ſpeak to Sinners as to awaken them, and ſo hold out the rich Invitations of Mercy, that the weary and Sin-burthen Sinner may accept of them? How much Need do Miniſters ſtand in of the Grace of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Aids of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in this great Work? They have no Strength nor Wiſdom of their own, they never would bring one Soul into the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did not the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> work with them and give Succeſs to their Labours. It is he ſubdues the People under himſelf and makes them willing in the Day of his Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If Miniſters are ſent forth to perſwade Men into the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then it is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a People to be inſtant in Prayer to God for them.</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>Pray for us,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that the <hi>Word of God may have free Courſe</hi>: If Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are never ſo faithful and laborious, if they ſpend and be ſpent for your Souls, it will avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your Salvation, if <hi>God</hi> work not within you both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure. The Converſion of your Souls is the Work of God. And can you expect he will ever make you the happy Subjects of it, if you pray not for it? Be found often therefore upon your Knees, wreſtling with God for your Miniſters, that <hi>God</hi> would make them Sons of Thunder to <hi>ſecure Sinners,</hi> and <hi>Sons of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to his <hi>own Children.</hi> Miniſters are commonly

ſuch as a People pray them to be; and their <hi>Succeſs</hi> is uſually in Proportion to their <hi>earneſt Prayers</hi> for their Miniſters. If you neglect to pray for them God has ſet over you, there is too much Reaſon to fear, they will only prove a Savour of Death unto Death to your Souls.</p>
            <p>USE II. of <hi>Awakening to Sinners.</hi> And is it ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has taken vaſt Pains for your Salvation? Is he ſtill waiting upon you and pleading with you, in his Word, and by his Miniſters? And are his Miniſters endeavouring to perſwade and compel you into the Kingdom of Chriſt? Then think upon theſe Things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How <hi>inexcuſeable</hi> you will be found in the <hi>great Day of Accounts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will have no Plea to make for your ſelves, your own Mouths will condemn you, your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences will teſtify what Pains have been taken with you: how earneſtly the <hi>Son of God</hi> has intreated you: How his Miniſters have urged you. Then <hi>Chriſt</hi> will tell you how you ſtopped your Ears againſt his Calls, and mocked at all his Reproofs: Then <hi>Chriſt</hi> will put you in Mind of all the precious Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities you have had and how much you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed them: Then he will tell you how he laid hold on you by his Miniſters, and the Convictions of his <hi>Spirit</hi> and would have plucked you out of the Fire of Sin and Hell; but you offered Violence to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and deſpite to the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his Grace, &amp; chooſe rather to periſh in your Sins, than accept of Life by him: And what can the Sinner ſay when his Judge thus convicts him? What Shame and Confuſion will cover the Face of every Sinner in that Day? Their own Hearts will condemn them and their <hi>Judge</hi> is greater than they. It is impoſſible to expreſs the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005119_0032_1016AA5DC5B3F218"/>
Horror and the Confuſion that Sinners who periſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Light of the Goſpel will be in at that Day: They would gladly have the Mountains and Rocks fall on them to cover them from the Face of their <hi>Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let the Sinner ſeriouſly think, what an <hi>inſupportable Puniſhment</hi> he is bringing upon himſelf by refuſing to enter into the Kingdom of <hi>God</hi>: all the Pains and Intreaties that are uſed with Sinners to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them into the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> ſerve to increaſe and aggravate their everlaſting Condemnation and Torment. If all the Pains which are taken with you prove ineffectual for your Salvation, it is likely they will greatly inhance your Miſery. Every ſlighted Call, and every abuſed Invitation will lay a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the more ſevere Reflections of Conſcience. How inſupportable will your Puniſhment be if you ſtand out againſt all the Earneſtneſs of the <hi>Son of God?</hi> It will be more tolerable for the Sinners of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> than for you. Yea, it will be more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thoſe impious <hi>Jews,</hi> who with wicked Hands took our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour and put him to Death,</hi> than for you; <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Acts <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, To you my <hi>dear Brother.</hi> You ſee what the Work and Buſineſs, which is before you is. It is to bring Men into the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi>: You are to go forth and compel Men into the Kingdom of your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended <hi>Lord and Saviour</hi>: You are to fill up his <hi>Houſe and Church</hi>: you are to uſe all the Gifts <hi>God</hi> has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you for this End: you muſt lay yourſelf out for this Work; and be willing to ſpend and be ſpent, that you may perſwade Souls to <hi>Chriſt</hi>: It is the moſt honourable Employment in the World, vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more than to be Embaſſadors for the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on Earth. And it is a great and difficult Work: Too great for even the Angels to undertake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but here is your Comfort; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is engaged in this Work as well as you: And he has it more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Heart, than you can have upon your's. He has <hi>promiſed you his Preſence,</hi> if you give up yourſelf to his Service. And you may always remember the more you do for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>immortal Souls</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will be in <hi>Heaven.</hi>

To reprove you with Zeal, and warn you with Earneſtneſs, you muſt allow him to obſerve your State, and warn you againſt your beloved Sins that you may be plucked as Brands out of the Burning: You muſt allow him to watch over you, and be jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of you; That he may ſuit himſelf to your State,
