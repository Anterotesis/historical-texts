            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE Arguments for ſending Biſhops of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to America, are ſo ſtrong and convincing, that an Appeal may be made to the World for the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of ſending them. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Plan which has been long ſettled for the Regulation of their Authority when ſent, is ſo well calculated to ſecure the religious Privileges of every
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:010578_0004_0F86F07A8A858310"/>
Denomination of Chriſtians, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a proper Explanation can be needful, to recommend it to the Approbation of every candid and unprejudiced Perſon. For Want of this, many are ſtill averſe to an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate, and ſome are induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly employed in miſrepreſenting the Matter, and in propagating their Prejudices and Objections againſt it. It is therefore the general Opinion here, that it is at length become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to explain this Plan, and thereby, as the moſt effectual Method, to remove theſe Prejudices and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>Such, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is the Deſign of the following <hi>Appeal.</hi> The Author of it was not forward to undertake the Work. Want of Leiſure, and a Conſciouſneſs of Inability to execute it properly, were Difficulties in his Way not eaſy to be ſurmounted. But as no one appeared that was willing to
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:010578_0004_0F86F07A8A858310"/>
perform what all ſeemed to allow was neceſſary to be done, and as he was requeſted by many of his Brethren to undertake it, he finally conſented.</p>
            <p>Without this Apology, the Author would not preſume to inſcribe to <hi>Your Grace</hi> ſo imperfect a Piece, or to aſk for it your Patronage. Nor indeed would any Apology juſtify him in doing ſo, did he not know that <hi>Your Grace</hi> takes a Pleaſure in encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging every <hi>well-meant</hi> Endeavour, however unſucceſsful it may prove, to ſerve the Cauſe of Religion and the Church of Chriſt—of which amiable Diſpoſition your whole Life has been a Proof.</p>
            <p>As to the Church of England in <hi>America,</hi> it will ever be acknowledged with all Thankfulneſs, that none has ſhewn for it a more affectionate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, or treated the Members of it or its Clergy with more Kindneſs and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010578_0005_0F86F07B4CB5B538"/>
Condeſcenſion than <hi>Your Grace.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them You have honoured with a private Correſpondence; and but few have gone Home from this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for Holy Orders for a long Courſe of Years, who have not been able on their Return, to tell of the great Obligations You have conferred upon them. And this was the Caſe long before your Advancement to that high Station, whereby You became related to all of them as their Metropolitan, and to many of them alſo as Preſident of <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel in foreign Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides theſe particular Kindneſſes ſhewn to the Clergy, the general State and Intereſt of the American Church, has always been the Object of your cloſe, and careful, and anxious Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. None has ever entered ſo deeply into the Knowledge of her Condition, or had ſo true a Senſe of her Wants, or repreſented them to the Public in
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010578_0005_0F86F07B4CB5B538"/>
ſo proper and ſtriking a Light, as <hi>Your Grace</hi> did many Years ago, in your moſt excellent <hi>anniverſary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> preached before <hi>the Society.</hi> Therein particularly You explained the Need and Uſefulneſs of an American Epiſcopate; and what You then ſaid and publiſhed on the Subject, together with what You have continued to ſpeak and write ever ſince, on all proper Occaſions, has probably contributed more to prepare the Way for it, ſo far as it has been prepared, than what has been ſaid, and written, and done, by any other Perſon. For theſe Things, as well as on other Accounts, the Clergy and Friends of the Church in America revere You, with Sentiments of the ſincereſt Gratitude. They look up to <hi>Your Grace</hi> as eminently their Friend and Patron; and they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſpair of the Succeſs of their late Application, while ſo reaſonable a Cauſe is ſupported by your Abilities and Influence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010578_0006_0F86F07C0E81E1E8"/>At the ſame Time they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the Obligations they are under to many other illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and eſpecially to ſome great Prelates of the Church, who have been pleaſed to become their Advocates on this Occaſion: And it is not doubted but they will continue to aſſiſt and co-operate with <hi>Your Grace</hi> in this good Work, of reſcuing the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Church from the Diſtreſs ſhe is under, through the Want of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate. Every Attempt to relieve her, <hi>My Lord,</hi> is really an Act of Charity; and it may properly be ſaid that "the Bleſſing of <hi>her</hi> that is ready to periſh," will come upon thoſe that befriend her in this Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>As the following Papers were drawn up with a View of ſerving the Cauſe, which you have always had ſo greatly at Heart, and been foremoſt in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>in that Reſpect</hi> they can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to none ſo properly as to <hi>Your
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010578_0006_0F86F07C0E81E1E8"/>
Grace.</hi> But in many Reſpects the Offering is unworthy of your Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and yet—ſince it is made with an Intention of publickly expreſſing, not only that Reverence which is due to your exalted Station in the Church, but that Gratitude to which You are entitled, by the many ſignal Proofs You have given of your Attention, to the general Intereſt of Religion, and eſpecially of the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland in America, and your Concern for it, and aſſiduous Exertions in its Behalf; it is humbly hoped that it will not be rejected.</p>
            <p>If it may be received alſo as a Teſtimony of Gratitude, for particular Favours which <hi>Your Grace</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to beſtow on the Author, it will add greatly to his Happineſs.</p>
            <p>That GOD may long continue your Life and Health, ſo uſeful to the Public, and of ſuch peculiar Importance to

            <head>Advertiſement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following <hi>Appeal,</hi> has ſaid, by Way of Apology, that
<q>he was requeſted by many of his Brethren to undertake it.</q>
He thinks it not amiſs to declare more particularly, with the ſame View, that the Taſk was firſt impoſed upon him by the very worthy and Reverend Dr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> of <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in <hi>Connecticut.</hi> From that venerable Perſon a Work of this Nature would have come, with more Propriety, and greater Advantage to the Cauſe. For <hi>an Appeal to the Public in Behalf of the Church of England in America,</hi> on the preſent Occaſion, could be made by none ſo properly, or with ſo good Effect, as by him, who has ſo frequently ſignalized himſelf as its Advocate, for the Courſe of more than Forty Years, and who, for a conſiderable Part of that Time, has been anxiouſly ſolliciting the Cauſe of an American Epiſcopate. But a Tremor in the Hand, which cauſes him to write with the utmoſt Difficulty himſelf, made it neceſſary that he ſhould leave the Work for another. He thought proper to apply to the Author, whoſe Obligations to him were ſuch, that he could not refuſe him any Thing in his Power, without incuring the Imputation of Ingratitude and Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>At the Time when this Treaty was nearly concluded, the Clergy of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> being met together in a <hi>voluntary Convention,</hi> and aſſiſted by ſome of their Brethren from the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, took into Conſideration the Propriety and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of addreſſing the Public, on the Subject of an American Epiſcopate. After a thorough Diſcuſſion of the Point, they were unanimouſly of Opinion, that fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to explain the Plan on which American Biſhops had
<pb n="x"
                   facs="unknown:010578_0008_0F86F07EB1052220"

been requeſted, to lay before the Public the Reaſons of this Requeſt, to anſwer the Objections that had been made, and to obviate thoſe that might be otherwiſe conceived againſt it, was not only proper and expedient, but a Matter of Neceſſity and Duty. It was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly voted that Something to this Purpoſe ſhould be publiſhed, and the Author was appointed to this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—with Liberty, however, to make the Time of his performing it moſt convenient to himſelf. Excuſes were not admitted, and a Refuſal could not be juſtified.</p>
            <p>The Author, being brought thus under double En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, determined to acquit himſelf as well as his Circumſtances and Abilities would permit. In Order to this, he was careful to follow the Directions he had received, and, as he had Opportunity, to conſult the moſt judicious of his Friends, in Regard to the Method and Management of the Work. How he has ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, muſt be ſubmitted to the Judgment of the Reader, whoſe Candour is requeſted.</p>
            <p>It gives the Author great Pleaſure, to find that his Sentiments have been ſo clearly and forcibly expreſſed, by <hi>The Right Reverend the Lord Biſhop of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff,</hi> in his excellent anniverſary Sermon preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Society</hi> in <hi>February</hi> laſt. The Thanks of every Friend of the American Church are due to <hi>His Lordſhip,</hi> for ſo ſeaſonable and ſpirited an Aſſertion and Vindication of its Rights; from which it is not doubted but the following Extract will be acceptable to the Reader, although for Want of Room it muſt of Neceſſity be ſhort.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>The want of Biſhops (in America) hath been all along the more heavily lamented, becauſe it is a caſe ſo ſingular, that it cannot be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled in the Chriſtian world. For what ſect was ever any where at all allowed, that was not
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:010578_0008_0F86F07EB1052220"/>
allowed the means within themſelves of providing for the continual exerciſe of their worſhip? the granting one without the other would be but a mockery, Yet ſuch is the ſtate of our church in the colonies; and at a time, and in a realm, where the rights of conſcience are beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and moſt fully allowed and protected. All ſects of Proteſtant Chriſtians at home, and all, ſave one, throughout our colonies, have the full enjoyment of their religion. Even the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſuperſtition, within a province lately added to the Britiſh dominions, is completely allowed in all points; it hath Biſhops.—Thus ſtands the caſe of all churches in our colonies, except only the church here by law eſtabliſhed; that alone is not tolerated in the whole, it exiſts only in part, in a maimed ſtate, lopt of Epiſcopacy, an eſſential part of its conſtitution. And whence this diſgraceful diſtinction? whence this mark of diſtruſt? what is the fear? what the danger? A few perſons veſted with authority to ordain miniſters, to confirm youth, and to viſit their own clergy. Can two or three perſons, reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe ſpiritual functions, be dangerous to any in any matter? in what? or to whom? Can they poſſibly, ſo limited, on any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, attempt to moleſt any in their religious concerns? Can they invade the rights and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of magiſtrates? Can they infringe the liberties of the people? Can they weaken, or be thought diſpoſed to weaken, the fidelity of the colonies to his Majeſty, or their dependence on this country? To theſe duties, if there be any difference, the members of this church, as ſuch are bound by one ſpecial motive, beſides the many motives common to them with other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT Application has been lately made to our Superiors, by the Clergy of ſeveral of the Colonies, requeſting one or more <hi>Biſhops</hi> to be ſent to <hi>America,</hi> is a Matter now generally known, and was never intended to be kept as a Secret. As there is great Reaſon to hope, both from a Review of the Arguments that were offered in the Support of Addreſſes that were tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Occaſion, and from the favourable Diſpoſition of many in Authority, that this Requeſt in due Time will be granted; it has been thought
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:010578_0010_0F86F080B0A56E20"/>
proper, in a public Manner, to inform all who may imagine themſelves to be any Ways concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Event of our Application, <hi>candidly</hi> and <hi>explicitly,</hi> for what Reaſons, and with what Views, an <hi>American Epiſcopate</hi> is ſo earneſtly deſired by the Clergy, and the other Friends and Members of the Church.</p>
               <p>Some Perſons are ſaid to have been alarmed by this Conduct of the Clergy; but when the Caſe ſhall be duly explained and underſtood, it is not apprehended that any Uneaſineſs will remain, or that any Oppoſition can be formed againſt the Execution of a Plan, ſo reaſonable in itſelf, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Church here, and ſo univerſally harmleſs to others of every Denomination. As no Invaſion of the civil or religious Privileges of any, whether Churchmen or Diſſenters, is thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, it is hoped that every Objection, or even Doubt or Suſpicion of that Nature, will, by this Method, be intirely obviated. But ſhould any Objections continue which ſhall be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Notice, the Objectors are invited to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them in ſuch a Manner, that they may be fairly and candidly debated, before the Tribunal of the Publick; and if none ſhall be offered, it will be taken for granted that all Parties acquieſce and are ſatisfied.</p>

               <head>SECTION I. A Sketch of the Arguments in Favour of Epiſcopacy.</head>
               <p>IN Order to judge properly of the Subject before us, it is neceſſary to premiſe,<note place="margin">SECT. I.</note> and it ſhould be well conſidered, that the Church of England is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal,</hi> and conſequently holds the Neceſſity of Biſhops to govern the Church, and to confer Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Powers upon others. Of this there can be no Diſpute, ſince many of her public Offices, and indeed the whole Syſtem of her Conduct with Regard to the Clergy is founded on this Principle.</p>
               <p>In the general Preface to the Ordination Offices ſhe declares, that
<q>it is evident to all Men dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently reading the Holy Scriptures and ancient Authors, that from the Apoſtles Time there has been this Order in Chriſt's Church, Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, as ſeveral Offices.</q>
And her Practice of admiting none to officiate as Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have not been ordained by Biſhops, is a Proof, that ſhe eſteems every other Ordination to be, at leaſt, irregular and defective. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enter upon a particular Defence of this Doctrine, in an Undertaking of this Nature; ſince our preſent Plea is equally valid, whether theſe Principles are founded rightly or wrongly. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a <hi>brief Sketch</hi> of the Arguments, whereby the Neceſſity of Epiſcopal Government is defended, may, on this Occaſion, be not altogether uſeleſs or improper.</p>
               <p>It is an eſſential Doctrine of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that none can have any Authority in the
<pb n="4"
                      facs="unknown:010578_0011_0F86F08207C54200"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſtian Church, but thoſe who derive it from Chriſt, either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately.</hi> Thoſe who receive Authority <hi>immediately</hi> from Chriſt, before they can expect Submiſſion to it from others, muſt be able to prove that they have it; for which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs can ſuffice, at this Day, than the Power of working Miracles. Thoſe who receive it <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi> muſt derive it from thoſe Perſons whom Chriſt has authorized to convey it, <hi>i. e.</hi> they muſt receive it by a regular Succeſſion. For any to ſay, that ſuch a Succeſſion cannot be proved, is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: it is incumbent on the Objectors to prove that the Succeſſion, by which we hold, has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. Proof of this, although zealouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, has never yet been made; and could this Point once be made clear, it would alſo prove far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Chriſt has neglected to provide for his Church, in a Caſe ſo eſſential to the very Being of it, notwithſtanding his having expreſsly promiſed to be "ever with it, to the End of the World."</p>
               <p>Men may ridicule the Notion of <hi>uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> as they pleaſe; but if the Authority of the Clergy is derived from Chriſt, (and if it is not, they are no Miniſters of Chriſt) they muſt receive it in one of the Ways already mentioned. And if the Succeſſion be <hi>once</hi> broken, and the Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>once</hi> loſt, not all the Men on Earth—not all the Angels in Heaven, without an immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt, can reſtore it. It is as great an Abſurdity, on <hi>St. Paul's</hi> Principles, for a Man to preach without being properly <hi>ſent,</hi> as it is to hear without a Preacher, or to believe in him of whom we have never heard.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt is the great Founder of the Church, ſo he is the only Fountain of Eccleſiaſtical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Whatever general Laws he was pleaſed to
<pb n="5"
                      facs="unknown:010578_0011_0F86F08207C54200"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
injoin, muſt be of indiſpenſible Obligation to all his Followers. Indeed, with Regard to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church, his Laws are expreſſed in ſuch general Terms, that we muſt neceſſarily have Recourſe to thoſe, whom he immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Government of his Church, for a more particular Explanation of them.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtles,
<q>to whom he ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion, being ſeen of them Forty Days, and ſpeaking of the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God,</q> underſtood the Laws of Chriſt, is not to be doubted: and, as they were alſo conducted by the Spirit of God, the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and particular Rules which <hi>they</hi> have given for the Government of the Church, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived—either as authentic Explanations of Chriſt's general Laws, or as Regulations that are agreeable and conformable to them. To this muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the public <hi>Practice</hi> of the Apoſtles is a faithful and plain Comment on the Laws of Chriſt, unleſs we can ſuppoſe them to have been unacquainted with, or diſobedient to, his divine Will; and it is of equal Authority with any written Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Now if we carefully examine the Writings of the Apoſtles, and the <hi>Canonical</hi> Records of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, I muſt think that theſe Things will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear,—that our bleſſed Saviour, before his Aſcenſion, committed the Government of his Church upon Earth, intirely to <hi>them</hi>—that this Government was <hi>exerciſed</hi> by them—that they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed</hi> this Power to others, to be communicated ſucceſſively to others, to the lateſt Poſterity—par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that theſe their Succeſſors were an Order diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, thoſe who are now called Preſbyters—and that none who were not of

this higheſt Order, had the Powers of Ordination and Government committed to them. It would lead me too far from my preſent Deſign, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh theſe Points by particular Proof; nor can it be neceſſary, as ſeveral of the Facts that ſupport them, have been brought to a cloſe Examination, and fairly ſtated to the Public, in the Inſtances of <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem, Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus, Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> the Angels of the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>Let us now conſider what Evidence ariſes to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour theſe Concluſions, from the general State of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> The Travels of ſome of the Apoſtles are related in Scripture, and from thence, as well as from other Proofs, it appears, that with amazing Succeſs they planted and ſettled Churches in all the moſt conſiderable Countries of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> within the Compaſs of not many Years. And it is a Fact well known, that all the Churches that were gathered during the <hi>Firſt Century,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately by the Apoſtles, or their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, were under the Direction of ſome or other of that venerable Order. Men of the moſt eminent and undoubted Piety, who had been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with their intimate Acquaintance, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles to ſuperintend Churches in certain limited Diſtricts, ſome of whom were choſen to ſucceed them in thoſe Churches which they had always kept under their own more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſpection. So that during this Period, while the Chriſtian Church was governed by the Apoſtles, and others of their Appointment, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in our Opinion, but groſs Prejudice, or a
<pb n="7"
                      facs="unknown:010578_0012_0F86F082122E9638"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
wrangling and captious Diſpoſition, to ſay no worſe, can lead any to ſuſpect or aſſert, that it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially corrupted, or that it had departed, in any conſiderable Degree, from that Plan of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt had inſtituted. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is as much a poſitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Chriſtian Sacraments, and the Laws relating to it bind us as ſtrongly, as the Laws which oblige us to receive Baptiſm or the Holy Euchariſt. As ſuch they were conſidered in the Period we are treating of; and any Attempt to change them would have been treated with the ſame Indignation and Reſentment by the Chriſtians of that Age, as if the Laws relating to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been wilfully violated.</p>
               <p>And if we conſider the general Character of Chriſtians, and the State of the Church, in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Centuries,</hi> we ſhall find it not eaſy to believe, that there could have been any eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Variation or Departure, from the original Plan of Diſcipline and Government committed to the Church. Chriſtianity ſtill continued to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Engines of worldly Power and Policy, and had nothing to ſupport it, but its own rational Evidence, accompanied with the Power and Spirit of God, and the Expectation of Happineſs in an inviſible State. But very few worldly Proſpects and Motives could operate either on the Clergy or private Chriſtians, when they all knew that their Religion tended to deprive them of all worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and would probably cauſe them to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, and inſulted, and perſecuted, even to Death. Their only Dependance was on their aſcended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, for whoſe Sake, and in Obedience to whom, they ſacrificed all the Eaſe and Happineſs and Glory of the World, eſteeming them but as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010578_0013_0F86F082CB7A27F8"/>
Droſs and Dung in Competition with their Duty: In this State, and with this Diſpoſition, every Law of Chriſt was valued more than Life, every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Uſage and Practice of the Church was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as ſacred, by Chriſtians in general.</p>
               <p>And as we are obliged to believe, that but few could have been deſirous of making Innovations, ſo it is utterly incredible that many would have been willing to ſubmit to them, in Matters of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. How firmly the Chriſtians of thoſe Days were attached to, and how conſcientiouſly they followed, whatever they eſteemed to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt or his Apoſtles, the <hi>Quarto-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciman</hi> Controverſy, or the Diſpute which divided the Church about the proper Time for the keeping of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> among others, is a noted Proof. And although in this Point one Party muſt have been miſtaken, yet it is manifeſtly a Matter of no great Conſequence, and the Church at that Time was <hi>divided</hi> in their Judgment: and, it by no Means follows from this Inſtance, that the Church might alſo have been miſtaken in Matters of the greateſt Weight, ſuch as thoſe of Faith and Government, eſpecially when all were <hi>united</hi> in Opinion.</p>
               <p>And as the Practice of the primitive Church was a faithful Comment on the Laws of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, relating to the Government of the Church; ſo it is not ſo difficult a Matter, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what that Practice was, as ſome may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, The Works of the Apoſtolical Fathers <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The Authenticity of ſome of theſe has been warmly diſputed, eſpecially of the Epiſtles of <hi>St. Ignatius</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> has, within a few Years, in an Appendix to his <hi>Dudleian Lecture,</hi> endeavoured moſt zealouſly to invalidate their Teſtimony. But the Doctor undoubtedly knows that he has been able to offer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>new</hi> on ſo exhauſted a Subject; and others know, that he has ſaid Nothing againſt the Authenticity of theſe Epiſtles, but what has, long ago, been fairly and fully confuted</p>
                     <p>Although the Advocates for Epiſcopacy ſee no Neceſſity for giving up the Teſtimony of <hi>St. Ignatius,</hi> it is not from an Opinion that their Cauſe would labour under any great Diſtreſs, without that Support. It has a much ſurer Foundation to reſt upon, and they are willing to have it tried on the Footing of pure Scripture Evidence, as well as that of publick and notorious Facts.</p>
                     <p>Hard is the Fate of ancient Writers! For if they do not luckily countenance modern Opinions, either their Credit will be directly attacked, or their Arguments ridiculed or ſophiſtically evaded; and if nothing leſs will ſerve the Authenticity of their Writings, and perhaps that ſuch Perſons ever exiſted, will be diſputed. And when an obſtinate Oppoſition is once undertaken, whether from Intereſt, or Spleen and Malignity, no ancient Authors are ſo ſecure, not even ſome of thoſe of the Holy Bible, but that ſuch Adventurers may be able to do ſome Injury to their Reputation and Authority. This Remark accounts for much of the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>St. Ignatius</hi> met with in the laſt Century: Prejudice and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Attachment to particular Syſtems may probably account for the Remainder.</p>
                     <p>Father <hi>Hardouin,</hi> whoſe general literary Character was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, is a remarkable Inſtance to what Lengths Prejudice, or rather an incomprehenſibly whimſical Humour, may carry a Man, in Caſes of this Nature. In a large Work of his, printed in <hi>Paris</hi> 1693,
<q>He undertakes to prove from Medals, that the greater Part of thoſe Authors, which have paſſed upon the Moderns for ancient, were forged by ſome Monks of the xiiith Century, who gave to them the ſeveral Names of Homer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Plato, Ariſtotle, Plutarch, &amp;c. Tertullian, Origen, Baſil, Auguſtine, &amp;c. He only excepts out of this monkiſh Manufacture, the Works of Cicero, Pliny's Natural Hiſtory, Virgil's Georgicks, and Horace's Satyrs and Epiſtles. Theſe he ſuppoſes the only genuine Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Antiquity remaining, except ſome few Inſcriptions and Faſte; and with the Aſſiſtance of theſe, he thinks that theſe Monks drew up and faſhioned all the other ancient Writings, as Terence Plays, Livy's and Tacitus's Hiſtory, Virgil's Aeneid, Horace's Odes, &amp;c nay he puſhed this Chimera ſo far, that he fancied he could ſee plainly enough, that Aeneas in Virgil was deſigned for Jeſus Chriſt, and Horace's Miſtreſs Lalage for the Chriſtian Religion.</q>

Now theſe all agree in their Account of the general Practice and Government of the Church, and the Evidence ariſing from the Whole, appears to us to be of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Force in Favour of Epiſcopacy; and in the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> one of the beſt Reaſoners the Engliſh Nation ever produced, it amounts even to a <hi>Demonſtration.</hi> It greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thoſe who can reſiſt this Evidence, to be very careful that the ſame Arguments whereby they endeavour to overthrow the Weight of it, do not alſo operate with equal Force againſt the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the Canonical Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>It is generally allowed by the Rejecters of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, that Epiſcopal Government obtained very early in the Church. Dr. <hi>Doddridge</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">In his Lectures, &amp;c. Page <hi>498.</hi>

<q>the Diſtinction between Biſhops and Preſbyters has been as ancient as the Time of St. <hi>Ignatius:</hi>
                  </q> i. e. the Beginning of the Second Century, and within Seven or Eight Years after the Death of the laſt of the Apoſtles.

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010578_0014_0F86F08563B9D408"/>
throughout the Church within a very few Years of the Apoſtles Death. Thoſe Powers which were now given to a new Order of Officers, muſt have been quietly abdicated by their former Poſſeſſors, and the whole Chriſtian Church muſt have been perſuaded to give up a Form of Government, which had been conſecrated by the Practice and Authority of the Apoſtles, and then to ſubmit to a new Form, which they had never experienced or heard of. Surely ſo great and ſtrange a Work could never have been accompliſhed in ſo ſhort a Time, without the Aſſiſtance of ſupernatural Power; and the Enemies of Epiſcopacy muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that a very extraordinary Miracle muſt, on this Suppoſition, have been wrought in Favour of it.</p>
               <p>If the Experiment ſhould be made at this Day, what Addreſs would it require, what a tedious Proceſs would be found neceſſary, to proſelyte even a ſingle national Church, that of <hi>Scotland</hi> for Inſtance, which holds Epiſcopacy to have been an Innovation in the Chriſtian Church, to a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Submiſſion to it? And yet no modern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians can pretend a greater Veneration and Zeal for apoſtolical Inſtitutions, than the primitive Chriſtians were undoubtedly poſſeſſed of. What long Struggles and violent Convulſions have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been ſuffered, before any Republican Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been brought to acquieſce in a Change to Monarchy? And yet Men have commonly been found as ready to give up the eſtabliſhed Forms of Civil Government as thoſe of Religion.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing ſuch a Change to have happened, can any tolerable Reaſon be aſſigned, why no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, no Intimations of it are to be found in Hiſtory? Can it be imagined, that while many trifling Occurrences in compariſon, ſuch as the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010578_0015_0F86F0869B618968"/>
Death of one Biſhop, and the Succeſſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Birth of a third, in every Age of the Church have been carefully related, that not the leaſt Notice ſhould have been taken, either by Friends or Enemies, Pagans or Chriſtians, of ſuch a capital Revolution? Or, are we able, from this univerſal Silence of Hiſtory, to form any other Concluſion, than that the Event in Queſtion has never happened?</p>
               <p>Let us hear on this Subject a very celebrated Writer <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Chillingworth <hi>in his</hi> Demonſtration of Epiſcopacy.</note>.
<q>When I ſhall ſee therefore all the Fables in the <hi>Metamorphoſis</hi> acted, and prove true Stories; when I ſhall ſee all the Democracies and Ariſtocraſies in the World lie down and ſleep, and awake into Monarchies; then will I begin to believe that Preſbyterial Government, having continued in the Church, during the Apoſtles Times, ſhould preſently after (againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine and the Will of Chriſt) be whirled about like a Scene in a Maſque, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into Epiſcopacy. In the mean Time while theſe Things remain thus incredible, and, in human Reaſon, impoſſible, I hope I ſhall have Leave to conclude thus:</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Epiſcopal Government is acknowledged to have been univerſally received in the Church, preſently after the Apoſtles Times:</p>
                  <p>Between the Apoſtles Times and this <hi>preſently after,</hi> there was not Time enough for, nor Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of, ſo great an Alteration:</p>
                  <p>And therefore there was no ſuch Alteration as is pretended; and therefore Epiſcopacy being confeſſed to be ſo ancient and Catholic, muſt be granted alſo to be Apoſtolic.</p>

               <head>SECTION II. The Powers peculiar to the Epiſcopal Office ſhewn to be thoſe of <hi>Government, Ordination</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Epiſcopal Order appearing thus to be diſtinct from,<note place="margin">SECT. II.</note> and ſuperior to that of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, it is proper now to enquire, wherein that Diſtinction and Superiority conſiſts. In Order to this, we muſt carefully ſeparate the ſeveral Things that have been added as <hi>Appendages</hi> to the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Office, from thoſe which originally and eſſentially belong to it. In Chriſtian Countries, the Alliance between the Church and State has obtained for the former many Perquiſites and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of an external Nature, which may be reduced to the three Heads of, legal Exemption, temporal Poſſeſſions, and civil Power. Theſe have generally varied in different Countries and Ages; and although they have influenced the external Form and Appearance of the Church, yet they have not altered its real Nature, which is always and eſſentially the ſame under all outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whether protected, neglected or perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, by the Powers of the World.</p>
               <p>Thus the Woman, in the Viſions of St. <hi>John</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xii.</note>, was the very ſame, after
<q>ſhe fled into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</q> and was purſued by the Dragon, as when ſhe
<q>was clothed with the Sun, had a Crown of Twelve Stars on her Head, and the Moon under her Feet,</q>
notwithſtanding that her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010578_0016_0F86F087516648E0"/>
Circumſtances and Figure were widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. Every one knows that the Office of a Clergyman is the ſame, whether he is poſſeſſed of a Fortune, or is without one—whether he has a large Pariſh, or a ſmall one. And if theſe things make no Alteration in the Office of a Preſbyter, it will be hard to ſhew why they ſhould alter the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Office, and why it ſhould not be exactly the ſame now, as it was before the Days of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As worldly Proſperity or Adverſity does not affect the Nature of the Office, ſo neither does the Location nor Limitation of it with Regard to Place. He who has a ſmall Dioceſs, has the ſame Epiſcopal Powers, as he that has a large one; and it matters not, as to the Validity of the Act, whether it is performed by the Biſhop of <hi>Man,</hi> or the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>—or, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> whether by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Rhegium,</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or <hi>Eugubium,</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> or <hi>Tanais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our preſent Inquiry therefore, leads us to the Conſideration of thoſe Powers only, which, being inſeparable from the Office, and peculiar to it, all Biſhops, as ſuch, are equally poſſeſſed of, and without which they would ceaſe to be Biſhops: and theſe will be found to be the Powers of <hi>Government, Ordination</hi> and <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Power or Right of <hi>Government</hi> is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily included in the Superiority of their Office. For in every Society, where there is a Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Offices, that which conſtitutes the higheſt Office is the legal Poſſeſſion of the higheſt Power; and the ſuperintending and governing Power, being ſuperior to all others, muſt of Conſequence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010578_0016_0F86F087516648E0"/>
belong to the higheſt Office. In the Chriſtian Church, the Apoſtles were inveſted with this Power by Chriſt—as it was intended for perpetual Uſe, they conveyed it to their Succeſſors—it was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> by <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> by <hi>Dyoniſius the Arcopagite</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> by <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> at <hi>Philippi,</hi> by <hi>Archippus</hi> at <hi>Coloſſé,</hi> &amp;c.—and, through all the Ages of the Church, it has been tranſmitted down and maintained by the Epiſcopal Order; who, in the exerciſe of it, have occaſionally and frequently taken the Advice of their Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Biſhop may communicate this Power, in ſome Degree, to Preſbyters or others as he ſhall think proper; but in ſuch Caſes, it muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in Subordination to him, for he can never diveſt himſelf of his controlling and ſuperintending Authority. It is ſo eſſential to his Office, that he cannot relinquiſh it in ſuch a Manner, as not to be accountable for the Exerciſe of it.</p>
               <p>The Epiſtles to the Seven Churches of the <hi>Lydian Aſia</hi> are a Proof of this, and ſhew plainly, that the Government of thoſe Churches reſpectively, was lodged in the Hands of ſingle Perſons, who are called <hi>Angels</hi>; by which was meant and intended, according to the united Voice of Antiquity, <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the appropriated Senſe. Some of theſe are reproved for the Relaxation of Diſcipline, and all of them are treated as having the intire Government of their reſpective Diſtricts, and as accountable for the State of Religion within the Bounds of their Spiritual Juriſdiction. But it is needleſs to prove what the Enemies of Epiſcopacy will not deny, that wherever this Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has obtained, the Government of the Church has always been exerciſed by Biſhops, and never by Preſbyters, unleſs in an inferior Degree and in Subordination to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:010578_0017_0F86F0880CC35580"/>Another Power belonging to Biſhops, is that of <hi>Ordination</hi>; which has always been conſidered by the Friends of Epiſcopacy as peculiar to Biſhops, and unalienable from their Office. And indeed there would be an Abſurdity in ſuppoſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. For to whom can the Appointment of inferior and ſubordinate Officers belong, in every Society, but to thoſe who govern it? Beſides, the ſame Arguments which prove the Diſtinction of Biſhops from Preſbyters, prove alſo that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is an Office peculiar to the former; for it is chiefly by the Appropriation of Offices, that we are able to prove the Diſtinction of Orders. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Eccleſiaſtical Offices are never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Clergy in common, but only by ſuch of them as are particularly ordained for thoſe Purpoſes, it is evident that thoſe who are thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and impowered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are admitted to a different and higher Order. Now, with Regard to the Power of Ordination, none that have laboured in the Cauſe have ever been able to ſhew from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a <hi>ſingle</hi> Inſtance, wherein this Power has been exerciſed by Preſbyters <hi>only</hi>; but there are <hi>many</hi> Inſtances in which thoſe, who are manifeſtly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Preſbyters, are found to have uſed it.</p>
               <p>As to the Caſe of <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, in his <hi>firſt</hi> Epiſtle to him, to
<q>neglect not the Gift which was given him by Prophecy, <hi>with</hi> the laying on the Hands of the Preſbytery,</q>
it will not anſwer the Purpoſe. For allowing, at preſent, the Word <hi>Preſbytery</hi> to ſignify, what ſome would chooſe it ſhould ſignify, a Number of meer <hi>Preſbyters</hi>; yet we are certain that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not ordained by ſuch Perſons only, unleſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> was but a meer Preſbyter. For in his <hi>ſecond</hi> Epiſtle to him he expreſsly aſſerts, that this ſame Gift was
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010578_0017_0F86F0880CC35580"/>
imparted to him
<q>
                     <hi>by</hi> the laying on of his own Hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Queſtion then ariſes, How theſe two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Timothy's</hi> Ordination can be reconciled? To this Queſtion the Anſwer is obvious. There is not a Preſbyter of the Church of England but can, with Truth and Propriety ſay, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Ordination <hi>by</hi> the laying on of the Hands of the Biſhop, and <hi>with</hi> the laying on of the Hands of Preſbyters. For in <hi>our</hi> Ordinations, in which, as in other Things, we endeavour to come as near as poſſible to the primitive Standard, the Preſbyters that are preſent, always join with the Biſhop in the Impoſition of Hands. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Difference between <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with: Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> received his Gift <hi>by</hi> the Impoſition of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Hands, as being effectual to convey it; but it was only <hi>with</hi> the Impoſition of the Hands of the Preſbytery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which implies not any Power in them, but their Concurrence only. St. <hi>Paul</hi> could have ordained without their Concurrence, but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their Hands would have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unavailable without the Apoſtle—much more in Oppoſition to him. I am aſhamed to repeat Things which have been ſo frequently ſaid by others; but an Apprehenſion that theſe Papers may fall into the Hands of ſome, who are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to what has been written on the Subject, muſt be my Apology.</p>
               <p>As to the other Caſe of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which is objected againſt us, there is no Evidence that this was any Ordination at all; and when it can be proved that it was, it will be ſoon enough to conſider it.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that there is no Inſtance in Holy Scripture, wherein Ordination has been performed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010578_0018_0F86F088CEE05980"/>
by meer Preſbyters: I may go on and ſay, that there is not an Inſtance of it to be found in the Church for ſeveral Ages. <hi>Aerius</hi> and <hi>Colluthus</hi> in the Fourth Century, ſeem to have been the firſt Contrivers of Ordinations of this Sort; but, with what Views they acted—in what Light they were conſidered by the Catholic Church—and how badly they ſucceeded—are Particulars, for which I beg Leave to refer the Engliſh Reader to <hi>Hooker's Eccleſiaſtical Polity</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Book vii. Sect. 9.</note>, and to Archbiſhop <hi>Potter's</hi> very excellent <hi>Diſcourſe of Church Government</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. v.</note>.</p>
               <p>From this Time, until after the Beginning of the Reformation in the <hi>Sixteenth Century,</hi> no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances worthy of Notice occur to favour Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Preſbyters. So that the uniform Practice of the Church for 1500 Years, may be added to the Evidence of Scripture, in Support of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Epiſcopal Ordination.</p>
               <p>There is another Branch of the Epiſcopal Office, which muſt not be paſſed over on this Occaſion, as we think it a very material one; I mean the Impoſition of Hands in <hi>Confirmation.</hi> The Nature and Deſign of Confirmation may be ſeen in our public Office for the Adminiſtration of it—wherein the Perſons to be confirmed are, in a public Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, preſented to the Biſhop, who aſks them with due Solemnity,
<q>Do ye here in the Preſence of God, and of this Congregation, <hi>renew</hi> the ſolemn Promiſe and Vow that was made in your Name at your Baptiſm; ratifying and confirming the ſame <hi>in your own Perſons,</hi> and acknowledging yourſelves bound to believe, and to do all thoſe Things which your God-fathers and God-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then undertook for you?</q>
to this Queſtion
<pb n="19"
                      facs="unknown:010578_0018_0F86F088CEE05980"

each Perſon anſwers in the Affirmative, "I do." Then follows the Impoſition of the Biſhop's Hands, with Benediction and Prayer.</p>
               <p>We ſee here, that Confirmation conſiſts of two Parts; one to be performed by the Biſhop, and the other by the Perſons preſented to him. The Perſons preſented, on their Parts, ſolemnly, in the Preſence of God and the Congregation, renew the Promiſes made, not by themſelves, but by others in their Name, at their Baptiſm, and ratify and confirm the ſame in their own Perſons; in Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, the Biſhop for his Part, impoſes his Hands upon them with Prayer, and bleſſes them.</p>
               <p>As to that Part of the Tranſaction which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Perſons confirmed, none can diſpute the Propriety or Uſefulneſs of it. For nothing can be better adapted for the Promotion of Virtue and Piety, than that thoſe who have been baptized in their Infancy, as ſoon as they are duly inſtructed in the Nature of the baptiſmal Covenant, ſhould thus publickly engage, in their own Perſons, to perform the Conditions of it. And as to the Biſhop's Part, for the ſame Reaſons that we expect the Bleſſing of God to attend any miniſterial Offices in the Chriſtian Church, it may be expected in this; which is founded on the Example and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, as well as on the unvaried Practice of the primitive Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Church of England declares, <note n="*" place="bottom">Can. lx.</note> that
<q>it hath been a ſolemn, ancient and laudable Cuſtom, continued from the Apoſtles Time, that all Biſhops ſhould lay their Hands upon Children, baptized and inſtructed in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010578_0019_0F86F08998109948"/>
of the Chriſtian Religion, praying over them and bleſſing them.</q>
If this Cuſtom has been continued <hi>from</hi> the Apoſtles Time, it muſt have been practiſed <hi>in</hi> their Time; for, in the Language of the Schools, the <hi>Terminus a quo</hi> is the Time of the Apoſtles. And it can with no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be ſaid to have been continued <hi>from</hi> their Time, if it commenced <hi>after</hi> it. Let us ſee then what Information the Scripture gives us, relating to this Subject.</p>
               <p>In <hi>the Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. viii.14, 15, 16, 17.</note> we have the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paſſage:
<q>When the Apoſtles that were at Jeruſalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, they ſent unto them Peter and John; who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt. For as yet he was fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Then laid they their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
Theſe Words exactly deſcribe Confirmation, as it is practiced in the Church of England, and there is hardly Room for a Poſſibility of applying them to any Thing elſe. Two Apoſtles are ſent to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, to perform a particular Office—had it not been neceſſary that this Office ſhould be performed by thoſe of the higheſt Order in the Church, others undoubtedly would have been employed in that Service; it being abſurd to imagine, that Apoſtles would have been ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Samaria</hi> to do that only, which might as effectually have been done by common Elders—the Office itſelf was to impoſe Hands on thoſe that had received Baptiſm—and the great End of it was, that, by
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010578_0019_0F86F08998109948"/>
this Impoſition of Hands, the Subjects of it might receive the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>We have another Inſtance of Confirmation in the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> on whom,
<q>after they were baptized, St. <hi>Paul</hi> laid his Hands, and the Holy Ghoſt came upon them <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xix.</note>.</q>
There can be no Reaſon to doubt but the Office here performed to the Converts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was the very ſame that was performed to thoſe in <hi>Samaria</hi>; ſince it was adminiſtered, in the ſame Manner—by a Perſon of the ſame higheſt Order in the Church—to thoſe that had the ſame Qualifications—and was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſame Effects.</p>
               <p>Should it be objected, that theſe Inſtances prove only what was occaſionally practiced by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but not that this Rite was intended to be of ſtanding Uſe to the Church in all Ages, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: What was the Intention of the Apoſtles, was beſt known by their Contemporaries who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with them; and what <hi>their</hi> Opinion was of this Matter, we may ſafely judge from their Practice. That Confirmation was alſo practiſed by the immediate Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, and has been univerſally continued through all the Ages of the Church, until within this Two Centuries, he that has the leaſt Acquaintance with Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory muſt confeſs. Had there been any Doubts or Diſputes, about the Uſefulneſs or Propriety of its Continuance, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, we might have ſome Reaſon to diſpute it now. But ſo far was this from being the Caſe, that it was univerſally received as of ſacred Obligation, and of great Importance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Can you be ignorant (ſays St. <hi>Jerom</hi>) that this is the common Cuſtom of Churches, that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010578_0020_0F86F08BF8883E88"/>
Hands are laid upon thoſe who have received Baptiſm, and in that Manner the Holy Ghoſt is implored? Do you aſk, where this is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? you will find it in <hi>the Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> But even if the Authority of Scripture had been wanting, the Conſent of the <hi>whole World</hi> in this Matter, would have the Force of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <note n="*" place="bottom">An niſcis etiam Eccleſiarum hunc eſſe Morem, ut baptizatis poſtea Manus imponantur, et ita invocetur Spiritus Sanctus.

               <p>But that it was the Intention of the Apoſtles, that Confirmation ſhould not expire with them, but be continued for the perpetual Benefit of the Church, we are not only able to prove thus medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, but it muſt neceſſarily follow, from what one of them has <hi>ſaid</hi> concerning it. The Author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews <note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. vi.1, 2.</note> ſpeaks of it, as one of the firſt Principles of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and fundamental to it; and puts it upon the ſame Footing, in that Reſpect, with Repentance, Faith, &amp;c.
<q>Leaving the <hi>Principles</hi> of the Doctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to Perfection; not laying again the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Repentance from dead
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010578_0020_0F86F08BF8883E88"/>
Works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms, and of <hi>the laying on of Hands,</hi> and of the Reſurrection of the Dead, and of eternal Judgment.</q>
What we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>the laying on of Hands,</hi> ſubſequent to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, thoſe who reject the Doctrine of Confirmation may probably diſpute. But all the ancient Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators agreed in Opinion, in which they have had the Concurrence of the moſt conſiderable of the Moderns, that what is here meant, is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands in Confirmation only. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Principles of Chriſtianity are the ſame now as they were originally, Confirmation, which, in the above Paſſage is declared to be one of them, ought always to be retained in the Church.</p>
               <p>But it may be farther objected, that from the Inſtances of Confirmation recorded in Scripture, the Effects of it appear to have been miraculous, and conſequently, as the Power of Miracles has confeſſedly long ceaſed, that this Rite whereby it was imparted, is now uſeleſs, and ought not to be continued. But the Solution of this Objection is not difficult. There is no Reaſon to believe, that miraculous Gifts, although frequently, were always imparted by the Impoſition of the Apoſtles Hands. But could this be proved, yet other Gifts of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature were alſo communicated at the ſame Time; and this Communication is neceſſary to all Perſons in all Ages. Without the gracious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances of the Holy Spirit, it is as certain now as it ever was, that no Man is able to withſtand Temptations, and to fulfil the Conditions of the Goſpel Covenant.</p>
               <p>Thoſe upon whom the Apoſtles laid Hands, are ſaid to have received the Holy Ghoſt: but, I truſt, there is nothing ſo extraordinary in this, but that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010578_0021_0F86F08D425463C8"/>
Chriſtians in all Ages, who have a proper Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and make Uſe of the ſtanding Means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Church, may hope to obtain even this unſpeakable Benefit. And if ſome, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this Impoſition of the Apoſtles Hands, are ſaid to have ſpoken with Tongues, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, which was not ſo much for their own perſonal Advantage, as for the Conviction of others; it is ſufficient for Chriſtians at this Day, that, without theſe miraculous Endowments, after
<q>the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of their Sins,</q>
they are
<q>ſtrengthened with the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter,</q>
and that
<q>the manifold Gifts of Grace are daily increaſed in them—that they receive the Spirit of Wiſdom and Underſtanding—the Spirit of Counſel and ghoſtly Strength—and are filled with the Spirit of the Fear of God;</q>
for all which Things the Biſhop and Congregation are directed to pray, in the Office of Confirmation.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee upon what Authority this Practice is founded, and the Advantages that attend it; and if Perſons in this Age are diſaffected, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different towards it, it is either becauſe they do not underſtand the Nature of it, or have not that Zeal and Anxiety for their ſpiritual Intereſts, which Men had formerly <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q>The holy Rite of Confirmation is a divine Ordinance, and it produces divine Effects, and is miniſtered by divine Perſons, that is, by thoſe whom God hath ſanctified and ſeparated to this Miniſtration.

               <head>SECTION III. That the Church in America, without an Epiſcopate, is neceſſarily deſtitute of a regular Government, and cannot enjoy the Benefits of Ordination and Confirmation.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">SECT. III.</note>IN the preceeding Sections I have endeavoured to give a <hi>Summary</hi> of the Arguments in Favour of Epiſcopacy, and to prove, with all poſſible Brevity, that the Powers of ordaining, confirming and governing the Church, belong rightfully to Biſhops, and are not to be exerciſed by any of an inferior Order.</p>
               <p>If the Conſiderations which have been offered have no Weight with others, they are, however, convincing to us of the Church of England; and we firmly believe the Truth and Importance of the ſeveral Points, the Proof of which has been thus briefly attempted. Indeed the Conviction of Diſſenters, with Regard to the Divine Inſtitution and Authority of Epiſcopacy, is not the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Intention of this Publication: and yet it is no Mark of an unfriendly Diſpoſition, to hope, that thoſe who are unable to invalidate the Force of the preceeding Arguments, will candidly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them, unleſs they are able to oppoſe to them others which they judge to be, at leaſt, of equal Strength. For it is the Duty of every rational Inquirer, in all Caſes, and more eſpecially in Matters of Religion, to be governed by what appears to be the ſtrongeſt Evidence. But the preſent Deſign is to ſet before the Public, the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010578_0022_0F86F08D4DEBBC68"/>
Neceſſity and Importance of Epiſcopacy, <hi>in the Opinion of Epiſcopalians,</hi> and to ſhew the wretched Condition of the Church of England in America for Want of Biſhops.</p>
               <p>And this appears, in Part, from what has been already offered. For if, according to the Doctrine and Belief of the Church of England, none have a Right to govern the Church <note n="*" place="bottom">The Reader will obſerve, that only ſuch Authority is here ſpoken of, as is purely Eccleſiaſtical, and peculiar to the Officers of the Church. The King's Supremacy, as expreſſed in Article xxxvii, is maintained by the Church in America, in as full and ample a Manner as in England.</note> but Biſhops, nor to ordain, nor to confirm; then the American Church, while without Biſhops, muſt be without Government, without Ordination and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>Was there no other Diſadvantage attending our Want of Biſhops, than that it neceſſarily prevents our having Confirmation adminiſtered, we ſhould eſteem it a great Grievance. For in Proportion to our Opinion of the Uſefulneſs of this ſacred Inſtitution, muſt be the Hardſhip of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Enjoyment of it—eſpecially, when it is conſidered that our Enjoyment of it would not interfere with either the civil or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rights or Privileges of any. I will not, however, enlarge on this Subject, but proceed immediately to Matters of greater Conſequence; and ſuch are the Church's Want of Government and ordaining Powers.</p>
               <p>When it is ſaid, that the Church of England in America, without Biſhops, muſt be without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, this is to be underſtood in a qualified Senſe. For where there is abſolutely no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all, there can be nothing but Diſorder and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010578_0023_0F86F08E127386A8"/>
Confuſion, without any Appearance of Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; which, I truſt, is not yet the Caſe of the Church in America. Some Degree of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eſſential to the very Being of every So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whether civil or religious; and as ſoon as Government intirely ceaſes, the Society is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and has no Exiſtence.</p>
               <p>It has been allowed that Preſbyters may have a ſubordinate Authority to govern; and it is well known, that the <hi>Biſhop of London</hi> hath formerly taken ſome Cognizance of Eccleſiaſtical Matters in the Plantations, by Virtue of the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But much more than this is needful, to anſwer the Neceſſities of the American Church. The Clergy can evidently do but little <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The moſt that the Clergy can do to relieve the Church, in the preſent State of Things, ſeems to be in the Way of <hi>voluntary Conventions,</hi> which has been regularly practiſed, for a Number of Years, in ſome of the Northern Colonies. A general Concern for the Intereſt of Religion and the Church, and a Deſire in the Clergy of contributing their united Endeavours to promote it, occaſioned the firſt Riſe of theſe Conventions; and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which have been found, on the Whole, to attend them, have cauſed their Continuance.</p>
                     <p>Indeed ſuch Conventions of the Clergy, wherein all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers meet together on Terms of Equality, are unknown to the Conſtitution of the Church of England. But it muſt be alſo granted, that for ſuch a Number of Preſbyters, to be left without a Biſhop at their Head to ſuperintend and govern them, is a Thing equally unknown to the Conſtitution of any Epiſcopal Church upon Earth. That, of the Church of England in her Colonies, is an extraordinary Caſe: and in extraordinary Caſes uncommon Meaſures may be allowable. If ſome Inconveniences may be expected from theſe Conventions, which hitherto have been but ſmall and inconſiderable; Inconveniences alſo will ariſe, from every other Method that can be taken by the Clergy to ſerve the general Intereſt of Religion, while without an Epiſcopate— and undoubtedly the greateſt Inconveniences of all, from their neglecting to exert themſelves <hi>jointly</hi> in the Proſecution of their general Duty. If thoſe who think unfavourably of our Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would be ſo obliging as to tell us, <hi>how,</hi> in this diſtreſſed State of the Church, we can ſerve it, and thereby the common Cauſe of Religion more effectually, we ſhould take it kindly. This is the great End we aim at; and we are attached to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Means, only in Proportion as we judge them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive thereto.</p>
                  </note> without a Biſhop; and when it is diſputed, whether <hi>one</hi>
Biſhop reſiding in America would be ſufficient for the Colonies, it is agreed, on all Sides, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Care cannot be taken of them by a Biſhop,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010578_0023_0F86F08E127386A8"/>
who has the immediate Inſpection of a large Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in England, and reſides at the Diſtance of Three Thouſand Miles. Trial has been heretofore made what could be done by Commiſſaries; but their Uſefulneſs, upon the Whole, appeared to be ſo inconſiderable, that none have been appointed for near Twenty Years.</p>
               <p>So that the State of the Church in America is, at preſent, really this: The Clergy are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of each other, and have no Eccleſiaſtical Superiors to unite or control them; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſenſible of their Want of Power, and find themſelves free from all Reſtraints of Eccleſiaſtical Authority. They both conſider themſelves as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God for their religious Behaviour, and, in ſome Senſe, to the World for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of their Characters. They have the <hi>Rubrics</hi> of the Church of England, whereby they profeſs to govern themſelves, and to which, for the moſt Part, they ſtrictly adhere, in the public Offices of Religion; and they endeavour to conform to the <hi>Canons,</hi> ſo far as the Circumſtances of the Church in this Country will admit of. But after all, Men's governing themſelves by certain Rules and Laws, (if the Expreſſion may be allowed of) and their being governed by others, who have a proper Authority, although according to the ſame Laws, are Things that will ever be found to be different. In the former Caſe, ſome Appearance of Order may be maintained, but the Body is
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010578_0024_0F86F08F5DA0F9E8"/>
without Strength, and liable to be deſtroyed by innumerable Accidents; whereas it is only in the latter Caſe, that Health and Vigour and Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency can be reaſonably expected.</p>
               <p>The Government of the Church may be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally divided into Two Branches, and conſidered as relating either to the Clergy, or the Laity; and it may be proper to take a ſhort View of it, with Reference to both. Religion being a Matter of free Choice, for which we are ordinarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable only to him, who will hereafter judge us for our moral Behaviour—and the Church, conſidered with Relation to civil Power, being in the very Nature of it a voluntary Society; it is left to Men's Conſciences, whether they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Members of it or not. But after they are become Members, the Laws of the Church are in Force againſt them, and they are ſubject, in Eccleſiaſtical Matters, to the Authority of thoſe who govern it.</p>
               <p>What the juſt Penalties of Diſobedience are, we muſt learn from the Nature of the Church it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In Civil Society, the Magiſtrate is armed with the Sword of Juſtice, and
<q>he is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth Evil <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.4.</note>,</q>
according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Nature of his Offences. But the Power of the Church is of a ſpiritual Nature, and the utmoſt Effect of it in this World, is the cutting off and rejecting thoſe Members which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably and dangerouſly corrupted. This Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which has commonly been known by the Name of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> however it was dreaded in the pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity, has loſt much
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010578_0024_0F86F08F5DA0F9E8"/>
of its Force in this; wherein Altars are ſet up againſt Altars, and Churches againſt Churches, and thoſe who are rejected by one, may be received by another. A Diſpoſition to ſlight the higheſt Puniſhment which the Church can inflict has become general, and there appears to be no Remedy for it, unleſs in the Uſe of Reaſon and Perſuaſion. But we live in an Age, in which the Voice of Reaſon will not be heard, nor the Strength of Arguments regarded, although ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Declarations of Heaven, on the Subject of Church Diſcipline. Nay, a Man would be generally eſteemed to be either wrong-headed, or mean-ſpirited, or both, who ſhould profeſs much Reverence for Eccleſiaſtical Authority; and the Charge of <hi>Prieſt-Craft,</hi> ſo long hackneyed by Infidels and Libertines, would be ſure to fall upon the Clergy, ſhould they have Courage to ſpeak up in Defence of it.</p>
               <p>In this State of Things, the Reſtoration of the primitive Diſcipline ſeems to be a Matter rather to be wiſhed for and deſired, than to be rationally attempted by thoſe in Authority. Accordingly no Attempts of this Nature will be made under in American Epiſcopate; the Diſcipline of the Church, ſo far as it relates to the private Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, will be left as it is, and nothing farther will be done than refuſing the Communion to diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and ſcandalous Perſons, which every Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may now refuſe, and ought to refuſe, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the <hi>Rubrics.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with Regard to the Clergy, it is propoſed that a ſtrict Diſcipline be eſtabliſhed, and that the Biſhop's Power over them ſhall be as full and complete, as the Laws and Canons of the Church direct. Of the Neceſſity of this, none can be
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010578_0025_0F86F08F8A083108"/>
more ſenſible than the Clergy themſelves, who, in all their Addreſſes in Favour of an Epiſcopate, have propoſed and requeſted that this may be the Caſe. The general Character of the American Clergy, the Author believes, if he may judge from a large and extenſive Acquaintance with them, and he hopes it may be thought excuſable in him, on this Occaſion, although one of the Number, to declare his Belief of it, to be truly reſpectable. They are ſound and ſteady in their Principles, and regular in their Behaviour. In ſo large a Body, ſome Exceptions from the general Character muſt be expected; but it is rather to be wondered that their Number is ſo ſmall, conſidering all Things.</p>
               <p>Indeed we have heard much of the profligate Behaviour of the Clergy to the Southward, and in the Iſlands; but this, perhaps, may have been owing to the Conduct of a few Individuals, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and aggravated with a malicious Intention. But allowing many of theſe evil Reports to have been juſtly founded, yet we all know that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Practices of one vicious Clergyman will be more frequently mentioned, than the Virtues of Fifty, of an orderly Life and Converſation.</p>
               <p>But after all, whatever may be the Proportion between the virtuous and vicious Clergymen in America, as there are undoubtedly ſome of both Characters; the Want of Biſhops to ſuperintend and govern them, is obvious at firſt View. If one Sort have no Need of a Biſhop to keep them to their Duty, yet ſome Caſes will ariſe in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it in which his Direction will be uſeful —and many Caſes, wherein his Support and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement will be needful—and in all Caſes, his Friendſhip and Patronage will give Life and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010578_0025_0F86F08F8A083108"/>
Spirit to them in undergoing the Difficulties, and in performing the Duties, of their Station.</p>
               <p>But as there are Clergymen alſo of a different Character, it is more immediately neceſſary on Account of theſe, that Epiſcopal Government ſhould take Place in America. The Proceſs of carrying an Accuſation, and afterwards of ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, before our Superiors, at ſo great a Diſtance, muſt be tedious and difficult; and this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration undoubtedly, in ſome Caſes, may cauſe thoſe to eſcape Puniſhment who really deſerve it. But the Caſe will be different under a ſettled Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate; as then, for every Grievance of this Nature, the Church will have an eaſy and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Remedy. If a Clergyman ſhall diſgrace his Profeſſion in an open and ſcandalous Manner, a Biſhop reſiding in the Country can ſuſpend him immediately; and if upon Trial the Caſe ſhall be found to deſerve it, he can proceed to deprive him of his Benefice <note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid that in <hi>Maryland,</hi> a Clergyman once poſſeſſed of a Living, can hold it for Life, however looſe and profligate he may prove in his Behaviour. If this is really the Caſe, it muſt be owing to ſome great Defect in the Conſtitution of that Province, which ought to be remedied. In the mean while, it is ſuch a Hardſhip upon the Church, as, I believe, is ſuffered in no other Part of the World. And what makes it the more intolerable, is, that the ſole Right of diſpoſing of every Benefice in the Province, is claimed by the Proprietor, and exerciſed by his Governor. It is ſome Alleviation however, that the preſent very worthy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor makes it a general Rule, (if the Author hath been rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) to which he adheres, as far as he can, conſiſtently with his Obligations to the Proprietor, to grant Induction to no Clergyman, without the Approbation of the Veſtry and principal Pariſhioners.</note>, and not only ſilence and depoſe him, but excommunicate him from the Society of Chriſtians. The Conſideration of this, and that they are under the Eye of their Biſhop, one main Branch of whoſe Buſineſs is to inſpect and enquire
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010578_0026_0F86F092A53135B0"/>
into their Conduct, will naturally tend to make the Clergy in general, more regular and diligent in the Diſcharge of the Duties of their Office, and more careful and circumſpect in their whole Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. In a Word, of thoſe whoſe Characters are juſtly exceptionable, ſome may probably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a Biſhop; and as to others, they may be eaſily diſplaced, unleſs it be the Fault of the People themſelves.</p>
               <p>But a greater Diſadvantage, if poſſible, than the Want of a regular Government, attends the Church of England in America in its preſent State, I mean the Want of Ordination: for none can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Holy Orders without croſſing the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, with great Hazard and Expence. The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch a Voyage may, to ſome, appear to be trifling; but the Apprehenſion of it, together with a natural Averſion to the Sea, has been known to deter many worthy Perſons, who have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of obtaining Ordination in the Church, from attempting it—the Fear and Apprehenſion of Danger, in ſuch Caſes, whether rightly founded or not, having always the ſame Effect. But what real Foundation there is for ſuch an Apprehenſion, will be beſt diſcovered from Experience and Facts. Now the exact Number of thoſe that have gone Home for Ordination, from theſe Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies (excepting ſome who have ſailed lately, who cannot properly be included in this Account) is Fifty-two. Of theſe Forty-two have returned ſafely, and Ten have miſcarried; the Voyage, or Sickneſs occaſioned by it, having proved fatal to near a fifth Part of them.</p>
               <p>The Expence of this Voyage cannot be reckoned at leſs, upon an Average, than One Hundred Pounds Sterling to each Perſon. To Men of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

this is an inconſiderable Sum; but Men of Fortune muſt not be expected to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Service of the Church in America, where the Proſpect is ſo diſcouraging, and ſo many diſagreeable Circumſtances are known to attend it. The Expence muſt therefore generally fall upon ſuch, as having already expended the greateſt Part of their Pittance in their Education, will find it extremely hard to raiſe a Sum ſufficient for the Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Under theſe Diſcouragements, there has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been great Difficulty in ſupplying the Church with Clergymen, and there always muſt be. In what Manner the Church is ſupplied at preſent <note n="*" place="bottom">February 1767.</note>, the following Inſtances will ſufficiently teſtify. In the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> there are Twenty-one Churches and Congregations; Eleven of theſe are intirely deſtitute of a Miniſter, and there are but Five Clergymen to do the Duties of the other Ten. In <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> including the <hi>Lower Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> the Caſe is ſimilar. In the City of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> there are Three Churches and Congregations, and but Two Clergymen; in the Reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Number of Churches is Twenty-ſix, and that of the Clergy is but Seven.</p>
               <p>If ſome of the Colonies are better ſupplied, perhaps others may be found which are provided for not ſo well. In <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor <hi>Dobbs</hi> informed <hi>the Society,</hi> in his Letter dated March 29th, 1764,
<q>that there were then but Six Clergymen in that Province, although there were Twenty-nine Pariſhes, and each Pariſh contained a whole County:</q>
And the Majority of the Inhabitants are ſaid to profeſs

themſelves Members of the Church. Other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have contributed to this general Want of Clergymen in America, but it has always been principally owing to the great Difficulty of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Ordination.</p>
               <p>Under this Head it may be obſerved farther, that the Danger and Expence of a Voyage to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for the Purpoſe of obtaining Ordination, are not the only Evils we have Reaſon to complain of: for another glaring Diſadvantage, to which the Church in America is manifeſtly ſubject, ariſes from the impoſſibility that a Biſhop reſiding in England, ſhould be ſufficiently acquainted with the Characters of thoſe who go Home from this Country for Holy Orders. To this it is owing, that Ordination has been ſometimes fraudulently and ſurreptitiouſly obtained by ſuch Wretches, as are not only a Scandal to the Church, but a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the human Species.</p>
               <p>The Church has taken all due Care that none ſhall be ordained, without full and proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their <hi>good Character</hi> and Abilities <note n="*" place="bottom">See Canon xxxiv.</note>; and as to thoſe who go Home from this diſtant Country for that Purpoſe, ſenſible of the peculiar Hazard attending ſuch Caſes, the <hi>Biſhop of London,</hi> in Conjunction with <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel in foreign Parts,</hi> every Year proclaims and publiſhes to the World, that he
<q>requeſts and earneſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſeeches all Perſons concerned, that they recommend no Man out of Favour or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or any other worldly Conſideration, but with a ſincere Regard to the Honour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and our Bleſſed Saviour; as they tender the Intereſt of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Good of Men's Souls.</q>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>But although the Biſhops of London, to whom this Application from America has always been made, have ſucceſſively exerciſed the greateſt Care and Circumſpection in this Matter, yet none of them have been able intirely to avoid Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Nature. Notwithſtanding their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Caution and Care to prevent it, Inſtances have happened, wherein Perſons have produced in England the moſt ample written Credentials, obtained God knows how, of their pious and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly Converſation, whoſe Lives have been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly infamous in this Country; and after having been inveſted with the ſacred Office, they have been ſent back to take Charge of the Souls of others—in the Proſecution of which Work they have acted as if they had not, or imagined that they had not, any Souls of their own.</p>
               <p>And this is not much to be wondered at, ſince in ſuch a Country as America, an artful Man may ſometimes be able to procure Teſtimonials in his Favour, ſigned by a competent Number of ſuch Clergymen and others, as a Biſhop of London will not know how to object againſt. Or, ſhould this Attempt fail him, he may even <hi>forge</hi> his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, and ſo carry his Point before he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. This Suppoſition is not an abſurd one— it is neceſſary in Order to account for the Succeſs of ſome Adventurers from the Colonies, who have obtained Ordination in England, and then have returned to America to diſgrace themſelves and the Church—to the great Grief and Vexation of all its Friends, and, I doubt not, to the no ſmall Conſolation of ſome of its Enemies.</p>
               <p>And when we conſider the miſerable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that muſt neceſſarily follow, even from a ſingle Inſtance of this Kind, and that <hi>one worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>

Clergyman will do more Miſchief to Religion, than <hi>many worthy</hi> ones are able to repair; it is evident that the Church may be, as Experience proves that it ſometimes actually has been, a great Sufferer in this Reſpect. And there ſeems to be no Method of preventing this Evil intirely, but by the Reſidence of Biſhops in America; in which Caſe the general Character of each Candidate for holy Orders might be known by the Biſhop, and ſuch Impoſitions as have been mentioned, would ſeldom be attempted.</p>

               <head>SECTION IV. The unparalleled Hardſhip of this Caſe repreſented.</head>
               <p>WAS the Author diſpoſed to proceed in the Way of Declamation, he is of Opinion,<note place="margin">SECT. IV.</note> that the Chriſtian Church has not, in any Inſtance, for Ages paſt, afforded a more fruitful Subject for it. But it is his Deſign only to ſtate Arguments and Facts as briefly as he can, and to recommend them to the candid Conſideration of the Public. He therefore begs Leave, on the foregoing Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, barely to make <hi>an Appeal</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men <hi>in Behalf of the Church</hi>—whether, in Caſe the religious Society whereto they belong, was doomed to undergo ſuch an Hardſhip as the Church of England in America ſuffers for Want of Ordination, to ſay nothing of other Inſtances, they would not think themſelves injured, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain moſt bitterly? If any other Denomination of Chriſtians in his Majeſty's American Dominions was not allowed to have a Clergyman, without paying a Fine of One Hundred Pounds Sterling on his Admiſſion, and expoſing him, at the ſame Time, to ſome dangerous Proceſs, which had proved fatal to a fifth Part of his Predeceſſors, would they not eſteem it an intolerable Grievance, and a cruel Perſecution? And indeed, would not every diſintereſted Perſon conſider it in the ſame Light? Now, if this would be eſteemed Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Caſe of Preſbyterians or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaliſts, or of any other religious Denomination of People in this Country, why it ſhould be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leſs when ſuffered by the Church of England,

is hard to conceive. We have the ſame Feelings, the ſame Senſibility with other Perſons, and are equally affected by any Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps may diſpute the Propriety of the Word, as the great Grievance in Queſtion ariſes not from any poſitive Exertion of Civil Power againſt us: but if it be not properly Perſecution, it is ſomething that is as bad in its natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. It may be queſtioned, whether the worſt Perſecutions have ever exterminated a fifth Part of the Clergy in any Country; and it is evident, that all direct Perſecutions have been attended with this good Effect, that the religious Zeal of thoſe againſt whom they have been intended, has been animated and increaſed: whereas, in the particular Species of ſuffering, of which the American Church ſo juſtly complains, there is a peculiar Tendency to render the Members of it careleſs and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in religious Matters, and regardleſs of its Intereſts.</p>
               <p>If there are any Points, in which the Reaſon and common Senſe of Mankind can be ſuppoſed to agree, this muſt unqueſtionably be one, that the Church of England in America, under the before-mentioned Diſadvantages, although not formally perſecuted, is in a moſt wretched and deplorable Condition. And, we who are Members of it, cannot but think it an Aggravation of our Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that it appears to be altogether unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented; we being ſingled out from all the People upon Earth to be made the firſt Example of it. It would be but a poor Conſolation, we confeſs, to be able to recollect Inſtances, wherein others have ſuffered in the ſame Manner with ourſelves. But yet our Condition ſeems to imply, and Strangers may conclude from it, that there has been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010578_0029_0F86F094CA344248"/>
groſly amiſs and unprecedented in our Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which has brought down upon us the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of our Superiors, from whom we might otherwiſe expect, at leaſt, that common Protection and Indulgence, which is ſo generouſly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly afforded to all others.</p>
               <p>But while we thus ſuffer, we are not apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive that it can be owing to the Diſpleaſure of our Superiors, as we are conſcious of no Crimes, with Regard to the State. On the other Hand we claim a Right to be conſidered as equal with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, in every due Expreſſion of Fidelity and Loyalty. We eſteem ourſelves bound, not only by preſent Intereſt and Inclination, but by the more ſacred Ties of our religious Principles and Chriſtian Duty, to ſupport, to the utmoſt, the National Civil Eſtabliſhment. Accordingly no Trumpet of Sedition was ever heard to ſound from our Pulpits—no Seeds of Diſaffection have been ſuffered more privately to be ſown in our Houſes. As our Religion teaches us, in the firſt Place, and above all Things to <hi>fear God</hi>; ſo, while we can preſerve it, it will be a full Security to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our <hi>honouring the King,</hi> and <hi>not meddling with them that are given to Change</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This Declaration is not intended to imply any Accuſation of others; who are able, it is hoped, to make their own Defence, whenever the Occaſion ſhall require it. His Majeſty's American Subjects, of all Denominations, belonging to the old Colonies, have always profeſſed Sentiments of Loyalty; and the Author believes they have generally been <hi>ſincere</hi> in thoſe Profeſſions. If there have been any late Appearances of undutiful Behaviour in the Colonies, they have ariſen, not from any Diſaffection towards his Majeſty's ſacred Perſon—not from any Want of Eſteem for the civil Conſtitution—but from an Opinion of <hi>unconſtitutional</hi> Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And ſo long as the free Principles of the Britiſh Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be extended to the Colonies, whoſe Inhabitants, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever divided in other Reſpects, all agree in maintaining the ſame Eſteem for Liberty with true Engliſhmen at Home, there will be no Danger of their attempting to revolt.</note>.</p>

and ſtigmatized by the Want of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Privileges, which are granted to all other Denominations of Chriſtians whatever, in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Dominions. In our petitioning for Biſhops, all that we aſk for ourſelves, is what has been freely granted to others, what has been refuſed to none elſe who have applied for it. We requeſt only the Liberty of enjoying the Inſtitutions of our Church, and thereby of being put upon an equal Footing with our Neighbours—with the various Sects of Engliſh Diſſenters, who have the full En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their reſpective Forms of Eccleſiaſtical Government and Diſcipline—and even with the Moravians and Papiſts, who are ſeverally allowed a Biſhop. And we cannot but flatter ourſelves, that we have as good a Right to expect Succeſs in an Application of this Nature, as if we were Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, or Moravians, or Papiſts. For it is utterly inconceivable to us, that there can be any Thing in the peculiar Principles of our Religion, or in the diſtinguiſhing Circumſtance of its being the national Religion, that can account for a Refuſal <note n="†" place="bottom">

That it is ſo, compared with the State of religious Denominations in the Britiſh Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, has been already ſhewn. And if we look abroad, or carry our Inquiries back through all the Ages of the Church to its firſt Origin, I am perſuaded we ſhall not be able to find its Parallel.</p>
               <p>During the Time of the Apoſtles, as the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtians increaſed, Care was taken to form them into proper Eccleſiaſtical Diſtricts, and a Biſhop was appointed for each,
<q>to ſet in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Things that were wanting, and to ordain Elders in every City<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus i.5.</note>.</q>
What was the Extent of theſe original Diſtricts, to which the Exerciſe of the Epiſcopal Authority was ordinarily limited, is, perhaps, not eaſy exactly to determine at this Day. But it is moſt probable, that in every large City, including its <hi>Environs</hi> and Dependencies, where the Goſpel had been received, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſtian Congregations and Preſbyters was conſiderable, Biſhops were appointed. And in every Territory, which had natural Boundaries and Limitations, whereby it was made ſeparate and diſtinct from the neighbouring Countries, whether it did or did not include any Capital City, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as before, that the Number of Churches required it, a Biſhop was alſo ſettled. By this Means due Proviſion was made for the whole Church, and no large Number of Chriſtians was
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010578_0031_0F86F0964F8E5878"/>
neglected, nor ſuffered to continue long without a regular Eccleſiaſtical Government.</p>
               <p>An Inſtance of this general Care is to be found in <hi>Crete</hi> over which <hi>Titus</hi> was appointed Biſhop by St. <hi>Paul</hi>; at a Time, when the Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in that Iſland, was probably much inferior to the preſent Number of profeſſed Chriſtians, in more than one of our Britiſh American Iſlands. In the ſucceeding Ages, until the Roman Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtian, this Apoſtolic Plan was carefully followed, and the Number of Biſhops was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, in Proportion to the growing Extent and Advancement of Chriſtianity <note n="*" place="bottom">Bingham's Antiquities, <hi>Book ix.</hi>
                  </note>. When the Church at length obtained the Protection and Patronage of the State, theſe Eccleſiaſtical Regulations were <hi>eſtabliſhed by Law,</hi> and Biſhops, in the Exerciſe of their Juriſdiction, were aided and ſupported by Civil Power.</p>
               <p>If we purſue the Hiſtory of the Church from this Period, we ſhall meet with no Inſtance, in which any large Number of People proſelyted to the Chriſtian Religion, or any conſiderable Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſettled by a Chriſtian Country, have been without a Biſhop, the Dutch Colonies excepted, which do not deſire them. It has been the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all Chriſtian Nations, to provide for and maintain the national Religion, and to render it as reſpectable as poſſible, in the moſt diſtant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; wherein, either a Regard for their Religion, or Reaſons of Policy, and probably both, have led them to take equal Care for the Eſtabliſhment of Eccleſiaſtical, as of Civil Government. As to <hi>America,</hi> in particular, wherever we meet with French or Spaniſh Settlements, we find Biſhops.

In <hi>Canada,</hi> a Country leſs populous than many of the Britiſh Colonies, when we took Poſſeſſion of it, there was a compleat Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under an Epiſcopate.</p>
               <p>But we need not confine our Inquiries to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nations and Countries. If we conſult the Records of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> and <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> the Caſe appears always to have been the ſame in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Among the ancient civilized Heathens, the national Religion was never neglected; for it was generally conſidered as one of the firſt Duties of the Civil Magiſtrate, to encourage, ſupport and increaſe its Influence, to the utmoſt of his Power. And the Mahometans have ever been as zealous in propagating their Religion, as in extending their Conqueſts.</p>
               <p>This univerſal Practice of all Nations and Ages, has proceeded from Two general Principles that are deeply founded in human Nature, and human Policy. The firſt is inſeparable from our Nature, and neceſſarily leads Men to exert themſelves, for the Preſervation and Security of whatever they eſteem and hold to be valuable, in Proportion as they judge of its Uſefulneſs and Importance. The other ſeems to be a fundamental Principle of ſound and conſiſtent Policy, which neceſſarily requires the Protection and Security of the national Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For as ſome Religion has been ever thought, by the wiſeſt Legiſlators, to be neceſſary for the Security of Civil Government, and accordingly has always been interwoven into the Conſtitution of it; ſo, in every Nation, that Religion which is thus diſtinguiſhed, muſt be looked upon as, in the Opinion of the Legiſlature, the beſt fitted for this great Purpoſe.</p>

Muſt we neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that they have no Eſteem and Affection for that Religion, which is ſo cloſely allied and connected with the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the State? Has the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the Church of England been ſuch, with Regard to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment—or, are its <hi>Principles</hi> ſuch, that it is not intitled to the ſame Care and Protection, which other Kingdoms and States have ever afforded to the national Religion, whether Chriſtian, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, or Pagan? Neither of theſe, it is hoped, can be ſaid properly.</p>
               <p>Although the Church of England in America appears not hitherto to have been made a national Concern; yet many Reaſons may be aſſigned for this Neglect, owing to the peculiar Circumſtances of the Engliſh Nation and Colonies, which will account for, although, perhaps, not altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it. The Colonies were generally ſettled by private Adventurers; and ſome of them, by thoſe who had an Averſion to Epiſcopal Government. The Propriety of not ſending a Biſhop to Colonies of the latter Sort, will be diſputed by none: and as to the others, their Beginnings were ſmall, and for ſome Time an Epiſcopate was not greatly wanted.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:010578_0033_0F86F09942963B40"/>Beſides, it ought to be conſidered, that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Government—the Revolutions of Power— the Oppoſition of contending Parties at Home— the Intrigues of foreign Courts—and the Attacks of neighbouring Kingdoms and States, have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been more than ſufficient to employ the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Attention, almoſt ever ſince the Riſe of our Colonies. Accordingly we have found, that even the <hi>commercial</hi> and <hi>political</hi> Importance of theſe Colonies, has been but little known or regarded, until of very late Years. In theſe Circumſtances, it is not to be wondered, that the Caſe of <hi>the Church</hi> in America, has not been attended to; eſpecially as the Members of it, not excepting the Clergy, have been careleſs themſelves, and not made thoſe Repreſentations in Favour of it, which they ought to have made.</p>
               <p>To this may be added, that ſo long as no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Plan for an American Epiſcopate was ſettled and propoſed, a Fear of infringing the religious Rights of Proteſtant Diſſenters in this Country, for which both our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Rulers have ſo tender a Regard, muſt have created an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſuperable Difficulty in carrying into Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution a Work of this Nature.</p>
               <p>Our own Negligence in this Country has been confeſſed; and I wiſh as much could be fairly ſaid in Excuſe for it. How can the Neceſſities of the Church here be known, at a Diſtance, unleſs thoſe who reſide here will be at the Trouble of repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them? And from whom can ſuch Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be properly expected, but from the Clergy, and other Friends and Members of the Church?</p>
               <p>Indeed there have not been wanting ſome Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, for almoſt a Century back, who have ſeen

and lamented the Want of Biſhops in this Country, and endeavoured to obtain them: and there was a Time, wherein the Members of the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſeem to have exerted themſelves in Behalf of an Epiſcopate. So early as in 1672, this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was mentioned, and it was thought needful and expedient even then, that a Biſhop ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in <hi>Virginia.</hi> But in the Beginning of this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, Addreſſes were earneſtly and repeatedly made to <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel in foreign Parts,</hi> then newly incorporated, ſigned not only by the Clergy and by Veſtries, but by Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Provinces <note n="*" place="bottom">

VI.</note>THE favourable Opportunity which has ſo long been waited for, in the Opinion of many wiſe and judicious Perſons in America, now preſents itſelf—and ſuch, in ſeveral Reſpects, as the Circumſtances of the Nation have never, until now, afforded. As the Tumults of War have ceaſed, and the public Tranquillity is reſtored, without any reaſonable Suſpicions of a ſpeedy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption—ſo, the greateſt Harmony ſubſiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Mother-Country and moſt of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the late Diſputes having been brought, by the Wiſdom and good Temper of the former, to a happy Termination—the Plan of an American Epiſcopate has been previouſly ſettled, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted in ſuch a Manner, that the religious Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of none can be violated or endangered—and, which we ſhould ever acknowledge with all Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, we are, at this Time, ſo happy as to have a Prince on the Throne, from whoſe moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Diſpoſition to promote the general Intereſt of Virtue and Religion, from whoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Affection for the Church, and from whoſe moſt gracious Declarations on the Subject before us, we cannot poſſibly doubt of the Royal Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and Concurrence—while a wiſe and virtuous Miniſtry cannot fail of being ready, to afford to ſo good a Cauſe, all needful Aſſiſtance. Theſe are the Advantages, which now happily concur to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010578_0036_0F86F09B6936ACA8"/>
the American Church, and which peculiarly mark the preſent Period.</p>
               <p>It ought to be farther conſidered, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for ſending Biſhops to America, were never ſo urgent and forcible as they are at preſent. When ſuch Progreſs was made towards obtaining for this Country an Epiſcopate, in the former Part of this Century, the Number of American Clergy and Profeſſors of the Church, although judged then to be greater than in many Dioceſſes in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note, Page 52.</note>, was ſmall and inconſiderable, in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the Amount of their preſent Number. The amazing natural Increaſe of the Coloniſts, and the vaſt Acceſſion of Europeans to the Britiſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, have, in the Compaſs of Fifty or Sixty Years, ſo enlarged the Number of its Inhabitants, and proportionably of the Members of the Church, that perhaps it is not inferior now, to the Number of Inhabitants in all the Dioceſſes in the Province of <hi>York,</hi> excluſive of Diſſenters.</p>
               <p>Should it be ſaid, that the Church of England in America contains now near <hi>a Million</hi> of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Aſſertion might be juſtified. It is not eaſy to aſcertain the Number exactly, in a Country ſo widely extended and unequally peopled; but from general Calculations it has been frequently ſaid of late Years, that the proper Subjects of the Britiſh Crown in America amount to <hi>Three Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</hi> This has been ſaid even in the Parliament of Great-Britain, if our Information may be truſted —it has been repeatedly ſaid in this Country, by ſome of our moſt ſenſible Writers. Strangers may be aſtoniſhed at ſo large an Account, but to others it is not incredible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:010578_0037_0F86F09B8A91B810"/>An actual Survey <note n="*" place="bottom">Communicated by a Gentleman of undoubted Veracity.</note> of the Number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in 1762, with a Diſtribution of them into Claſſes, according to their religious Profeſſions, is ſaid to have been carefully made: and it was then found, that, not including the new Colonies ceded by the laſt general Treaty of Peace, they amounted to between Two and Three Millions, in the Colonies and Iſlands. Of the <hi>Whites,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Church were about a third Part—the Preſbyterians, Independents and Anabaptiſts were not ſo many—the Germans, Papiſts and other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, amounted to more.</p>
               <p>Let this Repreſentation be carefully conſidered, and it will appear in a very evident and ſtriking Light, that the Wants of the American Church, as it has been deſtitute of Biſhops, muſt have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally increaſed, and can amount now to little leſs than an abſolute Neceſſity. In theſe Circumſtances, could ſuch a Number of Chriſtians, even under a Pagan Government, unleſs in a State of open Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, provided they had always proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves loyal and faithful Subjects, apply in vain for a Favour, ſo needful for themſelves, and ſo harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to others? How much leſs Reaſon then can the Church in America have to fear a Refuſal in the preſent Caſe, not only from a Chriſtian Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, famed for its prudent Indulgence to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Denominations in general—but from a Nation, which is moreover diſpoſed to befriend it, from peculiar Reaſons both of Affection and Policy?</p>
               <p>This Argument taken from the <hi>Number</hi> of thoſe who belong to the Church of England in America, will receive great additional Force, from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the State of the <hi>Blacks</hi> in our Iſlands
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010578_0037_0F86F09B8A91B810"/>
and Colonies; who were found, in the above-mentioned Survey, to be about Eight Hundred and Forty-four Thouſand. Although many of theſe, it is to be feared, through the Neglect of their Maſters, are not Chriſtians at all; yet, as they are connected with, and under the immediate Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, Perſons who profeſs Chriſtianity, they may be ſaid, in an imperfect Senſe, to belong to the reſpective religious Claſſes of their Owners. However, their Situation is undoubtedly ſuch, that in Proportion as a Senſe of Religion prevails in their Maſters, they will receive Benefit. Now as theſe are known chiefly to belong to the Profeſſors of the Church, if an Epiſcopate will naturally tend to improve the State of Religion in the Church of England, it muſt conſequently, (to ſay nothing of a particular Care which will probably be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them, when Biſhops ſhall be ſettled) have a general good Effect upon more than half a Million of poor Creatures, Sharers with us of the ſame common Nature—ſent into the World as Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners and Candidates for the ſame glorious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality—whom Chriſt equally purchaſed by his precious blood-ſhedding—who notwithſtanding, as they are bred up in Ignorance and Darkneſs, are ſuffered, to the eternal Diſgrace of their Owners, to walk on "in the Shadow of Death," without a Ray of rational religious Hope to chear them.</p>
               <p>This Conſideration muſt make a deep Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the Minds of all ſerious Chriſtians, and lead them to encourage and help forward every Work, which has any probable Appearance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Spiritual Intereſts, of ſo many of theſe wretched Outcaſts of Humanity. If it is the Duty of Chriſtians to communicate <q>the glad Tidings of Salvation</q> to Heathens in general; it is a
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010578_0038_0F86F09EDBC2C408"/>
Duty more peculiarly incumbent upon us, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Goſpel to ſuch of them as are under our immediate Government and Inſpection, and who wear out, under the hard Yoke of Bondage, their Strength and very Lives in our Service.</p>
               <p>Another Argument for granting an American Epiſcopate, ariſes from the Obligations of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; a national Senſe of which, it is humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ought, at this Time, to have a peculiar Efficacy in Favour of Religion in the American Plantations. By a ſignal Interpoſition of Divine Providence, the Britiſh Arms in America have triumphed over all that oppoſed them, our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been prodigiouſly extended, and our new Acquiſitions, together with our old Settlements, have been ſecured, not only by Treaty, but by a total Annihilation of that Power on this Continent, whereby our former Safety was chiefly endangered.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>wiſe</hi> Nation ſees and acknowledges the Hand of God in the Production of ſuch Events; and every <hi>religious</hi> Nation will endeavour to make ſome ſuitable Returns to him for ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Favours. And what Returns are proper to be made in ſuch Caſes, one Moment's ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection will clearly diſcover. The Circumſtances of Things evidently point out two Duties to our Governors, on this Occaſion, both of them impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in themſelves, and of indiſpenſible Obligation: <hi>One</hi> is, the farther Security and Support of the true Religion in America, in thoſe Places where it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is; and the <hi>other,</hi> the Propagation of it in thoſe Places, to which it has not hitherto been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>As America is the Region, wherein the Divine Goodneſs has been more remarkably diſplayed, in

Favour of the Britiſh Nation; ſo, America is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the very Ground, on which ſome ſuitable Monument of religious Gratitude ought to be erected. This ſhould be of ſuch a Nature as to be viſible to the World, and, that the Honour of the Supreme Ruler of Events may be thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately promoted. Now as the Honour of God is moſt directly promoted by public Worſhip—as that Worſhip muſt be moſt acceptable to him, wherein the Praiſes and Adorations of his Creatures are regularly offered him, in the ſolemn Offices of the pureſt and beſt Religion—and as the national Religion muſt be ſuppoſed beſt to anſwer theſe Characters, in the national Opinion; it neceſſarily follows, that the State of the national Religion here has a Right, on this Occaſion, to the peculiar Attention and Conſideration of thoſe, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Direction of our public Affairs.</p>
               <p>What then does the preſent State of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in America require to be done? What is <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> to be done for its Benefit and Advantage? Theſe are the Queſtions that, muſt naturally ariſe. And every one that profeſſes it, every Witneſs of its ſuffering Condition, is able to anſwer:—The Church of England in America, is periſhing for Want of common Neceſſaries. She has long been imploring Relief, under ſuch Diſeaſes as muſt prove fatal to her, if much longer neglected. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly requeſts, and ſhe <hi>only</hi> requeſts, that proper Remedies may be provided for her preſent Sufferings. And ſhe leaves it, with all due Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Wiſdom of her Superiors, whether any Thing farther is proper to be done, to ſtrengthen and improve her Intereſts. She wiſhes for nothing, which ſhall be thought inconſiſtent with the Rights and Safety of others. She aſks

nothing, but what has been granted to others, without any ill Conſequences; and ſhe relies on the common Affection and Juſtice of the Nation, to raiſe her to this Equality. And, whether there is any Thing preſumptuous or unreaſonable in theſe Expectations, let Heaven and Earth judge!</p>

—or, at the very leaſt, to afford thoſe who are engaged in, or deſirous to undertake the Propagation of it, all due Encouragement. And in this View, an American Epiſcopate will be found to be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be plainer, even from the common Principles of Humanity and Benevolence, if we have no Regard to the ſacred Injunctions of our holy Religion, than that it is the Duty of thoſe whom
<q>the Day-Spring from on high hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited,</q>
to communicate this Light to others, and as they have Opportunity,
<q>to give the Knowledge of Salvation</q>
to thoſe that are without it,
<q>for the Remiſſion of their Sins</q>
—This is the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty of every private Chriſtian, and it is a Duty ſtill more ſtrongly incumbent upon every Chriſtian Nation; as the Means of ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication are more in the Power of a Nation, than of private Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Situation and Circumſtances of ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more favourable than thoſe of others, for
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010578_0040_0F86F0A0CD0363F0"/>
Attempts of this Nature. The faireſt Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are commonly in the Hands of trading Nations, like ours; to which Commerce opens a free Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the unenlightened Parts of the Earth —and, when conducted fairly and properly, it is attended with ſuch ſenſible preſent Advantages, that farther Propoſals for their ſpiritual Benefit, will probably be received, with leſs Prejudice, as coming from the Hands of their Benefactors.</p>
               <p>When the Engliſh Nation firſt propoſed to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Settlements in America, the Propagation of the Goſpel among the native Inhabitants was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mentioned as a principal Part of the Plan. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in whoſe Reign theſe Settlements were projected, conſidered the Opportunity they would furniſh for the Advancement of Chriſtianity, as a ſtrong Motive for carrying the general Scheme into Execution. "The firſt Letters Patent gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her Succeſſor, to eſtabliſh a Company for improving the Trade and Plantations in <hi>Virginia,</hi> April 10th, 1606, expreſsly enjoined <hi>the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Faith,</hi> as the End principally intended.

               <p>How this original Plan came to be altered, and ſo eſſential a Part of it as the Converſion of the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010578_0040_0F86F0A0CD0363F0"/>
American Heathens, to be afterwards omitted, would require more Time to explain, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Brevity of this Publication will admit of. That it has been altogether laid aſide as a <hi>national</hi> Deſign, is too evident to be diſputed. And yet as the Nation has not rejected the Chriſtian Religion, but profeſſes to be governed by it, and to eſteem the Light of the Goſpel as an invaluable Bleſſing, may it not be hoped that they may ſtill be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to reſume the Plan? Are there no Sparks of Chriſtian Compaſſion remaining, to warm the Breaſts of our national Rulers, in Favour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Tribes of our Fellow-Creatures, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally "made of one Blood" with us—with whom we are farther connected by Poſition and political Ties—and who are ſtill
<q>Strangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of Promiſe, having no Hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World?</q>
May it not be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expected, that ſome generous Efforts will be made, to furniſh them with the Means of rational and eternal Happineſs, of which moſt of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be intirely deſtitute? Eſpecially, may it not be expected, under the peculiar Advantages which the preſent Seaſon affords?</p>
               <p>The Providence of God, as has been obſerved, points out this general Duty, by the late Events, more plainly and expreſsly than ever. We never had, until this Time, ſo favourable an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for carrying forward this bleſſed Work. We never had it ſo much in our Power; and our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Gratitude were never ſo ſtrong. A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Dependance of the Natives upon us, is now eſtabliſhed; as they can have Recourſe to no other European Nation, without the utmoſt Difficulty, for the Supply of their Neceſſities. The Britiſh Standard is now erected in the Heart of their

Country; and a friendly Communication is opened with many Tribes and Nations, whoſe Names were unknown to us until very lately. The Influence of <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>French Miſſionaries</hi> ceaſes to operate in thoſe Regions, where formerly every Attempt made by a Proteſtant Nation to propagate the Goſpel, was ſure of being counteracted as effectually as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. In a Word, their Situation is now ſuch, that no Opportunity or Chance remains for their ever hearing ſo much as <hi>the Name</hi> of Chriſt, if they do not hear it from us.</p>
               <p>What Influence theſe Conſiderations may have upon <hi>our Politicians,</hi> one who is no Politician will not undertake to determine. But certainly they muſt deeply affect the Minds of all ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and, one would think, of rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent Deiſts, who profeſs a Regard for natural Religion—the great Doctrines and Duties of which, are generally corrupted and violated by the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Heathens, and will be moſt effectually reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſecured by the Propagation of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>After all, it may deſerve to be conſidered, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on the Principles of meer worldly Policy, ſome Pains and Expence prudently beſtowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Converſion of theſe Savages, would not turn to our Account? The nearer they are brought, in their Principles and Morals, to the Chriſtian Syſtem, the more they will reſemble Chriſtians in their Way of Life. The Principles of the Goſpel, and the Manners of Savages, cannot conſiſt with each other, for any conſiderable Time. The more they improve in Civil Life, the more uſeful they will be to us in the Way of Commerce—and the leſs we ſhall have to fear from their barbarous Cruelties, on any Occaſion.

               <p>But while the Propagation of the Goſpel amongſt the American Heathens has been altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, as a national Concern, many private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe eminent Abilities have been an Honour to the Nation—whoſe univerſal Benevolence has been as conſpicuous as their Abilities—and whoſe Activity has been equal to their Benevolence— have not neglected to exert themſelves, in Behalf of the general Intereſts of Chriſtianity. Can any Engliſhman, even at this Day, hear the Name of <hi>Boyle</hi> mentioned, without a very ſenſible Emotion of Pleaſure? This truly <hi>honourable</hi> and illuſtrious Perſon, amidſt his unwearied Application for the Improvement of religious and uſeful Knowledge at Home, found much Time and large Sums to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, for the Propagation of Chriſtian Knowledge, in different remote Parts of the Earth, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly amongſt the Natives of America.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, notwithſtanding they have been abuſed in this Country by many petulant Tongues, and ſome petulant Pens, on this Account, the Converſion of Heathens was not their <hi>primary</hi> and original Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (for if we read the Hiſtory of its Riſe, or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its Charter, which recites a particular Caſe only, and makes Proviſion for it, and may judge from thence, we ſhall find it as evident as Language can make it, that the Support and Propagation of the Goſpel amongſt our own People in America, was the immediate and principal Deſign of their Incorporation;) I ſay, this worthy Society, have moſt aſſiduouſly and vigorouſly attempted, ſo far as their more immediate Duty would admit of it,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010578_0042_0F86F0A25424CCA0"/>
the Converſion of the Indians in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of our Settlements.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, to ſuch as judge of their Deſign by miſtaking their <hi>Title,</hi> and are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the large Sums <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It has been given out, from Year to Year, by the Publiſhers of the <hi>Court Kalendar,</hi> that the annual Expence of this Society is about One Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds. It is aſtoniſhing that ſo groſs a Miſtake ſhould be once made—more ſo, that it ſhould continue to be ſo often repeated—and moſt of all, that it ſhould be adopted by Writers, from whoſe Accuracy better Things might be expected—eſpecially, as the Society never fails to publiſh yearly an exact Account of their Expences, and even to expreſs the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. This Miſrepreſentation may poſſibly have been owing to no unfriendly Intentions; but yet, as it may be ſuppoſed to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate widely, it muſt naturally have a bad Effect upon the Society, by preventing Benefactions. For ſome who beſtow Nothing, on the Suppoſition that the Society's annual Expence is but One Thouſand Five Hundred Pounds, would, in all Probability, give liberally, if they knew it amounted to near Five Thouſand Pounds, which is really the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>The Society was incorporated in 1701. In Ten Years Time their Expences aroſe to One Thouſand Eight Hundred and Forty-ſix Pounds, Ten Shillings, and One Penny, <hi>per Annum</hi>; a Sum conſiderably larger than the above-mentioned Compilers have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, even for the preſent Year. Their Expences have been gradually increaſing, from their firſt Inſtitution to the preſent Time. In 1740 their Expence was Three Thouſand Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Forty Pounds; and in 1765 they expended Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Seven Hundred and Eighty Pounds, Five Shillings, and Three Pence—of which Sum Four Thouſand One Hundred and Forty-four Pounds, Five Shillings, and Three Pence, was paid in Salaries to Miſſionaries, Catechiſts, &amp;c. and the Remainder was laid out in Books, Gratuities to Miſſionaries, and in defraying other inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Charges.</p>
                  </note> they have annually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in America for the Propagation of the Goſpel, that their Progreſs in the Converſion of Heathens has been ſo ſmall. But when it comes to be conſidered, that their Benefactors have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted them with their Donations, chiefly for other Purpoſes—and, that their Funds have never been ſufficient, to anſwer the Occaſions that have ariſen in their more immediate Department—it is rather to be wondered, that they have been able to make any Attempts at all of this Nature, than that they
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010578_0042_0F86F0A25424CCA0"/>
have done ſo little. And yet they have always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome Perſon in this Service; and I believe it may be truly ſaid, that they have never neglected any fair Opening to introduce the Goſpel amongſt the American Heathens, eſpecially if proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could be found, to engage in ſuch a Miſſion. But they can force none into this Service, which heretofore has been attended with great Danger, as well as Fatigue: they can only offer ſuch Salaries and Rewards by Way of Inducement, as they have Abilities to offer. However, they have not been altogether unſucceſsful in their Attempts. Several Hundreds, by Means of the Society, have been converted from Heatheniſm to the Chriſtian Faith, among whom ſome have been Ornaments to their new Profeſſion, and an inſtructive Example to thoſe who have had better Advantages. Yet ſtill it muſt be confeſſed, that the Succeſs has not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Pains that have been taken; and from the repeated Trials that have been made, as well as from other Evidence, it appears, that there muſt be ſome more effectual Way for the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Savages, than has been yet taken.</p>
               <p>As it was always known, that the living like Chriſtians with Reſpect to Religion, and like Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages with Reſpect to civil Life, could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in the ſame Perſons; it was hoped that the Converſion of Indians to the Chriſtian Religion, would naturally introduce amongſt them Civility of Manners—and this was reckoned among the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be expected from converting them. But it ſeems now to be generally agreed, that what was propoſed as a <hi>Conſequence,</hi> ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a <hi>neceſſary Means,</hi> of ſpreading the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel amongſt ſavage Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:010578_0043_0F86F0A312810B98"/>The Religion of the Goſpel was intended for Men and reaſonable Creatures, and not for Brutes, although in the Shape of Men. Until theſe Wretches therefore are, in ſome Degree, humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, there can be but little Proſpect of making them Chriſtians, to any laſting and valuable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>The Society,</hi> for a long Time, ſeem to have been growing ſenſible of this; but as another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod had been undertaken, it was proper that a full Trial ſhould be made of it.</p>
               <p>The venerable Dr. <hi>Bray,</hi> who has not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly been ſtiled <hi>the Father of the Society,</hi> and than whom, no Man ever more carefully conſidered Subjects of this Nature, and but few have had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opportunities of informing themſelves, was latterly of this Opinion. In his <hi>Memorial relating to the Converſion of the American Indians,</hi> addreſſed to the then Commiſſaries of <hi>Maryland,</hi> and the Reſt of the Clergy, he has the following Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>You muſt earneſtly endeavour to bring them off from a wandering and idle Life, to a ſettled and induſtrious Way of living; it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceive how any religious Impreſſions and Inſtructions ſhould be given them to any Purpoſe, or remain upon them in their wandering State. Nor was it ever known in Fact, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity did thrive among a rude and barbarous People, continuing in an unſettled and ſavage Way of living, as in the Nature of the Thing, it is impoſſible that it ſhould. And it is very remarkable, that as our Bleſſed Maſter came into the World when it had become moſt <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized</hi>; and where it was ſo, in a few Ages, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity overſpread the civilized Part of it: ſo upon the Inundation of wild and barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010578_0043_0F86F0A312810B98"/>
into the Roman Empire, true Chriſtianity did ſenſibly decline; and Satan, by his Deputy or Vicegerent <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> regained his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the greateſt Part of Chriſtendom, both in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts of the Empire.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Stebbing,</hi> a Perſon of diſtinguiſhed Abilities and Penetration, and a Member of the Society, in his anniverſary Sermon, delivers the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<q>Of a general Converſion of the native Indians, (ſays he) I ſee no great Likelihood at preſent. If this is to be done by human Means, there muſt be the neceſſary Preparations for human Means to operate. They muſt be poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed into good Manners—there muſt be ſome common Intercourſe between us—we muſt bring them to ſome good Liking of our Laws and Cuſtoms. All this is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> where the Power of Miracles is wanting; and <hi>when,</hi> and whether <hi>ever,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> will be done, God only knows.</q>
One of the grand Obſtacles the Doctor complained of, is now happily removed; the others will always continue, until we heartily engage in the Removal of them. I might avail myſelf of the Names of more illuſtrious Perſons now Living; but farther Authorities are needleſs in ſo plain a Caſe.</p>
               <p>It having then become a ſettled Point, that the moſt proper Way for converting Savages, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to inſtruct them in the Arts and Manners of civil Life, <hi>the Society</hi> has been, for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Time, carefully employed in collecting ſuch Information and Intelligence, relating to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as may enable them to form a proper Plan for civilizing the Natives of America, in Order to their becoming Chriſtians—in which great and good Work, they cannot doubt of meeting with all needful Encouragement. For this Purpoſe many
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010578_0044_0F86F0A3CC93D558"/>
Perſons in America have been particularly conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both Miſſionaries and others; and the Reſult already is, that they have come to a general Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to erect Schools, for teaching the Indian Children the Elements of Agriculture, and the moſt neceſſary mechanic Arts, together with civilized Manners—to be followed by proper Inſtruction in the Chriſtian Religion <note n="*" place="bottom">A School on much the ſame Plan has been eſtabliſhed for ſome Years in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> under the Direction of the worthy Mr. <hi>Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>; and its Beginnings are not unpromiſing.</note>. They have entered into Reſolutions for carrying into Execution a Scheme of this Nature, as ſoon as proper Places can be fixed for the Erection of ſuch Schools, and proper Perſons be found to engage in the Service—truſting in that good Providence to aſſiſt them in this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, which has ſo wonderfully ſupported them in the Proſecution of their original Work.</p>
               <p>But here a Number of Difficulties ariſe to retard their Progreſs. A Variety of Plans and Propoſals have been tranſmitted from this Country. The Perſons who have been conſulted, have their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prejudices and Attachments. The Things and Places which one repreſents as expedient, are condemned by another. And this muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity happen, where ſo many Perſons, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together, and without Opportunities of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting one another, are called upon to give their Opinion of a Caſe, like this, whereof moſt of them muſt be ſuppoſed to have but a partial Knowledge.</p>
               <p>To ballance and adjuſt ſo many different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Repreſentations, muſt be the Work of much Time and Care, and will of Courſe greatly retard the Execution of the general Plan. For one falſe Step taken in the Beginning, may in Time produce Conſequences that are pernicious and fatal.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010578_0044_0F86F0A3CC93D558"/>
But theſe Difficulties would vaniſh in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, under an American Epiſcopate. Suitable Places for the Erection of Indian Schools, might be ſpeedily aſcertained—proper Perſons to be intruſted with the immediate Care of them, might be found out and appointed—and when actually employed, the general Direction and Superintendency of a Biſhop reſiding near them, would not only give Spirit to the Work, but would moreover be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to <hi>unite</hi> ſo many Perſons, in different Parts of the Country, who are independent of each other, and to make them regular and uniform in their Endeavours to promote the ſame general Deſign.</p>
               <p>In a Syſtem of this Kind, where a Number of Powers and Movements are to be employed to one common Purpoſe, a regular and conſiſtent Direction of them is as requiſite, as of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent mechanical Powers, in a Watch or a Clock. And the nearer the ſuperintending Influence is, the better; for when it is preſent, if irregularities ariſe, they are ſoon corrected, and are never ſuffered long to continue. In other Caſes, where a Number of Perſons are employed in one general Work, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uniform Direction is allowed to be neceſſary; and why this particular Caſe ſhould be an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will not be eaſy to ſhew.</p>
               <p>The Neceſſity of one common Direction in the Caſe before us, will probably be granted; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome may think it may as well be carried on without an Epiſcopate. This is a Point which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome Examination. Although the general Direction of ſuch a Work muſt belong to <hi>the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> at Home, ſo long as it is carried on at the Expence of the Society; yet it will be highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that a Superintendent in this Country ſhould overſee the Whole, with a Power to regulate the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010578_0045_0F86F0A514E9C280"/>
Behaviour of all that are immediately employed in it, to hear Complaints, to redreſs Grievances, and to correct Abuſes; to whom Application may eaſily be made on all Emergencies.</p>
               <p>Now the Queſtion is, Whether a Biſhop would not be a more proper Perſon to be entruſted with this Superintendency, than any other? And if we conſider that the great End in View, is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and Propagation of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion—and that many Clergymen as well as others muſt be employed in the Service, there muſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear to be a peculiar Propriety in carrying on this Work, under the Direction of a Biſhop. Who can be ſo proper to conduct a Plan for the Propagation of the Goſpel, as one of that Order, to whom the Charge of the Goſpel was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally committed, and to whom a Bleſſing was expreſsly promiſed, in their Endeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it? Who ſo proper to govern Clergymen, as thoſe to whom the Government of them, together with that of the whole Church, was particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by its Divine Founder?</p>
               <p>If ſome of the Ends of this Superintendency might as well be anſwered, by putting it into Lay-Hands, yet others manifeſtly cannot. There muſt be frequent Occaſions for the Exerciſe of thoſe ſpiritual Powers, which are peculiar to the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Office; and it will be of great Conſequence to the Succeſs of the Work, whether Recourſe may be had to a Biſhop in ſuch Caſes eaſily and ſpeedily, or whether the Application muſt be made to one, at the Diſtance of more than a Thouſand Leagues.</p>
               <p>It ſhould alſo be conſidered, that ſuch a Station muſt neceſſarily require ſome Perſon of eminent Abilities and Influence, to fill it properly. And

although many ſuch, at this Time, are to be found amongſt the Laity; yet, where ſhall we find one thus qualified, who is not too deeply engaged in Affairs of another Nature, to devote himſelf to this in ſuch a Degree as will be neceſſary? If ſuch a one ſhould be ſent from Home for this Purpoſe, he muſt be ſupported agreeably to his Rank and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the Expence of which <hi>the Society</hi> can by no Means afford. Whereas if there was a Biſhop in America, this would be conſidered as Part of his Office; which he would therefore freely execute, without any Addition to the neceſſary Charges. Thoſe Perſons in this Country, who may be thought beſt qualified for ſuch a Truſt, I believe, are fully employed in other Matters already, and cannot be expected to relinquiſh them and engage in this, without a handſome Support.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir William Johnſon,</hi> who, by his long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in, and careful Attention to, Indian Affairs, is probably beſt qualified for this Direction, and is undoubtedly the beſt Judge of theſe Matters in America, has, on this Occaſion, been particularly conſulted by <hi>the Society,</hi> whereof he is a Member, and by ſome in this Country. The Opinion of the Matter, which muſt always carry the greateſt Weight, is, that an American Epiſcopate will greatly facilitate the Converſion of the Indians, upon any Plan that ſhall be followed. He declares his Readineſs to aſſiſt and co-operate with a Biſhop in ſo good a Work, but ſays nothing of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking it as Principal, as the political Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Indian Affairs, with which he is inveſted by the Government, already affords him ſufficient Employment.</p>
               <p>What then remains to be done? Shall <hi>the Society,</hi> at an Expence which will in a great Meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable

them to purſue their Plan, be obliged to ſupport a Lay-Superintendent, who, at the ſame Time, will be unable to anſwer all the Purpoſes of ſuch an Office? Or, will an Opportunity be granted them, of putting the Management of this important Affair into the Hands of an American Biſhop—who can more properly and effectually execute the Office, and without any additional Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence? If a Chriſtian Nation does not think fit to undertake this Work <hi>immediately,</hi> a Work which will probably be attended with many political Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; yet ſurely it cannot refuſe to give all due Countenance and needful Encouragement, to ſuch benevolent Chriſtians and worthy Patriots, as are willing and deſirous to undertake it—eſpecially when this can be done, without burthening the Public.</p>

               <p>THE Deſign of what has been offered in the foregoing Section,<note place="margin">SECT. VIII.</note> is to ſhew—That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel amongſt thoſe who are Strangers to it, is a Duty incumbent upon every Chriſtian Nation, as they have Opportunity:— That the Engliſh Nation in particular has, at this Time, a much better Opportunity, for converting to the Chriſtian Faith the Heathen Nations on the Borders of our Settlements, than has heretofore offered, and that the Obligations of Gratitude to perform this Duty are ſtronger, and the Providence of God points it out more plainly, than ever:— That the commercial and political Advantages to be expected from ſuch a Converſion, if it can be effected, are a ſtrong Argument for attempting it, on the meer Principles of worldly Policy:—That the true Method to be taken for the Converſion of Savages, is by previouſly teaching them the Arts and Manners of civil Life, in order to which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Schools in different Parts of the Country are neceſſary:—That <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> not waiting to ſee what the Nation will attempt, have, on theſe Principles, formed a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plan for the Erection of Indian Schools, with a Deſign to put it in Execution, as ſoon, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively, as poſſible:—And that in Order thereto, it is reaſonable to think, that an American Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate

will be moſt eminently uſeful, and indeed that the Work cannot be properly conducted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. From theſe Conſiderations it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that every Friend, not only to the Church of England, but to Chriſtianity in general, ought moſt earneſtly to deſire the Settlement of Biſhops in America, on <hi>this Account,</hi> and to uſe his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for obtaining it.</p>
               <p>The Reaſons which have been offered in Favour of an American Epiſcopate, appear to us to be of that real Weight and Importance as to deſerve, and we humbly hope that they will obtain, the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Superiors; and if they are duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we are unable to conceive that they can fail of producing the deſired Effect, under ſo mild and equal a Syſtem of Government.</p>
               <p>The Principles of Liberty, Juſtice and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, are the main Pillars that ſupport the fair Fabrick of the Britiſh Conſtitution. It is the Glory of Britiſh Subjects, that they enjoy as much Happineſs and Freedom as is conſiſtent with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and infinitely more than is conſiſtent with the Want of Government—and that their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties are ſecured by Laws that have been made by, and cannot be ſuſpended or repealed without the Conſent of, thoſe whom they have choſen to act as their Repreſentatives. No undue Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over ſome can legally be claimed by others; and for every Act of Injuſtice or Oppreſſion, a ſure Remedy is provided. Proviſion has been carefully made, that all may have full Enjoyment both of civil and religious Liberty; and ſo free and equitable an Execution of the Powers of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eſtabliſhed, that no Body of Subjects, not an Individual, can juſtly complain of any Suffering or Grievance, without Confidence of Redreſs.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010578_0047_0F86F0A60C207E00"/>
Such is the happy Tendency of our Conſtitution, and we truſt that our preſent Rulers have a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to act, in all Caſes, agreeably to the Genius and Spirit of it.</p>
               <p>Will not then the Complaints of near a Million of Britiſh Subjects in America, of unimpeached Loyalty and Fidelity, who are ſuffering under the moſt unprecedented Hardſhips with Regard to their Religion, an Intereſt dearer than Property and more invaluable than civil Liberty, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and procure the Redreſs of ſo intolerable a Grievance? When an impartial Tenderneſs and Care for the religious Rights of all, is the profeſſed Principle of the Adminiſtration, as well as of our Legiſlature, is it not abſurd, and injurious, and ungrateful, to entertain any Suſpicions, that ſo large a Number of Subjects will be treated with a cruel Partiality?—of ſuch Subjects eſpecially, as have ever been dutiful and faithful, and who ſtand in a peculiar Connection with, and Relation to, the national Body? Can it be imagined that ſo groſs a Partiality againſt the national Religion, may ever be juſtly imputed to the Britiſh Nation, as no other Nation upon Earth was ever guilty of? For no
<q>Nation has ever treated their Gods, which are no Gods,</q>
in ſuch a Manner, as this Imputation would charge a Chriſtian and Proteſtant Nation with treating the great Sovereign of the World.</p>
               <p>As therefore we cannot but hope that the Voice of ſo many Petitioners will be heard, and that ſo reaſonable a Requeſt will be granted; ſo we cannot but flatter ourſelves that it will be granted <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> and that no unneceſſary Delays will prevent its good Effect. The Reaſons which have been aſſigned for granting us an Epiſcopate, are now in full
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010578_0048_0F86F0A6DD4ACF50"/>
Force, and ſtronger than ever; and if they require it at all, they require it <hi>immediately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not apprehended that any Difficulties can attend the Execution of this Plan at the preſent Time, which will not always continue; and ſome peculiar Motives and Advantages now concur to favour it, which probably no future Period will afford. If then our Application fails of Succeſs now, we ſhall deſpair of it hereafter; and—we want Language to expreſs the ill Conſequences we fear from ſuch a Diſappointment.</p>
               <p>What has been ſaid implies not an Opinion, that there are at this Time <hi>no</hi> Difficulties in the Way, but only that there are no Difficulties but ſuch as muſt be always expected. We are very ſenſible that a Work of this Nature will have many to oppoſe it. Some will oppoſe it from an Enmity to all Religion. Others will oppoſe it from an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, either open or ſecret, to the <hi>Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; of which the Church of England is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly the ſtrongeſt Barrier againſt Popery. There are others again who heretofore have oppoſed it, from an Apprehenſion, that either the Property or religious Liberty of their Friends might be affected by it; as it was not ſo well known, with what Powers and with what Views it had been requeſted that Biſhops might be ſent to us. But this has been ſo often and explicitly mentioned of late, that it can hardly be ſuppoſed, that any Perſons of Power and Influence can remain ignorant of our true Plan.</p>
               <p>However, for the Sake of others, and of ſuch as miſtake it, it may be proper, in a Work of this Nature, to make the following Declaration to the Public, (and I appeal to every Reader, who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

with the Matter, for the Truth of it) that it has been long ſettled by our Friends and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors at Home, and the Clergy of this Country have often ſignified their entire Approbation and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence therein—<hi>That the Biſhops to be ſent to America, ſhall have no Authority, but purely of a Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Nature, ſuch as is derived altogether from the Church and not from the State— That this Authority ſhall operate only upon the Clergy of the Church, and not upon the Laiety, nor Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of any Denomination—That the Biſhops ſhall not interfere with the Property or Privileges, whether civil or religious, of Churchmen or Diſſenters—That, in particular, they ſhall have no Concern with the Probate of Wills, Letters of Guardianſhip and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, or Marriage-Licences, nor be Judges of any Caſes relating thereto—But, that they ſhall only exerciſe the original Powers of their Office as before ſtated,</hi> i. e. <hi>ordain and govern the Clergy, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter Confirmation to thoſe who ſhall deſire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, without any Reſervation or Equivocation, is the exact Plan of an American Epiſcopate which has been ſettled at Home; and it is the only one, on which Biſhops have been requeſted here, either in our general or more particular Addreſſes. And ſo far is it from being our Deſire to moleſt the Diſſenters, or any Denominations of Chriſtians, in the Enjoyment of their preſent religious Privileges, that we have carefully conſulted their Safety and Security, and ſtudied not to injure, but oblige them.</p>
               <p>Many may have received different Accounts of our Deſigns, and of our Conduct; but ſuch as have not proceeded from Ignorance, muſt have been the Effect of Maliciouſneſs. When Biſhops were firſt propoſed and requeſted for this Country, they were
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010578_0049_0F86F0A88AD32228"/>
mentioned under the Title of <hi>Suffragans.</hi> This is no ambiguous Term; it has a fixed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Meaning in the Laws of England, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be miſtaken. Suffragan Biſhops are the ſame with thoſe that were called <hi>Chorepiſcopi,</hi> or Biſhops of the Country, in the primitive Church; and it is their Buſineſs to diſcharge all Offices <hi>merely</hi> Epiſcopal, in the remote Parts of the Dioceſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they reſide, according to the Direction of, and by Virtue of a Commiſſion from, the Dioceſan <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dr. Grey's</hi> Syſtem of Engliſh Eccleſiaſtical Law.</note>. And ſince the Term has been omitted, ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations have attended our Petitions for Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Biſhops, that I know not of a ſingle Inſtance, wherein Reaſon has been given to ſuſpect, that a Departure from the ſame general Plan has been aimed at or deſired. And of this I am <hi>certain,</hi> that all our Addreſſes from this and ſeveral of the neighbouring Colonies, for many years, have had one conſiſtent and unvaried Tenor, agreeable to the preceding Explanation.</p>
               <p>What Weight will be allowed to theſe Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Author knows not; but the Authority of the following Declaration to the ſame Purpoſe, contained in <hi>an Anſwer to Dr. Mayhew's Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> cannot fairly be diſputed; as the Author of it, ſuppoſed to be a very high Dignitary in the Church, manifeſtly diſcovers that he is perfectly acquainted with the Affairs of <hi>the Society,</hi> and of the Church in America. Speaking of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the latter, he ſays: <q>It is deſired, that Two or more Biſhops may be appointed for them, to reſide where his Majeſty ſhall think moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; that they may have no Concern in the leaſt with any Perſons who do not profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

               <p>Now what reaſonable Objections can be offered againſt ſuch a Plan as this, which is ſo univerſally harmleſs in every Reſpect, that none can be injured by it; and ſo uſeful withal, that near a Million of Perſons will receive Benefit, and perhaps the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of many Souls will be effected, by its being put in Execution? Can any Thing be promoted by it, but the Good of the Church? Can any Thing then be objected againſt it, but that this End will be promoted? But will any dare, in this Age of Britiſh Freedom and improved Liberty, to avow the Objection? Would not ſuch a barefaced At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thus wantonly to oppreſs us, and to prevent our Enjoyment of thoſe invaluable Rights, to which we are equally intitled with others—which there is no Pretence that we have ever forfeited— and no Appearance of a Diſpoſition to abuſe—

rouſe the Indignation and Reſentment of all the Friends of religious Liberty and Toleration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churchman or Diſſenters?</p>
               <p>Every Oppoſition to ſuch a Plan, has the Nature of Perſecution, and deſerves the Name. For to puniſh us for our religious Principles, when no Reaſons of State require it, is Perſecution in its ſtricteſt and propereſt Senſe. Will it be ſaid, that the Prevention of an Epiſcopate in America, is no Puniſhment? It may as well be ſaid, that keeping a Man out of his Right is no Injuſtice. Whatever Evil is inflicted on us on account of our Principles or Practices, is properly Puniſhment; and every Good we are deprived of, is equivalent to an Evil inflicted. Wherever therefore an Evil is inflicted, or we are deprived of a Good, on account of our Religion, unleſs it be neceſſary for the Security of the Public, we ſuffer Perſecution.</p>
               <p>As ſuch Treatment has the very Eſſence of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, ſo it can have its Source only in an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerant perſecuting Diſpoſition. And it is not to be doubted but a Diſpoſition that will produce thus much, if armed with Power, would be productive of more—and that they, who only endeavour now to prevent our Enjoyment of thoſe Advantages, to which we are intitled by the Laws of God and the Conſtitution, would bring us, if they could, to the Stake or the Gibbet. But what an Abomination is ſuch a Diſpoſition and Behaviour, in the Eyes of every true Engliſhman, of every true Proteſtant! What an Indignity and Affront to the Nation, to deſire it to countenance ſuch Injuſtice and Cruelty!</p>
               <p>It is hard to believe that any Proteſtants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that any Engliſh Diſſenters, who have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, for a Century paſt, been warm Advocates for

religious Liberty, and who are greatly indebted to a Toleration themſelves, can be ſo inconſiſtent, as to wiſh this Harm to the Members of the national Church. It would be a very ungrateful Return, for the moſt ample, compleat and generous Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is this Day to be found upon Earth. Many of the moſt ſenſible Men belonging to that Body, have expreſſed, on this Subject, Sentiments that are candid and liberal; and he who was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered in ſome Senſe as their Head <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Samuel Chlandler.</note>, when our Plan was explained to him, and his Opinion thereupon was deſired, did not heſitate to declare his free Conſent to, and Approbation of, American Biſhops, in the Manner that we requeſt them.</p>
               <p>The Principles of religious Liberty profeſſed by the Diſſenters, muſt not only reſtrain them from oppoſing an American Epiſcopate, as now ſettled and explained, but oblige them, if they would act conſiſtently, even to <hi>befriend</hi> it. Some of them, I am fully perſuaded, would freely join with us in our Applications for Biſhops, it their Aſſiſtance was needed, as we ſhould be ready to aſſiſt them, in Caſe of the like Grievances; and all of them will really have a much worſe Opinion of the Church of England in general, or of thoſe who belong to it, as probably their Reproaches on future Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will teſtify, if this Matter ſhould not be brought to a ſpeedy and happy Termination. For certainly nothing can more degrade our national Religion, in the Eyes of Diſſenters and others, both Proteſtants and Papiſts, at Home and abroad, than to ſee that it is in ſo ſmall Eſtimation, and its Intereſt ſo little regarded, by thoſe who profeſs it.</p>
               <p>For, wherever Men are indifferent towards the Religion they profeſs, one of theſe Concluſions

will neceſſarily be made, and there is no preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it—either that their Religion, upon a more intimate Acquaintance, appears to be unworthy of their Eſteem and Affection—or, that its Profeſſors are of an irreligious Character, and have no Regard for that which is the moſt invaluable of all Things. And in either Caſe, the Reputation of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will greatly ſuffer.</p>
               <p>At the Time of writing this, caſting my Eyes upon the <hi>Public Paper</hi> of the Day, I was ſtruck with the following Paragraph, ſaid to be an Anſwer from the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to the Empreſs of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who had interpoſed with that Monarch, in Behalf of his Proteſtant Subjects.
<q>I have not forgot the Obligations I am under to the Empreſs of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, among the Means which God Almighty made Uſe of to raiſe me to the Throne: but when I came to it, I promiſed the exact Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my Religion throughout my Kingdom. If I was weak enough to abandon it, my Life and my Throne would be expoſed to the juſt Reſentment of my Subjects. I am threatened with forcible Means to oblige me to do what is aſked of me, which would reduce me to an Extremity equally unhappy. I perceive ſome Danger in whatever Reſolution I may take; but I had rather be expoſed to ſuch as my <hi>Duty and Honour</hi> induce me to make Choice of; and from this Time I join with my Country in Defence of our holy Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the Suppoſition, that the Propoſals, made by her Ruſſian Majeſty to the King of Poland, were believed to be inconſiſtent with the Safety of the national Religion, there is Something ſo ſenſible, ſpirited and open in this Declaration, that every candid and conſiſtent Proteſtant muſt applaud it,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010578_0051_0F86F0AA75101B40"/>
at the ſame Time that he condemns the eſtabliſhed Religion of Poland. Popery is a groſs Corruption of the Chriſtian Religion, and it has been wrought up to its preſent State, by the Application and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of many Ages. It preſents to us, not the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and undefiled Religion of the Goſpel, but under the Name of it, an intolerant Syſtem, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Superſtition, Abſurdity, and I know not what; and it manifeſtly appears to be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſt of Mankind, to endeavour, in the Uſe of all proper and fair Means, to reform it. But although this appears to be ſo evident to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, there are undoubtedly others, to whom it does not appear at all, and who believe the contrary.</p>
               <p>As the King of Poland has ſolemnly bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Oath, to maintain and defend the Popiſh Religion, we muſt charitably ſuppoſe that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it to be true. And as he believes it to be true, and has ſworn to maintain it, he cannot give it up, he cannot neglect it, without betraying his <hi>Duty and Honour,</hi> in the Opinion of all reaſonable and unprejudiced Perſons. If therefore the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and others, who are ſenſible of the Abſurdities and Corruptions of the Popiſh Religion, cannot but commend this firm Adherence to it in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Majeſty, ſo long as he believes it to be the true Religion; ſurely they muſt at leaſt equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the like Conduct, with Regard to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion, in Proteſtant Princes—more eſpecially, when the Security of the eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a Toleration of thoſe who peaceably diſſent from it, are allowed to be conſiſtent.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Public Paper we are told, that the Courts of <hi>London, Berlin</hi> and <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> have agreed to aſſiſt and co-operate with the Ruſſian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, in Favour of the Proteſtants in Poland. It
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:010578_0052_0F86F0AA89EDC750"/>
muſt give Pleaſure to every conſiderate Proteſtant, to hear of ſo generous an Effort to be made, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be made properly, in Behalf of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion; and we cannot but earneſtly wiſh it Succeſs. But could it be conceived, that thoſe Powers who are thus active for the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in foreign Countries, would neglect to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it in their own proper Dominions, their Zeal for it abroad would be eſteemed but little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than political Grimace. And on this Principle our Engliſh Diſſenters would have a much better Opinion of the Church of England, and of our Superiors who are Members of it, if, while they warmly intereſt themſelves in Favour of Proteſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in Poland, they do not inconſiſtently neglect, what they profeſs to eſteem the pureſt Species of it, in our own Colonies. A true Regard for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion is not confined to particular Places: it will produce vigorous Endeavours to improve and ſecure it, and to render it as reſpectable as we can, in all Places; and eſpecially in thoſe Places, wherewith we are moſt cloſely connected, and wherein our Power and Influence are greateſt.</p>

               <p>SHOULD it be pretended,<note place="margin">SECT. IX.</note> that what appears to be ſo reaſonable in itſelf as an American Epiſcopate, and ſo becoming the Honour and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Britiſh Nation to grant, would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of much Clamour and Diſcontent in the Colonies, and, on that Account, that ſound Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy forbids it; it would be an ill-grounded Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
               <p>It may deſerve Conſideration, whether <hi>any</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs that can be imagined, ſo deſtitute of a proper Foundation to ſupport it, that can ariſe-from the Proſpect of Biſhops in America, ſent only to take Care of the Church, in the Manner explained, can in Reaſon and Policy juſtify the Refuſal of what is ſo eſſentially needed. Every reaſonable Objection of others ought to be conſidered; but thoſe which are evidently perverſe and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, eſpecially after due Care has been taken to make that Unreaſonableneſs and Perverſeneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, deſerve not to be regarded—much leſs to be regarded in ſuch a Manner, as to ſacrifice thereto the Intereſt and very Being of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in America. But if the Uneaſineſs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans be of ſuch Conſequence, why the Uneaſineſs of the Members and Friends of the Church, ſo juſtly founded in Caſe of a Refuſal, deſerves not to be conſidered, as much as the Uneaſineſs of its Enemies without any Foundation, will be difficult to ſhew.</p>

We humbly apply to our Superiors—we call even upon our Enemies—we appeal to the World—for a Deciſion of this Point.</p>
               <p>Theſe Things have been hinted as worthy of Conſideration, even on the Suppoſition that ſending Biſhops to America could be really attended with Diſcontent and Uneaſineſs in Diſſenters and others. But of any conſiderable Diſcontent or Uneaſineſs, there is no Reaſon to be apprehenſive. Whatever Notions the Diſſenters in this Country may have formerly entertained, concerning the Church; yet of late Years they have greatly come off from their Prejudices, and Sentiments of Candour, Charity and Moderation have viſibly taken Place. And, excepting here and there a hot-headed Writer, or a pragmatical Enthuſiaſt, ſome of whom are to be found in all Communions, who expect to find their Account in raiſing a Combuſtion and being noiſy, we would hope of the Diſſenters in America, that they bear no Ill-Will to the Church, and deſire

nothing more than Security in the Enjoyment of their preſent Advantages.</p>
               <p>Indeed in the Time of the late Diſturbances oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> it was aſſerted in ſome of the <hi>London Papers,</hi> that the Fear of Biſhops being ſent into America, was the principal Cauſe of that Uneaſineſs and Clamour, which raiſed ſuch a Flame in this Country. Every one here knew the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a vile and malicious Repreſentation of the Caſe; and whoever could believe it to be true, muſt have previouſly conceived of the Americans, as being of all Creatures the moſt wretchedly ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid. The Diſcontent of that Time, aroſe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from another Quarter. It was by no Means peculiar to the Rejecters of Epiſcopacy, nor had any Relation to it; but proceeded from what the Americans generally eſteemed, and complained of, as an <hi>unconſtitutional oppreſſive Act.</hi> I appeal to all the Remonſtrances of thoſe unhappy Times—to all that was publiſhed here, either in Pamphlets or periodical Papers, whether the Fear of an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate was <hi>once</hi> aſſigned as a Reaſon for the public Uneaſineſs. And I appeal to every American, whether there now is, or ever has been any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Noiſe or public Clamour on this Account. For myſelf, I can truly declare, that I have not heard of any, nor do I forſee any.</p>
               <p>Of the Inhabitants of this Country, a full third Part belong to the Church, and a conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of others are profeſſed Epiſcopalians; and none of theſe can be ſuppoſed conſiſtently to have an Averſion to Biſhops. Of the Engliſh Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a very large and reſpectable Body are the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>; who entertain a particular Friendſhip and Reſpect for the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and have given many ſubſtantial Proofs of it.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:010578_0054_0F86F0AEEFFE1E18"/>
The Affair of Biſhops has been mentioned and explained to many of them, and they appear to have no Diſpoſition to be jealous or uneaſy on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their coming.</p>
               <p>And as to Diſſenters of other Denominations, the Subject has been propoſed to ſome of the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them, who have, with great Candour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that as ſuch an Epiſcopate as has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, could have no ill Effect upon any, they had no Objections to offer. Nay ſome have even been ſo generous, as to endeavour to undeceive their more ignorant and illiberal Brethren, if the Author of theſe Papers has not been miſinformed. And even amongſt the moſt prejudiced, it is hoped that but few can be found, who would not think themſelves injured by any Suſpicions of their having ſuch an Antipathy to Biſhops, that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to breathe the ſame Air, or to live in the ſame Country, with them. Time perhaps was when this might be truly ſaid of ſome of them; but the preſent Age has, in this Reſpect, mended greatly on all Sides, in this, as well as in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Country.</p>
               <p>The Diſſenters in England find that they can live happily with Biſhops, even where their Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is complete—where it extends to all Perſons —and where it is ſupported by all the Strength of the civil Power. The Engliſh Biſhops have, for a long Courſe of Years, exerciſed their Authority with ſo much Mildneſs, Tenderneſs and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſcarcely to have afforded an Inſtance of reaſonable Complaint, eſpecially to Diſſenters; and many of the latter have been ſo generous as to confeſs it. The late Dr. <hi>George Benſon,</hi> a very learned Diſſenter, did not ſcruple to make the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Declaration. <q>The Church of England,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010578_0054_0F86F0AEEFFE1E18"/>
with its preſent Candour, Spirit of Toleration and Charity, appears to me, to be the beſt Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment on the Face of the Earth <note n="*" place="bottom">In his <hi>Life of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as quoted by the <hi>Monthly Reviewers.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Authors of the <hi>Monthly Review,</hi> than whom none can be warmer Advocates for every Species of religious Liberty and Indulgence, ſay, with particular Reference to our very Subject:
<q>Whatever formidable Ideas of Epiſcopacy, thoſe Diſſenters that fled into America, might carry along with them, and tranſmit to their Poſterity, we can ſafely aver, that Epiſcopal Power, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that it was oppreſſive formerly, is not ſo now: and that Diſſenters at Home have no Reaſon to conceive any Terror of it <note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. XXX. Page 285.</note>.</q> If then the Diſſenters in England, who live under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Juriſdiction and Government of an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate, find no Reaſon to complain or <q>to conceive any Terror of it;</q> ſurely in America they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have Reaſon to be terrified at the Proſpect of the ſame Epiſcopate—eſpecially as they will not be under the Juriſdiction and Government thereof in any Reſpect.</p>
               <p>As all Power is liable to be abuſed, and ſome Defects muſt be expected in the beſt-regulated Government in this World, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil; it is not denied but there have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſome Inſtances, wherein the Power of our Biſhops has been ſtrained too high. But theſe may be conſidered rather as the Fault of the Times, in which neither the natural Rights of Men, nor the religious Rights of Chriſtians, were ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and underſtood, as in the preſent Age. And even <hi>then,</hi> the Spirit of the Church of England like
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:010578_0055_0F86F0B038771400"/>
that of the Goſpel, was more
<q>peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be entreated,</q>
than that of any other national Church; and the Engliſh Biſhops, to whom it was greatly owing, were treated with particular Reſpect on that Account. In what Light the moſt eminent Reformers and foreign Proteſtants have always conſidered them and the Engliſh Prelacy, may be ſeen in <hi>The French Church's Apology for the Church of England</hi>

               <p>In the mean Time, I beg Leave to produce two ſhort Extracts from that Work. The firſt ſhall be from a Declaration of the celebrated <hi>Peter du Moulin,</hi> an eminent Profeſſor of the French Church in the Beginning of the laſt Century, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words:
<q>I know that under Pretence that the Church of England hath another Form of Diſcipline than ours is, our Adverſaries (the Papiſts) charge us that our Religion is divers. But Experience confuteth this Accuſation.— The moſt excellent Servants of God in our Churches, <hi>Peter Martyr, Calvin, Zanchius, Beza,</hi> &amp;c. have often written Letters full of Reſpect and Amity to the Prelates of England.—Our Adverſaries unjuſtly accuſe us to be Enemies of the Epiſcopal Order.</q>
The other Extract ſhall be from the Words of <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf.
<q>Give us ſuch a Hierarchy (ſays he) in which <hi>Biſhops preſide,</hi> who are ſubject to Chriſt and to him alone (not to the Pope) as their only Head; and then I will own no Curſe too bad for him that ſhall not pay the utmoſt Reſpect and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to ſuch an Hierarchy as that.</q>
And what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays in general of ſuch an Hierarchy

as ours, <hi>Beza</hi> and the moſt illuſtrious foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have particularly applied to the Church of England.</p>
               <p>If then <hi>Calvin</hi> and the moſt celebrated foreign Proteſtants, were of Opinion, <hi>in former Times,</hi> that the Diſſenters in England ought peaceably to <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> to the Government of our Biſhops: ſurely the Diſſenters in America <hi>now,</hi> when the Engliſh Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government is ſo much milder than hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will not oppoſe the very Exiſtence of Biſhops in the ſame Country with themſelves—eſpecially as no Obedience or Submiſſion at all from them is required or expected. But, as was ſaid before, I take not this to be the preſent Diſpoſition of Diſſenters in America, and believe that they would reſent the Imputation of it as a groſs Affront. They have acquired the ſame liberal Turn in their Sentiments and Manners, with the Diſſenters at Home; and provided there be no Invaſion of their Privileges and Rights, they can live as quietly and peaceably with their Neighbours, although diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Principles, and even with Biſhops, as their Brethren can in any other Part of the World.</p>
               <p>Some of them indeed formerly have had an Averſion to the Idea of Biſhops in America, on the Suppoſition that they muſt become ſubject to their Authority. But the Plan which is now fixed, muſt effectually obviate all their Objections and diſſipate their Fears. As the Biſhops propoſed will have no Power over them, or Concern with them, there can be nothing to alarm them. <hi>Our</hi> Ordinations cannot hurt them; any more than <hi>their</hi> Ordinations can injure us. They can have no more Reaſon to complain of Confirmation, or of any other Epiſcopal Office performed in our Churches by Biſhops, than they now have to complain, that
<pb n="94"

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
Preaching and the common Adminiſtration of the Sacraments are practiced in them by Preſbyters. And as to ſuch Diſcipline and Government as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be exerciſed under an Epiſcopate, they will have no Reaſons to be diſſatisfied therewith; any more than we now have to be diſſatisfied with the Diſcipline exerciſed by them—but on the other Hand, they will have many Reaſons to be pleaſed with it.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral Things in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in America, owing to the Want of a proper Superintendency and Government, with which they ſay they are offended; and the Removal of Offences will naturally give them Pleaſure. Sometimes they have been grieved, at ſeeing the ill Behaviour of a Clergyman in the Orders of our Church; but by the Settlement of American Biſhops, a Remedy will be provided for this Diſorder. Sometimes they have lamented, that the Biſhops at Home, and <hi>the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel,</hi> have been impoſed upon by falſe Accounts tranſmitted from hence by our American Clergy, (whether with or without juſt and ſufficient Reaſons, I will not ſtop to enquire); but under an Epiſcopate, they muſt be ſenſible that there can be no Opportunity for any groſs Impoſitions of this Nature. Sometimes, again, Complaints have been made, that, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this falſe Information, Miſſions have been erected in improper Places, and the Society's Bounty has been miſapplied; but of all ſuch Caſes Biſhops in this Country will be competent Judges, and no Perverſion or Abuſe of the Society's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will be ſuffered to continue. Some of them have ſignified that it would give them the utmoſt Pleaſure, to ſee more vigorous Efforts made by <hi>the Society,</hi> for propagating the Goſpel amongſt the
<pb n="95"
                      facs="unknown:010578_0056_0F86F0B0FAB8AB48"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
Heathens on our Borders: This Pleaſure the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety intends to afford them, as ſoon as Biſhops ſhall be ſettled in America, without which this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Work cannot be conducted properly—and this is one Reaſon why an Epiſcopate has been ſo earneſtly requeſted. I might inſtance in many other Particulars to the ſame Purpoſe, but theſe are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew, that an American Epiſcopate will probably produce many Effects that will be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Diſſenters. And as the Laws of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity and Benevolence oblige them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, for our Sake; ſo they may be ſuppoſed, very conſiſtently, to deſire it alſo for their own.</p>
               <p>If our American Biſhops are to have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over Diſſenters, nor indeed to exerciſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline over our own People, the Clergy excepted; then the frightful Objection of <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely vaniſhes. For if no Authority of this Kind will be claimed or exerciſed by them, we may be ſure that no Courts will be erected for the Exerciſe of it.</p>
               <p>What Foundation there is for Complaint of the Spiritual Courts in England, I know not. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may have uſed too great Severity in ſome particular Inſtances. But this Complaint is not infrequently made, of our common Courts of Juſtice. Cruelty and Severity is by no Means the Character of the Engliſh Biſhops, nor is it connected with the Exerciſe of their Authority, more than with that of the civil Magiſtrate: and in all Courts, whether Eccleſiaſtical or others, where an Injury is ſuffered, the Laws of England have provided a Remedy.</p>
               <p>If ſome of the Laws which relate to theſe Courts, are imagined to bear hard upon Britiſh Liberty,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:010578_0057_0F86F0B1527DB808"/>
this, by the Way, is not neceſſarily to be conſidered as the Fault of the Biſhops—it ought to be charged to the Account of the Legiſlature in general, and not of a particular Branch of it. But be this as it may, it is probable that theſe, and all other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Laws, as well as our Liturgy and public Offices, and our Tranſlation of the Bible, will be reviewed, as ſoon as it ſhall be thought that there is good Senſe and Candour enough in the Body of the Nation to admit of it.</p>
               <p>Some undoubtedly blame theſe Courts, becauſe they find themſelves puniſhed therein for Actions, of which other Courts at preſent take no Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance. But ſuch Perſons do not conſider, that if Spiritual Courts were aboliſhed, thoſe Actions which are proſecuted and brought to Trial there only, would many of them be made puniſhable in other Courts, as they were before the <hi>Norman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi>; ſince they are eſteemed by the Legiſlature of the Nation to be inconſiſtent with the public Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, I may venture to aſſert, that the Spiritual Courts at Home, with all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, are an advantage to the Public; and that the Annihilation of them would be no Benefit to thoſe Individuals, who make the loudeſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of them. But whether they are uſeful or hurtful, and whether the Averſion to them in this Country be rightly founded or not; as it is certain that they will never be eſtabliſhed here, they cannot with Propriety be made an Objection againſt an Epiſcopate.</p>

               <p>AS to <hi>Tithes,</hi> of which many Americans have had formidable Apprehenſions, there could be no Reaſon to fear the Payment of them here, even ſhould the Authority of our Biſhops be as full and extenſive as it is in England; and it is owing altogether to Ignorance and Miſapprehenſion, that People here have ever given themſelves Uneaſineſs on that Account. As perhaps no Prejudice has taken deeper Root or extended wider in America than this, and as it ſtill continues to prevail in the Minds of many well-meaning but miſtaken People; ſome Pains taken to undeceive them, and to place this Subject in its true Light, will not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the friendly Reader.</p>
               <p>Tithes cannot be demanded by Biſhops in this Country, becauſe there are none belonging to the Church: they are demanded in England, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are due to the Church. They are due to the Church there, becauſe they have been freely given to it, by the ancient Proprietors of the Lands; and the Laws relating to them do not <hi>convey</hi> them to the Church, but make them recoverable as its Property, to which it had a previous and compleat Right. This Right was veſted in the Church by King <hi>Ethelwulph,</hi> with the Conſent of his Barons, in the Year 854. At this Time all the Lands in England were properly the Kings <hi>Demeſne,</hi> and he

had as good a Right to diſpoſe of any Part of them in this Manner, as any Proprietor or Owner of Lands in this Country has, to diſpoſe of them to ſuch Perſons and for ſuch Purpoſes as he thinks proper. Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Littleton's Tenures</hi>

               <p>Afterwards, when a Diſtribution was made of the Lands to the <hi>Barons</hi> for the Defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they received them under this Incumbrance; and by Conveyance and Deſcent they have come down into the Hands of their preſent Poſſeſſors, thus incumbered, <hi>i. e.</hi> Nine Parts as private Property, and the Tenth Part as, through all Changes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church. When therefore the Tithe is paid to the Church, the Church only receives its own, and what never did, nor can rightfully, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Perſon who pays it.</p>
               <p>To make the Nature of Tithes appear plainer if poſſible, let us conſider them in their moſt ſimple and original State, before any Alteration was introduced by <hi>Impropriations, Modus's,</hi> &amp;c. And here let us ſuppoſe two Eſtates of equal Value, each to be really worth One Thouſand Pounds, but one free from Tithes, the other titheable. If theſe two Eſtates were to be ſold, the Price of the firſt would be its
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:010578_0059_0F86F0B2CB877250"/>
full Value One Thouſand Pounds, while that of the other would be abated, in Proportion to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumberance. Or ſuppoſing theſe two Eſtates to be <hi>leaſed</hi> at an annual Rent; in this Caſe, if the former is rented at Fifty Pounds per Annum, the latter will be rated at Forty-five Pounds only, to be paid to the Landlord, the remaining Tenth Part being due and payable to the Church.</p>
               <p>From theſe ſuppoſed Caſes the Nature of Tithes plainly appears; and it alſo appears, that none have Reaſon to complain of the Hardſhip of paying them, any more than of paying Rent to the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord—or than he who receives Money belonging to the Church, can juſtly complain of being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the Uſe of it. For as the Tenth Part of the Produce of the Land, in this latter Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Church, the Landlord never purchaſed it, and conſequently he has no Right to receive it from the Tenant. If the Tenant pays Five Pounds in Tithes to the Church, he pays but Forty-five to the Landlord, in all Fifty Pounds; whereas, if he paid no Tithes, he would be obliged to pay the ſame Sum of Fifty Pounds to the Landlord. If Tithes were exactly paid in the Manner here ſtated, neither Party would be injured in their Rights; the Church would receive Nothing but its own from the Land-Holder, nor the Land-Holder from the Church, and neither in this Caſe would be injured or benefited.</p>
               <p>Although the State of Tithes in England is now become more complex and intricate than is here ſtated, owing to many Cauſes, which it is not my preſent Buſineſs to aſſign; yet their true Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Original has been explained, from whence the general Nature of them, which continues the ſame, may be eaſily underſtood. And it evidently
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:010578_0059_0F86F0B2CB877250"/>
follows from what has been ſaid, that ſo far as the Church is ſupported in England by Tithes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by <hi>Predial</hi> Tithes, it is ſupported without any Expence to the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Some may imagine that the Tithes of moſt Pariſhes in England muſt amount to an enormous Sum, and that ſuch exorbitant Wealth muſt have a general bad Effect upon the Clergy. Whether this be ſo or not, is, I confeſs, not immediately to my preſent Purpoſe to conſider. And yet, ſince I have entered upon the Subject, I would willingly, if poſſible, remove every Prejudice and Miſtake concerning it, which have been conceived in the Minds of Americans. Every Prejudice relating to this Subject, contributes Something to that Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Biſhops, which many are poſſeſſed of. The candid Reader will therefore excuſe my taking No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, even of ſuch Prejudices as theſe, as not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impertinent to my general Deſign.</p>
               <p>In what Manner Wealth has a natural Tendency to affect the Clergy, may be concluded from this common Aſſertion, ſometimes made with a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intention, but perhaps more frequently with a malicious one, but which is ſtrictly and literally true, that <hi>the Clergy are but Men.</hi> For this will directly lead us to infer, that Wealth will operate upon them, much in the ſame Manner that it does upon Men in general. Upon ſome it will have a bad Effect, and upon others a good one, according to the prevailing Diſpoſition and Character of each Perſon reſpectively. But as it is hoped that, in Proportion to their Numbers, there is more true Piety and Virtue to be found amongſt them, than in any other Order of Men; ſo it will be expected, that their Wealth is proportionably employed to better Purpoſe. And, to ſay nothing of what has
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010578_0060_0F86F0B38B66AF98"/>
been beſtowed in <hi>private</hi> Charity, if we take a View of all the public Inſtitutions in the Kingdom, ſuch as Colleges, Hoſpitals and charitable Societies; the Friends of the Clergy will have the Pleaſure to find, that none have been more forward than they, in affording all uſeful and charitable Aſſiſtance to their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
               <p>As to the other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Suggeſtion, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Amount of Tithes; it is acknowledged, that if they were at this Day paid according to the original Grant of them, they would, in moſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, produce a large Revenue to the Church. But under the preſent Cuſtoms and Regulations, I believe that there is not a Pariſh in England that pays a full Tithe, agreeably to the Intention of the Donors, in ſuch a Manner that the Incumbent receives Five Pounds out of every Fifty Pounds produced by the Pariſh: But of this there is no Complaint, with Regard to thoſe Pariſhes, where the Clergy are ſtill provided for ſufficiently; and it is confeſſed that there are ſuch in the Kingdom. But the Number of them is very ſmall, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that of the Livings that fall ſhort of it.</p>
               <p>An Author of Reputation ſays:
<q>It is well known that there are in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> about Three Thouſand parochial Cures, none of which exceed the yearly Value of Thirty Pounds a Year, Two Thouſand of which are not above Twenty Pounds a Year a piece, and a Thouſand of thoſe not above Twelve Pounds a Year. I, (ſays he) now Miniſter to a Congregation of about Twelve Hundred People, in the deareſt Part of <hi>England,</hi> and almoſt daily am employed in the Buſineſs of the Cure, and yet have not Fifty Pounds per Annum certain, of which the Tithes are about Thirteen Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:010578_0060_0F86F0B38B66AF98"/>
and the Glebe about Twelve Pounds <note n="*" place="bottom">Lewis's Examination of the Rights, <hi>&amp;c. Page 522.</hi>
                     </note>.</q>
Now can it be imagined that the Tithes are fully paid in any of theſe Pariſhes, I mean that the Tenth Part of the yearly Value of the Lands in the Pariſh, is paid to the Incumbent? A landed Eſtate of Three Hundred Pounds per Annum is eſteemed but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in any Part of England; and yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Tithe of ſuch an Eſtate is more, than all the Tithes that are actually paid in the largeſt of Three Thouſand Pariſhes—as the proper Tithe of an Eſtate of but One Hundred and Twenty Pounds per Annum, is equal to the Tithes received by the Incumbent, in a Thouſand Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>The Author mentions his own particular Caſe, wherein he cannot miſtake. His Cure, I ſuppoſe, he meant <hi>Margate</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> contained about Twelve Hundred People, which cannot be computed at leſs than Two Hundred Families, and his Tithes amounted to about Thirteen Pounds per Annum, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to One Shilling and Four Pence to a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily on an Average, which is but the Tenth Part of Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence.</p>
               <p>From this Repreſentation, is it poſſible not to ſee, that the Church at Home has ſuffered a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Depredation of its Property? And that, in the Caſe of Tithes, there are indeed the greateſt Reaſons for Complaint—but not on the Side of thoſe who pay, but of thoſe who receive them? And yet, not ſatisfied with the Injuries that are paſt, ſome, it is ſaid, ſtill pay with Reluctance the poor Pittance that is left! But, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, Men might as juſtly refuſe to pay the Rent that is due to their Landlords, or any juſt Debts whatever. For what is ſaved from the full Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010578_0061_0F86F0B5523ADEC0"/>
of Tithes, where they are due, by any Arts or Evaſions, is only ſo much gained by the Plunder of the Church, already greatly diſtreſſed in many Pariſhes: a Species of Injuſtice which has the true Nature of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and is as highly criminal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, and even the Law of Nature, as it ever was under the Law of Moſes.</p>
               <p>Let us now return, and proceed to the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what has been ſaid on the Subject of Tithes, to the Caſe of America. If any Perſon in America has given to the Church the Tithes of his Eſtate, as poſſibly ſome may have done, although I have never heard of ſuch an Inſtance; the Church has unqueſtionably a Right to receive it, whether we have Biſhops or not. If any have given leſs or more than this Proportion, as ſome have; the Church has equally the ſame Right to receive it— the Right being not founded on the Circumſtance of its being preciſely a <hi>Tenth</hi> Part, but on the free Gift and Conveyance of the legal Proprietor. Whatever has been given or conveyed to the Church, the Church has a Right to demand; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has not been given or conveyed to the Church, belongs not to the Church, nor can it be claimed as its Property.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of Societies, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, is exactly the ſame, in Regard to the Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Property, with that of Individuals. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can obtain a Right to the Property of others, without the free Conſent or Conveyance of the true Proprietors. Theſe Principles are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and neceſſarily founded on the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and no Power, either divine or human, can reverſe them. Can any then be ſo weak as to fear, that the Arrival of Biſhops in America, will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cauſe the Nature and Relation of Things
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010578_0061_0F86F0B5523ADEC0"/>
to be changed? The Reſidence and Power of more than Twenty Biſhops in England have no general Effect upon private Property; and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> may be very certain, that the Reſidence of one or two Biſhops in this, which is a much larger Country, without any Power of a temporal Nature, will not affect it. In this Reſpect, at leaſt, our American Biſhops will be like the Biſhops of the primitive Church; they will content themſelves with ſuch a Reception as they can obtain fairly, and claim no Perquiſites, but ſuch as ſhall be freely granted them.</p>
               <p>But although it is evident, that Tithes, in the preſent State of Things, cannot be claimed in this Country, and that Biſhops cannot make any Change in the Nature of Property; yet ſome may go on to object, that the Laws of England relating to Tithes, will take Place in America, under an Epiſcopate. I anſwer: thoſe Laws unleſs they are now binding in America, or have ſome enacting Clauſe to make them to be of Force here as ſoon as we ſhall have Biſhops, neither of which will be pretended by the Objectors, can no more operate in this Country under an Epiſcopate, than without one. They can never have any Effect here, until an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be made to extend them to us. And it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that ſuch an Act will be made; becauſe all that it could effect, is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for already, by thoſe Laws which are univerſally allowed to be in Force in America.</p>
               <p>For, as has been before ſhewn, the Laws which relate to Tithes in England, only enable the Church to recover them as its lawful and equitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but do not make them its Property. There are many Eſtates in England, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe Laws, pay no Tithes at all. This, in particular, is the Caſe of moſt of the Abbey-Lands
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:010578_0062_0F86F0B5F7759608"/>
which were veſted in the Crown, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. on the Diſſolution of the Monaſteries. If then the Laws in Queſtion make not Eſtates titheable in England, a Perſon of the loweſt Capacity can draw the Conſequence, that they can make none ſo here.</p>

               <head>SECTION XI.
Farther Suſpicions and Objections obviated, and the Subject concluded.</head>
               <p>BUT it may be inquired,<note place="margin">SECT. XI.</note> whether <hi>new</hi> Laws will not be made, in Caſe of an American Epiſcopate, to ſubject us to the Payment of Tithes? But of this there can be no more Reaſon to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, than if Biſhops were not to be ſent hither. Tithes are not paid in England to Biſhops, but to the Incumbents of Pariſhes; and the Clergy in this Country will have no greater Need of Tithes after the Arrival of Biſhops, than they now have, and have had always. In ſeveral Provinces on this Continent, the Clergy are regularly and well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported: and in the others, we have no Proſpect but ſtill to depend, in a great Meaſure, upon the Charity of our Benefactors at Home, until God ſhall either enable or diſpoſe our Friends in this Country to do more for us.</p>
               <p>But as Ignorance is ever ſuſpicious, it may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be aſked, Shall we not be <hi>taxed</hi> in this Country for the Support of Biſhops, if any ſhall be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I anſwer, Not at all. But ſhould a general Tax be laid upon the Country, and thereby a Sum be raiſed ſufficient for the Purpoſe: and even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing we ſhould have three Biſhops on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, which are the moſt that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; yet I believe ſuch a Tax would not amount to more than Four Pence in One Hundred Pounds. And this would be no mighty Hardſhip upon the Country. He that could think much of giving the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:010578_0063_0F86F0B7434F4270"/>
Six Thouſandth Part of his Income to any Uſe, which the Legiſlature of his Country ſhould aſſign, deſerves not to be conſidered in the Light of a good Subject, or Member of Society.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch Tax is intended, nor, I truſt, will be wanted. It has been propoſed from the very Beginning, that the American Biſhops ſhould be ſupported without any Expence to this Country. A Fund accordingly has been eſtabliſhed, for this particular Purpoſe, for more than half a Century paſt, under the Influence and Direction of <hi>the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for the Propagation of the Goſpel</hi>; and many worthy Perſons have contributed generouſly and largely to the Increaſe of it. I can recollect as I am writing, the following Inſtances: Archbiſhop <hi>Tenniſon,</hi> who has been dead upwards of Fifty Years, bequeathed to it One Thouſand Pounds Sterling; Sir <hi>Jonathan Trelawney,</hi> near the ſame Time, another Thouſand Pounds; the Lady <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Haſtings,</hi> Five Hundred Pounds; Biſhop <hi>Butler,</hi> Five Hundred Pounds; Biſhop <hi>Benſon,</hi> Two Hundred Pounds; Biſhop <hi>Oſbaldeſton,</hi> Five Hundred Pounds; and Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> One Thouſand Pounds. Theſe, and all other Sums which the Society have received for this Uſe, were put into the public Funds as ſoon as paid into their Hands, and have been accumulating ever ſince, excepting what they expended at <hi>Burlington,</hi> in the Manner that has been mentioned. If this Stock is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Support of a proper Epiſcopate in America, I imagine the Difficulty in making it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, will not be great. For, as many have given liberally on the <hi>remote Proſpect</hi> of its being needed, it is not to be doubted but Benefactors will be raiſed up, when Aſſiſtance ſhall be called for by a <hi>preſent Neceſſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:010578_0063_0F86F0B7434F4270"/>Another Objection has been made by ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to the following Purport; That if Biſhops are once ſettled in America, although in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we now propoſe, there will probably be an Augmentation of their Power, as ſoon as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit of it: and what is eaſy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive in its Beginning, may become burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and oppreſſive in its End. But at this Rate there can be no End of objecting. For if every <hi>poſſible</hi> ill Effect of a Thing, although confeſſedly proper in itſelf and harmleſs in its <hi>natural Tendency,</hi> may be made an Argument againſt it, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can eſcape. Arguments of this Sort may be as fairly and properly alledged—againſt a religious Toleration, which is now generally eſteemed by Proteſtants, to be a natural Right of Men, and a very important one of Chriſtians— againſt admitting thoſe who diſſent from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion to any Degree of civil or military Power, to which, indeed, they have no natural Right—againſt allowing the common People the Uſe of the Holy Scriptures, or the Liberty of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining any Points of Religion or Government— againſt ſuffering any to receive a learned Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. for none can tell what ill Conſequences and Abuſes may follow, in ſome future Period, from theſe Conceſſions and Indulgences. The Truth is, Men are not to be terrified or influenced by Fears of ſuch Conſequences as are barely <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi>; but to conſider what is reaſonable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in itſelf, and what Effects will <hi>probably</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> follow.</p>
               <p>That an American Epiſcopate is reaſonable and proper in itſelf, and that ſuch an Epiſcopate as is now propoſed has a natural Tendency to produce no ill Conſequences, has, I truſt, been ſufficiently
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010578_0064_0F86F0B74A5942F0"/>
proved. There is not the leaſt Proſpect at preſent, that Biſhops in this Country will acquire any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or Power, but what ſhall ariſe from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion of their Abilities and Integrity, and a Conviction of their Uſefulneſs and of this, no Perſons need dread the Conſequences. But ſhould the Government ſee fit hereafter to inveſt them with ſome Degree of civil Power worthy of their Acceptance, which it is impoſſible to ſay they will not, although there is no Appearance that they ever will; yet as no new Powers will be created in Favour of Biſhops, it is inconceivable that any would thereby be injured. All that the Happineſs and Safety of the Public require, is, that the legiſlative and executive Power be placed in the Hands of ſuch Perſons, as are poſſeſſed of the greateſt Abilities, Integrity and Prudence: and it is hoped that our Biſhops will always be thought to deſerve this Character.</p>
               <p>To explain in what Manner civil Power, if veſted in American Biſhops, would be moſt likely to operate, I beg Leave to put the following plain and familiar Caſe. Let us ſuppoſe a Clergyman in this Country, of any Denomination, made a <hi>Juſtice of the Peace,</hi> or <hi>a Judge of the Quorum:</hi> Would the Perſons who are immediately concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Proceedings, be otherwiſe affected, than if he was a meer Layman? It cannot be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Whether it would be proper to give ſuch a Commiſſion to any of the Clergy, is another Point. In moſt Parts of this Country there can now be no Occaſion for it, and where it is not evidently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Good of the Public, I know that ſome of the Clergy would refuſe it, and I believe there are but very few that would deſire it. If then it could be of no great Conſequence to the Public
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010578_0064_0F86F0B74A5942F0"/>
or to Individuals, whether a Juſtice of the Peace be a Clergyman or a Layman, ſuppoſing their Abilities and perſonal Characters to be equal; ſo, if Biſhops ſhould be inveſted with a proportionable Degree of civil Authority, neither would there be any great Reaſons for Complaint. But after all, nothing of this Kind is at preſent foreſeen or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and it is abſolutely determined that no Powers ſhall be given them, that can interfere with the civil or religious Rights of any.</p>
               <p>But there is no Occaſion for dwelling on Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this Nature. The real and only Plan on which it is agreed to ſettle Biſhops in America, when his Majeſty ſhall ſee fit to appoint them, has been fairly ſtated and explained in the preceeding Pages. This Plan is now propoſed to the Public, to ſee whether any reaſonable Objections can be offered againſt it. But whatever may be objected againſt any different Plan, is not to the Purpoſe. The Friends of the Church are deſirous to know, what can be ſaid or ſuggeſted againſt an American Epiſcopate, in the Form wherein it is propoſed to ſettle it; and they who have any Thing to offer, are requeſted to confine themſelves to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Point: For to object againſt Biſhops in this Country, under a Form wherein it is determined not to ſettle them, is as foreign to the Purpoſe, as to object againſt the Authority of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> or the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now taken Notice of all the Objections that have been made againſt ſending Biſhops to America, ſo far as they have come to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and it muſt be left to the Reader to judge, whether, with Regard to the Epiſcopate in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, they are not unreaſonable and groundleſs. It is indeed poſſible that other Objections may have
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:010578_0065_0F86F0B80C840290"/>
been offered, or may be hereafter ſuggeſted, againſt American Biſhops; but I am perſuaded that upon Examination they will generally be found to be Proofs, rather of the Dexterity or Ill-Will of the Inventors, than of the real Fears and Uneaſineſs of the Inhabitants. Ar ful Men may raiſe Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Difficulties in the plaineſt Caſes, and can make any Thing an Argument againſt any Thing, in a Way that ſhall appear plauſible, to thoſe who are unacquainted with the Legerdemain of Cavilers and Sophiſts. But whoever employs his Talents in this Exerciſe, is as unworthy of the public Attention, as the Child that engages in Crambo or Puſh-Pin.</p>
               <p>Thus, having repreſented the Diſtreſs the Church of England in America is under, for Want of an Epiſcopate—having attempted to prove, by various Arguments and Conſiderations, the Propriety and Fitneſs and Neceſſity of relieving it, and of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the ſame Advantages which are granted to all other Denominations of Chriſtians in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's American Dominions—and having explained the Nature and Extent of that Authority with which our Biſhops will be inveſted, when it ſhall be thought proper to ſend them, and ſhewn that ſuch an Appointment can produce no Harm to the Diſſenters, nor afford juſt grounds of Uneaſineſs or Complaint to any; I muſt now haſten to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, ſubmiting what has been offered to the Judgment of the Reader. Nothing has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, in the Courſe of this Work, but what the Author believes, upon good Evidence, to be true; no Argument has been advanced, but with a full Perſuaſion of its being pertinent and concluſive. He looks upon the Subject to be of the utmoſt
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:010578_0065_0F86F0B80C840290"/>
Importance; and he has no Diſpoſition to trifle with it, or with the Public to which he appeals.</p>
               <p>If theſe Papers ſhould have the Honour of coming into the Hands of any of thoſe Perſons, from whoſe Power or Influence an American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate is in any Meaſure expected; the Author humbly begs, that the Cauſe which he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to plead, may not ſuffer, in their Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the Unſkilfulneſs of its preſent; Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Although he greatly diſtruſts his own Management, he has no Diffidence of the Cauſe itſelf. He believes it to be the Cauſe of Truth, of Juſtice, and of Chriſtianity, and as ſuch he moſt reſpectfully and ſubmiſſively recommends it, imploring their Attention to ſo extraordinary and important a Caſe, as that of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in America.</p>
               <p>It need not be repeated, that unleſs Biſhops ſhould be ſpeedily ſent us, we can foreſee nothing but the Ruin of the Church in this Country. It need not be ſuggeſted, that ſuch an Event is too much to be hazarded, when no Good can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ariſe from ſuch a Riſque, and much Evil will probably follow it—Evil, which it is the unqueſtionable Duty of thoſe to prevent, who are intruſted with the Intereſts of the Nation. The Church of England here, is ſo inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the Church at Home, or rather, is ſo eſſentially the ſame with it, that it muſt ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or periſh, by the ſame Means. The Cauſes indeed, which deſtroy it here, may be local, and not immediately operate in England; but then, that Inattention and Negligence in our national Superiors, which would ſuffer it to be deſtroyed in the Colonies, muſt have a general Effect, and can produce no Good to the ſame Church in the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:010578_0066_0F86F0BA72C0DFC8"/>
Mother-Country. Here, the Church has been long ſtruggling under ſuch an increaſing Load of Difficulties, and is now in ſuch a State of Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to deſerve the Compaſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the whole Chriſtian World. From our own Nation, and the Guardians of its Intereſts, it conceives itſelf to be intitled to more; as there is a Concurrence of every Kind of Motive for prevailing upon them, to afford it the Relief which is ſo eſſentially needed. The common Principles of Juſtice, and the moſt ſacred Obligations of the Chriſtian Religion, have been ſhewn to require this at their Hands.</p>
               <p>Nor need the Author uſe many Words to prove, that Conſiderations even of a political Nature, are ſufficient in this Caſe, to prevail with thoſe who are inſenſible to other Motives. The Church of England, in its external Polity, is ſo happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected and interwoven with the Civil Conſtitution, that each mutually ſupports and is ſupported by the other. The greateſt Friendſhip and Harmony have ever ſubſiſted between them; and in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Period, wherein the Ruin of the one was effected, the Deſtruction of the other immediately followed. The Reſurrection of the one, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cloſely attended the Reſtoration of the other; and he that has a Regard for the Happineſs of either, can never wiſh to ſee the Experiment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, either in England or her Colonies.</p>
               <p>It is not pretended that the Character and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the preſent Times are, in this Reſpect, the ſame, as in the Period refered to; nor that thoſe who are Enemies to Epiſcopacy in this Age, are Enemies to Monarchy, as was frequently the Caſe formerly. The contrary is evident, in innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inſtances. There are many Britiſh Subjects, both at Home and in the Plantations, who reject
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:010578_0066_0F86F0BA72C0DFC8"/>
Epiſcopacy, and yet are warm Advocates for our happy Civil Conſtitution. It is therefore raſh and Injurious to charge any with Diſaffection to the Government, at this Day, becauſe they diſſent from the national Religion. But notwithſtanding, Epiſcopacy and Monarchy are, in their Frame and Conſtitution, beſt ſuited to each other. Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy can never thrive in a Republican Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor Republican Principles in an Epiſcopal Church. For the ſame Reaſons, in a <hi>mixed</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, no Form of Eccleſiaſtical Government can ſo exactly harmonize with the State, as that of a <hi>qualified</hi> Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p>And as they are mutually adapted to each other ſo they are mutually introductive of each other. He that prefers Monarchy in the State, is more likely to approve of Epiſcopacy in the Church, than a rigid Republican. On the other Hand, he that is for a Parity and a popular Government in the Church, will more eaſily be led to approve of a ſimilar Form of Government in the State, how little ſoever he may ſuſpect it himſelf. It is not then to be wondered, if our Civil Rulers have always conſidered Epiſcopacy as the ſureſt Friend of Monarchy; and it may reaſonably be expected from thoſe in Authority, that they will ſupport and aſſiſt the Church in America, if from no other Motives, yet from a Regard to the State, with which it has ſo friendly and cloſe an Alliance.</p>
               <p>But there is no Reaſon to doubt, but every proper Motive will have its Effect, upon thoſe wiſe and illuſtrious Patriots, who now conduct our public Affairs. We no more ſuſpect the Goodneſs of their Diſpoſition, than the Reaſonableneſs of the Cauſe, for which we are ſo anxious. All that we can be juſtly apprehenſive of, is, that to thoſe who
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010578_0067_0F86F0BBA024B6C8"/>
reſide at ſuch a Diſtance, the Neceſſity of relieving the Church in America, with <hi>all poſſible Speed,</hi> may not be ſo evident, as to thoſe who are Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of its ſuffering Condition. We therefore beg Leave to ſuggeſt this—and earneſtly to requeſt, that the Relief, which we doubt not is intended, may be <hi>ſpeedily</hi> granted. The ill Effects of delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, may be irretrievable. The preſent favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opportunity may be ſoon loſt, and then De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair will ſucceed our diſappointed Expectation.</p>
               <p>To thoſe who have been averſe to American Biſhops, and hitherto have ſhewn a Diſpoſition to oppoſe their Settlement, I have but a Word more to offer. Their Prejudices, we charitably believe, muſt have ariſen altogether from Miſapprehenſions of the Caſe, and from the Fears which, from thence, have been conceived, of their becoming Sufferers, either in their Property or Privileges, by the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate in Queſtion. The Subject is here placed in its true Light, and thereby, it is truſted, their Miſapprehenſions are fairly removed, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Fears are ſhewn to be groundleſs. Inſtead therefore of diſtreſſing themſelves, or of oppoſing the Church in the Caſe before us, we flatter our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they will act the Part which Generoſity and Candour preſcribe, and behave towards us as Fellow-Chriſtians and Proteſtants ought to behave to one another. If they have been led by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Miſinformation to oppoſe a Cauſe, which they now find to be juſt; their Duty obliges them to be careful for the future, at the very leaſt, not to obſtruct it. If they are in Reality the Friends of Truth, and Juſtice, and Liberty, which they pretend and we are willing to believe them to be, they muſt be heartily diſpoſed to act a friendly Part towards us, with Regard to an Epiſcopate;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:010578_0067_0F86F0BBA024B6C8"/>
which Diſpoſition will add greatly to their own Happineſs, as well as to ours. They know, by Experience, the ineſtimable Value of thoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, for which we have petitioned; and if we are as fairly intitled to them as any other Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, they ought not to envy, but to take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in, our Enjoyment of them.</p>
               <p>If all the religious Denominations in America, by the general Conſtitution of the Britiſh Colonies, are to be treated on the Footing of a perfect Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for which ſome have contended; then, the Church of England is as fully intitled to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Enjoyment of its own Diſcipline and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as any other Chriſtians. If any one Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is intitled to a Superiority above others, as is believed by many; then, the Claim of the Church of England to this Preference, is not to be diſputed. One of theſe muſt be undoubtedly the Caſe; and on either Suppoſition, to endeavour to prevent the Epiſcopate we have aſked for, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Cruelty.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould remain unconvinced by the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been advanced, or unſatisfied with the Solution of Objections that has been attempted, or ſhould have any new Objections to offer; the Author will be ready, in Caſe of a decent Notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, to reconſider the former, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the latter—ſhould it be thought proper by his Friends, upon whoſe Judgment, in ſuch Matters, he will always depend more, than upon his own. For the preſent, he begs Leave to conclude in the Words of an eminent Writer of the laſt Century, as they exactly repreſent his own Diſpoſition and Sentiments:
<q>I ſhall heartily beſeech all thoſe who ſhall pleaſe to read what has been written, that if they meet with any Thing therein, which
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:010578_0068_0F86F0BCEB4DE448"/>
either is leſs fitly ſpoken, or not clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, they would give me Notice of it in ſuch a charitable and Chriſtian Way, as I may be the <hi>better</hi> for it, and they not the <hi>worſe.</hi> Which Favour if they pleaſe to do me, they ſhall be welcome to me as an Angel of God, ſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me from the Lanes of Error into the open Ways of Truth. And doing theſe Chriſtian Offices to one another, we ſhall by God's good Leave and Bleſſing, not only hold the Bond of external Peace, but alſo in due Time be made Partakers of the Spirit of Unity. Which Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that the Lord would graciouſly beſtow on his afflicted Church, is no ſmall Part of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions in the public Liturgy; where we are taught to pray unto Almighty God, that he would pleaſe <hi>continually to inſpire his univerſal Church with the Spirit of Truth, Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and grant that all they which do confeſs his holy Name, may agree alſo in the Truth of his holy Word, and live in Unity and godly Love.</hi> Unto which Prayer he hath but little of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which doth not heartily ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>AN APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SINCE the drawing up of theſe Papers, I have met with a Pamphlet intitled, <hi>A Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the uninterrupted Succeſſion and holy Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt Engliſh Biſhops, being an Extract from Mr. Ward's Second Canto of his England's Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: with an Introduction, Notes and an Appendix, containing the ſolemn funeral Song of the native Iriſh. Printed</hi> M, DCC, LXVI. This curious Performance has been printed with great Secreſy, probably in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> although the Place and Name of the Printer be not mentioned, and as ſecretly diſperſed amongſt the Inhabitants of the remote Parts of the Country. The Deſign of it is to ridicule the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Succeſſion of our Engliſh Biſhops, and the Occaſion of it appears to have been the late Application made by ſome of the Clergy, for <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Biſhops.</p>
            <p>The Editor, in his Introduction, which he has endeavoured to ſet to the Tune of <hi>Ward's Canto</hi> in doggerel Verſe, <hi>abſurdly</hi> aſſumes the Character of a <hi>Churchman,</hi> as he introduces his Hero to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, what he even profeſſes to expoſe; whereas a Regard to Conſiſtency of Character, which is as neceſſary in Works of Drollery and Humour as in any other, ſhould have led him to appear in his
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:010578_0069_0F86F0BD9EBF27A0"/>
true Shape of an <hi>Anti-Epiſcopalian,</hi> or rather of an <hi>Anti-Proteſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Story of the <hi>Nag's-Head</hi> Conſecration, the only Engine with which this vain Mortal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to attack the Church, is well known to have been a Fiction of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> invented Forty Years after the Time wherein it is ſaid to have been tranſacted, and when it was hoped that no direct Proof could be made of its Falſity. But he, who frequently
<q>diſappointeth the Devices of the Crafty,</q>
ſo ordered it in his Providence, that what was thus infamouſly projected to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour the Church of England, is an eternal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of Reproach to the Church that invented it, as it muſt ever diſgrace thoſe who endeavour to propagate it. But that the Reader may better judge of it, an Account of the whole Affair, as given by <hi>Biſhop Burnet,</hi> is hereunto ſubjoined.</p>
            <p>The Extract from <hi>Ward,</hi> which makes the Body and even the Soul of the Pamphlet, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than a Repetition of this villainous Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Nag's-Head</hi> Conſecration in wretched Rhyme, cooked up and larded with ſuch unſavory Ingredients, as muſt render it offenſive to every Perſon of the leaſt Delicacy, and can agree only with ſuch Stomachs as can bear the Rankneſs of Train Oil. It is now generally agreed that Ridicule, even when managed with the greateſt Dexterity, is not the Teſt of Truth. If this Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor thinks otherwiſe, let him try the Experiment with One or Two keener and better Pieces, which are recommended for the Improvement of him and his Friends, if peradventure he has any, I mean <hi>Butler's Hudibras</hi> and <hi>Swift's Tale of a Tub.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Appendix is intitled <hi>Remarks on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Piece</hi>; wherein the Editor condeſcends to
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:010578_0069_0F86F0BD9EBF27A0"/>
come down to the Level of tame Proſe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances a Number of Aſſertions tending to diſcredit Epiſcopacy, which have been frequently and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually confuted, and ſhewn to be falſe. For the Support of them, he refers to a Liſt of Authors, who have been often and abundantly anſwered, without taking the leaſt Notice of the Anſwers; and concludes with a doleful Story of a poor Clergyman in Ireland who was ſuppoſed to be frightened to Death, and a Lamentation of the wild Iriſh on the Occaſion. This, we may chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſuppoſe, was intended for an Exploit of Wit; but it will puzzle a Reader of ordinary Sagacity, to diſcover any Thing, either in the Imagination, or Execution of it, that can juſtly intitle it to this Character.</p>
            <p>His whole Performance is cloſed with this grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Period:
<q>I ſhall conclude my Remarks with only adding, that <hi>I wiſh</hi> there may be no Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to repeat this ſolemn <hi>Dirge</hi> over your Biſhop upon his Introduction.</q>
The Danger here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated there is no great Reaſon to fear, as it is ſuggeſted, not by any public Appearances, but by the Ferocity and Rancour of his own Heart, of which his whole Performance is a Proof. But does he not ſay that he <hi>wiſhes</hi> the Occaſion may not happen? Aye, indeed does he; but any one that reads his Pamphlet, will think it to be as cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and polite Treatment as he deſerves, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him in the Words of <hi>Valerian,</hi> an old honeſt Capuchin, "<hi>Mentiris impudentiſſime.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole; I can venture to pronounce the Performance before me to be the moſt unfair, impudent and malicious Thing I have met with; and I am perſuaded that thoſe whom he intended to ſerve, or rather to deceive, will not thank him
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010578_0070_0F86F0BE0AAEC1A8"/>
for his Trouble. For ſo long as Men, in any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Senſe, continue to be reaſonable Creatures, ſuch Management muſt be eſteemed a Diſgrace to the Cauſe which it aims at promoting.</p>
            <p>If this Perſon is alarmed at the Proſpect of Biſhops in America, Why does he not ſtand forth fairly and produce his Objections? In the Name of Goodneſs, let him ſhew, if he can, that the Church of England in this Country has no Need of Biſhops—or that ſhe has no Right to expect that Biſhops will be granted her—or that ſuch an Indulgence will harm the Diſſenters. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his Weakneſs, ſhould it be put to a fair Trial, he dares not venture into the open Field. Like a <hi>Cherokee,</hi> he chooſes rather to ſkulk in the Dark, and to do what Miſchief he can amongſt ſuch of the Inhabitants as he ſuſpects to be moſt weak and unguarded. Contrary to the Rules of Honour, and the Laws of all civilized Nations, like his Brother-Savages he attacks with poiſoned Arrows; and therewith he too is ſupplied by the inveterate Enemies of the Proteſtant Intereſt. For, as has been obſerved, this <hi>Nag's-Head</hi> Affair, was altogether a mean and wicked Contrivance of the Papiſts, to blaſt the Reputation of the Engliſh Reformation. <hi>Ward</hi> was a notorious Papiſt, and his whole Book, from which this Extract is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, was written for the very Purpoſe of ſetting the Reformed Religion in a contemptible Light. What muſt the World then think of ſuch a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication as this? Or, of a Cauſe, that can require ſuch an Advocate, and ſuch Arts, to ſupport it?</p>
            <p>I will not give this <hi>poetico-proſaic</hi> Haberdaſher any farther Diſturbance, but leave him in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of as much Tranquillity and Satisfaction as ſuch a Production, with the Conſciouſneſs of his
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:010578_0070_0F86F0BE0AAEC1A8"/>
own evil Intentions, can afford him. Had his Views been <hi>honeſt,</hi> with whatever Abilities he had acquited himſelf, his Reward would have been greater. For there is much Truth in the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Father Garaſſe,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that write with a <hi>good</hi> Deſign, that
<q>when a poor Genius toils inceſſantly to produce ſome worthleſs ridiculous Piece, and for that Reaſon will never obtain the public Applauſe, yet that all his Pains might not paſs unrewarded, God gives him a Self-Satisfaction, for which it would be an Injuſtice beyond Barbarity to envy him, And thus God, who is all juſt, denies not even to <hi>Frogs</hi> the Pleaſure of being charmed with their own Muſic.</q>

                        </head>
                        <p>"On the 8th Day of <hi>July</hi> the <hi>Congè d' Elire</hi> was ſent to <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and upon that, on the 22d of <hi>July,</hi> a <hi>Chapter</hi> was ſummoned to meet the firſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi>; where the Dean and Prebendaries meeting, they, according to a Method often uſed in their Elections, did by a Compromiſe refer it to the Dean to Name whom he pleaſed: and he naming Doctor <hi>Parker,</hi> according to the Queen's Letter, they all confirmed it, and publiſhed their Election, ſinging <hi>Te Deum</hi> upon it. On the 9th of <hi>September</hi> the Great Seal was put to a Warrant for his Conſecration, directed to the Biſhops of <hi>Dureſme, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Peterborough, Landaff</hi> and to <hi>Barlow</hi> and <hi>Scory</hi> (ſtiled only Biſhops, not being then elected to any Sees) requiring them to conſecrate him. From this it appears, that neither <hi>Tonſtal, Bourn</hi> nor <hi>Pool</hi> were at that Time
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:010578_0071_0F86F0BECDF8EB68"/>
turned out: It ſeems there were ſome Hope of gaining them to obey the Laws, and ſo to continue in their Sees.</p>
                        <p>"This Matter was delayed to the 6th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi> Whether this flowed from <hi>Parker's</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to engage in ſo high a Station, or from any other ſecret Reaſon, I do not know. But then the Three Biſhops laſt named refuſing to do it a new Warrant paſſed under the Great Seal, to the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff, Barlow</hi> Biſhop Elect of <hi>Chicheſter, Scory</hi> Biſhop Elect of <hi>Hereford, Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Exeter, Hodgkins</hi> Biſhop Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of <hi>Bedford, John</hi> Suffragan of <hi>Thetford,</hi> and <hi>Bale</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſſory</hi>; that they, or any Four of them, ſhould conſecrate him. So by Virtue of this, on the 9th of <hi>December, Barlow, Scory, Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and <hi>Hodgkins,</hi> met at the Church of <hi>St. Mary le Bow</hi>; where, according to the Cuſtom, the <hi>Congè d' Elire,</hi> with the Election, and the Royal Aſſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to it, were to be brought before them: and theſe being read, Witneſſes were to be cited to prove the Election lawfully made; and all who would object to it were alſo cited. All theſe Things being performed according to Law, and none coming to object againſt the Election, they confirmed it according to the uſual Manner. On the 17th of <hi>December, Parker</hi> was conſecrated in the Chapel of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> by <hi>Barlow, Scory, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdale,</hi> and <hi>Hodgkins,</hi> according to the Book of Ordinations made in King <hi>Edward's</hi> Time: Only the Ceremony of putting the Staff in his Hands was left out of the Office, in this Reign. He being thus conſecrated himſelf, did afterwards conſecrate Biſhops for the other Sees: namely, <hi>Grindal</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London, Cox,</hi> that had been King <hi>Edward's</hi> Almoner, Biſhop of <hi>Ely, Horn</hi> Biſhop
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:010578_0071_0F86F0BECDF8EB68"/>
of <hi>Wincheſter, Sandys</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter, Merick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor, Young</hi> Biſhop of <hi>St. David's, Bullingham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln, Jewel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſbury</hi> (the great Ornament of that Age for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Piety;) <hi>Davis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>St. Aſaph, Gueſt</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter, Berkley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Bentham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield, Alley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Par</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough. Barlow</hi> and <hi>Scory</hi> were put into the Sees of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Hereford.</hi> And ſometime after this, in <hi>February</hi> 1561, <hi>Young</hi> was tranſlated from <hi>St. David's</hi> to <hi>York</hi>; there being now no Hopes of gaining <hi>Heath</hi> to continue in it: which it ſeems had been long endeavoured, for it was now Two Years that that See had been in Vacancy. In like Manner, after ſo long waiting to ſee if <hi>Tonſtal</hi> would conform, there being now no more hope of it, in <hi>March</hi> 1561, <hi>Pilkington</hi> was made Biſhop of <hi>Dureſme. Beſt</hi> was afterwards made Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and <hi>Downham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>"I have given the more diſtinct Account of theſe Promotions, becauſe of a malicious Slander with which they were aſperſt in aftertimes. It was not thought on for Forty Years after this. But then it was forged, and publiſhed, and ſpread over the World, with great Confidence, That <hi>Parker</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was not legally nor truly conſecrated. The Author of it was ſaid to be one <hi>Neale,</hi> that had been ſometime one of <hi>Bonner's</hi> Chaplains. The Contrivance was, that the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi> being required by <hi>Bonner</hi> not to conſecrate <hi>Parker,</hi> or to give Orders in his Dioceſs, did thereupon refuſe it: Upon that the Biſhops Elect being met in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> at the <hi>Nag's-Head</hi> Tavern, <hi>Neale,</hi> that had watched them thither, peeped in through an Hole of the Door, and ſaw them in great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:010578_0072_0F86F0BF928DA628"/>
finding the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi> was intract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. But (as the Tale goes on) <hi>Scory</hi> bids them all kneel, and he laid the Bible upon every one of their Heads or Shoulders, and ſaid, <hi>Take thou Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preach the Word of God ſincerely,</hi> and ſo they roſe up all Biſhops. This Tale came ſo late into the World, that <hi>Sanders</hi> and all the other Writers in Queen <hi>Eliſabeth's</hi> Time, had never heard of it: otherwiſe we may be ſure they would not have concealed it. And if the Thing had been true, or if <hi>Neale</hi> had but pretended that he had ſeen any ſuch Thing, there is no Reaſon to think he would have ſuppreſſed it. But when it might be preſumed that all thoſe Perſons were dead that had been preſent at <hi>Parker's</hi> Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then was the Time to invent ſuch a Story; for then it might be hoped that none could contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict it. And who could tell but that ſome who had ſeen Biſhops go from <hi>Bow-Church</hi> to dine at that Tavern with their Civilians, as ſome have done after their Confirmation, might imagine that then was the Time of this <hi>Nag's-Head-Conſecration.</hi> If it were boldly ſaid, one or other might think he remembered it. But as it pleaſed God, there was one living that remembered the Contrary. The old Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> who had been at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, declared it was at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and deſcribed all the Circumſtances of it, and ſatisfied all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men that it was according to the Form of the Church of England. The Regiſters both of the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and of the Records of the Crown, do all fully agree with his Relation.

It is as manifeſtly an original Writing, as any that I ever had in my Hands: I have put it in the Collection, for the more full Diſcovery of the Impudence of that Fiction. But it ſerved thoſe Ends for which it was deſigned. Weak People hearing it ſo poſitively told by their Prieſts, came to believe it; and I have myſelf met with many that ſeemed ſtill to give ſome Credit to it, after all that clear Confutation of it, made by the moſt ingenious and learned Biſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi> the late Primate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Therefore I thought it neceſſary to be larger in the Account of this Conſecration; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Influence it hath into all the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been ſince that Time derived down in this Church." <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> Vol. II.
