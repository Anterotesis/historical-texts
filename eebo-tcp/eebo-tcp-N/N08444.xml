            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>REV'D SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A GENTLEMAN in this town, to whom Mr. Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming's "defence" was lately ſent, ſaw fit, a few days ago, to put it into my hands, deſiring I would give it a reading; which I have accordingly done.</p>
            <p>How far it may be juſtly called <q>a defence of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy againſt your ſermon,</q> I am not able to ſay; not having had the pleaſure of ever ſeeing it: But 'tis with great impropriety ſtiled "a defence againſt mine;" as nineteen parts in twenty of what I had ſaid, is paſſed over, without ſo much as an attempt to examine its force, or ſhew its inconcluſiveneſs in point of argument. Was it not that my name is now and then mentioned, no one would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine he had it in view to anſwer me, any more than an hundred others, who have appeared on the ſame ſide of the queſtion in diſpute.</p>
            <p>I ESTEEM my ſermon as full an anſwer to his "defence," as if wrote on purpoſe to confute it; and aſk no other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than that they be carefully compared with each other, and an impartial judgment formed thereupon. If this is done, I cant ſuppoſe that any one, beſides Mr. L. will be diſpoſed to think, <q>that he has anſwered the moſt material things advanced by Dr. Chauncy:</q> It muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, on the contrary, that he has ſcarce taken notice of any thing material that I have offered.</p>
            <p>I HAVE no other knowledge of this gentleman, than what may be collected from this ſmall work of his; which has not, I confeſs, given me an exalted opinion of him. Was I inclined to engage in the epiſcopal controverſy, I ſhould chooſe for my opponent, one that is better able to manage a diſpute, than he appears to me to be. What good purpoſe would it ſerve to write, tho' it were never ſo
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010800_0003_0F81D1A7969D7978"/>clearly and ſtrongly, when one knows before hand, that little notice may be taken of what is wrote, and yet the whole be compleatly anſwered?—He has ſaid but little, very little, but what has been anſwered an hundred times over, and with arguments much too powerful to be ſet aſide by him.</p>
            <p>I AM ſorry your lot is caſt among thoſe who are deeply tinctured with high-church principles. Such are always bigots themſelves, and zealouſly endeavour to make others ſo too. This was the caſe among us in former years; but theſe high flying-notions are now almoſt abſorbed in a more generous way of thinking. There are but few who dare openly profeſs their adherance to theſe tenets, whatever their private thoughts may be. 'Tis indeed high time they were univerſally eradicated out of men's minds, they are ſo ſenſeleſs in themſelves, as well as contrary to the word of God.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, as the caſe is circumſtanced with you, it may be well for you to take him to taſk, and point out his weakneſs; which, as I imagine, you will find no difficult matter.</p>
            <p>IT would be doing too much honour to him, for us both to be engaged in the diſpute with him: Tho' I believe it is in reality a diſpute with the combined clergy in thoſe parts. By the account I have of Mr. L. he is not equal to the performance that comes out in his name, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient it may be as an anſwer to either of us.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION, &amp;c. INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN I preached and publiſhed my diſcourſe upon ordination, I had no thoughts of engaging in a controverſy. Providence had caſt my lot in that part of Chriſt's vineyard, where there are ſundry epiſcopalians, interſperſed among the people of my charge, as well as in the neighbourhood. Tho' I never could find any ſcripture warrant, for the peculiarities that diſtinguiſh that church from the reſt of the proteſtant world; tho' it has many defects in its orders, worſhip and diſcipline, and is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably different from the plan laid down by our Saviour and his apoſtles, and followed by the primitive chriſtians in the next ſucceeding ages; yet as it appears to have the eſſentials of religion, it has ever been my practice to treat its profeſſors as chriſtian brethren, tho' miſtaken in ſome points; agreeable to the apoſtolic direction, <q>him that is weak in the faith receive, but not to doubtful diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> A wrangling diſputatious temper among the diſciples, eſpecially among the miniſters of the prince of peace, is odious and unchriſtian. As the things in which we agree, are, by all allowed, to be of infinitely greater importance than thoſe in which we differ; how can that zeal be defended which ſpends itſelf only, or principally, about the latter, while the former are treated with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative neglect? Is it not much more becoming the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of chriſtians and miniſters of the goſpel, to lay aſide theſe bickerings, and unite our endeavours in oppoſing the growing cauſe of infidelity and irreligion, and promoting the more important truths of our common chriſtianity? Theſe are the principles agreeable to which I have ever
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010800_0004_0F81D1A893BFFFF0"/>treated our epiſcopal diſſenters: And I challenge the whole party to produce an inſtance, in which I have ever begun a diſpute with them upon the controverted points, or attempted, publicly or privately, to prejudice them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own worſhip or miniſtry. I eſteem it a greater honour to promote the real intereſt of religion, than that of any particular denomination; and, if I know my own heart, had much rather be the happy inſtrument of ſavingly converting one ſoul to Chriſt; than of making a thouſand proſelytes, merely to the low deſigns of a party. It has ever given me pain, to obſerve the prevalence of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary temper and conduct, in thoſe of any denomination, whether clergy or laity. How far this has been the caſe with the epiſcopalians in theſe parts, would, perhaps, be deemed invidious in me to ſay. Sure I am, if I had not obſerved too many inſtances of this kind; had I not been repeatedly ſollicited, to preach and publiſh upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as a neceſſary antidote againſt the effects of them; the diſcourſe I am now called upon to vindicate, never would have ſeen the light. In compoſing of it, I ſtudiouſly guarded againſt every thing offenſive; for I had no deſire to be drawn into a controverſy. Had I been diſpoſed to this, I could not have been at a loſs for materials. It is well known, that beſides the exorbitant, unſcriptural claims of their biſhops, and the mean, ſervile ſubjection of the preſbyters, in that church; there are ſome things in her articles, and in her worſhip and diſcipline many more, which are, (at leaſt in our opinion) highly exceptionable. However naturally many of theſe things ſell in my way, while writing upon this ſubject, I carefully ſuppreſſed them; for my maxim was to act only on the defenſive, and endeavour, by ſcripture and reaſon, to vindicate our miniſterial authority from the perpetual attacks of the party. In theſe circumſtances, I had reaſon to conclude, that the moſt ſanguine and zealous among them would not be offended, or look upon themſelves concerned to anſwer me, either from the pulpit or the preſs. But no ſooner was the piece publiſhed, than the epiſcopal pulpits, here
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010800_0004_0F81D1A893BFFFF0"/>and in the neighbourhood, reſounded with the old cry, "the power, the power;" and repeatedly rung over all the various changes, of the <hi>nullity</hi> of preſbyterian orders and adminiſtrations, the abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> of uninterrupted ſucceſſion, and the <hi>unalterable and divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy. And among the reſt, it was ſaid, Mr. L. often diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf upon the topic, with ſingular pathos and zeal.</p>
            <p>IT was ſoon given our, that an anſwer to my piece would be publiſhed: But as no particular author was named, and the rumour abated; it was generally concluded, as they had no call to engage in the controverſy, the deſign was laid aſide. However, after a preparation of near three years, Mr. L. has ſeen fit to ſtep forth, and favour the public with the firſt fruits of his pen, in what he is pleaſed to call <q>a defence of the epiſcopal government of the church, containing remarks upon two late noted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, on preſbyterian ordination.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT I was to expect, from ſuch an opponent, I was at a loſs to determine; having never had a taſte of his abilities for managing a controverſy. When the book came out, I read it with a good degree of attention; and was not a little ſurprized to find, that after ſo long prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the author had ſo little to ſay, upon the two pieces he had ſet himſelf to anſwer. As to Dr. Chauncy's, the Dr. juſtly obſerves, nineteen parts in twenty are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over without a ſingle remark. And as to mine, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever compares it with Mr. L.'s anſwer, will, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, make much the ſame remark. Whether he has ſo fully ſucceeded, in thoſe parts he pretends to anſwer, muſt be ſubmitted to the judgment of the public, to which I appeal.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe and ſuch like reaſons, it was judged at firſt, that to attempt an anſwer was no ways neceſſary. But as the party ſoon began to triumph in it, as an unanſwerable piece, and boaſted of great exploits done by it, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſundry converts to the epiſcopal cauſe; it was generally concluded, that ſomething ought to be wrote by way of reply. This, I hoped, would have been underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:010800_0005_0F81D1A8F61C10E8"/>by Dr. Chauncy, as every way my ſuperior, eſpecially in his acquaintance with this controverſy. But as he has declined the ſervice, for the reaſons mentioned in his letter, prefixed to theſe ſheets; it of courſe devolves upon me.</p>
            <p>AS I am conſcious of no other motive in the affair, than a ſincere regard to truth, and the intereſt of our churches, which I really believe to be the intereſt of the redeemer's Kingdom; I ſhall endeavour fairly to examine <hi>every thing</hi> in Mr. L.'s book, that looks like an argument, and give it its due weight. For as it is truth rather than victory I aim at: ſo the former will ſhine brighteſt when placed in <hi>controſt</hi> with every thing that oppoſes it; and as to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he who ſhould challenge it for only <hi>nibbling</hi> at here and there a ſentence in his antagoniſt, muſt I conceive, appear with a very ill grace. This, however, will make me more lengthy, than might otherwiſe be thought needful.</p>
            <p>ONE thing I think proper to premiſe.—Since, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the caution uſed, both by the Dr. and myſelf, to avoid a controverſy with epiſcopalians, they have ſeen fit to engage in one; and will not ſuffer us even to defend our cauſe, when called upon ſo to do, without taking the alarm; I ſhall not look upon myſelf holden to obſerve the like caution, in that reſpect, as I did in my ſermon. If therefore in the courſe of this diſpute, I ſhould happen to treat them with leſs ceremony: If there ſhould occafional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drop from my pen, any direct reflections, or free ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions, upon ſome very exceptionable and unſerip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts of their ſcheme, when they fall in my way, I requeſt the candid reader to impute it to the proper cauſe.</p>

               <hi>SEC. I.</hi> Remarks upon the letter-writer, S. I. and Mr. L.'s intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>R. L. has uſhered his "defence" into public view, with a letter ſigned, S. I. Who this gentleman is, we are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enquire. As he has ſeen fit to give us only the initial letters of his name, and no more ceremony than any anonymous writer, whatever honorary titles he may happen to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified with.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OUR opponents, ſays he, have of late, without any provocation, been muſtering up their old ſophiſms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ancient epiſcopal government of the church, which have been long ago abundantly anſwered over and over.</q> Perhaps the gentleman thinks all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt his ſcheme, deſerve the name of <hi>ſophiſms.</hi> He ſhould remember however, that, tho' to call an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that pinches, by an ugly name, may be an eaſy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to get rid of it; yet in the judgment of the candid, a ſolid refutation would be more ſatisfactory. That our arguments are <hi>old,</hi> is readily granted; for ſo is truth: But that they are the worſe or the weaker upon that account, appears not. Nor does it appear that theſe arguments have been all abundantly, I mean ſolidly <hi>anſwered.</hi> To pretend to anſwer an argument, is one thing; to do it effectually, another. The former, in the preſent caſe, we allow. The latter perhaps wants proof: We have only his bare word for it; and as he ſeems to be an intereſted
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010800_0006_0F81D1A9CE6DA250"/>perſon, the public, and not he, will be preſumed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt judge. But then, <q>theſe ſophiſms have been muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up againſt the <hi>ancient</hi> epiſcopal government of the church.</q> Had he ſaid againſt the <hi>preſent</hi> government of the church of England, as explained by ſome of her zealous ſons; the words would have read as well, and been more agreeable to truth. Every ſect, almoſt, is apt to boaſt of its antiquity; and if bare <hi>aſſertions</hi> are admitted as proof, one has as good a claim to the honour as another: That the preſent government of the church of England, is <hi>epiſcopal,</hi> none will deny: But that it is very <hi>ancient,</hi> at leaſt ſo <hi>ancient</hi> as ſome of its advocates pretend, is by many denied. As to myſelf, I am fully perſuaded, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all its high pretences to antiquity; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritively a mere novel, upſtart inſtitution. So far from being the true <hi>ancient</hi> epiſcopacy, that prevailed in the apoſtles times, and the ages next following; that it is, in many reſpects, diametrically oppoſite to it and deſtructive of it. This, I preſume, will appear in the following pages.</p>
            <p>BUT after all, if we had attacked, even the church of England, without <hi>provocation,</hi> it was doubtleſs wrong. This is a charge commonly brought by our epiſcopalians. Notwithſtanding the uncommon generoſity, with which they are treated in this country, and the ſingular indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the ſtate towards them, above what was ever ſhewn to <hi>diſſenters,</hi> in any part of the chriſtian world; they are often complaining of oppoſition and ill-uſage. At leaſt, if we will believe them, they never begin a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. They are forced into it, in their own defence. This gentleman tells us, <q>theſe opponents, (meaning, I ſuppoſe, Dr. Chauncy and I) have of late been muſtering, &amp;c. againſt the church, <hi>without any provocation.</hi>
               </q> Mr. L. ſays, <q>I am fully perſuaded, upon the ſtricteſt enquiry, it will be found, that there cannot be one ſingle inſtance produced, for thirty years paſt, in which our clergy have begun the diſpute."<note n="*" place="bottom">Defence p. 7.</note> And, "When the church of England is <hi>attacked,</hi> her elergy ſuppoſe they ought
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010800_0006_0F81D1A9CE6DA250"/>to <hi>defend</hi> it."<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 8.</note> His book is therefore called a <hi>defence,</hi> &amp;c. And this is the only reaſon that cauſes him to publiſh this <hi>defence.</hi>
               </q> But is this repreſentation honeſt? Are preſbyterians ſuch quarrelſome neighbours, as always to be <hi>attacking</hi> the church of England? and <hi>beginning</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with her, <hi>without provocation?</hi> Nothing leſs. The firſt piece wrote upon the controverſy, in this conutry, was on the epiſcopal ſide. And the firſt in this colony, by one with whom, I preſume, S. I. is intimately acquainted. What then can theſe gentlemen mean, by <hi>attacks</hi> upon the church of England? Had either the Dr. or I, denied her the eſſentials of a true church; had we diſputed the <hi>vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> of her miniſtry;—pronounced a <hi>nullity</hi> upon her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; —ranked her clergy among the ſons of <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab,</hi> or her members with <hi>heathen Jews</hi> and <hi>infidels;</hi> or had we <hi>directly</hi> attempted to expoſe any of thoſe many things, which are, at leaſt, highly exceptionable in her doctrines, diſcipline, orders, and worſhip; they might, with more propriety ſound the alarm, and cry, <q>an <hi>attack</hi> upon the church.</q> Every one knows, how common theſe <hi>cants</hi> are, from a certain quarter. But is there any thing of this kind in the pieces Mr. L. pretends to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? Certainly nothing. They bravely <hi>defend</hi> our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, from the exceptions of theſe zealous advocates for epiſcopacy, whoſe high-flying principles, lead them to anathematize all of our communion, and leave all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant world, but themſelves, to the uncovenanted mercies of God. According to theſe gentlemen, it ſeems, there can be no defence of preſbyterian principles, however mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, without <hi>attacking</hi> the church of England. This is a great miſtake. Let but the church of England, even in her preſent form, be put upon her original and true foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; —let her reſt upon the foundation, which the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and all her moderate and catholic ſons ſince, have fixed for her; I mean <hi>the civil authority of the King and parliament;</hi> and they never need ſear being <hi>attacked</hi> by us. A <hi>defence</hi> of preſbyterian ordination and government, will
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010800_0007_0F81D1AA712ABF08"/>be no direct oppoſition to the church of England, in this view of it. Had there never been any higher claims for her, (and, to me, it is clear there never ought:) Had her ſons in this country, contented themſelves, with challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her, the honour of being a valuable branch of the reformation, and of having the authority in England, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for her eſtabliſhment and ſupport there; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, "the annual lecture in Cambridge," at which Mr. L. is ſo much nettled, never would have had a being; nor the pieces he pretends to anſwer, have ſeen the light.</p>
            <p>BUT the grand ſecret, no doubt, is:—The cauſe of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy is to be puſhed in America, at all events. And, upon trial, this, it ſeems, has been found the beſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent—to unhinge and perplex the minds of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,—to fill their heads with airy notions of the <hi>abſoluts neceſſity</hi> of epiſcopal ordination, prejudice them againſt their own miniſters, as having no <hi>commiſſion</hi> from Chriſt, no <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to perform the divine offices of religion, and boldly pronouncing <hi>nullity</hi> upon all their adminiſtrations. This is the general ſtrain of all the pieces upon the controverſy, that have been wrote in this country. If this was not Mr. L.'s deſign, he had no call to engage in the diſpute. This, however, is no new art. All oppoſers of religion, have ever made their moſt ſucceſsful attacks, thro' the ſides of its clergy. Thus did Korah, Dathan and Abiram. They fell upon Moſes and Aaron, and denied their authority, as officers in God's church. <q>Ye take too much upon you.</q> The ſcribes and phariſees did the ſame in their oppoſition to chriſtianity in its infancy. They <q>compaſſed ſea and land to make proſelytes,</q> they attacked the divine author of the goſpel, and boldly queſtioned his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as a public officer in the church. <q>By what <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> doſt thou theſe things? and who gave thee this <hi>authority?</hi>
               </q> The apoſtle Paul met with the ſame treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Judaizing teachers, (who, by the way, were notable ſticklers for uninſtituted rites and ceremonies in religion,) traduced his character, denied his miniſterial au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and in that way andeavoured to prejudice people's
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010800_0007_0F81D1AA712ABF08"/>minds, and draw off a party to follow them. This laid him often, under the diſagreeable neceſſity, of vindicating himſelf againſt ſuch aſperſions; as may be ſeen in his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. The grand topic of declamation of papiſts, againſt proteſtants, has ever been this. <q>You have thrown off the pope's authority, ſeperated from the <hi>catholic apoſtolic</hi> church; you have therefore no <hi>authentic miniſtry,</hi> no <hi>valid</hi> goſpel adminiſtrations.</q> The ſame clamor was raiſed in England, by the non-jurors, againſt the church of England, at the revolution. And moſt of us remember, how ſucceſsful the ſame artifice has been, in the hands of our enthuſiaſtic ſeperates of this country, in the late times.</p>
            <p>But to return.</p>
            <p>
               <q>FOR ten years, ſays Mr. L. before this, the church of England and <hi>diſſenters,</hi> lived in a peaceful ſtate: But ſince they have publiſhed ſo many things againſt that church, it has a little diſconcerted the deſign of our clergy.</q> If the "deſign of their clergy" is to promote practical godlineſs, and make converts to Jeſus Chriſt; I am at a loſs to find any Thing in the books he ſpeaks of, tending to <hi>diſconcert</hi> it. But if their grand <hi>deſign</hi> is, to convert <hi>preſhyterians</hi> to the doctrines of <hi>prelacy,</hi> and make proſelytes to the church of England, I dont doubt but it has been a little, perhaps not a very little <hi>diſconcerted,</hi> by the publications aforeſaid.—He adds, <q>Who determine, as much as poſſible, to live peaceably with all men.</q>— Peace, without doubt, is a very deſirable thing; but if <hi>truth</hi> muſt be the purchaſe of it, we beg to be excuſed. We ſhould heartily rejoyce to find them, ever more diſpoſed to a <hi>peaceful</hi> conduct, than at preſent they appear to be; and are not conſcious of any thing on our ſide, to make them otherwiſe. But if their <hi>deſigus are diſconcerted,</hi> by opening peoples eyes to diſcover the truth; if their tempers are ſoured, and they become unſociable, and <hi>unpeaceful,</hi> by a bare detection of the weakneſs of their cauſe, and they are reſolved not to live in <hi>peace,</hi> unleſs we will give up all pretences to the character of miniſters and chriſtians, and, right or wrong, come over to their party; we muſt plainly tell them, they hold their friendſhip too dear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:010800_0008_0F81D1AB2D612448"/>
               <q>THIS conduct of their miniſters, ſays S. I. to his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, has made it neceſſary for us to write again, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the church; and I am glad, and thank you, that you have undertaken this office, and ſo well acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yourſelf in the diſcharge of it.</q> How well Mr. L. has acquitted himſelf in this <hi>office,</hi> muſt be left to the reader. However if all our arguments are but <hi>ſophiſms;</hi> eſpecially if they <q>have been long ago abundantly anſwered over and over by others;</q> 'tis no great purchaſe to do it again. But a ſmattering of logic will ſerve, to anſwer a <hi>ſophiſm,</hi> and detect its fallacy. And if in the preſent caſe, this has been ſo often done before, ſome perhaps may be ready to doubt, whether Mr. L. has not acted the <hi>plagiary,</hi> and only publiſhed the works of others, in his own name. Beſides, if all our <hi>ſophiſms</hi> have been ſo often, ſo abundantly anſwered before, what occaſion was there for doing of it again? Not that I would detract from Mr. L.'s perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. It is really better than I expected from <hi>him;</hi> and, ſo far as he enters into the ſubject, as good, I imagine, as the cauſe will well admit. After all, I can hardly think he has done quite ſo much execution with it, as his friend ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. According to him, all our arguments ſtand no more chance, before the formidable artillery of this mighty champion, than mere cobwebs or puffballs, before the mouth of a roaring cannon. <q>They inſtantly vaniſh into duſt and ſmoke.</q> But no wonder: Since whatever <q>plauſible appearance they make, they are but mere cavils.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>THEIR chief appearance of ſtrength, he adds, lies in the promiſcuous uſe of the words, biſhop and preſbyter.</q> This gentleman muſt allow me to tell him, he here labours under a great miſtake. If he had read the pieces he makes ſo free with, he muſt have ſeen that, we argue the validity of preſbyterian ordination, from the one general commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to miniſters in the goſpel. As this commiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all Chriſt's miniſters, we think they muſt be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to all the powers it contains; therefore to ordination which is one of theſe powers. We argue it, from all goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010800_0008_0F81D1AB2D612448"/>miniſters being ſucceſſors to the apoſtles, in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacity, and ſo poſſeſſed of all the powers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, in that capacity, of which ordination is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably one.—We argue it, from there being but one kind, or order of miniſters, to be found in the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, —but one ſet of qualifications required,—one general work or buſineſs aſſigned,—and only one method of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into office, preſcribed for them all. Finally, we produce, as we think, plain and expreſs inſtances, from ſcripture, of ordination by preſbyters, properly ſo called, which is more than our opponents have ever been able to do, for epiſcopal ordination, tho' often requeſted ſo to do.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, <q>the promiſcuous uſe of the words, biſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture</q> is one of our arguments, and, we think, a good one. For if theſe names were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in common to all goſpel miniſters at that time; if every ſcripture preſbyter was really a biſhop then, we ſee no reaſon why it ſhould be otherwiſe now. At leaſt the inſtance he brings to convince us of our miſtake; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that tho' biſhop and preſbyter were one office in the apoſtles times, yet they <hi>ought</hi> not to be ſo now; does not ſeem ſo happily choſen to prove the point, tho' it ſerves well enough, to ſhew how the alteration was introduced into the chriſtian church, the motives leading to it, and the means uſed to accompliſh it.</p>
            <p>THE inſtance he produces is this.— <q>They might, ſays he, with juſt the ſame reaſon, argue and conclude, that Pompey and Auguſtus were of the ſame office, becauſe they were both called <hi>imperatores;</hi> when all the world knows, that within 50 years, (as the caſe hath often been with other words,) a different ſet of ideas was annexed to that word, from what it meant 50 years before: Which was plainly the caſe, with the word, biſhop, when the church came to be ſettled, &amp;c</q> The truth of the fact he mentions, as to the Roman ſtate, I readily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Nor will I diſpute the propriety of the application. It has indeed, in this inſtance, (as he juſtly obſerves,) fared with the chriſtian church, much as it did with the ancient
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010800_0009_0F81D1ABF192EEE8"/>Roman common-wealth. While Rome was free, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her happy republican form of government; the term, <hi>imperator,</hi> meant only an officer in the army, of equal authority with his brother officers of the ſame title. But when Julias Caeſar, that grand uſurper, not content with the original honours and powers of his office, as general; but fired with unbounded thirſt of dominion, found means to deſtroy the ancient form of government, and enſlave his country; then he appropriated the title to himſelf and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and ſo the word, <hi>imperator,</hi> in proceſs of time, came to ſignify, one of ſupreme authority over all others, both in the army and ſtate.</p>
            <p>AND has it not happened, even ſo, with the word, <hi>biſhop,</hi> in the chriſtian church? Originally it ſignified, <hi>barely</hi> a miniſter of Chriſt, a ſtanding officer in the church, only of equal power with the reſt of his brethren in the miniſtry. But the church of Rome, in imitation of the ſtate, have long ſince, deſtroyed the original parity, that firſt ſubſiſted among the goſpel-miniſters, and, together with the <hi>power,</hi> appropriated the <hi>title</hi> of biſhop, in its higheſt ſignification, to the pope, the grand uſurper and enſlaver of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in ſpirituals, and made him lord paramount, over all the officers and members in the church of Chriſt. And pity it is, that any proteſtant church, ſhould ſo far affect to ape and imitate them, as to adulterate the ſcriptural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, biſhop, to appropriate the title to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſuperior order of officers in the church, as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of a lordly authority over their brethren in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, who were all originally upon a level, as to power; all true ſcripture-biſhops. Is not this too much like ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolizing with the church of Rome, the mother of harlots and abominations? Is it not too lightly departing from the ſcripture patern, and treating with too much neglect, that ſolemn caution, given by the great head of the church, to his miniſters, <q>be ye not called <hi>rabbi, maſter, lord;</hi> for one is your maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are <hi>brethren.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>LET the candid reader now judge, whether there is not ſome weight in this argument, drawn from the <hi>identity</hi> of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010800_0009_0F81D1ABF192EEE8"/>"the names, piſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture" in ſupport of preſbyterian ordination, after all this gentleman has ſaid to defeat it? Or whether it is, as he ſays, <q>a mere <hi>logo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machy,</hi> or ſtrife about words, fixing modern ideas to old names?" Beſides, who is it that has introduced this logomachy" "this ſtrife about words?" Who, "that affix modern ideas to old names?" They, who have affixed</q> to the name biſhop, originally the ſame, by his own confeſſion, with preſbyter; the <q>modern additional ideas</q> of ſuperior authority, and a lordly dominion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his brother biſhops and fellow preſbyters? or we, who conſider him, in the ſame ſtate of equality with his brethren, in which the ſcripture has fixed him? They, who arrogate to him, the ſole power of ordination and government? Or we, who, agreeable to ſcripture patern, leave theſe powers in common to all goſpel miniſters? If there is any adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, any perverſion of words from their original ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, "or affixing modern ideas to old names," let thoſe be anſwerable who have given the occaſion.</p>
            <p>NOTHING of conſequence occurs in the remaining parts of this letter, but what we ſhall meet with in the piece it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies, and which will be there conſidered. He indeed tells us "they maintain" the ancient government of the church was epiſcopal;" that Timothy was an inſtance of it at Epheſus, and the apocalyptic angel another, &amp;c. &amp;c. To which he finally adds, the teſtimony of the fathers, who, if we may believe him, were all upon their ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And then ſays; <q>They, (the fathers) muſt have as well known the form, in which the apoſtles, under divine inſpiration, eſtabliſhed and left the church; as we now know how ours was, in Q. Elizabeth's time.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer.</p>
            <p>IT is not true in fact, that theſe ancient fathers, had ſuch perfect knowlege of the original inſtitution of the church, or that their writings in this caſe are ſo certainly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, as his argument ſuppoſes. If their writings are a ſure guide for us in one caſe, they are in another. But 'tis well known theſe ſame fathers maintained the doctrine of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010800_0010_0F81D1ACD7535FE0"/>the millennium, and practiſed giving the ſacrament to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and moreover, declared that they received theſe things from the apoſtles themſelves. This they aſſart as fully, as they do the doctrine this gentleman cites them to prove. And yet his church, and ail others, for many hundred years, reject the teſtimony of the fathers in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid inſtances, as being repugnant to the word of God. But further, granting his aſſertion to be true, <q>that theſe writers knew as well what form of government prevailed in the apoſtles times, as we do, what was the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church of England in Q. Elizabeth's time;</q> yet this will not prove that dioceſan epiſcopacy is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right. This gentleman, and other zealots of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aſſert, that epiſcopacy in England, at the time of the reformation, was ſettled upon the foot of divine inſtitution. Others, not only preſbyterians, but many eminent and learned epiſcopalians, affirm the contrary: They deny it has any pretence of divine right in its original eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but reſts wholly upon the civil authority and acts of parliament, for its exiſtence in its preſent form. Now both of theſe opinions can't be true. If then we can't, at this day, certainly know, upon what footing the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland ſtood in the reign of Q. Elizabeth; we certainly cannot know from the writings of theſe fathers, what was the apoſtolic inſtitution of the church, even allowing that they knew it, as well as we do, what was eſtabliſhed by Q. Elizabeth and her parliament: For, it ſeems, we are far from being agreed in that, and therefore don't certainly know it,—But what ſpoils the whole of this argument for epiſcopacy, is that it takes for granted a fact which is not true. <q>The fathers teſtify in favour of dioceſan epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, therefore it is of divine inſtitution.</q> I deny the fact. It is ſo far from being true, that any of the fathers of the two firſt centuries, declare in favour of dioceſan epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, much leſs that this was the form of church government handed down to them from the apoſtles; that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, their writings unanimouſly exhibit to view a form, diametrically oppoſite to and abſolutely deſtructive of, the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010800_0010_0F81D1ACD7535FE0"/>preſent dioceſan epiſcopacy, that prevails in the church of England. This I propoſe to prove in its proper place, to which I refer the reader.</p>
            <p>HE goes on; "This was always <hi>my way</hi> of arguing." Anſwer. Some men are obſerved, to have a very odd and wrong-headed <hi>way</hi> of arguing, all their days. But barely its being <hi>their way,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> they have always been uſed to, will not prove it to be a good one, or ſerve to recommend it to thoſe, who have been accuſtomed to a better <hi>way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE adds, <q>juſt in the ſame way do our diſſenting neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, with us, very rightly argue the cauſe of infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the firſt day ſabbath; only they have not near ſo many clear, inconteſtible facts, either of ſcripture or antiquity, for them, as we have for epiſcopacy; ſo that they muſt either give up <hi>them,</hi> or embrace <hi>that,</hi> or be ſelf-condemned, as inconſiſtent with themſelves.</q>— I anſwer. There is, at leaſt in our opinion, much better evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, both from ſcripture and antiquity, in ſupport of infant baptiſm, and the firſt day ſabbath; then for dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan epiſcopacy. But if there were not, there is this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference between us and them. They, from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and antiquity, are convinced, as they tell us, that dioceſan epiſcopacy is of divine inſtitution, and therefore practice it. But then they virtually exclude all other chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, from the benefits of the goſpel, by denying the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their clergy, and the validity of their adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leaving them in the deplorable ſtate of heathen and infidels.—We, on the other hand, from the ſame teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, believe infant baptiſm, and the firſt day ſabbath. We accordingly practice them. But then, <q>we have not ſo learned Chriſt,</q> as to think it our duty, either by our principles or practice, to unchurch and unchriſtianize all who differ from us in theſe points: But, if they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe qualified, cheerfully admit their miniſters into our pulpits, and their members to communion, in goſpel ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. We are content to enjoy our principles, without taking upon us to damn all who differ from us. Upon the whole then, we don't find ourſelves greatly embarraſſed with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010800_0011_0F81D1AD91687B60"/>this powerful <hi>dilemma,</hi> in which he means to entangle us, in order to draw us over to the church. We really think, notwithſtanding all he has ſaid, we may ſafely retain our old principles and practice, without incurring the character of ſelf-inconſiſtency, in the judgment of the impartial, or ſeeling the reproaches of ſelf-condemnation in our own conſciences.</p>
            <p>HIS letter concludes with theſe words.— <q>Let us then faithfully adhere to the doctrine, government, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy OF THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH OF EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLAND, WHICH CERTAINLY ARE, AND HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE, THE MOST SCRIPTURAL, OF ANY NOW IN THE WORLD.</q> A high encomium! and if juſt, abundantly ſufficient to recommend his beloved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy to the good graces of all mankind. Let him only favour us with ſufficient proof of his aſſertion, and we will, at once, quit our preſent way, and all in a body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cordial proſelytes, to his moſt excellent, truly apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic, and beſt conſtituted church in the world. Till then, he muſt allow us a little to heſitate,—to conſider who this pompous character comes from. Poſſibly it may be juſt. Of this, however, he has given us no proof but his bare word.—Perhaps he may have obſerved, that it is no new thing for men to cry; <q>The temple of the Lord, are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are theſe</q> All men are apt to like their own principles beſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a partial fondneſs for their <hi>own way.</hi> And for aught I can ſee,—the cry, of <q>THE MOST EXCELLENT CHURCH, THE MOST SCRIPTURAL, PURE, PRIMITIVE DOC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRINE, GOVERNMENT AND LITURGY OF ANY IN THE WORLD,</q> are words, that ſound as ſmooth and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly in the ear, and offer full as much conviction to the underſtanding of an impartial judge, from the mouth of any other enthuſiaſtic ſectary, as from that of an epiſcopal <hi>diſſenter</hi> in New-England. I now take leave of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron in order to pay my devoirs to his client.</p>

               <hi>SECT. II.</hi> Containing ſome incidental remarks, upon ſundry ſcattered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in Mr. L.'s book, not ſo immediately connected with the main point.</head>
            <p>MR. L. charges me with a miſtake, in calling Mark an apoſtle<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 30.</note> My words are, <q>Thus Matthew Mark and John, are all called evangeliſts, tho' at the ſame time they ſuſtained the character of apoſtles.</q> How I came to make the miſtake of calling Mark an apoſtle, I know not, unleſs through inadvertency; as knowing it no ways affected the argument, whether he in particular bore that character or no. A miſtake however, I confeſs it was, and thank him for pointing it out. I ſhall now do him the ſame friendly office, in pointing out a few of his; ſome of which greatly affect the ſubject he is upon. The firſt I ſhall notice is a general one that runs thro' his piece, as well as the letter prefixed to it; I mean, his calling thoſe of our communion in this country, <hi>diſſenters.</hi> 'Tis pity, I think, theſe gentlemen don't conſider where they live, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they give themſelves ſuch airs. Not that I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there is any thing reproachful in the name, when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied, tho' doubtleſs this is their meaning. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter</hi> is one, who differs from the eſtabliſhed religion of the country where he lives. I muſt therefore inform him, if he don't know it, that the term is merely <hi>topical.</hi> That in England, for inſtance, the ſame perſon who is a member of the eſtabliſhed church there, conſequently no <hi>diſſenter;</hi> let him but only paſs the Tweed into Scotland, or croſs the Atlantie, and fix in New-England, and he commences a very <hi>diſſenter</hi> as any in Chriſtendom. The reaſon is, in the former country, the epiſcopal perſuaſion, in the latter, the preſbyterian or congregationl, is the religion by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. This miſtake, I do not pretend greatly effects the point in diſpute. It may tend however to give people's minds a wrong bias. At leaſt it is always beſt to call
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010800_0012_0F81D1AE9FB67FF0"/>things by their proper names. And as Mr. L. as well as I, is a young writer, it may be a kindneſs to him juſt to be reminded, that however weak and deficient his arguments are, his readers will at leaſt expect of him propriety in point of diction.</p>
            <p>IN page 37, he is chargable with another miſtake, and that too expreſſed in a manner, hardly conſiſtent with the character of a polite gentleman, upon which, 'tis ſaid, he pretty much values himſelf.—What I intend is, his charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with downright falſehood and diſhoneſty for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſage in my book. His words are <q>Mr. Welles, in p. 27, has theſe remarkable words. By biſhops, they, (the church) mean, I hope, true ſcripture biſhops, not merely creatures of the ſtate, of human inſtitution.</q> On which he very <hi>genteely</hi> remarks. <q>I muſt be ſo free as to tell him, he did not hope any ſuch think, for he <hi>knew</hi> the contrary to be true.</q> What he could find in theſe harmleſs expreſſions to awaken his ire, (for he certainly was angry,) or what induced him to cite them, and paſs ſuch illiberal and injurious reflections upon them; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels myſelf utterly at a loſs to determine. Was it that he thought they carried in them an inſinuation, that their church was really a creature of the ſtate, in its preſent form, and not of divine inſtitution? No ſuch thing was expreſſed. But if there had, he ought to know that this is the opinion, not only of preſbyterians; but of many great and learned writers in his own church; I may ſay, of the generality of the reformers, and all the more moderate epiſcopalians ever ſince<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. Stillingfleet ſays. <q>I doubt not to make it evident, that the main ground for ſettling epiſcopal government in this nation, was not accounted any pretence of <hi>divine right,</hi> but the convenience of that form of church government, to the ſtate and condition of this church, at the time of the reformation.</q> Iren. p. 385.
<p>Biſhop Whitegift ſays, <q>I am perſuaded that the external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church, under a chriſtian magiſtrate, muſt be according to the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of government, uſed in the <hi>commonwealth:</hi> Elſe how can you make the prince, ſupreme governor of all ſtates and cauſes eccleſiaſtical.</q>

                  <p>Of the ſame opinion were Dr. Edwards, and their celebtated Hooker. The former of which, delivers his own and Mr. Hooker's ſentiments, in theſe words, <q>The judicious Mr Hooker holds, that epiſcopacy may be abrogated; conſequently it is not of <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>apoſtolic</hi> right, but the <hi>political inſtitution</hi> of the church.</q>—<bibl>Edw. remains, p. 257.</bibl>

VIII. cap. 17, in theſe words, <q>Archbiſhops, biſhops, archdeacons, and other eccleſiaſtical officers, have no manner of juriſdiction <hi>eccleſiaſtical,</hi> but by, under and from his royal majeſty,—<hi>the ſuprems bead</hi> of the church of England and Ireland, to whom, by holy ſcripture, all authority and power is wholly given, to heart and determine, all manner of cauſes <hi>eccleſiaſtical.</hi>

                  <p>The ſame is declared in an act of parliament made I. Edw. VI capt 2 <q>All authority and juriſdiction ſpiritual and temporal, is derived and deduced from the King's majeſty, as ſupreme head of theſe churches and realms of England and Ireland.</q>

                  <p>This clearly ſhews, that the epiſcopal government of the church in England, is not ſuppoſed to reſt upon the foundation of ſcripture; but upon the King's authority, as ſupreme head of the church. As a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of which, in the beginning of the reformation, biſhops actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took out their commiſſions from the king, and were promoted by his letters patent; the form of which, as biſhop Burnet tells us, was, <q>that the king appointed ſuch an one to be biſhop, during his natural life, or ſo long as he behaved well, and <hi>gave him power to ordain, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive miniſters to exerciſe eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, and perform all other parts of the epiſcopal function,</hi> and this they were to do, IN THE KING'S NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY.</q>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010800_0012_0F81D1AE9FB67FF0"/>this ſentence, and the other he pretends to quote from p. 50 of my ſermon? The words I there uſe (for he has not quoted them right) are theſe, <q>Another argument made uſe of, &amp;c.—is, that the New-teſtament has actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed three diſtinct orders in the goſpel miniſtry, viz. that of biſhops, &amp;c.</q> Now let the candid reader com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two ſentences, and ſee if there be any contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Or any thing that could provoke him to treat me ſo rudely. In one I ſay, epiſcopalians argue their three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from ſcripture. In the other I expreſs my hope that <q>by one of thoſe orders, biſhops, they mean ſcripture bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</q> In the former, I aſſert what they declare their belief in this caſe to be. In the latter, I expreſs my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable hope of their honeſty in ſuch declaration. Theſe were the <hi>hopes,</hi> the only <hi>hopes,</hi> I mentioned. But Mr. L. very politely replies, "I muſt be ſo free as to tell him he never <hi>hoped</hi> any ſuch thing. In ſome caſes, I would be far
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010800_0013_0F81D1AEECF9C758"/>from calling his knowledge in queſtion. But how he could know my heart; how he could certainly tell, what I did, or did not <hi>hope,</hi> is beyond me to conceive. But he tells me, not only that I did not "<hi>hope</hi> ſo"; but that <q>I <hi>knew</hi> the <hi>contrary,</hi> to be true.</q> Now if I <hi>knew</hi> the contrary to be true, it muſt be becauſe it <hi>was</hi> true: Otherwiſe, it is utterly impoſſible I could know it to be true. But what, I aſk, is this <hi>contrary,</hi> which he ſays, I know to be true? Plainly this, <q>that by biſhops, epiſcopalians do not mean true ſcripture biſhops.</q> This, and nothing elſe, ſtands op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to what I declared was the matter of my hope. All therefore I am able to make of this <hi>remarkable</hi> ſentence, is this. I had ſaid, <q>I hoped, by biſhops, epiſcopalians mean true ſcripture biſhops.</q> Mr. L. denies they mean any ſuch thing. I had declared, that when they talked ſo much about the divine right of epiſcopacy, I was charitably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to think they were honeſt. But this gentleman plainly tells me it is no ſuch thing. Since therfore he muſt be ſuppoſed to know beſt, and will needs have it ſo; I will grant I was miſtaken, as to him in particular; tho's as to others of his party, he muſt allow me to entertain the ſame charitable opinion ſtill; at leaſt till they give me the ſame reaſon to alter it, as he has done in his caſe. If this is not his meaning in <hi>theſe remarkable</hi> words of his; 'tis indeed difficult to ſay, what his meaning is. They ſeem to have no meaning at all; and therefore (to uſe another of his courtly phraſes) <q>they might have been left out, and his defence would have been as good as it is now</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. L. ſeems to be diſpleaſed with the <hi>length</hi> of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. In pag. 30 he has theſe words. <q>Tho' he (Mr. Welles) <hi>fleers</hi> about our preaching deacons; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is really true that Stephen preached as good a ſermon as Mr. Welles's <hi>divine right,</hi> &amp;c. tho' it was not ſo long.</q> I have examined the paſſage, to which he refers in this remark, but can find nothing that looks like a <hi>fleer</hi> there. After giving an account of the inſtitution of deacons, Acts 6. beginning, and anſwering the arguments they bring for their preaching; I have theſe words, <q>Since
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010800_0013_0F81D1AEECF9C758"/>therefore it plainly appears, that theſe deacons, were in no ſenſe, goſpel miniſters, but expresſly appointed and ſet apart to quite another ſervice; it undeniably follows that no order in the chriſtian miniſtry can be founded upon this inſtance; and conſequently, that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended order of preaching deacons, has no warrant— from the word of God.</q> Now what is there in theſe words, that looks like a <hi>fleer?</hi> It is true, I denied that <hi>preaching</hi> was any part of the ſcripture deacon's office; and if after I had proved it was not, I called it, a <hi>pretended order,</hi> &amp;c. I can ſee nothing criminal in it, nothing that looks like <hi>fleering.</hi> The order of preaching deacons in the church of England, is either a <hi>real</hi> and ſcriptural, or a <hi>pretended</hi> and unſcriptural one. The former he knows we deny. He knows it was the very thing I was then diſproving; and if, when I had, as I thought, ſufficiently diſproved it, I called it a <hi>pretended</hi> order, I can ſee no reaſon he had to be offended. I hope he would not have me call it a <hi>real ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> order of the miniſtry, when I did not believe it to be ſo, and had proved it not to be ſo.—But <q>he believes it is really true, that Stephen preached as good a ſermon as mine, tho' it was not ſo long.</q> Poſſibly he does; tho' why he believes it, he has not told us. Sure I am, the ſcripture, to which he ſo often appeals, furniſhes no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it. That indeed gives a lengthy account of this <hi>protomartyr,</hi> but ſays not a word about his <hi>preaching</hi> as I can find. 'Tis true it ſpeaks of his <hi>diſputing;</hi> but then Mr. L. I preſume, will not pretend that all <hi>diſputing</hi> is <hi>preaching.</hi> He has <hi>diſputed</hi> againſt my ſermon; but he has not publicly told us, he ever <hi>preached</hi> againſt it, tho' others ſay he did at ſundry places and times. Whether his <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> upon theſe occaſions, was <hi>longer</hi> or <hi>ſhorter,</hi> whether it was <hi>better</hi> or worſe than mine, as it is of little importance, I am not anxious to know. Be that as it will, I do not ſee what great reaſon <hi>he</hi> had tò complain of the <hi>length</hi> of my ſermon; ſince long as it is, it has given him ſo little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For all profeſſedly attempts to anſwer of it, is only my firſt argument, which being compriſed in little more
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010800_0014_0F81D1B00C7C1738"/>than two pages, could not, one would think, give him any great pain. Whether, it was the <hi>length,</hi> or the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the other arguments, that diſcouraged him from meddling with them; as he has not ſeen fit to tell us, every one muſt be left to conjecture for himſelf.</p>
            <p>THE pieces Mr. L. attempts to anſwer, had <hi>occaſionally</hi> mentioned "the right of people to chooſe their miniſters." This he has repeatedly remarked upon, tho' not directly connected with the main point; while ſundry arguments that were, are paſſed by unnoticed. What could be his motive for this, is difficult to gueſs. Perhaps he thought, ſo long as people were left to claim and prize this invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priviledge; all he could ſay upon his <hi>divine-right</hi> and <hi>beſt-conſtituted-church,</hi> would be inſufficient to draw them away from a communion, where this priviledge is enjoyed, to one where it it utterly denied. He attacks Dr. Chauncy upon this head, and ſpends near two pages in endeavouring to diſprove it; and, as if that was too little, he falls upon it again in his remarks upon me. He demands of the Dr. <q>Where we find in ſcripture, this to be declared a part of chriſtian liberty.</q> &amp;c. I preſume, ſcripture pattern will ſatisfy for proof of this point, ſince it is all they <hi>pretend</hi> to bring for epiſcopacy, and much more than they are able to produce. And of this kind of proof there is plenty in ſcripture. From the goſpel hiſtory it appears, that this was the univerſal practice in the apoſtles times. When the vacancy made in the breach of apoſtles, by the death of Judas, was to preſent, was taken in the caſe; ſo that when Matthias was appointed, he is ſaid to be <q>numbered with the apoſtles, <hi>by the common vote or ſuffrage,</hi>
               </q> as it is in the original.<note n="*" place="bottom">Act 1.26. SUNKATEPSEPHISTMAE.</note> This is a plain matter of fact: And this ſolemn tranſaction in the beginning of chriſtianity, is a ſtanding pattern for the church in all ſucceeding ages.</p>
            <p>I mentioned in my ſermon, the inſtance of the ſeven deacons, who are expreſſly ſaid, "to be choſen" by the church, <hi>by the whole multitude</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 6.5.</note> Was it thought neceſſary, that the vote of the church ſhould be taken, in the choice
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010800_0014_0F81D1B00C7C1738"/>of officers, whoſe buſineſs was only to <hi>ſerve tables;</hi> how much more, in the more important office, of miniſters of the word and ſacraments? As a further proof of this right, I obſerved in my ſermon, that this was the manner, in which the elders, ordained by Paul and Barnabas were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced: By the vote or ſuffrage of the people, as it is in the original.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 14.23. KEIROTONAESANTES, &amp;c. which Beza renders, <q>qoum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ipſi per <hi>ſuffragia</hi> creaſſent, &amp;c. when they had by <hi>votes</hi> conſtituted them elders, &amp;c.</q> This, it ſeems, the tranſlators of our bible were convinced of. <q>For before our engliſh bibles had undergone <hi>epiſcopal</hi> correction at this place, the words, "<hi>by election,</hi> were added. And in the margin was this note.—<hi>The apoſtles did not thruſt paſtors into the church, by a lordly ſuperiority; but thoſe and placed them, by the voice of the congregation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THESE now are ſo many ſcripture examples, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this right, by the primitive chriſtians. Hence it undeniably follows, that this originally belonged to the people; conſequently, to go about to rob them of it, is unſcriptural and tyrannical. Dr. Chauncy mentioned a number of proofs from the fathers, in ſupport of this right; and that even after the diſtinction between biſhops and preſbyters took place. To theſe, many more might eaſily be added, from the ſame quarter. I ſhall ſubjoin one from Cyprian biſhop of Carthage who flouriſhed A. D. 250. <q>The people, ſays he, have the chief power of <hi>chooſing</hi> worthy miniſters, and refuſing the unworthy.</q> He adds, <q>That it muſt be received as a <hi>divine</hi> tradition, and an <hi>apoſtolic</hi> obſervation."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Epiſ. 68.</note>
               </q> The ingenious author of the enquiry into the conſtitution, &amp;c. of the primitive church, ſuppoſed to be Sr. Peter King, afterwards lord chancellor, abundantly proves, from numerous teſtimonies, that this was the univerſal practice of the primitive church, for people to chooſe their own miniſters. And indeed, the contrary practice, is ſo repugnant to reaſon, to all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of liberty, and the univerſal cuſtom in all other caſes; that, one would think, nothing but the higheſt degree of prejudice, could reconcile people to it. Do not we eſteem it a priviledge to chooſe our civil rulers? and look upon the people, as in a degree of ſlavery, who are utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010800_0015_0F81D1B08E40DD60"/>of it? Would we ſubmit, to have others chooſe for us, a lawyer to defend our property, or a phyſician to take care of our health? and oblige us to improve theſe and no other? Certainly no. But if we are ſo tenacious of our natural rights, where our temporal intereſt, and bodily health only, are concerned; how much more ought we to be, in things that relate to the health of our ſouls, our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eternal intereſt? Surely as much more, as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exceeds the former in point of importance. No wonder then Mr. L. conſidered the want of this, a very important objection againſt his favorite church; and tho' ſomewhat beſide his ſubject, ſet himſelf ſo zealouſly to remove it. How far he has ſucceeded, I leave to the reader. But if he is not able, wholly, to vindicate his own church in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he ſeems to think it ſome excuſe that others, and ours in particular, is in the ſame ſtate. This ſeems to be his meaning in theſe words. <q>I believe if the matter be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examined, it will be found, that the right of the New-England churches, to chooſe their miniſters, is founded, not upon ſcripture, but upon the law of the province, which declares who ſhall be the patrons, in each pariſh to chooſe their miniſters. As far as I have been able to underſtand this matter, the law of the province conſtitutes the heads of the families to chooſe, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 16.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HOW far Mr. L. <q>has been able to underſtand this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</q> he muſt know beſt. The <hi>defect</hi> of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not in my power to help. Whether it was for want of <hi>underſtanding</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> certain, I am, the account he gives of this affair is not true. According to the law of this colony, (and I ſuppoſe the caſe is much the ſame in the reſt of New-England, where there is an eccleſiaſtical eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment) the right of chooſing a miniſter, is declared to be, not in the heads of families excluſively; but in them and the members of the church, whether heads of families or not. Beſides, this right is not founded, as he ſuppoſes, in the law of the colony, any more than the obligation of any divine law, adopted by the civil magiſtrate. The <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> in one caſe, and the <hi>right</hi> in the other, is founded in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010800_0015_0F81D1B08E40DD60"/>ſcripture. The civil law only recognizes the right, and protects people in the enjoyment and exerciſe of it. And all men acquainted with our eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, know that we are ſo far from having any thing to do, with what he calls "patrons, in each pariſh, to chooſe the miniſter;" that moſt people know nothing of the term, or what it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, and I hope, by experience, never may. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, and all others of our people, who vote in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-meetings for other purpoſes, have all free liberty to vote in the choice of a miniſter. And that they may act with diſcretion in this important affair; they have opportunity to make trial of the candidate while he is upon probation. Was it then honeſt in Mr. L. to ſay, <q>In the ſame way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, corporations and particular perſons, become <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi> in the church of England?</q> In that church, <hi>patrons,</hi> clerical or ſecular, chooſe the miniſters for the people. In ours, he is choſen by the church and people themſelves In the former the biſhop, or ſome lay patron, who perhaps never ſaw the candidate, and is never to ſit under his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, has the ſole power of electing. In the latter, he is elected by the votes of thoſe who have made trial of him, are to maintain him, and attend upon his adminiſtrations. In our method, the law acknowledges the natural and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right of the people in this important affair, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects them in the enjoyment of it. But in theirs, in defiance of both, their miniſter is <hi>obtruded</hi> upon them without their conſent. If therefore, in this view of the caſe, <q>that good gentleman," (as Mr. L. calls the Dr.) ſhould really think their church, ſomewhat culpable in the matter of <hi>patrons;</hi>
               </q> few people, I preſume, "would greatly wonder at it," ſave he and thoſe of his party; and if, as he ſays, <q>their church appears to him to ſtand clear of all blame in that matter;</q> it muſt be owing, I think, to prejudice and partiality in a very high degree.</p>
            <p>I FIND but one thing more, in Mr. L.'s book, proper for this ſection. And that is, the <hi>uncommon</hi> advertiſement tacked to the end of it. I have read it over ſundry times, but can't be certain I have hit upon his meaning after all.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010800_0016_0F81D1B144FBE100"/>He talks much about <hi>conſequences;</hi> cautions his anſwerer againſt "falling upon <hi>conſequences,</hi>" and declares that <q>he has no concern with <hi>conſequences.</hi>
               </q> What he intends by them, is difficult to ſay. A <hi>conſequence</hi> in logic, is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of every good argument. But he can't mean this by his conſequences: For whatever they be, he places them in oppoſition to <hi>arguments,</hi> for want of which, in confuting his book, they are ſuppoſed to be "fallen upon." And yet this or ſomething like it, muſt be his meaning too; for he warns his antagoniſt againſt "flying from the ſubject, or what he has advanced in "his book" and <q>falling upon the <hi>conſequences.</hi>
               </q> But if this be his meaning, he need give himſelf no trouble in the caſe, provided he has only been careful, "to advance" nothing but truth: For truth is ever conſiſtent with itſelf; and nothing but truth will follow from it, or be the <hi>conſequence</hi> of it, and this can do him no hurt. But if he has not: If he has advanced things in his book, that are not true, or eſpouſed principles that cannot be ſupported by ſcripture or reaſon, he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the <hi>conſequences,</hi> whether he will or no. If, for inſtance, he has advanced a ſcheme of church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which takes the power of diſcipline out of the hands of her proper paſtors, and ſo robs her of this uſeful part of Chriſt's inſtitution: If, according to his principles, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal churches in America, cannot be ſaid to have the leaſt ſhadow of diſcipline: If it neceſſarily follows from his poſitions, that it is better to be a papiſt than a preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, and an ordination received in the church of Rome, "the mother of harlots" is lawful and valid, while one received in the truly proteſtant church of Scotland or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> nul and void:<note n="*" place="bottom">Of the unaccountable partiality of the church of England in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Rome, there has not long ſince, as I am informed, been a ſtriking inſtance in America. Mr. Houdin a romiſh prieſt in Canada, took a fancy to a young lady. As the doctrine of celibacy in his church, forbid his marrying of her, they agreed to quit their country and run off to New-York. Sometime after he found means to get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the ſociety for propagating the goſpel, and without reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, came as a Miſſionary in their ſervice to New-Rochelle, where he lately died. Much about the ſame time, as I take it, Mr. Hooper, who had been ordained in the church of Scotland, conformed to the church, but could not be admitted as a miniſter without reordination. He accordingly went to England, was reordained by the biſhop, and is now an epiſcopal miniſter in one of the churches in Boſton.</note> If upon his ſcheme, all
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010800_0016_0F81D1B144FBE100"/>the proteſtant world, except his own church, are utterly deſtitute of any valid goſpel adminiſtrations, and in no better ſtate than heathen and infidels, becauſe they lack epiſcopal ordination: Or laſtly, if he ſhould be told, that upon his principles, both he, and probably the greateſt part of epiſcopalians in this country, are in the ſame deplorable circumſtances; having never received any baptiſm, but what was adminiſtred by the unauthorized hands of thoſe, who lack epiſcopal ordination, and therefore, upon his principles, can have no power to baptize, conſequently, that he, and the greateſt part of his brother-miſſionaries in theſe parts, are ſo far from being the only authorized re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular miniſters among us, that they are not even viſible chriſtians, and therefore, not only, have no right to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter goſpel ordinances to others, but are actually unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to them themſelves:—If any, or all theſe things ſhould happen to be urged againſt him, perhaps he will call it "a flying from the ſubject, and falling upon <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences."</hi> And in anſwer, gravely tell us, <q>he has no concern with <hi>conſequences.</hi>
               </q> But whatever he thinks, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judges, 'tis preſumed, will think, that genuine <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,</hi> may properly be urged in a diſpute, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chargeable with "flying from the ſubject for want of argument; and that the advocates of ſuch principles, from whence ſuch <hi>conſequences</hi> flow, ought to be <hi>"concerned"</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, whether they be or no. No man ſhould advance any principles, but what are true. From ſuch, no <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> will follow but what are true, and conſequently good: Good in themſelves, and agreeable to every doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and duty of ſcripture, which is infallible truth. If therefore men and, their principles are productive of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,</hi> in their own nature, bad; repugnant to the laws of charity and the great doctrines and duties of the goſpel; they cannot think to excuſe themſelves to the world, by
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010800_0017_0F81D1B1EBC4E908"/>ſaying "they have no concern with <hi>conſequences.</hi> They ought to be "<hi>concerned</hi> about them," and manifeſt this concern to the world, by renouncing and abjuring ſuch principles, as corrupt and deteſtable, from which ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable and damnatory <hi>conſequences</hi> follow.</p>

               <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Animadverſions upon Mr. L.'s preliminary remarks to page <hi>10.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I FULLY agree with our author; <q>That it nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to know who are the lawful miniſters in Chriſt's kingdom.</q> And am well pleaſed with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he has propoſed to decide this point, viz. <q>by an appeal to ſcripture and reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN the mean time, let us attend to the obſervations he thinks proper to make, previous to his entering upon this deciſion. His firſt obſervation is this. <q>The whole body of diſſenters, (preſbyterians he means) affirm, that biſhop and preſbyter, in ſcripture, ſignify the ſame office: Yet they ſay, no inſtance is to be found there of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by any perſon under the name <hi>biſhop:</hi> And if a preſbyter is the ſame office, then there is none by a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter.</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">ibid.</note> But now, who does not ſee the fallacy of this argument? He allows, with us, that biſhop and preſbyter, in ſcripture, ſignify the ſame office; that miniſters were promiſcuouſly called by both theſe names, in goſpel times. But then he holds, that the buſineſs of ordination, &amp;c. ought not to lie in common, to all goſpel miniſters; but to be confined to a particular order, which in their church, are called biſhops. We, on the contrary affirm, that as biſhop and preſbyter, in ſcripture, ſignify the ſame office; the power of ordination belongs in common to all miniſters, and therefore ought not to be confined to ſome few, under the title of biſhops. To prove this, we obſerve, that tho' we have ſundry accounts of ordination, in ſcripture, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by miniſters, yet there is no ſingle inſtance of one ſo performed by them, under the name <hi>biſhop,</hi> and yet to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010800_0017_0F81D1B1EBC4E908"/>this, epiſcopalians appropriate the whole power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Mr. L. ſays, if this be true, that there is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in ſcripture of an ordination performed by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under the name biſhop, then it will follow,—What? Why "that there is none by a preſbyter," that is, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one performed by a preſbyter. But does it at all follow, that becauſe the ſcripture mentions no ordination as performed by miniſters under their one title of biſhops, therefore there is no inſtance to be found there of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining under their other title, that of preſbyters? Or thus, becauſe the ſcripture never calls miniſters by one of their common names, i. e. biſhops, when acting in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; is it a neceſſary conſequence that it never calls them by their other common name, preſbyters, when acting in that buſineſs? Is it not poſſible that the ſame office in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may be commonly denominated and known by either of the names, biſhop or preſbyter indifferently, and yet only one of theſe names, conſtantly uſed and applied to him, when acting in the buſineſs of ordination? But now this is what his argument proves, or elſe it proves nothing. The truth is, he has, either ignorantly or deſignedly, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the terms in his ſyllogiſm, ſo that his concluſion contains more in it than his premiſes, which all logicians call, falſe reaſoning. His argument reduced to mode and figure, runs thus, <q>Biſhop and preſbyter in ſcripture ſignify the ſame office. No inſtance is to be found there of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by any perſon under the name of biſhop</q> This is his major and minor propoſition. His concluſion is,— <q>Therefore there is no inſtance of an ordination perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a preſbyter.</q> Whereas, had he kept to the terms in his minor propoſition, his concluſion muſt have been, "Therefore there is no inſtance of an ordination performed "<hi>by any perſon under the name preſbyter.</hi> Had he done this, his readers would at once have ſeen the weakneſs and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of his argument.</p>
            <p>IN England. biſhop, and lord-ſpiritual are ſynonimous terms. Now ſhould I undertake to prove, that there is no account in the engliſh hiſtory, of an ordination performed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010800_0018_0F81D1B59CA04710"/>by a biſhop, and in order to it, make uſe of this argument. —Biſhop and lord-ſpiritual ſignify the ſame office: But there is no account in hiſtory, of an ordination performed by any perſon under the title of lord-ſpiritual; therefore there is no account of one performed by a biſhop; and from hence ſhould infer, the invalidity of epiſcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Mr. L. I preſume, would hardly allow the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be good. And yet it is the ſame he has uſed in this caſe, and full as concluſive. However, weak as it is, it ſeems it wrought full conviction in his mind: For he tells us <q>he is fully perſuaded, at that time in which the ſcriptures were wrote, none had power to ordain mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Chriſt's kingdom, but thoſe only, who <hi>in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> are called <hi>apoſtles.</hi>
               </q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 9.</note> But then what becomes of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Timothy? Mr. L. has ſpent a conſiderable part of his book in attempting to prove, the divine right of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, from the inſtance of Timothy biſhop of Epheſus. Yea it is the moſt plauſible argument, and indeed the only thing in his piece that deſerves the name of an argument. But if <q>none had power to ordain miniſters in Chriſt's kingdom, but thoſe only, who are <hi>in ſcripture</hi> called <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi>
               </q> Timothy certainly had no power to ordain, for he is never once called an <hi>apoſtle</hi> in the whole ſcripture, as I ſhall have occaſion more particularly to ſhew anon: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all pretence to ſupport his ſcheme from this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is to no purpoſe. Tho' therefore I might now fairly diſmiſs the controverſy, as decided in our favour by his own confeſſion; Yet not to take advantage of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of his, I ſhall conſider the argument when I come to it. In the mean time I intirely agree with him in what follows in this paragraph: "That the biſhops in the church of England, do not anſwer, to thoſe that are promiſcuouſly called, either biſhops or preſbyters <q>in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q> I add, neither do they, to any order inſtituted in ſcripture. Dioceſan biſhops, ſuch as obtain in that church, are ſo far from being of divine inſtitution, that they are doubtleſs <hi>mere creatures of the ſtate,</hi> what the goſpel knows nothing of,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:010800_0018_0F81D1B59CA04710"/>
AND ſo I am ready to attend upon his next obſervation, which is this, <q>That diſſenters (preſbyterians he ſhould have ſaid) are not agreed among themſelves about the orders of the miniſtry,—ſome holding to one order, others to two, and others again to three, &amp;c.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 9.</note> But what then? ſhall we mend the matter, in point of unity, or in the leaſt better ourſelves, by going over to the church of England? By no means. Epiſcopalians are really as much divided in ſentiment in this reſpect, as thoſe he calls <hi>diſſenters.</hi> Thus ſome of them abſolutely deny that any particular form of government or order, is eſtabliſhed in ſcripture, but the whole is left to the civil magiſtrate.<note n="‖" place="bottom">This in particular was the opinion of their celebrated Hooker. His words are, <q>The neceſſity of polity, and regimen, in all churches, may be held, without holding any one certain form to be neceſſary in them all; and the general principles are ſuch, as do not particularly deſcribe any one, but ſundry forms of diſcipline may be equally conſiſtent with the general axioms of ſcripture.</q>
                  <bibl>Pref. Eccl. Pol. p. 2.</bibl> 19.20. And to this agree, Stellingfleet, Edwards, &amp;c.</note> Others agian think, with us, that there are only two ſtanding orders of officers, biſhops or preſbyters, and deacons, to be found there.<note n="†" place="bottom">Of this opinion were the biſhops Cranmer, Jewel, Willer, and Stillingfleet, and indeed the main body of the engliſh clergy with the king and parliament, at the time of the reformation, as I proved in my ſermon, from the book called "the inſtitution of a chriſtian man, which was expresſly approved by them all. The words are theſe, <q>In the new teſtament there is no mention of any other degrees or diſtinctions in orders, but of deacons or miniſters, and presbters or biſhops.</q>
                  <bibl>Burn. Hiſt. Refor. Vol. 1 p. 324.</bibl>
               </note> This has always been the opinion of the more moderate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians in England; and therefore tho' they conform to the church of England, they do it, not as being of divine inſtitution, but as eſtabliſhed by the king and parliament. And others, with Mr. L. and his flighty brethren, aſſert the three orders of biſhops, prieſts and deacons, as of divine appointment: Theſe plead the abſolute neceſſity of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ordination, and reject all the proteſtant world who are without it. I might add, that there have been other advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for prelacy, who have pleaded, with equal zeal, for the ſeveral orders of acolyths, lectors, ſubdeacons, archdeacons, chiroepiſcopi, archbiſhops, patriarchs, and the Roman hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erarchicks,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010800_0019_0F81D1B65513C468"/>for the pope, as Peter's ſucceſſor, at the head of all.— <q>We may ſee then, (to uſe his own phraſe) the queſtion under debate, cannot be decided by theſe men; for they are not agreed among themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT how does he prove "that diſſenters are not agreed" in this point? Why he tells us, <q>ſome never ordain their deacons," and theſe of courſe "hold, that Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but one order, preſbyters.</q> But how does this follow? He himſelf ſuppoſes the biſhop is a different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their church, and appointed by Chriſt. And yet, as far as I can learn, he has properly no new ordination when appointed biſhop, but only what they call a conſecration to the epiſcopal office. Tho' therefore ſome of our churches ſuppoſe, that ſince the civil magiſtrate now takes care of the poor, which, in times of perſecution, was the deacon's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, there is no neceſſity of a formal ordination to that office; it will by no means infer a denial of his being an officer in the church, of divine appointment. We all, I preſume, are agreed that the deacon is an officer of divine appointment, (tho' not inſtituted by Chriſt, as Mr. L has it, but by his apoſtles:) and that, whether we ordain him or not. He was therefore quite miſtaken in affirming, that we hold to but one order of officers as of divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>BUT then if ſome <hi>diſſenters</hi> hold to but one, and others to two, there are others again, he tells us, <q>that hold to three orders of miniſters in the kingdom of Chriſt.</q> And for this he quotes Mr. Calvin. But how came Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, pray, to be a <hi>diſſenter?</hi> He was indeed a <hi>diſſenter</hi> from the church of Rome: And (I hope) ſo is Mr. L. too. But from the church of England he never was a <hi>diſſenter,</hi> for he never belonged to it. Our epiſcopalians, indeed, warmly contended, in years paſt, that the church of England eſtabliſhment extends to America, and conſequently that all who refuſe to conform to it, are <hi>diſſenters.</hi> But the higheſt ſticklers for uniformity among them, never, that I know of, pretended to carry the claim to <hi>Geneva,</hi> before Mr. L. It ſeems his head is ſo turned againſt <hi>diſſenters,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:010800_0019_0F81D1B65513C468"/>ſince he has renounced our communion, and become a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateſt, that he is ready to faſten the approbrious character, upon every one, who happens to differ from him. Beſides, according to him, Calvin was no diſſenter; for he held to the three orders of "biſhops, preſbyters, and deacons." I have examined the place in Calvin's inſtitutions, from whence Mr. L. pretends to make his quotation, and boldly affirm there are no ſuch words there. The ſentence truly quoted, is this, <q>As we have declared that there are three ſorts of miniſters commended unto us in ſcripture; ſo all the miniſters that the old church had, is divided into three orders.</q> Then follows; not <q>
                  <hi>biſhops, preſbyters and deacons,</hi> as added by our author: But theſe words; For out of the order of elders, were partly choſen <hi>paſtors and teachers;</hi> the reſt of them had the rule of judgment, and correction of manners. To the <hi>deacons</hi> was committed the care of the poor, and the diſtributing the alms.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Calv. inſt. lib. 4. c. 4. ſec. 1.</note> This plainly ſhews what Calvin's judgment was: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides paſtors and deacons, there was the office of ruling el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as practiſed in the church of Scotland. But now what is this to "biſhops, preſbyters and deacons," as quoted by Mr. L.? This is not the only time, he has uſed the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the authors he pretends to quote, of making them ſpeak what they never intended.</p>
            <p>BUT he tells us, <q>In ſcripture we find mention made of <hi>apoſtles, preſbyters,</hi> and <hi>deacons,</hi> and why they ſhould be ſo carefully diſtinguiſhed when ever they are mentioned in ſcripture, if there was not a ſubordination in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſeems very ſtrange.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 9:</note>—Anſwer. Barely theſe names being mentioned, or even <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> in ſcripture, will not prove, that they mean different orders in the church, of ſtanding continuance. If ſo, we ſhall find, not only <hi>three,</hi> but <hi>five</hi> orders in ſcripture. There we are told, <q>that when Chriſt aſcended, he gave, not only apoſtles and prophets and evangeliſts, but alſo paſtors and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 4.10.</note> Here are five different names of church-officers mentioned and theſe <hi>as particularly</hi> and <hi>carefully diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as thoſe he has mentioned: And if to theſe we add,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010800_0020_0F81D1B7278E6F30"/>preſbyters and deacons, two of the number mentioned by him, and which are not included in the above five; we ſhall, inſtead of <hi>three,</hi> have no leſs than <hi>ſeven</hi> different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, all as <hi>particularly mentioned</hi> and as <hi>carefully diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> as thoſe <hi>three</hi> mentioned by him.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, that there is mention made, in ſcripture, of apoſtles, presbyters and deacons, is readily granted. 'Tis further conceded, that presbyters and deacons, ſignify two diſtinct offices in the church. Finally, it is allowed, that apoſtles are ſuperior to them both. But then they are ſo, only conſidered in their extraordinary character, as apoſtles, in which, as I ſhall ſhew more fully hereafter, they have no ſucceſſors, and ſo all that remain are only the presbyters and deacons, about which there is no diſpute.</p>
            <p>HE goes on.—<q>Let it be carefully remarked, that thoſe who were commiſſioned to ſend others, were called <hi>apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> in the time when the new-teſtament was penned.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 10.</note> But then what becomes of Timothy and Titus again? His main argument for the biſhop's ſole power of ordination, depends upon Timothy and Titus, being the biſhops at Epheſus and Crete. But as they are never called <hi>apoſtles</hi> in ſcripture; it muſt unavoidably follow, either, that they never were biſhops, and ſo his main argument for epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is demoliſhed: Or if they were, then what he here ſo often affirms, is not true.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THE word biſhop, he tells us, being uſed to expreſs the <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> no more altered the office, than the word, <hi>chriſtian,</hi> altered the profeſſion of <hi>believers.</hi>
               </q> Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But then there is this material difference in the two caſes: The latter was done in the apoſtles times: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by his own confeſſion in times poſterior. The name, <hi>believer,</hi> was changed into that of <hi>chriſtian,</hi> by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts 11.26. CHREMATISAI.</note> Whereas no ſuch heavenly warrant is pretended for changing the name <hi>apoſtle,</hi> into <hi>biſhop.</hi> If he will but juſt reconcile this <hi>material</hi> difference; I will allow the two caſes to be parrallel. Till then, he muſt excuſe me, if I think his compariſon nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>BUT he goes on to tells us, in his margin, from Euſebius
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010800_0020_0F81D1B7278E6F30"/>and Theodoret, that biſhops are the apoſtles ſucceſſors — I anſwer. If he only means that they are ſucceſſors to them, in their ordinary capacity, as goſpel miniſters, we have no diſpute with him, upon that head. In that ſenſe, we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all goſpel miniſters are ſucceſſors to the apoſtles, as I largely ſhewed in my ſermon.

               <hi>SECT. IV.</hi> Dr. Chauncy's ſermon vindicated from the exceptions contained in the "defence of epiſcopacy,"—from <hi>p. 11. to 24.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter upon a vindication of the Dr's ſermon, from the exceptions of another, it concerns me to do him juſtice, in one particular, in which I have, inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, miſrepreſented him myſelf.</p>
            <p>IN page 67 of my ſermon, I had theſe words; <q>And altho' the above learned writer, (meaning the Dr.) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts Ignatius out of the number of the primitive writers in his account, and owns, that the epiſtles aſcribed to him, <hi>ſpeak very fully in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN I wrote this ſentence, I had my mind upon what the Dr. ſays, in p. 71 of his ſermon: But upon reviewing the paſſage, I find, I miſtook his meaning. His words are, not <q>that thoſe epiſtles ſpeak very fully in favour of dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan epiſcopacy:" But "that they do, as certainly, as
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010800_0021_0F81D1B732F96488"/>ſtrongly, and as conſtantly, <hi>diſtinguiſh biſhops from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> as any of the writings of the third and fourth centuries.</q> Now all that the Dr. aſſerts is, that theſe epiſtles <hi>point out a diſtinction of order between biſhop and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter:</hi> And upon reading what Mr. Boyſe has wrote, in his "clear account of the ancient epiſcopacy," in which he has every thing contained in theſe epiſtles, relative to the ſubject; I am fully convinced, that the biſhop deſcribed in theſe epiſtles, even in the preſent ſtate of them, is very different from the <hi>dioceſan biſhop.</hi> The Ignatian biſhop, was merely a parochial one, having no more than a ſingle congregation for his charge, with presbyters under him: Whereas the dioceſan one, has many ſcores or hundreds of ſuch congregations in his cure. The interpolations and adulterations in theſe epiſtles, were doubtleſs made, before the biſhops power was inlarged, ſo as to comprehend a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pariſhes in his dioceſs.—Having thus corrected my own miſtake; I proceed to perform the ſame friendly office as to Mr. L.</p>
            <p>AS a direct proof of ordination by presbyters, the Dr. had mentioned, the inſtance of Saul and Barnabas being ſeperated to the work of the miniſtry, by certain prophets and teachers, as recorded, Acts XIII. beginning. As this is ſo very expreſs and circumſtantial an account, of a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the work of the miniſtry; as all the ſolemn acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contained in ordination, are here ſo particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; and as this is ſaid to be done, not by apoſtles or biſhops, but by the ordinary paſtors of the church, here called prophets and teachers; Mr. L. ſeems to be at a loſs what reply to make to it. He, at firſt, ſeems to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to the nature of this action; at a loſs what name to give it. "If, ſays he, this was an ordination:"—<q>If this was a <hi>real</hi> ordination, then,</q> &amp;c. Finally, he denies it to be an ordination. <q>Whatever is meant, ſays he, by this deſignation, it was not an ordination.</q> 
               <q>In truth this was not an ordination.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 11.</note> He found himſelf ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this inſtance, that he had no way to get rid of the argument, but by flatly denying it to be an ordination.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010800_0021_0F81D1B732F96488"/>And indeed, this was the only courſe he could take to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his ſcheme. For if this be once granted to be a real ordination, the indiſputable right of preſbyters, to act in this buſineſs, is firmly eſtabliſhed, and all pretences of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of it to a ſuperior order, muſt be given up. I ſhall therefore offer a few obſervations, to prove that this was, in fact, an ordination; and then make ſome remarks upon Mr. L.'s objections againſt its being conſidered as ſuch.</p>
            <p>NOW by ordination, I conclude, is meant, a ſolemn ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, or ſetting a part to an office in the church, by ſuch as have authority to do it, and that, in the uſe of thoſe rites or actions, the ſcripture has appointed in this caſe. The ſcripture rites of ordination, are faſting, prayer, and the impoſition of hands. In this way the ſeven deacons were introduced into office,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 6 6.</note> which Mr. L. owns to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In the ſame way Timothy was ordained<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 14.</note> And in the ſame way he is directed to ordain others.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. v 22.</note> And this has been the general method of introducing men into the miniſtry, in all ſubſequent ages. But now, all theſe things concurred in the inſtance under conſideration. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons acting in it, were church officers of Antioch, <q>
                  <hi>prophets and teachers.</hi>
               </q> What they undertook to do was to <q>
                  <hi>ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Saul and Barnabas to the work of the miniſtry, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gentiles.</q> This was done by the direction of the holy Ghoſt; <q>ſeperate me Barnabas and Saul to the work whereunto I have called them;</q> that is, to the work of the miniſtry, eſpecially among the gentiles, <q>to whom they were now ſent.</q> The thing therefore to be done, beyond diſpute, was to ſeperate theſe two men to the work of the goſpel miniſtry. How this was done, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count inform, us; <q>For when they had faſted 'and prayed and laid their hands on them, they ſent them away.</q> As every action, every circumſtance pertaining to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is here ſo very particularly and expresſly found; if, after all, this was not an ordination, I diſpair of ever finding one, in ſcripture of any where elſe. And what ſtill further confirms the matter, if it needs further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is, that if I am not much miſtaken, the apoſtle Paul
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010800_0022_0F81D1B81C868550"/>himſelf acknowledges it to be ſo. In his inſcription of his epiſtle to the Romans, chap. 1. v. 1. he has theſe words, <q>Paul a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, called to be an apoſtle, <hi>ſeperated</hi> to the goſpel of God.</q> He here evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to give himſelf, his true and proper character, of an apoſtle, and miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. He therefore parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mentions, both his <hi>call</hi> to the apoſtleſhip, and his <hi>ſeperation</hi> to the goſpel miniſtry. By the former, he moſt likely means, that immediate call from heaven, of which in Acts ix. Then it was he was <hi>called to be an apoſtle.</hi> But we find nothing in ſcripture anſwering to this other part of his character, viz. his <hi>ſeperation to the goſpel of God,</hi> unleſs it was this <hi>ſeperation</hi> we are now conſidering. And it is worthy of remark, the word in both places is the ſame, both in the original, and alſo in our tranſlation. In Acts 13th, <q>The holy Ghoſt ſaid, APHORISATE, <hi>ſeperate me Barnabas &amp; Saul to the work whereunto I have called them.</hi>
               </q> In Rom. 1.1. The apoſtle ſays he <q>was, APHORISMENOS, <hi>ſeperate to the goſpel of God.</hi>
               </q> Does it not appear highly probable, that when the apoſtle wrote theſe laſt mentioned words, he had his mind particularly upon the action we are conſidering? I confeſs I ſee no other ſenſe in which they can be well interpreted. And if ſo, we have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, even of the apoſtle himſelf, that this was, in fact an ordination.</p>
            <p>TO this Mr. L. objects, <q>that if theſe prophets &amp; teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were preſbyters, ſo were Barnabas and Saul. And if this was an ordination, they, who were before preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, were ordained to a ſuperior office; which, he ſays, is granting the thing they contend for.</q> I in office, as apoſtles; yet there is no account, that either they, or indeed any others, had been formally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into office, as ſtanding miniſters in the church, by the impoſition of hands, till now. They, and the reſt of the apoſtles, had hitherto, exerciſed their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, principally among the Jews. But now, that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was to be ſent to the Gentiles, and churches gathered and ſettled among them, upon a plan which was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010800_0022_0F81D1B81C868550"/>after the times of inſpiration were over, even to the end of the world; it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, to order, that they ſhould be ſet apart, by the ſolemn rite of ordination, as a ſtanding pattern for theſe future ages. This, as Dr. Chauncy obſerved, was the opinion of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed epiſcopal writer, Dr. Lightfoot. <q>No better reaſon, ſays he, can be given of this preſent action; than that the Lord did hereby, ſet down a platform of ordaining miniſters, to the church of the Gentiles in former times.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. 1. p. 189.</note> This being the caſe, it will by no means follow, that, <q>if this was an ordination, they were ordained to a ſuperior office,</q> as he ſuppoſes. Tho' they were in office before, they had been only "called to be <hi>apoſtles;</hi>" whereas now, they were "<hi>ſeperated</hi> to the goſpel of God," by ordination, that ſo they might, both have a public authentic character, and exhibit a pattern to be followed, in all ſucceeding ages. Had Mr. L.'s head been leſs crowded, with the unſcriptural ideas of <hi>ſuperiority</hi> and inferiority of orders in the miniſtry, he might have recollected, that even <hi>reordination</hi> itſelf, does not neceſſarily <q>advance a man to a ſuperior office in the church.</q> He doubtleſs knows ſundry of his brethren in America, who have been twice ordained: Once, <q>by the hands of the preſbytery,</q> according to ſcripture pattern, and then again by the biſhop, after they conformed to his church: And yet I ſuppoſe, he acknowledges them ſtill, as ſuſtaining no higher office, than that of preſbyters. Tho' according to his argument, he ought, in all reaſon, to look upon them as dignitaries in the church; <q>for who, (to uſe his own words) ever heard, that a preſbyter was ordained, unleſs it was, to advance him to a higher ſtation in the church?</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, <q>In truth, ſays he, this was not an ordination; but an action of the ſame nature with that Gal ii. 9. When James, Cephas and John,</q> &amp;c. It is well ſince he will not allow this to be an ordination, he has at laſt found what it is. It ſeems then, that it was <q>giving the right hand of fellowſhip:</q> For that is what was done in the inſtance to which he compares it. Now giving the right hand of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010800_0023_0F81D1B8B6BB2F48"/>fellowſhip, as it is a public declaration and ſign, that the perſon to whom it is given, is now received into a copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip of power and office with the givers, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuppoſe that the perſons giving, are at leaſt, equal in power with him who receives it. Conſequently if what was now done, was, as he ſays, giving the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Barnabas and Saul, it will follow that theſe prophets and teachers were at leaſt equal in power to Barnabas and Saul. Since therefore Mr. L. allows the ordaining power to the latter, it muſt equally belong to the former, whether they did in fact exerciſe it at this time or no; and then the validity of ordination by preſbyters will of courſe follow.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. If theſe two actions are, as he ſays, both of the ſame nature, then it will follow, that the perſons acting in both were of the ſame office, or indu'd with equal power: But thoſe who gave the right hand, in Gal. ii. 9. viz. James, Cephas and John, were undoubtedly veſted with the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, for they were apoſtles: Conſequently the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and teachers, who acted in the other inſtance, muſt be veſted with the ſame power of ordination too, whether they actually exerciſed it at this time or not.</p>
            <p>MR. L. has one objection more to this inſtance of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is this, <q>Whatever is meant by this deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was not ordination to impower Paul, for—it is beyond all diſpute that Paul and Barnabas officiated as public miniſters of Chriſt, long before this pretended or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 11, 12.</note> Anſwer; if they did, it was as apoſtles, by virtue of their extraordinary call; not as ordinary mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in the gentile church, of ſtanding continuance, by the impoſition of hands in ordination. Tho' therefore with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the former, <q>they were, as he ſays, <hi>apoſtles, not of men, neither by man;</hi>
               </q> yet in the latter ſenſe, they received their deſignation from men, as others now do, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands in a proper ordination. Their <q>officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as public miniſters before,</q> by virtue of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary call, no more proves that this was not an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; than the eleven apoſtles ſo officiating, by virtue of a temporary miſſion from Chriſt in his life time, will prove
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010800_0023_0F81D1B8B6BB2F48"/>the commiſſion, he gave them after his reſurrection, was no commiſſion. Mr. L. allows that the commiſſion recorded in Mat. 28.19. and John 20.21. was that which authorized the apoſtles to act as miniſters. And yet we know that Chriſt ordained the twelve apoſtles, and ſent them forth to preach, long before he gave them this commiſſion.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt. x. Mark iii. 14.</note> If therefore the eleven apoſtles ſo officiating in Chriſt's life time, does not prove the commiſſion he gave them after his reſurrection, to be no commiſſion; neither will Barnabas &amp; Saul's ſo officiating before this, prove that this was no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination.</p>
            <p>THIS objection indeed the Dr. largely conſidered and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in his ſermon. He there obſerved, that tho' <q>Paul and Barnabas were before this, commiſſioned miniſters of Chriſt;</q> yet this would by no means prove that they did not now receive a proper ordination. <q>For the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ordination, is not that the ordainers ſhould commiſſion perſons to do the work of the miniſtry. This is done by Chriſt. It only belongs to them to declare who theſe perſons are, and to ſeperate them to the work to which Chriſt has commiſſioned them. They don't make them miniſters, but being authorized hereto, give them an authentic character as ſuch, in the eye of the world, &amp;c. "As in the caſe of the mayor of a city, the king's charter of incorporation grants the power; the burgeſſes and the recorder only indigitate the proper recipient of it, and put him legally into the execution of his office.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dud. loc. p. 10, 32, 33. The judicious Hooker, as he is called, fully agrees with Dr. Chauncy in his notion of ordination. He defines it, "a ſolemn admittance;" and ſays, <q>the only true and proper act of ordination is, <hi>to inveſt</hi> men with that power which doth make them miniſters, by conſecrating their perſons to God and his ſervice in holy things. Such men do hold their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>from God (who ſhould give them commiſſion but he?</hi>) whether they be ſuch as himſelf immediately, or the church in his name, inveſteth.</q>
                  <bibl>Eccl. pol. 124, 410, 435.</bibl>
               </note> But the Dr. is miſtaken, ſays Mr L. in ſuppoſing that the mayor receives his commiſſion from the king. He receives it, he tells us, not from the king, <q>but from the perſons who give him the corporation oath.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 15.</note> In like manner, he argues, miniſters receive their commiſſion, not from Chriſt,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010800_0024_0F81D1B970AA5020"/>but from thoſe that ordain them <q>It is true, he ſays, that all power in the church of Chriſt is originally derived from him. When Chriſt was here upon earth, he reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of <hi>making officers,</hi> in his kingdom, to himſelf alone: When he was about to aſcend to heaven, he told a number of his diſciples, that all power, &amp;c.</q> That is, if I underſtand him, tho' the great head of the church, while he was upon earth, kept the power of <hi>making officers</hi> in his own hand, yet when he aſcended into heaven he delegated this power to his apoſtles and their ſucceſſors. 'Tis pity Mr. L. had not told us, how much of this power <hi>of making officers</hi> in the church, is now delegated to the biſhops; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, or only a part of it; or in what ſenſe it is now in the hands of the biſhops, whether <hi>deſpotically</hi> or abſolutely, or only <hi>miniſterially.</hi> If it be only in the latter ſenſe in them, then they are only Chriſt's miniſters or inſtruments in introducing men into office, and inveſting them with the powers of Chriſt's commiſſion, as the Dr. aſſerted, and ſo don't properly <hi>give</hi> the commiſſion, but only <hi>indigitate</hi> or point out the recipient of it. All therefore they have to do in the caſe, is only to judge of the qualifications of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be ordained, and give them a ſolemn admiſſion to the exerciſe of their office, by faſting, prayer and the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands. The commiſſion therefore is not from them, but from Chriſt. But if this power delegated to the biſhops, be <hi>deſpotical,</hi> as Mr. L. muſt ſuppoſe, or elſe what he here ſays is nothing to his purpoſe: If it be true, as he ſeems to intimate, that biſhops now, have the ſame power of <hi>making officers</hi> in the church, as Chriſt had when here upon earth; then it will follow, that no miniſters of the goſpel, ſince Chriſt's aſcention into heaven, can be ſaid to receive their commiſſion or authority from him, but from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers: As therefore in the caſe of a city-mayor; if, as our author aſſerts, he receives his commiſſion, not from the king's charter, but from the recorder, and is therefore not the king's officer, but his who gave him his oath; ſo in this caſe, if miniſters now, do not receive their commiſſion from Chriſt, but from thoſe to whom he has delegated this
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010800_0024_0F81D1B970AA5020"/>power of <hi>making officers</hi> in his church, that is, according to Mr. L. the biſhops; then they are no longer Chriſt's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but the biſhop's who gave them commiſſion, and conſequently they ought to preach, baptize, &amp;c. not in the name of Chriſt, but of the biſhop, whoſe miniſters they are, and who gave them their authority.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, as Chriſt <hi>had all power in heaven and earth,</hi> &amp; ſo was under no limitation as to the exerciſe of this power in <hi>making officers</hi> in his church, but might, if he had ſeen fit, multiplied theſe officers, and, inſtead of two, appointed twenty, or two hundred different kinds or orders: So from this principle of Mr. L.'s, it will follow, that not only the apoſtles but their ſucceſſors in office, to whom Chriſt has delegated this power of <hi>making officers,</hi> have the ſame unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited authority alſo, in this reſpect as he had: That they are not confined to any particular number of orders, in the exerciſe of this their <hi>office making</hi> power; but may appoint and eſtabliſh, as many different orders and degrees as they pleaſe; and inſtead of three orders in the church, might have three hundred or three thouſand. For Chriſt had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly this power. And indeed this is the ſenſe of the romiſh church upon this point. The pope, in virtue of his being ſucceſſor to Peter, is, according to them, not only infallible, but is veſted with all the plentitude of the power that Chriſt had, in this reſpect. And it is by this plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of power, with which he is veſted, not only that he has conſtituted that great variety of orders, found among their clergy; but alſo raiſed thoſe they call biſhops, above preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the church. According to the doctrine of that church, biſhops are ſuperior to preſbyters, not by <hi>divine right,</hi> but merely as advanced to this ſuperior dignity by the plentitude of the pope's power.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Burn. Hiſt. Refor. Vol. I. p. 366. Dr. Willet ſynop. pap. p. 269, 272, 281.</note> But,</p>
            <p>THE truth of the caſe is, thoſe words, <q>as my father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</q> on which our author founds the biſhop's power of <hi>making officers</hi> in the church, have no direct reference to the power of ordination at all. They only imply, that as Chriſt received his commiſſion imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010800_0025_0F81D1BA32FBBA30"/>from the father; ſo he did immediately ſend them to diſciple all nations, and teach them whatever he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. But this by no means implies, that whatever power Chriſt had himſelf, he inveſted his apoſtles with, or gave them the ſame authority and dominion in his church, that belonged to him. His power was <hi>deſpotical;</hi> theirs only <hi>miniſterial;</hi> and he himſelf warned them againſt aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any more. Mat. 20.25, &amp;c. He did not therefore make over to them a <hi>deſpotical</hi> authority of commiſſioning others, but only a <hi>miniſterial</hi> authority of inveſting ſuch with the office, his <hi>charter</hi> ſhould authorize &amp; oblige thereto.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus vindicated Dr. Chauncy's notion of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, from Mr. L.'s exceptions, I am now prepared to anſwer the queſtions he has ſeen fit to propoſe.—He aſks, <q>how the ordainers are to know in theſe times, that Chriſt has commiſſioned theſe men, as his miniſters, whom they let into the miniſtry?</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 14.</note> I anſwer.</p>
            <p>AS the Dr. no where ſays that men are inveſted with Chriſt's commiſſion, before ordination, as the queſtion ſeems to intimate; He ought rather to aſk, "how the ordainers are to know who are proper to be ordained, or veſted with Chriſt's commiſſion, and declared lawful miniſters?—And here the anſwer is eaſy. They are to know it by the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate's profeſſing an inclination to enter into the miniſtry, his being upon examination, found qualified for it, and, (in caſe he is to take the charge of a particular church) his being choſen and invited by the church to take the paſtoral charge of them. All who have theſe qualifications and this call, the ordainers may know are ſuch, as ought to be introduced into office in the church, and as ſuch may ſafely ordain them.</p>
            <p>AGAIN he aſks, <q>What teſtimony is given to the world, that the perſons he (the Dr.) has ordained, are the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt?</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">ibid.</note> Anſwer.—Their public ordination is a ſufficient evidence in this caſe. This, the Dr. had told him was the deſign of ordination. Not for the ordainers, properly ſpeaking, to authorize and impower them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but <q>to declare who the perſons were that Chriſt's
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010800_0025_0F81D1BA32FBBA30"/>commiſſion has impowered.</q> Not to <hi>make them officers,</hi> as Mr. L. would have it: But <q>to give them an authentic character, as ſuch, in the eye of the world.</q> And as this, with us, is done in a very public manner, it muſt be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evident to thoſe who attend the ſolemnity. And as to others, I hope, a certificate from the ordaining council pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly atteſted, will be deemed as good evidence, in our caſe, as the biſhop's licence and letter of orders are in that of Mr. L. and his brethren. We, no more than they, <q>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or deſire people ſhould believe in this caſe, without evidence.</q> If they can produce ſufficient teſtimony that their miniſters are ordained, we, I preſume, can eaſily do the ſame as to ours, notwithſtanding this <hi>fleer</hi> of Mr. L. to prejudice people againſt us. <q>And therefore, to uſe his words to the Dr. I hope he will now ſee his error &amp; retract it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have endeavoured particularly to anſwer every objection brought againſt this inſtance of Paul's &amp; Barnabas's ſeperation, and, I preſume, ſufficiently proved it to be a real &amp; proper ordination. That it was ſo, was the declared opinion of Chryſoſtom, one of the fathers. He aſſerts that <q>Paul was ordained at Antioch,</q> and that this is the ſenſe of Acts 13.1—3.*. Biſhop Taylor was of the ſame ſentiment, as I ſhewed in my ſermon. The ſame was the opinion of Dr. Lightfoot and Dr. Hammond, two celebrated writers of the epiſcopal ſide.* And Mr. Ollyffe another of them, in his diſpute with Mr. Calamy, brings this very text in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of reordination.<note n="*" place="bottom">As quoted by Euſch, ine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mat p. 43.</note> Finally, <q>in the book of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſed in the church of England, (as my author ſays, for I have not the book by me) the order for conſecrating biſhops, alledges the very fact we have been conſidering, as an example or precedent.</q>* This ſhews that the church of England looks upon this as a proper ordination, however ſome of her zealous ſons, for ſpecial reaſons, are tempted to deny it. But let it be called by what name it will, it is indubitably an expreſs and very circumſtantial inſtance, of perſons being ſeperated, and ſent forth to the work of the goſpel miniſtry, which is all the ſcripture means by ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And as this was confeſſedly done, not by officers of
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010800_0026_0F81D1BAECCD9EA8"/>a ſuperior character, not by apoſtles or biſhops, but by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or preſbyters, it muſt be conſidered as a proper ſcripture pattern of preſbyterian ordination, and a proof that ſuch ordination is valid.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED now to conſider what Mr. L. has to ſay, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other inſtance of preſbyterian ordination in ſcripture, as mentioned by the Dr. viz. that of Timothy, 1 Tim. iv. 14. <q>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the <hi>preſbytery.</hi>
               </q> This, the Dr. mentioned, as an expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ordination by preſbyters, and very fully anſwered all the objections commonly urged againſt it by epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians. Nor do I find any material one added by Mr. L. He indeed tells us <q>the text ſays, Timothy was not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by preſbyters, but by prophecy.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 19.</note> I anſwer: It does not ſay in ſo many words, he was <hi>ordained</hi> by either. The word, <hi>ordained,</hi> not being mentioned. But then, the thing ſignifying ordination; the rite univerſally in uſe, in ſetting men apart to the miniſtry, viz. <hi>impoſition of bands,</hi> is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mentioned, and expresſly ſaid to be performed, not by an apoſtle, not by an officer of a ſuperior character, nor yet by <hi>prophecy;</hi> but by the <hi>preſbytery.</hi> His ſaying therefore "that Timothy was ordained by <hi>prophecy,</hi>" a phraſe to which he, nor no man elſe can affix any determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate idea, could be with no other view, than to confuſe the minds of his readers, and perplex an argument, which he found himſelf unable fairly to anſwer. Had he attended to what the Dr. had obſerved, concerning the gift, here ſaid to be given to Timothy, by prophecy, it might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his impoſing upon his readers, and betraying his own ignorance in the interpretation he has given of this text. At the ſame time, it would have ſaved him the trouble of repeating that other objection, ſo particularly anſwered by the Dr. viz. that Paul was concerned in Timothy's ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The word <hi>gift,</hi> here ſaid <q>to be given to Timothy by prophecy,</q> &amp;c. Mr. L. inſiſts, is the ſame in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal with that mentioned II Tim. i. 6. as given by the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Paul's hands. The Dr. allows it is. He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010800_0026_0F81D1BAECCD9EA8"/>allows the ſame thing to be ſignified, in both texts, viz. the extraordinary gifts of the holy Ghoſt. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that theſe were communicated to Timothy by Paul's hands only. For after mentioning the text in queſtion, he ſays, <q>The meaning of the words, compared with what is ſaid upon the matter in II Tim. i. 6. may be fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the following paraphraſe, "Improve the gift of the holy Ghoſt, which I imparted to you, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meaſure, according to the prophecies which went before concerning you, when you was ſeperated to the work of the miniſtry, with the laying on of the hands of the conſiſtory of preſbyters.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dad. lec p. 36.</note> In this paraphraſe is fairly and methodically included, every thing contained in both texts, concerning Timothy's ordination, and the gift here ſaid to be imparted to him. The <hi>gift,</hi> in both places, ſignifies, the extraordinary HARISMETA or gifts of the holy Ghoſt. Theſe, the Dr. allows were conferred by the impoſition of Paul's hands only, as mentioned in II Tim. i. 6. This was given by <hi>prophecy;</hi> that is agreeable to, or in conſequence of the prophecies, which the apoſtle ſays I Tim. i. 18. went before concerning Timothy. Holy men prophetically ſpeaking by inſpiration, of him, as a fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to receive this gift, and in conſequence, to be put into the miniſtry; to which ſervice he is here, in I Tim. iv. 14. ſaid to be ſeperated, by the impoſition of the hands of the preſbytery, in ordination. This makes both the accounts, perfectly conſiſtent, which no other interpretation, perhaps, can do. To be ſure that given by Mr. L. is very far from doing it. Indeed, as in the forementioned inſtance of Paul and Barnabas; ſo alſo in this of Timothy, he ſeems very loth to allow, that ordination is intended by the impoſition of hands. "If, ſays he, this was an ordination." Again, "If this was an ordination, then," &amp;c. It is eaſy to ſee, in both theſe inſtances, what were his reaſons for expreſſing himſelf ſo doubtfully in the caſe. If theſe were allowed to be proper ordinations, he was fully ſenſible, all he could ſay, would be inſufficient to weaken the force of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brought from them, in favour of preſbyterian ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:010800_0027_0F81D1BBE2F7A130"/>And therefore he endeavours to perſuade his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that it is, at leaſt doubtful, whether ordination is the thing intended. But as the evidence in the caſe is ſo full; as every thing included in ordination is more particularly and expresſly mentioned, in theſe two inſtances, than in any others recorded in the new-teſtament; and I may add, as there can certainly be found no inſtance of an ordination in the whole bible, if theſe are not allowed to be ſuch; Mr. L. ſeems not quite willing, after all, to hazard the iſſue of the controverſy, upon a bare denial of this fact: But thinks it concerns him to ſhew, that if this was an ordination, yet it was not performed by preſbyters. And the only argument he brings for the purpoſe, is, "that the word <hi>preſbytery,</hi> "here, does not ſignify a number of <hi>preſbyters.</hi> His words are; <q>It ſeems, the Dr. takes it for granted, that a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery means a number of preſbyters only. Calling a number of preſbyters, a preſbytery, does not prove that St. Paul means the ſame, when he uſed the words.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 18.</note> He therefore concludes that <q>Paul was at the head of theſe el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to conſtitute them a preſbytery, with power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</q> If therefore I can prove, that the word PRESBU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERION, a <hi>preſbytery,</hi> always ſignifies, in the new-teſtament, and other ancient writers, <hi>a number of preſbyters only;</hi> then his whole objection againſt the Dr's interpretation of theſe words, is overthrown; and this inſtance of Timothy's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, will remain an inconteſtible pattern and proof of preſbyterian ordination.</p>
            <p>NOW the word PRESBUTERION is to be found but in two other places in all the new-teſtament, in both of which it ſignifies "a number of preſbyters only." The firſt is Luk. xxii. 66. <q>And when it was day PRESBUTERION, <hi>the elders</hi> of the people and the chief prieſts and the ſcribes came together,</q> &amp;c. It is very evident the word here means a number of elders or presbyters only: It is ſo tranſlated; the <hi>elders</hi> of the people, the ſanhedrim or grand council of the Jews: Not including the chief prieſts, the ſcribes, or indeed any other officer of a ſuperior rank, as Mr. L. would have it in the other inſtance: Theſe are alſo expresſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010800_0027_0F81D1BBE2F7A130"/>and very particularly diſtinguiſhed in the account; the <hi>elders</hi> of the people, PRESBUTERION, and the chief prieſts and the ſcribes. Beſides, the very perſons who are here called by the collective name, PRESBUTERION; in the parallel place, Matt. xxvii. 1. are called by the common or appropriate one, PRESBUTEROUS, (which ſhews the words are uſed ſynonimouſly) and they are there alſo diſtinguiſhed from the chief prieſts or any other officers. It is therefore beyond all diſpute that the word <hi>preſbytery,</hi> here means a number of elders only.</p>
            <p>The other place, in which the word occurs, is Acts xxii. 5. There it is tranſlated, "the ſtate of the elders," that is, the body or company of presbyters. Here again they are particularly diſtinguiſhed from the chief prieſt, or any other ſuperior officer; for he is particularly mentioned, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the TO PRESBUTERION, the ſtate or body of elders.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here it may be noted, that the presbytery or elders among the Jews, called PRESBUTERION or SANHEDRION, was their <hi>ſupreme</hi> court of judicature. We have an account of its inſtitution Numb. xi. 16. The right of government was veſted in them, and they were all veſted with equal power. <q>They were, as a learned writer tells us, originally intruſted with the power of <hi>ordaining</hi> elders to ſupply the vacancies made in their own body. This continued to be the practice till the time of Hillel, when it was reſolved that none ſhould ordain, without the preſence of the Naſi or Preſident, or a licence from him</q> 
                  <bibl>Selden de ſyned. II. 7. § 1.</bibl>
               </note> The word is frequently uſed by ancient eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical writers, and always to ſignify a number of <hi>preſbyters</hi> only. Numbers of quotations from the fathers, might eaſily be produced in proof of this. I ſhall adduce but one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom, I hope Mr. L. will make no exceptions. It is his favourite Ignatius. He frequently uſes this word; and in him it ever ſignifies a number of <hi>preſbyters</hi> only. A few inſtances may ſuffice. In his epiſtle to the Epheſians he ſays, "Being ſubject to the biſhop, and the <hi>preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>" <note n="‖" place="bottom">Sec. 2.

TO EPISCOPO KAI TO PRESBUTERIO.</note> In all theſe inſtances, and many more that might be mentioned, 'tis evident to demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the word, PRESBUTERION, means a number of <hi>preſbyters</hi> and nothing elſe. Not as Mr. L. would have it, <q>a number of elders with an apoſtle or biſhop at their head.</q> Thus it ſignifies in ſcripture, and in all good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors where it occurs. Nor do I remember ever to have ſeen it uſed, in any other ſenſe.</p>
            <p>DR. CHAUNCY had therefore good right <q>to take it for granted, that a presbytery means, a number of presbyters only.</q> And ſince this is the word uſed in this inſtance, it is a clear conſequence, that Timothy was ordained by a number of <hi>preſbyters;</hi> and therefore that presbyterian ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is the true ſcripture ordination.</p>
            <p>NOR will it at all alter the caſe tho' we ſhould grant that Paul joined with the presbytery in Timothy's ordination: For if he did, he acted, not as an apoſtle, but as a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of no more authority than the reſt. For it is in this character only, that the perſons who impoſed hands are here ſaid to act: Plainly denoting that they acted as a <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery;</hi> and conſequently, that the right of ordination is veſted in ſuch a body, and in none elſe.</p>
            <p>HENCE it will follow, that what Mr. L. ſays about the lower houſe of aſſembly in Connecticut,<note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 18, 19.</note> is not true. It is not true <q>that a number of presbyters have no more power to ordain without a biſhop, than the lower houſe of aſſembly have, to perform acts of legiſlation without the governor.</q> So far from it, that <hi>presbyters</hi> and they only are veſted with the power of ordination; and even when an apoſtle was joined with them, if that indeed was the caſe; he acted, not as an <hi>apoſtle,</hi> but as a <hi>preſbyter;</hi> therefore the action is expresſly ſaid to be done by a conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of presbyters, as we have ſhewed above. But if it were not ſo: If it were true, as he ſays, that a number of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have juſt as much and no more authority, with or without a biſhop, than the lower houſe of aſſembly have, with or without the governor; ſtill it will be nothing at all
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010800_0028_0F81D1BC909F2C38"/>to his purpoſe. For as the lower houſe, can perform no act of legiſlation, without the governor; no more can the governor without them. The power of the latter, in this caſe therefore, is at leaſt equal to the former. If then we allow this a parallel caſe, it will indeed follow that preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have no power to ordain, without a biſhop: But it will equally follow, that the biſhop has no ſuch power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the presbyters. Conſequently their power in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is equal. But, unluckily for our author, this will at once ruin his ſcheme, agreeable to which the <hi>ſole</hi> power of ordination is in the biſhop, and the presbyters have no manner of authority in the caſe. Thus have I very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, and I think ſufficiently vindicated the Dr's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this text, and proved it to be a ſtanding pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and warrant for presbyterian ordination.</p>
            <p>MR. L. goes on,— <q>Another objection is, that in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, biſhops are frequently called presbyters; therefore biſhop and presbyter mean one and the ſome office. In anſwer to this I would aſk, whether apoſtle and presbyter mean one and the ſame office in ſcripture? Anſwer this without a double meaning, and the point is ſettled.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 18, 19.</note> —I anſwer. Conſidered as ſtanding officers in the church, they moſt certainly do; and the apoſtle Peter himſelf ſhall be my voucher. <q>The <hi>elders,</hi> ſays he, which are among you I exhort, who am alſo an <hi>elder.</hi>" <note n="‖" place="bottom">II Pet. v. 1.</note> This then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, muſt ſettle the point.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AS another proof of ordination by presbyters, the Dr. obſerved, <q>that beſides deacons, the ſcripture mentions but one order of officers only, promiſcuouſly called biſhops or presbyters, therefore that the ordaining power muſt belong to that order.</q> In proof of this he added ſundry texts, and among others Philip. 1.1. where the apoſtle, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing this church with its officers, makes mention of but two orders, <hi>biſhops</hi> and <hi>deacons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN anſwer to this Mr. L. ſays, theſe biſhops were the presbyters of this church; and that, beſides them and the deacons, there was an apoſtle, viz. Epaphroditus, preſiding over them in quality of <hi>biſhop.</hi> In proof of this he quotes
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010800_0029_0F81D1BD371A2BB0"/>chap. ii. v. 25. where Paul ſays, <q>I ſuppoſed it neceſſary to ſend to you, Epaphroditus my brother, &amp;c.—but your <hi>meſſenger.</hi>
               </q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 19. 20</note> "In the original, he tells us, it is <hi>your apoſtle.</hi> Hence he infers, that in this church, were three orders of miniſters.</p>
            <p>ANSWER. Epaphroditus being <hi>ſent</hi> to Philippi is no proof he was ſent there in character of a biſhop. If ſo then Timothy muſt have been their biſhop alſo. For Paul ſays, "I truſt in the lord to <hi>ſend</hi> Timothy unto you ſhortly." v. 24. But this would be, to have two biſhops in this one church, which is utterly inconſident with the epiſcopal ſcheme; according to which there can be but one biſhop to one church. Neither will his being called the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's <hi>meſſenger,</hi> prove that he was their <hi>biſhop,</hi> or held any office in this church. I grant the word in the original is APOSTOLON, an apoſtle. This, however, in its common &amp; unappropriated ſenſe, means not a biſhop, or indeed any church officer; but according to its original derivation, a <hi>meſſenger,</hi> or one ſent. It is accordingly ſo tranſlated, wherever it occurs in ſcripture, in its unappropriated ſenſe, juſt as it is in this place. We meet with it in John xiii. 16. and II Cor. viii. 23. But as it is uſed in its unappropriated ſenſe in both, ſo it is tranſlated, as here, not <hi>apoſtle</hi> but <hi>meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger:</hi> But if it muſt be rendered <hi>apoſtle</hi> in this place, as Mr. L. contends, it muſt alſo in the others, and wherever it occurs. And if this be the caſe, John the baptiſt, and thoſe who were ſent to him from the phariſees, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo acknowledged as apoſtles or biſhops: For they are called APOSTELLMENOI, apoſtles, a word of the ſame theme and import with this. And therefore if this word muſt always ſignify <hi>apoſtle</hi> or biſhop, poſſibly Mr. L. will find in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an inſtance of a <hi>ſhe-biſhop</hi> or apoſtle: For Junia, which by many is ſuppoſed to be the name of a woman,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Chryſoſtom, Theophylact, Oecumenius, Origen, Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary the deacon, Pelagius, Primaſius, Bede, Haimo, and Premigius, read, not Junia, but Julia, believing her to be a woman, as the learned Blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del aſſures us</note> is ſaid with Andronicus, "to be chief among the <hi>apoſtles.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom xvi. 7.</note> But "the truth of the caſe is: The word APOSTOLON is here
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010800_0029_0F81D1BD371A2BB0"/>uſed in its unappropriated ſenſe. Our engliſh bibles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rightly have it tranſlated, not apoſtle, but <hi>meſſenger</hi> or one ſent. For ſo Epaphroditus was. He had been <hi>ſent</hi> by the Philippians to carry their bounty to Paul, as appears from chap. iv. 18. And therefore the apoſtle very properly calls him <hi>their meſſenger.</hi> Again. Paul's calling Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus, <hi>your meſſenger,</hi> plainly ſhews that he was not an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the appropriate ſenſe of the word. The apoſtles, as ſuch, are never called apoſtles <hi>of the churches,</hi> but of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe apoſtles or meſſengers, they are, who gives them commiſſion, and ſends them forth. Thus Peter and Paul, often call themſelves apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt,<note n="†" place="bottom">I Pet i. 1. 1 Cor. i. 1. &amp;c.</note> but they are never once called, <hi>your apoſtles,</hi> or the meſſengers of the church. Epaphroditus however is called a meſſenger or apoſtle, not of Jeſus Chriſt, but of the church: This plainly ſhews that he was not an officer in that church, but only a <hi>meſſenger</hi> they had ſent, to carry money to Paul. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it looks at leaſt highly improbable, had he been their <hi>apoſtle</hi> or <hi>biſhop,</hi> as Mr. L. pretends, that he ſhould be ſingled out by them for ſo inferior a piece of ſervice, as carrying their alms to Paul; eſpecially, as they had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of preſbyters and deacons, whom they might have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in this ſervice.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, had Epaphroditus been the biſhop of this church, is it not ſtrange the apoſtle ſhould not mention him in his inſcription of his epiſtle to this church? He parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mentions the <hi>biſhops</hi> or preſbyters, and deacons, but ſays not a word of any apoſtle. This neglect, moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Paul would not have been guilty of, had Epaphroditus been their biſhop, as our author pretends. Upon the whole, theſe reaſons muſt, I imagine, convince every impartial perſon, that he was not the biſhop of Philippi, that there were but only the two orders of biſhops or preſbyters, and deacons in this church, as the Dr. aſſerted, and therefore his argument for preſbyterian ordination, from this text, ſtands good.</p>
            <p>MR. L's next inſtance of three orders, is the church at <q>Jeruſalem. We have clear evidence, he tells us, from
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010800_0030_0F81D1BE46A99CB8"/>ſcripture that, St. James reſided for twenty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with and over the preſbyters and deacons there.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 20. 21.</note> For proof of this he refers to Acts, chapters vi. and xv. chap. xxi. 18. and Gal. i. 19.</p>
            <p>TWO things, he ſays, he has proved from theſe texts. One, that the apoſtle James reſided for twenty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the church at Jeruſalem: The other, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided with and <hi>over</hi> the preſbyters and deacons of this church, during that time.—Let us examine his proofs.—</p>
            <p>AS to the firſt, it does indeed appear from theſe texts, that Paul found James at Jeruſalem, three ſeveral times, and at the diſtance of ſundry years one from another. But then, at two of theſe times, the ſame accounts ſay, Peter was there with him. And one of them mentions John as there alſo. If, then from theſe two accounts it can be proved, that James was at Jeruſalem as biſhop, during the term aforeſaid; the ſame muſt follow alſo as to Peter. This argument therefore either proves that both of them ſo reſided, or that neither did. But as they could not, in Mr. L's ſenſe, be both biſhops of this church, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is plain, that nothing can be concluded from theſe two accounts, that either of them were. All the proof then that remains as to this fact, is the ſingle circumſtance of his being found there by Paul, ſome years after. Acts xxi. 18. But as there is no account how long he reſided there, barely his being found there, I preſume, will hardly be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a ſufficient proof of Mr. L's aſſertion, that the time of his continuance was twenty years. Indeed, as James, by our author's conceſſion was an apoſtle, there is not the leaſt degree of probability, much leſs any proof, that he reſided at Jeruſalem, or any other place, for any conſiderable time together, as his particular charge. So to do would have been utterly inconſiſtent with the apoſtolic character, and the charge given to the apoſtles by Chriſt, <q>
                  <hi>go teach all nations," "go into all the world,</hi> and preach the goſpel to <hi>every creature,"</hi> and ſo preach repentance and remiſſion of ſins <hi>among all nations,</hi> beginning at Jeruſalem.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. xxviii. 19. Mark xvi. 15. Luk. xxiv. 47.</note> How the executing this large commiſſion, could be conſiſtent
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010800_0030_0F81D1BE46A99CB8"/>with any of the apoſtles making Jeruſalem their ſtated reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, eſpecially for twenty years together, as Mr. L. aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, for my part I am unable to underſtand. Wherefore without offering a word more upon this point, I freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the candid reader to determine, whether the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence Mr. L. has brought, to prove that James actually "reſided twenty years together at Jeruſalem, is ſufficient to ſupport the fact. But if it ſhould be deemed to be, it will by no means follow, that he ſo reſided in character of a biſhop, or as Mr. L. expreſſes it, <q>with and over the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and deacons there.</q> This is the other thing he has here aſſerted, and for proof of it, he refers us to what he calls <q>James's conduct in the caſe St. Paul laid before him, Acts xv.</q> I deſire the reader to turn to the place, and read the whole account, and then ſay, what there is in it to prove that James, any more than any of the reſt, that were preſent at that council, was the biſhop of Jeruſalem? Is it that he was at Jeruſalem at that time? So was Peter and John, and other apoſtles. They therefore from this circumſtance bid as fair for the office as he. Was it that James attended upon the council there? The ſame did the other apoſtles, yea and the elders and brethren too. Or was it that James gave his judgment, in the determination of the queſtion before them? This did all that were preſent. And therefore when the decree was drawn up and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is expresſly ſaid to go forth in the name <q>of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and elders and brethren.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">v. 23</note> Or laſtly as it that James in particular, ſpoke in the council, and declared his ſentiments concerning the caſe in queſtion? But the ſame did alſo ſundry of the reſt, as Peter, Barnabas and Paul. Theſe are all particularly mentioned as ſpeaking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their opinion upon the point in debate. Yea, as giving the ſame <hi>ſentence</hi> or judgment, that James afterwards declared to be his. What right, I demand, then had Mr. L. to ſay, "that James's authority was <hi>deciſive</hi> in the caſe," any more than that of Peter, Paul and Barnabas, who had given the ſame ſentence before? Certainly none. Nothing
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010800_0031_0F81D1BEC20D6018"/>therefore appears from this circumſtance, or indeed from any thing elſe, in the account, in favour of James's epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal relation to, and authority over this church, and its offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but what equally appears in favour of the reſt. And ſince they could not all be biſhops of it, it is a plain caſe that none of them are proved to be ſo; conſequently, that there were not three orders of officers in this church as Mr. L. has aſſerted.</p>
            <p>HIS next attack upon the Dr. is for aſſerting, <q>That the apoſtles as ſuch, were extraordinary officers, and had no ſucceſſors,</q> and then aſks "in what reſpects they were ſo.?"<note n="*" place="bottom">p 21.</note> I anſwer.—Let him turn to the page in the Dr's ſermon, from whence he has quoted theſe words, and he will readily ſee. <q>They received their commiſſion immediately from Chriſt. Their charge was unlimitted; their province the whole world. They were, by office, the teachers of all nations; had power to gather churches every where, to ſettle them with proper officers, to inſpect over them, to give binding rules &amp; orders for the government of them; and all this under the infallible guidance of the holy Ghoſt.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Dud. lec. p. 48.</note> If this don't ſatisfy Mr. L. I would refer him for a more particular account of the diſtinctive character &amp; qualifications of the apoſtleſhip, to Mr. Boyſe's <q>ancient epiſcopacy,</q> p. 253, &amp;c. To Dr. Barrow as quoted by him, p. 272, &amp;c. and "the ſcripture-biſhop, p. 26, &amp;c. In the mean time, as I ſhall have occaſion, more particularly to conſider this point, when I come to his remarks upon my ſermon, it may be ſufficient to obſerve here,—that Mr. L. does not pretend to prove biſhops now-a-days, are indued with theſe extraordinary qualifications, on which the <hi>apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> character and powers were founded: conſequently the former cannot ſucceed the latter in the exerciſe of theſe powers. He ſays indeed as to ſome of theſe qualifications, —ſuch as, <q>the power of working miracles, travelling from place to place to plant churches, and being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent by Chriſt;" that they were not <hi>peculiar</hi> to the apoſtles, for others at that time had the ſame.</q> But now, what is this to his purpoſe? If they were not <hi>peculiar</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:010800_0031_0F81D1BEC20D6018"/>to the apoſtles, they were at leaſt <hi>eſſential</hi> to the apoſtolic character and abſolutely neceſſary to furniſh men for the duties of it. Tho' therefore ſome, cotemporary with the apoſtles, might have ſome of theſe extraordinary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, eſſential to the apoſtolic office; yet as none can pretend to them now; the conſequence is undeniable, that none now can pretend to ſucceed the apoſtles, in that part of their character and office, to which theſe extraordinary qualifications were eſſential and abſolutely neceſſary. Since therefore dioceſan biſhops do not, cannot ſucceed the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, in that part of their character or office which was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> and peculiar to them; it belongs to him, if he would ſupport his ſcheme, to prove, that the apoſtles, in communicating their <hi>ordinary</hi> powers, did in fact make a difference; committing a <hi>chief</hi> power to a ſuperior order, called <hi>biſhops,</hi> and an <hi>inferior</hi> one to others, under the name of <hi>preſbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is what he next attempts to do.— <q>What we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſays he, is that the apoſtles did commit a chief pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a ſuperior order, then called <hi>apoſtles.</hi>
               </q> And for proof he refers us to Acts xiv. 14. Philip. ii. 25. II Cor. viii. 23. <q>From theſe texts, he tells us, it appears, that Barnabas, Epaphroditus and Titus are <hi>ſtiled apoſtles."</hi> and adds, that he intends to prove Timothy alſo, to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the ſame apoſtolic power and office.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. As to, at leaſt three of the four here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither the texts he has quoted, nor indeed any other in ſcripture, proves them to be apoſtles, in the <hi>appropriate</hi> ſenſe of the word. As to Epaphroditus, it has been already proved that he was no apoſtle, but only a meſſenger of the church of Philippi, ſent to carry their contribution to the apoſtle Paul; an errand not over and above apoſtolical.— As to Titus, he is no where, in ſcripture, called an apoſtle in any ſenſe whatever. The text Mr. L. quotes to prove him ſo, is this, <q>Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-helper concerning you: Or our brethren be enquired of, <hi>they</hi> are the <hi>meſſengers</hi> of the churches and the glory of Chriſt.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">II Cor. viii. 23.</note> It ſeems Mr. L.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010800_0032_0F81D1BF7643C4F8"/>thouught Titus muſt needs be an apoſtle; becauſe he found the word, A POSTOLOI, <hi>meſſengers,</hi> in the ſame verſe, in which Titus is named. But unhappily for him, it is not Titus, but the <hi>brethren</hi> that went with him, who are called A POS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOLOI, <hi>meſſengers.</hi> Titus is particularly diſtinguiſhed from them in the former part of the verſe, as Paul's partner &amp; fellow-labourer, and not of the number of the brethren who are called A POSTOLOI, <hi>meſſengers,</hi> in the latter part of it. But if he was not: If he was, as Mr. L. ſuppoſes, of the number of theſe A POSTOLOI, <hi>meſſengers;</hi> it would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe: For it is abundantly evident, from the context, that the word A POSTOLOI is here uſed, not in its appropriate ſenſe, to ſignify an officer in the church; but in the common and unappropriated one, meaning bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>meſſenger,</hi> or one ſent. For it is evidently on account of their being <hi>ſent</hi> to Corinth to receive their collections, and carry them to Jeruſalem, and nothing elſe, that theſe perſons are called A POSTOLOI, meſſengers of the churches. If therefore Epaphroditus was no <hi>apoſtle,</hi> much leſs was Titus, who is never once called by that name, in any ſenſe of the word whatſoever. And tho' Mr. L. tells us <q>he deſigned to prove Timothy to be one;</q> yet as we find nothing of that kind done in the remaining part of his book; 'tis probable, upon ſecond thought, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the attempt. Since therefore he has dropt him out of the number, we have a right to do the ſame, and ſo there remains only Barnabas to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>AND, it is readily granted he is called an apoſtle in Acts xiv. 14. But until it is proved that he <hi>derived</hi> his apoſtolic power from the apoſtles; barely his being called an apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, will not prove his aſſertion, <q>that the apoſtles did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a chief power to a ſuperior order called apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles." All that is proved from this text, is that "Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas was an apoſtle.</q> How he came to be ſo, or from whom he <hi>received</hi> his "chief power" and ſuperior character as an apoſtle, the text is intirely ſilent; nor can it be collected from any thing Mr. L. has ſaid. If his being here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with Paul, ſignifies that he was veſted with the ſame
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010800_0032_0F81D1BF7643C4F8"/>ſuperior office and character as Paul was; no doubt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his apoſtolic commiſſion and authority, in the ſame immediate way, and from the ſame fountain, as Paul did. How that was, he himſelf has told us. For he was <q>an apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the father</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 1.1.</note> At leaſt till the contrary is proved from ſcripture, we have a right to conclude this was the caſe: Conſequently, that the apoſtles did not <q>thus divide the ordinary powers of their office, communicating to ſome more, to others leſs, and ſo conſtituting the two orders of biſhops and preſbyters,</q> as our opponents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. I may therefore now with propriety, I preſume, take leave of this argument in the words of Dr. Chauncy. <q>If the apoſtles did thus communicate theſe powers, in a different degree, committing to ſome more, to others leſs, and ſo conſtituting two orders in the miniſtry; it is what we may reaſonably expect to ſee evidenced. The new-teſtament is open. If it contains any ſuch evidence, let it be produced. We imagine it contains clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary, and that we have given ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Merely calling biſhops ſucceſſors to the apoſtles will not prove their ſuperiority: Tho' by the way they are never called ſo in the ſacred books.—The bible only can ſettle this point.</q>

            <p>OUR author proceeds.— <q>Dr. Chauncy ſeems to allow, that the church univerſally has been governed, in the form of epiſcopacy, (after the firſt two centuries) for ſeveral ſucceeding ages. But, ſays he, <hi>before that,</hi> in the early days of the church, it was governed by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 22.</note> I have examined the pages, from whence he pretends to quote this paſſage, but can find nothing of that kind there. If by <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> Mr. L. means <hi>dioceſan</hi> epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, (which he muſt mean, or it is nothing to his purpoſe) the Doctor is ſo far from allowing that the church was ever governed in that form, that on the contrary he affirms and proves, that during the firſt century, and the greateſt part of the ſecond, there is no diſtinction to be found, in the writers of thoſe times, between biſhop and preſbyter; the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010800_0033_0F81D1C02DDFCE10"/>names being uſed promiſcuouſly for the ſame office, juſt as they are in the new-teſtament. And even in the third cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and onwards, after the name biſhop came to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated, ſo as to ſignify ſomething different from preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter; he expresſly denies <q>that the fathers are univerſal or unanimous, in affirming of it for fact, that it was a diſtinction importing a <hi>ſuperiority of order,</hi> or that it was of apoſtolical inſtitution.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dud. Lec. p. 65.</note> As Mr. L. therefore has miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented the Dr. I hope he will do him juſtice. <q>And, (to uſe his own words) will ſee his error and retract.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I AM now prepared to conſider his rhapſody of queſtions quoted from Mr. Chillingworth, and thoſe of the ſame ſtrain added by himſelf in pages 22, and 23 of his book: The whole of which amount to no more than this, viz. how, when and by what means it was that the original form of preſbyterian church government, came to be changed to that of epiſcopalian?</p>
            <p>FOR anſwer to which, and indeed, to almoſt every thing elſe he has remarked upon the Dr's ſermon, I might very fairly refer him to the ſermon itſelf. At leaſt he will there ſee, that when this alteration of a diſtinction between bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and preſbyter firſt began, it was very ſmall. <q>The biſhop was no more than <hi>primus inter pares,</hi> the head preſbyter, the <hi>praeſes</hi> or moderator of the conſiſtory; and it was by gradual ſteps he attained to the power with which he was afterwards veſted. Theſe eccleſiaſtical ſuperiorities and inferiorities, which have for a long time been viſible in the chriſtian world, were unknown in the firſt and pureſt ages: Nor did they at once take place. It was the work of time. From prime-preſbyters, aroſe city-biſhops: From city-biſhops, dioceſan ones: From dioceſan biſhops, metropolitans: From metropolitans, patriarchs; and finally, at the top of all, his holineſs the pope, claiming the character of univerſal head of the church.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Dud. lec. p. 64.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IF this anſwer will not ſatisfy Mr. L. I will give him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in the words of a proteſtant in anſwer to a demand of the like kind from a papiſt. It is as follows. <q>When
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010800_0033_0F81D1C02DDFCE10"/>Arius, Neſtorius, and ſuch like heretics aroſe; they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently broke out of the church, and forſook all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And when Mahomet came from without, he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly aſſaulted all chriſtianity. But the <hi>papacy</hi> bred ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, as a gangrene in the church within. That cock atrice was long a hatching in the ſhell, before it did appear. It was a ſecret departure from the truth, cauſed by errors ſtolen into the church, <hi>ſenſim, ſine ſenſu,</hi> inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and unawares: Whence appears the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween open hereſy and clandeſtine apoſtacy. The one is eaſy to be known, becauſe it works openly, in the day: The other hard to be diſcovered, becauſe it makes its approaches only in the night.</q> Let Mr. L. only make the ſmall change of the word <hi>papacy</hi> into <hi>prelacy,</hi> and the anſwer will be exactly adapted to his queſtion.</p>
            <p>OR if this account ſhould be thought of too late a date, I will refer him to that given by Jerom, one of the fathers. His words are theſe:— <q>The preſbyter therefore is the ſame with the biſhop. And therefore, by the <hi>devit's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,</hi> there were parties in religion, and it was ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, I am of Paul, I of Apollos, I of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas; <hi>the churches were governed by the common council of preſbyters:</hi> But after every one thought, thoſe he baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be rather <hi>his</hi> than Chriſt's; it was agreed in the whole world, that one of the preſbyters ſhould be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt, to whom the care of all the church ſhould belong, and the ſeeds of diviſion taken away.</q>

            <p>WHAT could induce our author, to fall upon this topic of the uninterrupted ſucceſſion, and ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to anſwer objections againſt epiſcopacy, which neither of the pieces he undertakes to confute, ſay any thing about; and at the ſame time, paſs over unnoticed, ſo great a part of the arguments contained in theſe pieces, is difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; unleſs perhaps becauſe he thought it eaſier an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering objections of his own ſtarting, than thoſe urged by his opponents Be that as it will. <q>Another objection he tells us, is that they receive their authority from Rome; and that church is ſo corrupt, that ſhe can convey none.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſometimes heard it remarked, indeed, as a ſort of inconſiſtency in the church of England, to diſcover ſuch a partial affection to that of Rome, as to allow of their orders as valid while they deny thoſe of all Proteſtant churches; and blaſt ſo much of a ſucceſſion thro' that church, which in their homilies they call <q>a filthy old withered harlot, and ſo far from being or the nature of a true church, that for more than nine hundred years before the reformation, nothing could be more.</q> This, however Mr. L. denies. They did not, he ſays, derive either their power, or chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity from Rome. <q>The britiſh church flouriſhed, he tells us, many hundred years—before the goſpel took place in England.</q> I anſwer. That chriſtianity was early intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into England, is not denied. Who firſt preached it there, is very uncertain. 'Tis ſtill more ſo in what form, whether preſbyterian or epiſcopalian, that church was firſt
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010800_0034_0F81D1C3496E69D8"/>ſettled. If Paul was the firſt who brought the goſpel to Britain and planted chriſtianity there, as many writers ſay; it is preſumed, that ſince he himſelf was ordained by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, that was the form of ordination and government he would eſtabliſh there. As to king Lucius, whom Mr. L. makes to be the firſt chriſtian king, and the founder of an arch-biſhoprick in London; the time of his converſion is ſo uncertain, that Fuller, in his church hiſtory, reckons up no leſs than twenty ſix different accounts of it by different writers; between the firſt and laſt of which, there is no leſs than 90 years difference, as to date.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ch. Hiſt. p. 10.</note> This, with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things mentioned by the ſame author, gives the whole ſuch a fabulous and romantic air, that there is little or no weight to be laid on any thing ſaid about him. And indeed many doubt, whether there ever was ſuch a man in the world.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Cor. gee. gram. p. 213.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT granting chriſtianity was as early planted in Great-Britain, as he pretends, this will by no means help him out with a ſucceſſion through the old britiſh biſhops, as diſtinct from thoſe of the Romiſh church. He allows that the pope "got footing in England before the reformation." But then he tells us <q>the old britiſh clergy oppoſed him with all their might, and prevented all that came from Rome, from getting into the vacant churches, as far as poſſibly they could.</q> That when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

All that were <q>ordained at Rome, he tells us, refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to comply with the reformation, returned to Rome, from whence they came. The number of biſhops that did ſo were fourteen.

            <p>IT is well known by all acquainted with the engliſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that Auſtin the monk came into England toward the

He was ſent there by Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, the pope of Rome, to convert the Anglo-ſaxons to chriſtianity. From that time to the reformation, A. D. 1530, a ſpace of near a thouſand years, England was under the popiſh yoke, and over-run with all the errors and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the church of Rome, as much as the reſt of Europe. The whole chriſtian world, for many hundred years before the reformation, "wandered after the beaſt;" and the church of England, during the whole of that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, was as much the church of Rome, as that of France, Spain, or even Italy itſelf. All equally ſunk in error, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and idolatry, and equally <q>drunk with the cup of abominations, and filthineſs of the fornications, of that old withered harlot.</q> Where then, I aſk, will Mr. L. find a ſucceſſion for their clergy, except through the biſhops of the romiſh church? His attempts to derive it thro' a line of "ancient britiſh biſhops," is a mere chimera, that ſcarce deſerves notice. There were no ſuch biſhops to be found in England, during the greateſt part of that time. I readily allow that chriſtianity had been planted in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, before Auſtin's arrival; that upon the Saxon invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a number of the britiſh chriſtians retired into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Wales, and preſerved their liberty and chriſtianity. It is further granted, that upon Auſtin's coming into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the old britiſh clergy in Wales, refuſed at firſt to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the pope's authority. In conſequence of which the greateſt part of them were cruelly put to the ſword, in the city of Bangor, ſaid to be effected by Auſtin's means.<note n="*" place="bottom">Full ch II<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

If theſe welch biſhops therefore, were thoſe Mr. L. means by his "ancient britiſh biſhops," from whom their clergy derive their ſucceſſion, and who he tells us <q>as far as poſſible, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all that came from Rome from getting into the vacant churches;</q> the oppoſition they made, could be but very feeble at beſt, and muſt certainly have ceaſed, after

What then can Mr. L. mean, by pretending to keep up a diſtinction between the britiſh clergy, and thoſe of the romiſh church? Wales, for many hundred years before the reformation, was as really under the "papal yoke" as he terms it, and received their biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops "from Rome" as much as any other part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>BUT if this had not been the caſe: Had it been, as his argument ſuppoſes, that there was a diſtinct ſucceſſion of biſhops kept up in Wales, in a direct line from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent britiſh biſhops, even till the reformation; this will afford him no manner of relief as to the preſent clergy of their church. They, certainly, can claim no benefit from ſuch a ſucceſſion of welch biſhops; for not one of the welch biſhops was concerned in the conſecration of Parker, and yet from him all the biſhops in the church of England ever ſince muſt derive their ſucceſſion. The fact was truly this. In the beginning of the reformation under Henry VIII. all the biſhops, abbots and priors in England, (Fiſher

Now this being the caſe, that all the biſhops in the kingdom, not only of England, but Wales too, except one, were deprived; where will he go to make out a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for their clergy, from the old britiſh biſhops? They were all, ſave one, deprived, and a new ſucceſſion begun in Parker, from whom all the biſhops ever ſince, muſt derive their claim. Unleſs therefore he can prove, that Parker was conſecrated by the deſcendants of thoſe <q>ancient bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh biſhops,</q> his pretended ſucceſſion from them, is ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably overthrown. But to the utter deſtruction of his ſcheme, ſo it happened, that Parker, (from whom all the clergy of the church of England, both biſhops and preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ever ſince, derive their ſucceſſion) was conſecrated, not by any of the biſhops of Wales, but by four engliſh biſhops, who had been conſecrated in king Edward's time, had been deprived in the reign of Q Mary, and had never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. For the men who conſecrtaed Parker, were Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, formerly biſhop of Bath and Wells, Scory of Chicheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Coverdale of Exeter and Hodgſkins ſuffragan of Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford<note n="†" place="bottom">Ful. ch. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010800_0036_0F81D1C54F4C5608"/>appeared to aſiſt at the conſecration, and ſo it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without him by the four above named. Where then, I repeat it, will Mr. L. make out his ſucceſſion, thro' the line of the old britiſh biſhops? If he was ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with hiſtory, as not to know that there was no manner of foundation for ſuch a pretence, he was unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to write upon the ſubject, and ought not to have meddled with it. If not, he has deſignedly impoſed upon his readers and ought "to retract."</p>
            <p>THE truth of the caſe is, no hiſtory of the britiſh church furniſhes the leaſt foundation, even of pretence, for ſuch a ſucceſſion. Biſhop Burnet ſays, that the reformers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, expreſsly allowed <q>that England received the faith from thoſe ſent from Rome by pope Gregory the great, i. e. Auſtin and his monks.<note n="*" place="bottom">Abridg. vol. 1. p. 103.</note>
               </q> And all the advocates for uninterrupted ſucceſſion, I have ever ſeen, till Mr. L's book appeared, unanimouſly agree in tracing it up to Auſtin, and through him to St. Peter. Mr. Beach in particular, ſome years ago, in his controverſy with Mr. Hobart, ſays, <q>the preſent archbiſhop of Canterbury is the ſeventy third, who has ſet in that ſee, ſince Auſtin the monk.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Vind. p. 7.</note> And tho' I don't imagine there is any great probability of an unbroken ſucceſion, even in that line, yet it muſt be ſought there, or no where. 'Till therefore Mr. L. brings us ſome better authority for one, through the old britiſh biſhops, than his bare aſſertion; he muſt expect it will be treated with that contempt, ſuch a viſionary enthuſiaſtic ſcheme deſerves.</p>
            <p>I CALL this notion of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, &amp; the abſolute neceſſity of it to render goſpel adminiſtration va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, a <hi>viſionary enthuſiaſtic</hi> ſcheme. It is ſo even when tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in any line. The evidence of the fact is ſo ſmall, and the probability, or rather evidence of an interruption, ſo great, that a man muſt renounce the common principles of credibility, and act by an implicit faith, to give in to it, or at leaſt to lay any great weight upon it. But to be very confident of it, and that in a line where it is abſolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is not to be found, argues, if poſſible, a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010800_0037_0F81D1C5801D7310"/>of weakneſs and credulity than what the moſt viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary enthuſiaſts are influenced by. And is not this even the caſe with our author? For tho' he diſclaims a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion through the romiſh church and lays the whole ſtreſs upon one through the old britiſh biſhops, which never had any exiſtence, ſave in a heated imagination, he is ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the truth of it, that he tell us, <q>we have as good evidence that their clergy derive their authority, by an uninterrupted ſucceſſion from the apoſtles, (meaning through the line aforeſaid) as we have of the deſcent of all mankind from Adam by ordinary generation.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 26.</note> The higheſt evidence to which, even Mr. Beach, pretended in this caſe, and that in a line too, which bid much fairer, than the romantic one of our author, was only to put it upon a level, with that of the levitical prieſthood in the family of Aaron. This indeed was much too high. But even this it ſeems will not content Mr. L. Nothing ſhort of one, equal to that <q>of our deſcent from Adam, will ſerve his turn.</q> If the faith of the advocates of this doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues thus increaſing, we may expect it will ſoon grow up to full aſſurance; and that the next ſtickler for uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion, will put the evidence of it upon a par with that of our exiſtence.</p>
            <p>LET us however examine Mr. L's proof: And here let it be noted, that we have the moſt clear and expreſs ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evidence of our natural deſcent from Adam, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are abſolutely certain of it.<note n="‖" place="bottom">ſee Gen. i. 17. &amp; ii. 22.

Let it be alſo remembered, that this ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be in a line of biſhops as ſuperior to preſbyters, for he calls, it "a regular ſucceſſion of the <hi>epiſcopal power,</hi>" <q>an apoſtolic ſucceſſion," and "a ſucceſſion of the goſpel miniſtry in the three orders.</q> Barely a ſucceſſion in the line of <hi>presbyters</hi> will not ſuffice. For we have ſuch a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion up to their biſhops, and yet he denies us to be the miniſters of Chriſt. Now the argument by which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to prove his ſucceſſion, is this. Chriſt's promiſe to his miniſters, contained in his commiſſion, in Mat. xxviii.

But why muſt the promiſe have failed, unleſs there has been <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſucceſſion? There is nothing in the commiſſion, limiting the promiſe to ſuch a ſuperior order: Not the leaſt hint of the inſtitution of ſuch an order. The commiſſion is but one, and therefore one order only is inſtituted by it. But if there were two, or ten, it would make no alteration: Since the promiſe is not limitted to any one in particular, a ſucceſſion in either of them would anſwer all the ends of fulfilling the promiſe. Mr. L. himſelf allows that this promiſe belongs to preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 29.</note> If ſo, then a continuation of the ſucceſſion in the line of preſbyters, would as effectually ſerve the accompliſhment of the promiſe, as one in the line of biſhops: Conſequently if it has been continued in the former, the promiſe is fully accompliſhed, even tho' it has been broken or interrupted in the latter: and therefore his argument from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in ſupport of a ſucceſſion in the line of biſhops, is by his own confeſſion, intirely defeated.</p>
            <p>THE truth is, as the commiſſion ſuppoſes but one order in the miniſtry, the utmoſt that can be argued from the annexed promiſe, in favour of a ſucceſſion, even of any kind, is that there ſhall be a <hi>miniſtry</hi> continued in the church, to the end of time. How, or in what manner mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, ſhall be introduced, whether in a regular unbroken line of ſucceſſion or not, whether by a ſuperior or inferior order of miniſters, yea whether by the officers of the church or the brethren, as the commiſſion is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>THUS his bold aſſertion <q>that we have the ſame evidence for the ſucceſſion he pleads for, as we have for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent

For the other, we have only his forced interpretation of a particular text, which is no evidence at all.</p>
            <p>BUT if ſcripture will not ſupport his confidence in this point, perhaps he thinks hiſtory will. For he tells us <q>there can be no inſtance produced from all eccleſiaſtical hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, of any one man's being owned, by the church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, as a biſhop, who was not ordained by another bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or by an officer in the church ſuperior to a preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>

If it is not true in fact, that there has been any ſuch univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal acknowledgment, in favour of a ſucceſſion, which is doubtleſs the caſe; then his argument founded upon ſuch acknowledgment is at once deſtroyed. But if it is true, his argument founded upon it, is inconcluſive; for if it proves the point in queſtion, it will equally prove other things, which even Mr. L. himſelf will not admit as truths. <q>The ſum of the argument, he tells us, is this: Chriſt, at firſt, did appoint a certain number of men with power to ſend others: The church univerſal never could be induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive officers, unleſs they were ordained by ſuch officers, as Chriſt appointed to ordain; therefore there has been a ſucceſſion of ſuch officers, as Chriſt appointed at firſt, which are apoſtles, or, as they have been ſince called, biſhops.

Of this there is ſcarcely the leaſt probability. But my motive herein was, to expoſe the weakneſs of ſuch high claims, and the dangerous tendency of laying ſo much weight upon this ſame-epiſcopal ſucceſſion, as the zealous advocates for it commonly do. As to the weakneſs of the proof, I preſume it has been ſufficiently expoſed. The danger of laying ſo much ſtreſs upon it, muſt be obvious at firſt view.

               <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> A vindication of my diſcourſe upon preſbyterian ordination, from the exceptions contained in Mr. L's book; <hi>from p. 27, to 38.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>NOT to ſay any thing of Mr. L's <hi>logic,</hi> he ſeems to be well acquainted with a certain figure in <hi>rhetoric,</hi> by which a part is taken for the whole. Having remarked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one or two, among many, of Dr. Chauncy's arguments, he roundly tells us, <q>he has conſidered every thing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial advanced by the Dr.</q>—The ſame method he takes, in his remarks upon me. Thus he begins them.— <q>The ſum of his argument is this, there is but one commiſſion and of conſequence can be, but one order of goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 27.</note> Truly conciſe and laconic! An eaſy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious method this, of anſwering a book,—to remark upon one argument, out of many, and then pretend he has anſwered the whole; tho' perhaps not quite ſo ſafe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the author, unleſs he could be ſure, the pieces he pretends to anſwer, had never been ſeen by his readers. 'Tis true this was <hi>one</hi> of my arguments: I hope to ſhew it is a good one. But if he had read my piece, he muſt have obſerved that I uſed ſundry others in ſupport of the doctrine
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010800_0040_0F81D1C7C6FD94D0"/>I undertook to defend.—I argued it,—from preſbyters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſucceſſors to the apoſtles in their ordinary character.— From there being in fact but one order only to be found in the goſpel.—From preſbyters being true ſcripture biſhops, and the only biſhops the goſpel owns.—From expreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of preſbyterian ordination found in ſcripture.—And finally, from the ſuffrage of antiquity,—the unanimous judgment and practice of the reformed churches abroad,— the firſt reformers in England, and many great and learned epiſcopalians ſince. How then could he pretend, <q>that this was the <hi>ſum</hi> of what I had advanced, in ſupport of my principles?</q> However, ſince he chooſes to combat only this one argument, I ſhall follow him in his remarks upon it.—His words are, <q>Mr. Welles ſays, p. 17, theſe laſt words (meaning the promiſe annexed to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) plainly ſhew that this promiſe was made, not to the perſons of the apoſtles but to their office as miniſters in Chriſt's church; and conſequently that their office is to—continue to the end of the world.—He aſſerts, p. 16, this is the commiſſion, and the only commiſſion we have any account of, which Chriſt gave to his apoſtles.</q>—The conſequence of which Mr. L. ſays, muſt be this, <q>that the commiſſion conſtituted them <hi>apoſtles,</hi> and therefore the <hi>apoſtolic office</hi> muſt continue to the end of time.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER.—If by <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> he means the office the apoſtles ſuſtained, as ordinary miniſters in the church; I readily grant that the commiſſion in Mat. 28, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute them apoſtles, and that their office, in this ſenſe of it, is to continue to the end of the world. But if by <hi>apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic office,</hi> he means their office as <hi>apoſtles,</hi> properly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſidered in their extraordinary character, I deny that it was to be continued, and affirm there is nothing in the words he pretends to quote from me, that will infer ſuch a concluſion. 'Tis true I ſaid, and ſtill ſay, <q>that the promiſe of Chriſt's preſence to the end of the world, annexed to the commiſſion, was made, not to the <hi>perſons</hi> of the apoſtles, but to their <hi>office.</hi>
               </q> But as what? Not as apoſtles, but as I there expreſs it, <q>as miniſters in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010800_0040_0F81D1C7C6FD94D0"/>Chriſt's church,</q> i. e. ſtanding ordinary miniſters.—I alſo ſaid, <q>that this is the commiſſion, and the only one, we have any account of, that Chriſt gave his apoſtles.</q> But then I added, "in virtue of which they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to act <hi>as miniſters in his church.</hi>" i. e. as ordinary ſtanding miniſters, as the whole connexion of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhewed. Had Mr. L. thus quoted my words at large, every reader would have ſeen the weakneſs of the concluſion he pretends to draw from them. They are ſo far from given any countenance to his notion of, "a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the <hi>apoſtolic office</hi> as ſuch; that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they very expreſsly diſtinguiſh between <hi>this,</hi> and their ordinary character, and very clearly ſhew, that is was the latter, and not the former, that was to be perpetuated, and in which they were to have ſucceſſors to the end of time. This, I preſume, is ſufficient to vindicate my words from this conſequence he pretends to draw from them.</p>
            <p>BUT, ſays Mr. L. <q>the conſequence (meaning from my words) is plainly this: that the commiſſion conſtituted them apoſtles, or elſe that they acted as apoſtles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any commiſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ANSWER, This is by no means a plain conſequence neither. Had I ſaid, as he has imperfectly quoted me, <q>that this is the only commiſſion we have any account of, that Chriſt gave his apoſtles,</q> and had added nothing further, it would indeed have followed, not as he ſays, "that they acted without any commiſſion;" but that, for aught appeared in ſcripture, they acted without any. Theſe two concluſions are very different. The ſcripture gives no account of the ordination of Silas, Apollos, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. I truſt, however, he himſelf will not from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they acted as miniſters without any commiſſion or ordination. But then he well knew, that when I ſaid, "this is the only commiſſion," &amp;c. I meant the only one they received <hi>as ſtanding goſpel miniſters,</hi> inveſted with an office to be perpetuated. This diſtinction was fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the clauſe he has ſeen fit to ſuppreſs, viz. <q>in virtue of which they were impowered to act as miniſters,</q> &amp;c. His concluſion therefore, <q>that this commiſſion
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010800_0041_0F81D1C89D152508"/>conſtituted them apoſtles, or elſe they acted without a commiſſion,</q> no ways follows. For altho' as <hi>ſtanding ordinary miniſters,</hi> they had no other commiſſion, yet they might have <hi>as apoſtles.</hi> It was in the former view I ſpake of them, not in the latter. Certainly they were called apoſtles long before this commiſſion was given, even upon their being firſt called by Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. x. 2.</note> Paul was called and commiſſioned to be an <hi>apoſtle,</hi> and acted as ſuch, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he received ordination as <hi>a ſtanding goſpel miniſter.</hi> The commiſſion of the apoſtles as ſuch, as extraordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, was in an extraordinary way; by an immediate call from heaven. As apoſtles, they were all with Paul "not of men, neither by men, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father.<note n="‖" place="bottom">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> i. i.</note> When it was they received <hi>this</hi> commiſſion, whether upon their firſt call, as ſome ſuppoſe, or at the day of Pentecoſt, as others think, is perhaps difficult certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to determine. As their <hi>apoſtolic office,</hi> properly ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was extraordinary, and temporary, there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the commiſſion, impowering them thereto, ſhould be particularly recorded in ſcripture. This was given to them <hi>in perſon;</hi> and as they were to have no ſucceſſors in it, none elſe had any concern with it. But as <hi>ſtanding ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary miniſters,</hi> they were to have ſucceſſors to the end of time; and therefore it was neceſſary their commiſſion, in this character, ſhould be particularly recorded; for this concerned their ſucceſſors as well as themſelves. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we find, this commiſſion is in fact recorded: 'Tis that we have been conſidering: 'Tis that to which the promiſe is annexed of Chriſt's preſence to the end of the world; and the ſame concerning which I aſſerted in my ſermon, <q>that it is the only one, we have any account of, which Chriſt gave to his apoſtles, in virtue of which they were improved to act as <hi>ordinary</hi> miniſters in his church.</q> And for this purpoſe, no doubt it is recorded, that it might be a ſtanding commiſſion, impowering, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorizing and directing, all the true miniſters of Chriſt to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>OUR author's next remark is to this purpoſe,—that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010800_0041_0F81D1C89D152508"/>while I am proving from the one commiſſion, that one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only of miniſters can be virtuated by it, I myſelf, in effect, allow two, and ſo defeat my own argument: For he ſays, I call the apoſtles in one place, <hi>extraordinary officers,</hi> and in another, <hi>ordinary ones,</hi> and yet theſe are both impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by one commiſſion; hence he concludes that I am "refuted by myſelf."<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 28, 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I ANSWER, had he honeſtly cited the paſſage he pretended to quote from me, the weakneſs of this concluſion of his would have been obvious at firſt view. 'Tis true I ſpeak of the apoſtles, as ſuſtaining the twofold character or office, of apoſtles, and ordinary goſpel miniſters. But then it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually true that I ſpeak only with reſpect to the <hi>latter,</hi> when I ſay, <q>this is the commiſſion and the only commiſſion we have any account of their receiving from Chriſt.</q> This diſtinction and limitation I fully enough expreſſed, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from which he quotes theſe words, tho' he has ſeen fit to ſuppreſs it by apartial &amp; imperfect quotation. Such acts may help to ſupport a bad cauſe: A good one has no need of them. Will it at all follow, that becauſe the apoſtles, conſidered as <hi>ordinary</hi> miniſters of Chriſt, are impowered by this one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commiſſion, that they muſt as <hi>extraordinary</hi> officers alſo be impowered by the ſame? If it will not, then there is no force at all in Mr. L's concluſion from my argument, as tho' it allowed of two orders being impowered by one and the ſame commiſſion. As there is nothing expreſsly ſaid, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven implied in this commiſſion, of more than one order to be impowered by it; not the leaſt intimation, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers it contains are to be divided, and the whole given to one order, and part only to another; and finally, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent to ſuppoſe, that two or more offices, the one ſuperior, the other ſubordinate, ſhould be virtuated and appointed by one and the ſame commiſſion, we may I think, fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that one order of goſpel miniſters, and only one, is appointed and impowered by this commiſſion; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all the powers contained in this commiſſion belong to that one order, and that of ordination among the reſt. I preſume therefore, my argument from the one commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010800_0042_0F81D1C92C36CD48"/>ſtill ſtands good, notwithſtanding all Mr. L. has ſaid againſt it.</p>
            <p>I HAD ſaid in my ſermon, <q>that the apoſtles in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary character, had no ſucceſſors.</q> This Mr. L. calls "a bold aſſertion," and demands <q>what evidence I have produced to ſupport it.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. As the aſſertion is a negative, had no evidence been produced, it would hardly have deſerved the epithet of "bold." According to the rules of argumentation, the proof lies upon thoſe who affirm a fact, not upon thoſe who deny it. Had Mr. L. however, carefully read over the page in my ſermon, from whence he pretends to quote the paſſage, he muſt have ſeen the evidence he demands. My words are theſe, <q>It muſt be remembered that the apoſtles ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a twofold character, the one extraordinary as apoſtles, the other ordinary as goſpel miniſters. In their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary capacity, they were immediately called by Chriſt. —Were ſent forth by him to be witneſſes of his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. —Were endowed with the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, the knowledge of tongues, the power of diſcerning ſpirits, and of working miracles. They were not limitted to any particular place, one more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the exerciſe of their miniſtry; but had the whole world aſſigned them as their charge; and being under the infallible guidance of divine inſpiration, they had the ſuperintendency and government of all the churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, until the canon of ſcripture ſhould be full, and compleat rules given for that purpoſe in the word of God. In this they had no ſucceſſors, but this part of their office expired with themſelves: For as there is now no occaſion for theſe extraordinary powers, ſince the ſcripture is ſufficiently atteſted, its canon compleated, and every thing neceſſary for the inſtitution and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church, particularly revealed; ſo there are no men ſince the times of the apoſtles, who can lay any claim to theſe extraordinary and miraculous powers; and therefore none can pretend to be ſucceſſors to them in that part of their <hi>character</hi> which was founded on theſe
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:010800_0042_0F81D1C92C36CD48"/>powers.</q>—This was the ſenſe in which I aſſerted <q>the apoſtles had no ſucceſſors,</q> and theſe the reaſons I aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch aſſertion; and to me they appear concluſive: As this extraordinary character of the apoſtles had its riſe in the extraordinary circumſtances, attending them, and was founded in the extraordinary powers beſtowed upon them, it muſt neceſſarily have ceaſed, if the circumſtances and powers have ceaſed, on which it was founded; but that the latter have ceaſed, Mr. L. will not deny: For whatever powers they claim for their biſhops, the pretended ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the apoſtles; I think that of working miracles is not one of them. If he can produce any inſtance of that kind ſufficiently authenticated, they ſhall be properly noticed; if not, he muſt not be offended, if people look upon the claim a little aſſuming, nor pretend the <q>aſſertion is more bold</q> than true, if the right to aſſume the character ſhould happen to be denied.<note n="†" place="bottom">This aſſertion, <q>that the apoſtles as ſuch, have no ſucceſſors, which Mr. L. calls "an opinion which has nothing to ſupport it but the prejudices of education</q> is no way peculiar to preſbyterians. The learned Spanhemius, tho' a zealous prelatiſt, in his diſpute with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt the pope's ſupremacy as Peter's ſucceſſor, maintains that the apoſtolic character is founded in an immediate call, the giſt of tongues, and power of working miracles and is not perpetuated. <q>Let the pope, ſays he, now deſcend from the capitol. Let him, as did the apoſtles, declare that he has the gift of tongues divinely infuſed. Let him bring viſibly the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt from heaven. Let him work like the apoſtles, ſuch illuſtrious miracles, and then we ſhall yield that he has <hi>apoſtolic authority.</hi>" He adds, "They are much deceived who would bring the apoſtles down to the order of particular biſhops.— They were not at all called apoſtles, on the account that they were biſhops, and conſequently, apoſtle and biſhop are quite different things.</q>

                  <bibl>Adverſ. Turrian: Jeſuit.</bibl> Dr. Lightfoot aſſerts and proves, <q>that the apoſtleſhip was an order forever inimitable in the church. The apoſtles could not ordain an apoſtle by the impoſition of hands, as they could ordain elders; but they are forced to uſe a divine lot, which was as the immediate hand of Chriſt impoſed on him that was to be ordained. That opinion took little notice of this circumſtance, that hath placed biſhops in the place of the apoſtles, by a common and ſucceſſive ordination.</q>

OUR author's next attack upon this argument of the one commiſſion, is from the order of deacons, whom the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, he ſays, by virtue of this commiſſion, conſtituted and ordained. <q>They were ordained, he tells us, to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the apoſtles did, before theſe deacons were conſecrated to their office.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 30, 31.</note> It is pity he had not told us what this <hi>ſomething</hi> was, they were ordained to do. This he purpoſely evades; and he had his reaſons for it. If he had done this, he was ſenſible it would have at once appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that their office was not contained in, or virtuated by this commiſſion, and ſo have overthrown his objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my argument, which was <q>that one and the ſame commiſſion, could conſtitute but one office only.</q> This <hi>ſomething</hi> to which theſe deacons were ordained, was to <hi>ſerve tables,</hi> concerning which work, not the leaſt hint is to be found in the miniſterial commiſſion. That indeed impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thoſe to whom it is given, to <hi>preach, baptize,</hi> &amp;c. but ſays not a ſingle word of <hi>ſerving tables</hi> and managing the church ſtock, the peculiar buſineſs of deacons. As therefore the deacons office is not contained in, or virtuated by this commiſſion; ſo the appointment of them no ways militates againſt my argument, that where there is but one commiſſion, there can be but one order or office impowered by it.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' he cannot find the work of a deacon contained in the miniſterial commiſſion, he ſeems very deſirous of having their office virtuated by it, that ſo he may make out
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010800_0043_0F81D1CA215BB028"/>two orders impowered by the ſame commiſſion, contrary to what I had aſſerted. <q>If, ſays he, the commiſſion of the apoſtles, impowered them to ordain but one order of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; how came they to conſtitute the office of deacons.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 31.</note> I anſwer:—They did it, not by virtue of the <hi>miniſterial</hi> commiſſion we have been conſidering, but of that which conſtituted them <hi>apoſtles.</hi> The former, as has been ſhewed, belonged to them, not as <hi>apoſtles,</hi> but as ordinary miniſters of Chriſt, impowered thereby to <hi>preach, baptize,</hi> &amp;c. In vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this, they were no more impowered to conſtitute a new order, than any of their ſucceſſors in the ſame office. But as <hi>apoſtles,</hi> as divinely inſpired, and under the infallible guidance of the Holy Ghoſt, they had power to do it. And in this capacity, and this only, they acted, when they inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this office. As therefore, it was not in virtue of, or by power derived from the general miniſterial commiſſion, that this office of deacons was inſtituted; ſo there can be no argument brought from their appointment, in proof of two or more offices virtuated by this commiſſion; conſequently, my argument, <q>that where there is but one commiſſion, one order only can be virtuated or impowered by it,</q> ſtill ſtands good.</p>
            <p>I readily allow <q>the office of deacon, to be inferior to that of <hi>apoſtle,</hi>
               </q> I grant <q>it is an office in which the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ordination is not included.</q> And if it will pleaſe him, I will concede too, that they may in a general ſenſe, be called "miniſters in Chriſt's church." But then, as they are ſo, not by virtue of the general commiſſion given to miniſters as <hi>miniſters of the word and ſacraments;</hi> but by the expreſs appointment of the apoſtles, acting in their <hi>apoſtolic</hi> character; this will afford no argument in favour, either of his preaching deacons, or of his notion that two or more orders are impowered by this one commiſſion. Let him ſhew in this commiſſion, or elſewhere, as particular an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the appointment of their two orders of biſhops &amp; preſbyters, as we can produce of the inſtitution of deacons. Let him produce as expreſs warrant for deacons preaching, from the account of their firſt inſtitution, as we have for
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:010800_0044_0F81D1CAB2F378E8"/>that of preſbyters, in the general miniſterial commiſſion; and we will readily allow their ſcheme of dioceſan epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be warranted by ſcripture: 'Till then, he muſt not be offended if people call it by its true and proper name, an unſcriptural ſcheme that has no countenance from the word of God.</p>
            <p>BUT he tells me, that I undertook to prove the right of people to chooſe their own miniſters, from the inſtance of deacons being choſen by the church. <q>Now, ſays he, if theſe deacons were miniſters, it proves that there was more than one order of miniſters at that time: If they were not, it does not prove the point for which he brought it.</q>

Deacons being called miniſters in a general ſenſe, agreeable to the original import of the word DIACO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOS, will not prove them to be miniſters in the ſenſe of the commiſſion, that is, <hi>miniſters of the word and ſacraments.</hi> If ſo, Mr. L. muſt admit a <hi>fourth</hi> order into their prieſthood, viz. that of ſhe miniſters: For the apoſtle calls Phoebe a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> (DIACONON) "of the church of Cenchrea."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. xvi. 1.</note> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, calling deacons <hi>miniſters</hi> in this <hi>general ſenſe,</hi> will not prove <q>that there was more than one order of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>in the proper ſenſe,</hi> at that time.</q> And yet their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſters in this general ſenſe, that is, officers or ſervants of the church, and as ſuch, choſen and elected by the church, affords a good argument in proof of the church's right to chooſe her own officers in general, and conſequently thoſe who are to miniſter in the word and ſacraments in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. This inſtance therefore, of the deacons election by the church does as effectually <q>prove the point for which I brought it,</q> as if they had been miniſters in the moſt ſtrict and appropriate ſenſe of the word. Thus my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for but one order of goſpel miniſters, ſtand, I truſt, fully vindicated from this cavil alſo.</p>
            <p>THO' deacons, in the general ſenſe above, may be called miniſters, yet 'tis plain from their original inſtitution they never were deſigned to be miniſters of the word. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their appointment, and the buſineſs they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010800_0044_0F81D1CAB2F378E8"/>to do, is there expreſsly ſaid to be, "to ſerve tables,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts vi. 1—4.</note> and that with a ſpecial expreſs view that the apoſtles being releaſed from this care, might be at liberty to purſue their proper work, to <q>give themſelves to prayer and the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word.</q> Who can once imagine then, that preaching is any part of the deacons buſineſs? That when the apoſtles found, that "ſerving tables was inconſiſtent with and too much for the miniſters of the word, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly inſtituted the order of deacons to eaſe them of that burden, they ſhould nevertheleſs devolve the whole burden of both upon the deacons they had appointed? The apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles themſelves were not ſufficient for both; but the deacons whom they appointed, it ſeems were, if the doctrine of <hi>preaching deacons</hi> be true. When the deacon is employed in his proper work, I know no body that "deſpiſes him" (as Mr. L. complains.) It is an honorable office in the church, and ought to be ſo eſteemed. But when he leaves his buſineſs, and becomes <q>a buſy body in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</q> when he invades an office the ſcripture never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him, and preſumes to preach as a miniſter of the word; if he is not to be <hi>deſpiſed</hi> upon this account, moſt certainly he ought to be <hi>rebuked</hi> for his raſhneſs and preſumption.</p>
            <p>IN my argument from the one commiſſion, I had theſe words. <q>Who hath a right to divide the powers Chriſt has evidently connected in his commiſſion, and give the whole to one order of miniſters, and but half to the other; or rather to create a new order of officers in the church which the goſpel knows nothing of</q>?—From theſe laſt words Mr. L. attempts to prove, that I have cut myſelf off from a regular ordination. For if either the biſhops or preſbyters in their church, are this <q>new order which the goſpel knows nothing of;</q> as we derive our ſucceſſion from the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of their church, by whom our firſt miniſters in this country were ordained, we muſt, he ſuppoſes, derive it from this new order, and therefore our ordinations muſt be null<note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. When any officers in Chriſt's church, in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the powers granted them in the goſpel, engroſs and exerciſe thoſe which do not belong to them, they are ſo far
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:010800_0045_0F81D1CE54357640"/>forth "a new order which the goſpel knows nothing of." This I take to be the caſe with dioceſan biſhops. They ingroſs and monopolize the whole power of ordination and government, which the goſpel leaves, in common, to all goſpel miniſters. In doing this, they uſurp a power, which does not belong to them, and in the exerciſe of this uſurped power, are "an order which the goſpel knows nothing of." This, however, does not nullify thoſe actions, which the goſpel impowers them to perform. Now one of theſe is ordination. Tho' therefore in <hi>ingroſſing the whole power of ordination,</hi> &amp;c. to themſelves, they act as <q>a new order which the goſpel knows nothing of,</q> becauſe they have no right ſo to do; yet barely in <hi>ordaining,</hi> they are an order which the goſpel owns, becauſe, by the goſpel, they have a right to ordain. Again, when an order of officers, from principle, neglect a part of the duties of their office, and which their commiſſion obliges them to do; they are ſo far forth, "a new order which the goſpel knows nothing of." This is the caſe of the preſbyters in the epiſcopal church. Conſidered as ſet apart to the miniſtry by ordination, they are lawful goſpel miniſters. But conſidered as abridging themſelves of one half of the powers that belong to them, as living in a ſtate of ſervile ſubjection to the biſhop by their oath of canonical obedience; and preaching, not in virtue of Chriſt's commiſſion, but the biſhops licence; they are merely of human inſtitution, a <q>new order which the goſpel knows nothing of.</q> But until it is proved, that that an officer's pretending to claim and exerciſe a power which he has not, deſtroys and nullifies the power which he lawfully has; Mr. L's conſequence, as to the unlawfulneſs of my ordination, will by no means follow. If a juſtice of the peace ſhould pretend to engroſs all the authority of his brother-juſtices in a whole county, 'tis plain in ſo doing, he would be an officer which the law knew nothing of. This, however, would not invalidate thoſe acts, which, as a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the law impowered him to do. The pope, with his impious and unſcriptural claim of infallibility and univerſal dominion, over the whole chriſtian church, I hope Mr. L.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010800_0045_0F81D1CE54357640"/>will allow, is an officer which the goſpel knows nothing of: And yet he, and all other advocates for uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, muſt derive it from him, or upon their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they can have no claim to the miniſterial character, However therefore this argument of his, might move one to pity its weakneſs, I find nothing in it to make us <q>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of proper boaſting in the miniſterial authority we have received.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN p. 28 of my ſermon I argued, that as a governor and juſtice of the peace being different officers, muſt be impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by different commiſſions, ſo if there were different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of office in the goſpel miniſtry, we might reaſonably expect different commiſſions, authorizing them to theſe offices.</p>
            <p>TO this Mr. L. replies, that a governor, by virtue of the king's commiſſion, can authorize a juſtice of the peace and other officers, and juſt ſo the apoſtles, by virtue of their commiſſion from Chriſt, "can authorize men of different orders to act in Chriſt's name."<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. Tho' a governor can authorize a juſtice and other officers which the laws of the king or conſtitution have appointed, yet he can create no new officer in the ſtate. So in the other caſe. Tho' the apoſtles could ordain ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers as the goſpel had appointed, yet they could make no new ones, different from, or in addition to thoſe which the laws of Chriſt's kingdom, and the goſpel conſtitution have eſtabliſhed. We know it was agreeable to the goſpel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that they ſhould appoint the office of deacon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have in fact done it. Beſides this, we read of no other order appointed by them. If there be any, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to our opponents to produce them. When Chriſt aſcended, be left only his eleven apoſtles in commiſſion; all of one order, all equal it power. Had two or more orders been neceſſary in the goſpel miniſtry, he <q>who was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all his houſe.</q> would certainly have appointed them, or left orders with his apoſtles to do it. As he has not; as neither he nor his apoſtles have inſtituted, except deacons, any more than one order of officers in the goſpel
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:010800_0046_0F81D1CF146461F8"/>church, 'tis a certain conſequence there are no other. And therefore Mr. L's plea, from what the apoſtles were "im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to do in authorizing different orders," is nothing to the purpoſe. What they were "impowered to do," we muſt judge from what they have in fact done. And as, in fact, they have, beſides deacons, appointed no other order, we may ſafely preſume they were not impowered by Chriſt to appoint any other. As to the three orders which he ſays, they appointed in the church of Jeruſalem, it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conſidered and refuted, and his aſſertion proved to be groundleſs.</p>
            <p>HIS next attack upon me, is for ſaying, <q>that preſbyters have a right to govern the church." This, he ſays, "I labour hard to prove.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 32.</note> 'Tis true I mentioned this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, and, I think, ſufficiently proved it, without any "hard labour." He himſelf allows them ſome power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <q>That they have a right, in ſubordination to their apoſtle or biſhop, to govern their own ſtocks.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. What kind or degree of government, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary of Norwalk, as a <hi>ſimple</hi> preſbyter, pretends to, or what manner of diſcipline he exerciſes over the <hi>flock</hi> there. I am not able to ſay. This, however, I can ſay, that if he exerciſes any diſcipline at all, as a ruler in the church, it is without book. The canons of his church and the rules of his order, having allowed nothing of this kind to him, but reſerved the whole affair to his ordinary. If therefore he ſhould preſume to arrogate any ſuch power, and take it upon him to diſcipline any of his unruly <hi>flock.</hi> 
               <q>I can't ſay, (to uſe his own words to me) how they will reliſh theſe high claims of his.</q> If he ſhould ever attempt any thing of this kind;— <q>unleſs he does it under the ſpecious pretence of appoſing <hi>preſbyterians,</hi>"—"and his people ſhould once come to be cool, he muſt take a great deal of pains, and uſe much art, to bring them tamely to ſubmit to this his claim of authority over them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the direct proof of the preſbyters right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the reader is referred to the latter part of this, and the next ſection. In the mean time there is one ſentence
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010800_0046_0F81D1CF146461F8"/>more in this paragraph, which deſerves a remark. It is this. <q>If he will allow our biſhops, the ſame power over the preſbyters, that the apoſtles exerciſed over their preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we will contend for no more in their behalf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. 'Tis granted the apoſtles exerciſed authority over thoſe he calls preſbyters, in the age in which they lived. But the ſame did they alſo, over thoſe he calls biſhops; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly over Timothy and Titus. If this then is any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in proof of three orders in the church, in proof of the biſhop's authority over the preſbyter now, it equally proves the neceſſity of four orders, and will as effectually eſtabliſh the authority of the pope over all other biſhops, as it will theirs over preſbyters. But the authority the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles exerciſed over other goſpel miniſters, whether preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or biſhops, or by whatever name they were called; they did it, not as ordinary miniſters of the church, not as an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be perpetuated; but as apoſtles, as officers divinely inſpired, &amp;c. When therefore Mr. L. can prove his bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to have the ſame immediate miſſion, miraculous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, infallible guidance, &amp;c. &amp;c, &amp;c. which conſtituted the apoſtolic character and ſuperior authority; it well be then time enough for him to make, and us to grant the above demand.</p>
            <p>MR. L. next imputes to me an argument, for ſupport of our ordination, that I never uſed. He ſays <q>I take a great deal of pains to prove, and often repeat it, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the apoſtles, to ordain and govern, was not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but only implied in their commiſſion"<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 32, 33, 34.</note> This, he ſays, I do in order to prove that the firſt miniſters of this country had power to ordain, tho' no ſuch power was expreſſed, in the commiſſion they received from the biſhops that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them.</q> * Tho' I never tho't of this argument he here frames for me, yet as he has advanced ſome things in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon it, which may tend to miſlead the inattentive, it may be proper to make a few obſervations upon what he here offers.—He firſt tells me, that to the account of the commiſſion in Matt. xxviii. I ought to have joined that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by John; chap. xx. v. 21, 22, 23. Where Chriſt ſays,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:010800_0047_0F81D1CFF7DDD1A0"/>
               <q>As my father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you.—Whoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſins ye remit," &amp;c—"If, ſays he, we lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accounts, theſe two apoſtles give of the matter, we ſhall plainly ſee, that in the apoſtles commiſſion, they were expreſsly impowered to ſend others—to govern the church—to preach and to baptize.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. Great weight, I am ſenſible, is laid by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for prelacy, upon theſe words of our Saviour. <q>as my father hath ſent me, &amp;c.</q> The warm patrons of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, pretend here to find, the biſhops excluſive right to the power of ordination, &amp;c. Tho' by what logic, is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſay. Papiſts, from the ſame text, ſupport the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the maſs. For as God the father ſent Chriſt to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſacrifice for ſin; ſo Chriſt ſent his apoſtles, and they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to offer the ſacrifice of the maſs, that is, the real fleſh and blood of Chriſt in the ſacrament of the ſupper. So that theſe words will prove almoſt any thing and every thing. Now tho' I don't concieve the miniſterial commiſſion, to be contained in theſe words, but rather in thoſe Matt. 28. Yet if it will gratify Mr. L. I am willing, for once, to allow it; to allow the commiſſion to be collected from both. But then I don't ſee what ſervice it will be to his cauſe. For tho' the power of <hi>government</hi> is rather more particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in John's account than thoſe in Matthew's; <hi>the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining power,</hi> about which we are contending, is full as clearly expreſſed in Matthew as in John: Or rather, it is expreſſed in neither. However, tho' the commiſſion in Matthew, ſays nothing expreſsly, about ſending others; yet the promiſe of Chriſt's perpetual preſence, annex't to the commiſſion, neceſſarily ſuppoſes it, as I ſhewed in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; conſequently the ordaining power is fairly implied in the commiſſion. But the utmoſt that can be pretended in John's account, is barely an implication of ſuch power. Mr. L. ſuppoſes that the power "of ſending others," is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in theſe words; <q>As my father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you." Here indeed is expreſs mention of " the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſending Chriſt," and of "Chriſt's ſending the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles;</q> but not a ſingle word of <q>the apoſtles ſending
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:010800_0047_0F81D1CFF7DDD1A0"/>others,</q> or any thing <hi>expreſsly</hi> intimating that ſuch power was committed to them. In order to this, the words muſt have been, "as I ſend you, even ſo do ye ſend others." Mr. L. I conclude, will ſay, that the words, <q>as my father hath ſent me,</q> &amp;c. contain in them a power committed to the apoſtles of <hi>ſending</hi> others. I grant they do. But how? Not <hi>expreſsly,</hi> but only by implication. But then the ſame does the commiſſion in Matthew. As to this then, there is no manner of difference. <q>Perhaps, therefore, (to uſe his own words,) no better reaſon can be given, why Mr. L. will not allow the commiſſion in Matt. 28. to be the only miniſterial commiſſion, than that it does not comport with his <hi>ſcheme.</hi>
               </q> According to "his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>" there are three gradations in the miniſtry. Men muſt be firſt ordained dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, then preſbyters, and finally advanced to the higheſt order, biſhops. But, for this, he found, one and the ſame identical commiſſion would not ſuffice. He has therefore, beſides that mentioned by me, Matt. 28. found, as he thinks, another in John 20. <q>This, he tells us, Chriſt gave to his apoſtles, the night after he roſe from the dead,</q> and ſo before the other. By this then, according to <q>his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>
               </q> the apoſtles muſt have been ordained to no higher order than <hi>deacons,</hi> or at moſt <hi>preſbyters.</hi> The other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that in Matthew, he tells us, <q>was given ſome time after in Gallilee, which therefore, "to comport with his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>
               </q> muſt have made them <hi>biſhops.</hi> But, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for "his <hi>ſcheme,</hi>" the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, according to him, contains the powers of <hi>ordination and government,</hi> and the <hi>laſt,</hi> only thoſe of <hi>preaching and baptizing.</hi> According to his account, therefore, the apoſtles muſt <hi>firſt</hi> have been ordained to the <hi>higheſt</hi> office of biſhops, and <hi>afterwards</hi> to the <hi>lower</hi> one of preſbyters or deacons; which, to make the moſt of it, "comports with his <hi>ſcheme"</hi> but very indifferently, and muſt well nigh "prove fatal to his deſign."</p>
            <p>BUT if this will not help his own cauſe, he thinks it will overthrow ours. For he ſays,— <q>if we find that the words of the commiſſion that their miniſters received from our biſhops, are not expreſſive of ſuch power, (viz, of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010800_0048_0F81D1D0B81A6570"/>and government:) We muſt conclude they did not receive ſuch authority as is pretended.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 34.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. If there is but one miniſterial commiſſion, as has been proved, then all who are lawfully ordained, are veſted with this commiſſion, and all the powers it contains, of which ordination is one, let the intention of the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be what they will. The biſhops, who ordained our firſt miniſters, intended, I hope, to make them lawful miniſters of Chriſt, and inveſt them with his commiſſion; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, uſed words ſufficiently expreſſive of ſuch intention. If they did not do this in our caſe, neither did they, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, in that of Mr. L. and his brethren: They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not lawful miniſters of Chriſt, not being veſted with his commiſſion. But if this was done in the caſe of the latter, it was equally ſo in that of the former; conſequently they were veſted with Chriſt's general commiſſion and with all the powers of it, and thoſe of ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the reſt.</p>
            <p>AS a proof of but one order in the miniſtry, I mentioned, in my ſermon, the elders of the church of Epheſus, Acts xx. and ſaid, <q>the intire guidance and government of the church was committed to theſe elders, without any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſingle perſon as their ſuperior in office.</q> Here Mr. L. demands, <q>Where does he find that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe churches was committed to theſe elders.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. I find it in the words directed to them by the apoſtle, v. 28. He there charges them in theſe words. <q>Take heed therefore to yourſelves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you <hi>overſeers;</hi> to <hi>feed</hi> the church of God." But he tells me "they are here expreſsly ſaid to be made overſeers, not to <hi>govern,</hi> but to <hi>feed</hi> the flock;" and he is really "<hi>amazed</hi> I ſhould aſſert, that the intire guidance and government of the church is committed to them," for he can ſee nothing of it there.</q> Perhaps the following obſervations may help him <hi>to ſee</hi> it.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place. I find this power of government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>name,</hi> by which theſe elders are there called.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:010800_0048_0F81D1D0B81A6570"/>The apoſtle expreſsly calls them <hi>overſeers.</hi> He tells them they were made, EPISCOPOUS, biſhops, over this church, and that by the Holy Ghoſt. This name includes in it the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of rule or guidance. It is rendered, by the beſt lexico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, by <hi>epicopus,</hi> biſhop, <hi>inſpector,</hi> an inſpecter, <hi>praeſes,</hi> a preſident or chief ruler. Accordingly it is the very name that epiſcopalians have appropriated to the higheſt order of their clergy, the biſhops; and that as peculiarly expreſſive of the power of government or chief rule. If therefore their biſhops, as ſuch, are veſted with the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, theſe elders are alſo; for they are expreſsly called <hi>biſhops;</hi> and were made ſuch even by the Holy Ghoſt: Doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt, in making them biſhops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them the whole power of biſhops, and this of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among the reſt. Mr. L. allows, thoſe who are made biſhops, by other biſhops in their church, or even by the grand <hi>pontif</hi> at Rome, to be inveſted with the power of governing the church. But to theſe biſhops at Epheſus, who were made ſuch by the Holy Ghoſt; he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any ſuch power. How partial is this, to ſay no more? This power of government therefore is included in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>name</hi> by which theſe elders are called.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. It is included, and that expreſsly, in the charges the apoſtle gives them. The words are, "to <hi>feed</hi> the flock "of God, POIMAINEIN.<note n="*" place="bottom">paſco, <hi>rego,</hi> curo, doceo. Schrevel. Lex. in verb.</note> The word in the original, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to <hi>rule</hi> or feed, as a ſhepherd does his flock, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it all acts of <hi>paſtoral</hi> government and care. It is derived from POIMEEN, a ſhepherd, whoſe buſineſs is, not only to feed, but to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> his flock. Which title our Lord applies to himſelf, as peculiarly expreſſive of his character, as the "chief ſhepherd and biſhop of ſouls," and of all that power and authority he exerciſes in that character.<note n="‖" place="bottom">John x. ii.</note> Accordingly he uſes the word as his apoſtle does here, in his charge to Peter an apoſtle, and that as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the whole care he was to take of Chriſt's flock, both in government and inſtruction.<note n="†" place="bottom">John xxi. 16</note> Peter uſes the ſame word, in his charge to the elders or biſhops of the churches, to whom he directs his epiſtle.<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Pet. v. 2.</note> That theſe were the proper
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:010800_0049_0F81D1D16C0DE4A0"/>biſhops or rulers of theſe churches, is plain from the apoſtle's charging them to "take the over-ſight of them." EPISCOPOUNTES. To act the biſhop among them; as alſo from his cautioning them againſt <q>
                  <hi>lording</hi> it over God's heritage,</q> i. e. uſing this power of government tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. But to put the matter beyond all diſpute; we find the word ſundry times uſed in the new teſtament, where it can't poſſibly admit of any other interpretation but to <hi>rule,</hi> and therefore is ſo rendered by our tranſlators. Thus when Chriſt is ſpoken of under the expreſs character of a <hi>gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:</hi> He is ſaid, as ſuch, (POIMANEI,) <q>to <hi>rule</hi> God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Iſrael".<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. ii. 6.</note> Again. "To him that overcometh, I will give <hi>power</hi> over the nations, and he ſhall (POIMANEI) <hi>rule</hi> them with a rod of iron.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Rev. ii. 26, 27.</note> Again it is ſaid of the man child, <q>that he was to <hi>rule</hi> (POIMANEI) all nations with a rod of iron.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">cap. xii. 5.</note> Finally the ſupreme dominion and authority of our bleſſed Lord, <q>who hath on his veſture and on his thigh, a name written KING OF KINGS and LORD OF LORDS," is ſet forth by the ſame word, "he ſhall <hi>rule</hi> (POIMANEI) all nations with a rod of iron.</q> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">cap. xix. 15, 16.</note> Thus with an evidence, beyond all exception, it appears, that the power of <hi>ruling or governing</hi> the church of Epheſus, is <hi>expreſsly</hi> committed to the elders of it, by the apoſtle, in this his charge given to them. And yet becauſe our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators uſe the word <hi>feed</hi> in this place, Mr. L. confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts <q>that the direction given to them, was only to <hi>teach</hi> or <hi>feed</hi> the people over whom they were placed.</q> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">P. 43.</note> He puts the words <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>teach</hi> in <hi>italics,</hi> and makes them ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimous terms; at the ſame time he ſets both in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>ruling</hi> or <hi>governing,</hi> which is the original meaning of the word; and then tells us, <q>theſe words expreſsly declare, what they were made overſeers to do; that was, to <hi>feed</hi> the church of God; there is not the leaſt intimation they were to <hi>govern</hi> it." And he "is really <hi>amazed,</hi> he ſays, that I ſhould aſſert the contrary, when the place referred to ſo expreſsly ſays, that the Holy Ghoſt made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, not to <hi>govern,</hi> but to <hi>feed</hi> the church of God.</q> 
               <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">P. 34, 35.</note> What the poor gentleman's <hi>amazement</hi> aroſe from, whether
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:010800_0049_0F81D1D16C0DE4A0"/>from the overbearing luſtre of the evidence he oppoſed, or from what other cauſe; ſure I am, he has groſsly preverted the meaning of this text, by ſo confidently aſſerting, that <hi>nothing concerning the government</hi> of the church, is contained in it; when that is the very thing the apoſtle gives them in charge; and that by a word as expreſſive of it, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, any in the new teſtament. I hope he did not do this, with a diſhoneſt deſign, to impoſe upon his unlearned read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I will not therefore tell him as he <hi>politely</hi> does me, "that he himſelf knew the contrary to be true." This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I will tell him, that if he did not, he was utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified for the controverſy he has undertaken, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to have declined it.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus made good the aſſertion in my ſermon, "that the government of the church was veſted in theſe elders, the argument deduced from it in ſupport of preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian ordination ſtill ſtands good. The inference Mr. L. draws from what he calls "this claim of mine, as to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which he ſuppoſes it will have, upon the minds of my hearers, gives me not the leaſt uneaſineſs. The communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants of our church, which he is pleaſed to call the <hi>meeting</hi> of Stanford, by twenty years experience, well know my principles and practice, as to church government. Every one who reads my ſermon will readily ſee what I meant by ſaying <q>the intire guidance and government of the church, was committed to the elders.</q> That is, not excluſive of the church, but in contradiſtinction to any other pretended ſuperior officer. That they were the only perſons who, <hi>as officers,</hi> had any thing to do in governing the church. This I expreſſed by ſaying, <q>the Holy Ghoſt had made, <hi>not Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> but <hi>theſe elders,</hi> the ſole biſhops of this church.</q> Whereas, when I am profeſſedly ſpeaking of the powers committed to miniſters, by Chriſt's commiſſion; I expreſs it in theſe words. <q>To diſpenſe the word and ſacraments, to <hi>preſide</hi> in the government of the church, and to ordain others.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">preſ. ord. deſ, p. 19.</note> This, I think a ſufficient anſwer to all his quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as to the "powers I claim," in the government of the church. His remarks upon it, conſidering the foundation
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:010800_0050_0F81D1D235160EB0"/>he acted upon, and his end in view; appear as weak, as they are ill natured.</p>
            <p>THUS have I very particularly conſidered, all Mr. L's remarks upon my ſermon, and as I think, abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, all his objections againſt my arguments from the one commiſſion.

And as this is the only argument Mr. L. has pretended to attack, all the others in my ſermon, muſt be preſumed to ſtand good.</p>

               <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> A particular conſideration and refutation of what Mr. L. calls "his direct proof of epiſcopacy, from matters of fact recorded in ſcripture," from <hi>p. 38</hi> to <hi>48.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE whole of what our author calls <q>his direct proof of epiſcopacy," turns upon "the directions given by the apoſtle to Timothy, compared with his charge to the elders of Epheſus." "There are ſome things, ſays he, given in charge to theſe elders, in common with Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: Such as,—to take heed to themſelves and to their doctrine, &amp;c." "But beſides theſe, he tells us, there are ſeveral particulars, of great importance, that Paul gave in charge to Timothy, which he did not ſo much as mention to all theſe elders.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 39.</note>—Particularly.—He informs him as to the qualifications of preſbyters and deacons.—Orders him to charge ſome that they teach no other doctrine.—Charges him to lay hands ſuddenly on no man.—Directs him how to receive an accuſation againſt an elder.—Orders him to rebuke them that ſin, before all. — And finally charges him to keep this commandment unrebukable, till the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <q>Theſe things, he ſays, Paul gave in charge to Timothy, but did not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them to the elders of Epheſus." Hence he infers,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:010800_0050_0F81D1D235160EB0"/>that Timothy was ſuperior in office to theſe elders, and charged with the government of them, and of the church at Epheſus."<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 43, 44.</note> He then concludes, "that Timothy had the ſame authority that their biſhops claim, and the elders the ſame power only that the preſbyters, in their church, exerciſe, conſequently, "that epiſcopacy is of <hi>divine right,</hi> and the whole diſpute is at an end.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 44.</note> This is the true ſtate of his argument preſented in its full force. It turns wholly upon this.— <q>Timothy had <hi>more, and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> charges given him than theſe elders, therefore he was ſuperior to them in office,—veſted with epiſcopal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them.</q>— In anſwer to which I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT if this argument proves Timothy ſuperior to theſe elders; it equally proves Peter ſuperior to the reſt of the apoſtles, and ſo eſtabliſhes the ſupremacy of the pope above all other biſhops, according to the doctrine of the church of Rome.</p>
            <p>IT is evident from the whole hiſtory of the goſpel, that Peter is, in various reſpects, diſtinguiſhed from the other apoſtles. Whenever their catalogue is given, he is placed the firſt.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt. 10.2.</note> Are any ſelect number choſen, upon any ſpecial occaſion, Peter is always one. He is one of the number, and the firſt mentioned, who were picked out to provide for the paſſover,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luk. 22.8.</note> —to attend Chriſt in his transfiguration,<note n="§" place="bottom">Matt. 17.1.</note> and in his agony in the garden<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Matt. 26.37.</note> Our Lord frequently addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his ſpeech to him in particular by name, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the reſt of the apoſtles. His opinion is aſked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the demanded tribute. For him Chriſt, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, prays that <hi>his faith fail not,</hi> and charges him, and him only, to ſtrengthen his brethren. The women at the ſepulchre, are directed by the angel, <hi>to go tell his diſciples, and Peter</hi> in particular, that <hi>he was riſen from the dead.</hi>
               <note n="§§" place="bottom">Matt. 17.25. Luk. 22, 31, 32. Mark 16, 7.</note> And, what is ſtill more directly to the caſe, our Lord par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly applies to him by name, and commits to him the government of the church, without ſaying a word to the reſt of the apoſtles; tho' they were all preſent at the ſame time.— <q>And I ſay unto <hi>thee,</hi> that <hi>thou</hi> art Peter, and upon
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:010800_0051_0F81D1476FC16720"/>this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. And I will give unto <hi>thee,</hi> the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatſoever <hi>thou</hi> ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. 16.18, 19.</note> In the ſame manner, after his reſurrection, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes Peter only, tho' the other apoſtles were preſent, with this <hi>important charge,</hi>—"feed my ſheep,—feed my lambs."<note n="‖" place="bottom">John 21.15, 16, 17.</note> Here now are not only a number of circumſtances menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, which ſeem to give Peter a precedency to the reſt of the apoſtles; but ſundry <hi>important charges</hi> given to him which are not given to them, tho' they were preſent at the ſame time. And what is remarkable, theſe are the very arguments uſed by the church of Rome, to eſtabliſh the pope's ſupremacy, as Peter's ſucceſſor, and give him a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority to all other officers in the chriſtian church. If therefore they are ſufficient to prove Timothy's ſuperiority to the elders of Epheſus, they are equally ſo to prove that of Peter to the other apoſtles, and, conſequently, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſupremacy of the pope over all other miniſters. As the argument is the ſame, it is certainly as concluſive, in the mouth of an Italian roman-catholic, for the pope's ſupremacy, as in that of an Engliſh prelatiſt for the biſhop's ſuperiority. And indeed it is worthy of note, that there is no one argument uſed, by the latter, for the <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy againſt preſbyterians; but what has been uſed with equal force, and equal ſucceſs, by the former for the <hi>divine right</hi> of the <hi>papacy,</hi> againſt proteſtants. If then our author inſiſts upon this argument, as concluſive in his caſe, he muſt own it to be equally ſo, in that of the pope, and, to be conſiſtent with himſelf, muſt turn Roman-catholic: Or if he denies it in one caſe, he muſt give it up in the other, and own there is no force in it when brought to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh dioceſan epiſcopacy.—Moreover,</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF this argument proves Timothy's ſuperiority to the elders of Epheſus, it will equally follow, and upon the ſame principles, that he was ſuperior to many others alſo, whom yet Mr. L. himſelf allows to be biſhops in his ſenſe of the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:010800_0051_0F81D1476FC16720"/>word. He has told us that Barnabas was an apoſtle or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 22.</note> that Epaphroditus was the biſhop of Philippi, and James of the church at Jeruſalem<note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 20.</note> But no where will he find thoſe particular directions given to them, as are here given to Timothy. Where does he find Barnabas the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, James the biſhop of Jeruſalem, or Epaphroditus of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi receiving thoſe <hi>more, and more important charges,</hi> which, as he pretends, diſtinguiſh and prove the epiſcopal character of Timothy biſhop of Epheſus? In this reſpect even the Epheſian elders, to whom yet out author will not allow the epiſcopal authority, have evidently the advantage. For they, he allows, received charges and directions from the apoſtle, tho' not ſo <hi>many</hi> and <hi>important</hi> as Timothy did. But theſe, whom nevertheleſs he owns were proper biſhops, received no ſuch charges. Either therefore he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the epiſcopal character of James, Epaphroditus, &amp;c. and give up his argument for epiſcopacy thence ariſing; or elſe he muſt allow theſe elders of Epheſus to be biſhops, and ſo give up his preſent argument; or finally, which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the ſame, muſt ſuppoſe Timothy to be ſuperior to both, and, by divine right, an arch-biſhop, a prince apoſtle or pope. Nay further, as there are no ſuch particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and <hi>important</hi> charges, in ſcripture, given, even to the twelve apoſtles themſelves, as are here given to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, it muſt follow, from this argument, that Timothy was ſuperior even to them. And that altho' he received his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and charges from the apoſtle Paul, he was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Paul's ſuperior: For we no where find ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular directions and <hi>important</hi> charges given even to him, as are here given to Timothy. Thus this argument for Timothy's ſuperior power and character, while it deprives the Epheſian biſhops of paſtoral authority at the ſame time cuts off all others mentioned in ſcripture, even the apoſtles not excepted, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government.</p>
            <p>THERE is no way, I conceive, to get clear of this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, upon his ſcheme, but only by ſuppoſing, that tho' the apoſtles had not theſe particular directions given them that
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010800_0052_0F81D14891B12108"/>Timothy had, yet all the powers that belong to the paſtoral or epiſcopal function are included in their general commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion given them by Chriſt, and this is ſufficient to conſtitute them proper biſhops. It is granted they were. But then the ſame muſt be granted in the caſe of theſe elders, to whom he denies this power, and then his whole argument is defeated. They alſo were veſted with the powers includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the miniſterial commiſſion given by Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, had a particular charge given by the apoſtle, which, as I ſhall ſhew anon, neceſſarily ſuppoſed theſe powers. Either therefore this argument intirely cuts off the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and all others mentioned in the goſpel, from any claim to the powers of ordination and government, and leaves Timothy the only apoſtle or biſhop; or elſe, if the others are allowed to be veſted with theſe powers, in virtue of the general miniſterial commiſſion; the ſame muſt be granted to theſe elders alſo, and ſo his argument to prove dioceſan epiſcopacy, from this inſtance, looſes all its force.—But.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is not true, in fact, that Paul gave more <hi>important charges</hi> to Timothy, than what he gave to theſe elders, and therefore Mr. L's argument, founded upon the ſuppoſition that he did, is not concluſive. His charge to theſe elders, very expreſsly conſiders them as biſhops of the church of Epheſus; yea as appointed and fixed in the paſtoral or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal office over that church, even by the Holy Ghoſt. <q>Take heed therefore to yourſelves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath <hi>fixed or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed you biſhops.</hi>
               </q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">ATHETO EPISCOPOUS gr. Acts 20.28.</note> When therefore the apoſtle here char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them to <q>take heed to the flock over which they were conſtituted biſhops;</q> it is a direct charge, to do all the work, to diſcharge all the duties, and execute all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the epiſcopal office, conſequently thoſe of ordination and government which are part of thoſe powers. When the fame apoſtle directs Timothy <q>to do the work of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt,</q> all will allow it a command to diſcharge all the duties of that office. And when our Lord, in his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commiſſion to his apoſtles, bids them <q>go teach all nations,</q> &amp;c. it is granted on all hands, to be a command,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:010800_0052_0F81D14891B12108"/>authorizing and requiring them to exerciſe all the offices and powers of the miniſtry. So when the apoſtle here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands theſe elders to "take heed to the flock over which "the Holy Ghoſt had made them biſhops; it equally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes in it a charge to the exerciſe of the whole power and duty of a biſhop, as tho' they had been all particularly enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated, as it is pretended they were in the directions to Timothy. Is Timothy, for inſtance, <q>charged to ſee to the qualifications of ſuch who were to be ordained preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and deacons?</q> The ſame is given in charge to theſe elders, when they are commanded to <q>take heed to this whole flock as its proper biſhops or paſtors, to which office this work belongs. Is Timothy ordered to charge the elders that they teach no other than goſpel doctrines?</q> The ſame is included in the charge given to theſe elders. They are expreſsly commanded to "take heed to the whole flock." &amp;c. to <hi>feed,</hi> i. e. not only to teach, but, as I have largely proved above, to <hi>rule</hi> and govern this church of Epheſus. Paul had particularly reminded them, <q>how that he had kept back nothing that was profitable to them, but had taught them publicly, and from houſe to houſe; that the doctrine he had preached, was repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that he had not ſhuned to declare unto them the whole counſel of God; that he had ſhewed them all theſe things, to the intent that ſo labouring, i. e. as he had done, they might ſupport the weak. &amp;c.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">v. 20, 21, 27, 35.</note> Now what can the apoſtle mean, by ſo particularly mentioning in his charge, what, and how he had preached, but to ſet them an example, how they ſhould preach themſelves? And that they ſhould take care, <hi>that no other doctrine</hi> ſhould be taught by others, is very particularly contained in his exhortation to them. For after he had given them the above charge, as a reaſon of it he immediately ſubjoyns <q>for I know this, that after my departure, ſhall grievous wolves enter in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, not ſparing the flock; alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them. Therefore watch, &amp;c.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">v. 29, 30, 31.</note> But to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010800_0053_0F81D1490B87A900"/>was it for him to forewarn them of theſe <q>grievous wolves, theſe falſe teachers, "and men ſpeaking perverſe things,</q> when, if Mr. L's principles be true, they had no power to prevent them? And how weak, and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, will the apoſtles diſcourſe appear, to aſſign <hi>that,</hi> in particular, as a reaſon, why they ſhould take heed and watch over this church, as its proper biſhops or paſtors, when at the ſame time the apoſtle knew, if Mr. L's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be true, that they had no power, no authority, as ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the church, to call theſe falſe teachers to account, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he had warned them? Would it not appear extremely impertinent, not to ſay ridiculous, for the biſhop of London, Mr. L's dioceſan, to give him a ſolemn charge, to <q>take heed to the church at Norwalk," to watch over it, to feed and govern it as its proper biſhop or paſtor,</q> and that with a ſpecial view to prevent <q>falſe teachers from thruſting themſelves in, and drawing away diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them;</q> when at the ſame time, his Lordſhip well knew, that he was ſo far from having any power to <hi>rebuke an</hi> elder, to <hi>receive an accuſation</hi> againſt theſe falſe teachers, and ſo prevent the bad effects of their endeavours to <hi>draw away diſciples after them;</hi> that he has not authority to call to account, even a private chriſtian, or judge and cenſure the meaneſt offending member in his church? Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it would. But equally impertinent will the apoſtle's charge to theſe elders appear, unleſs we ſuppoſe they had power to call to account, and to cenſure theſe falſe teachers, and ſo prevent the evils, he foreſaw would otherwiſe ariſe.</p>
            <p>THIS power therefore moſt certainly they had.—A pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of "receiving an accuſation againſt an elder," againſt any of their own number, <q>any that ſhould ariſe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves;" and, if found guilty, "of rebuking them openly before all, that others might fear;</q> a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in ſhort, of puting to ſilence falſe or ſcandalous mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and of laying on hands upon others and ordaining them in their ſtead—This power they had equally with Timothy, which tho' not ſo particularly expreſs'd, is yet as neceſſarily included in the charge given to them, as in that
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010800_0053_0F81D1490B87A900"/>given to him. Beſides, Timothy himſelf was certainly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by ſuch elders, as has been already proved, and therefore theſe elders had the ſame power to ordain.</p>
            <p>AND as to "the one ſolemn charge more" ſo very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, mentioned by our author<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 42.</note> as given to Timothy, viz. <q>of keeping the commandment till the coming of Chriſt," ſince he himſelf tells us "that this is of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the promiſe to the apoſtles, <hi>that Chriſt would be with them to the end of the world;</hi>
               </q> it is evident from what he expreſsly allows elſewhere, that this muſt belong to theſe preſbyters, equally with Timothy, even upon ſuppoſition Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy was their ſuperior. For, ſpeaking of this promiſe, he ſays; <q>tho' it might with more propriety be confined to the apoſtolic office, than to the other, i. e. that of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; yet we allow that it extends to <hi>both,</hi> as <hi>both</hi> are to continue to the end of time.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">p. 29.</note> As this charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is what he calls, when applied to Timothy, <q>a charge, not merely perſonal, but ſuch as had relation to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he ſuſtained:" and as this, according to him, "is <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> to thoſe officers of Chriſt, who have power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute other officers in the church;</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 42.</note> it undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from his own conceſſion, that theſe elders, even tho' inferior to Timothy, had power to conſtitute or ordain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officers in the church; <q>for to <hi>their</hi> office, he tells us, was the promiſe and charge given, as well as to that of the apoſtles ſince both are to continue to the end of time;</q> conſequently theſe elders, having his <hi>own</hi> characteriſtic of thoſe who had power to conſtitute others, muſt be inveſted with the power of ordaining by his own conceſſion: And ſo upon his own principles, preſbyterian ordination is ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, "and, to uſe his own words, the diſpute is at an end."</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT Timothy could not be the biſhop of Epheſus, left there with ordaining power, &amp;c. is evident from Mr. L's own definition of an officer veſted with that power. For he tells us <q>that at the time in which the ſcriptures were wrote, none had power to ordain miniſters in Chriſt's kingdom, but thoſe only who are in <hi>ſcripture</hi> called <hi>apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</hi>" <note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 9.</note> Again. "Let it be careſully remarked, that

               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 10.</note> This then, with him, is abſolutely <hi>eſſential</hi> to the character of thoſe who had power to ordain at that time, viz. that they are in <hi>ſcripture</hi> called apoſtles. But now Timothy is no where in ſcripture called an apoſtle, and therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own definition, could not be left at Epheſus with power to ordain. Pity it is he had not thought of this. It would have ſaved him all the learned labour of his <q>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect proof of epiſcopacy.</q> And tho' it would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of the pleaſure of thoſe confident triumphs, with which the concluſion of it is ornamented, and robed him of the applauſe which his zealous admirers laviſh upon this part of his performance more eſpecially; yet, in the judgment of the impartial, <q>his book would have been as good as it is now, tho' not quite ſo long.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT perhaps he will endeavour to prove, for he told us he deſigned it, tho' it ſhould ſeem, he afterwards forgot his promiſe, <q>that Timothy was admitted to the apoſtolic office.</q> But if he was, why is he never called an apoſtle? Paul frequently joyns him with himſelf, in the inſcription of his epiſtles. And tho' he takes to himſelf the name of apoſtle, yet, 'tis remarkable, he never once gives it to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy. His ſtile is, <q>Paul an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, and Timothy a brother.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1.1. Col. 1.1.</note> Now how can this be accounted for if Timothy was an apoſtle? Would the meek, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble St. Paul arrogate to himſelf the honorable title of apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and deny it to Timothy, to whom it was equally due? Moſt certainly not. Beſides, if Timothy was an apoſtle, he was equal to St. Paul. But that he was not, is plain from the authority Paul exerciſes over him. He every where treats him, not as an equal, but an inferior. He writes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to him, in which he warns, directs, charges, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him, in the moſt authoritative manner. Orders him to come to him, to bring his cloke, his books, his parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and perſonally to attend upon him<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Tim 4.18. &amp; 4.16. &amp; 6.13, 14. 2 Tim 4, 1, 9, 13.</note> Is this the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of one to an equal? Eſpecially one of St. Paul's
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:010800_0054_0F81D149C29D53A8"/>meek and humble ſpirit? Certainly not. Timothy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was not, could not be an <hi>apoſtle,</hi> conſequently, if Mr. L's doctrine be true, could not be left at Epheſus with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining power; ſince none, according to him, but <hi>apoſtles,</hi> and ſo called in ſcripture, had power to ordain. In ſhort Paul exerciſes the ſame authority over Timothy, and that even in thoſe directions and charges, on which however, our author founds his epiſcopal or apoſtolic character, as he does over the elders of Epheſus. This would incline one to think, Timothy was ſuperior to theſe elders in no reſpects.</p>
            <p>But if he was, yet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. HE was an evangeliſt, and therefore could not be, as Mr. L. ſuppoſes, a reſident governor or fixed biſhop in Epheſus, or any other place. That he was an evangeliſt we learn from 2 Tim. 4.6. Now the work and buſineſs of an evangeliſt was utterly inconſiſtent with a fixed relation to any church, as its ſtated paſtor or biſhop. He was a kind of ſubordinate apoſtle, an extraordinary and temporary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, whoſe buſineſs was to travel from place to place and water the churches which the apoſtles had planted.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3.6.</note> Or, as Euſcbius expreſſes it, <q>To lay the foundation of faith in ſtrange nations, to conſtitute them paſtors; and having committed to them the cultivating theſe new plantations, to paſs on to other countries and nations.</q>

            </p>
            <p>THIS argument of Mr. L's for epiſcopacy, wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the ſuppoſition of Timothy's being fixed at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> over the elders of that church, as their proper bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, with ordaining and governing powers. He every where ſuppoſes him to be ſuch a fixed officer in that church. <q>He enquires, whether Paul has not given Timothy, a much more extenſive charge to be exerciſed by him at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> than he gave to the elders of <hi>the ſame church.</hi>

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">p. 43.45.</note> He every where ſuppoſes him to be a <hi>fixed</hi> officer in that church, and the whole of his argument depends upon this ſingle circumſtance. If he can't prove this, all his argument in favour of epiſcopacy, from the more
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:010800_0055_0F81D14A6CA0ED40"/>particular directions given to Timothy, than to theſe Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian elders, comes to nothing. This Mr. L. indeed does not once attempt to prove. He ſeems rather to take it for granted: And ſo having begged the main queſtion in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, proceeds to argue from it in ſupport of his ſcheme. And all the evidence that epiſcopalians ever bring, in proof of this main fact, is <q>Paul's beſeeching of him to abide ſtill in Epheſus, while he went into Macedonia.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.3.</note> But does this found like the language of an apoſtle to a fixed paſtor of a church? If Epheſus was his ſtated charge, why is he <hi>beſought</hi> to abide there, when he could do no otherwiſe, without neglecting his duty and ſinning againſt God? And why is he <hi>intreated</hi> to abide there, only while Paul went into Macedonia? If he was biſhop of that church, a ſtated reſidence there, was his indiſputible duty, not only for that ſhort period, but during life. And he would need no <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties</hi> to oblige him to it, unleſs we ſuppoſe the doctrine of <hi>non-reſidence,</hi> ſo much eſpouſed by ſome of his pretended ſucceſſors, was then in vogue. But conſidered as an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, an unfixed itinerant miſſionary, ſuch an entreaty was highly proper. And ſuch an one, 'tis plain from ſcripture, he was. Accordingly, as he is here deſired, by the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to ſtay, for a ſeaſon at Epheſus; ſo we find him upon another occaſion ſent to Corinth. 1 Cor. 16.10. He is with Paul again, when he wrote his ſecond epiſtle to that church. 2 Cor. 1.1. As alſo when he wrote his epiſtle to the Coloſſians. chap. 1. v. 1. At Baerea he was with Paul, and <hi>abode there ſtill</hi> with Silas. Acts 17.14. The word is the ſame, as is uſed for his continuing at Epheſus.<note n="‖" place="bottom">VPEMENON, PROSMEINAI.</note> If therefore, in the one inſtance, his ſo abiding makes him biſhop of Epheſus; it equally makes him biſhop of Baerea in the other. 'Tis true he ſoon left Baerea, and followed Paul to Athens, Acts 17.15. But 'tis equally true that he was to ſtay at Epheſus, only till Paul finiſhed his journey to Macedonia, and returned to him again. I Tim. 3.14. Chap. 4.13. And in the ſecond epiſtle, which was written not long after the firſt, it is moſt probable, from chap. 4. v. 12. that he had left Epheſus already: But
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:010800_0055_0F81D14A6CA0ED40"/>if he had not, 'tis certain he then left it; for the apoſtle there calls him away to Rome, and ſends Tychicus, another evangeliſt to Epheſus. 2 Tim. 4.9., 12, 21. Eph. 6.21, 22. In 1 Theſ. 1.1. we find him in Athens; whence he was ſent to Theſſalonica, and from thence returned back to Athens. 1 Theſ. 3.1, 2, 6. After this he removed with Paul to Corinth. Acts 18.5. From thence he accompanied him to Aſia and Epheſus. Acts 19.1. And thence he was ſent into Macedonia. v. 21, 22. But it would be tedious to follow him, in all his travels to ſo many different places. Enough has been mentioned of his unfixed, itinerant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, to ſhew he was an evangeliſt, and therefore could not be a fixed reſident officer in any church. The ſame might be ſhewn as to Titus, whom epiſcopalians make to be biſhop of Crete, barely becauſe the apoſtle, for ſome ſhort time left him there for certain purpoſes. There is the cleareſt evidence from ſcripture, that they were both of them impowered in the work of evangeliſts. And as this was utterly inconſiſtent with their ſuſtaining a relation to any particular church, as their fixed paſtors or biſhops, 'tis a clear conſequence they did not ſuſtain ſuch relation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our author has argued in ſupport of epiſcopacy from theſe directions given to Timothy, is nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. AS the ſcripture is wholly ſilent as to this notion of Timothy's epiſcopal care of Epheſus; ſo there is nothing in any of the ancient fathers to ſupport this opinion, but much to the contrary. Dr. Whitby, who was well read in the fathers, confeſſes, as I ſhewed in my ſermon, <q>that as to the great controverſy, whether Timothy and Titus were indeed biſhops, the one of Epheſus, the other of Crete, he could find nothing of this matter in any writer of the three firſt centuries, nor any intimation that they bore that name." He adds indeed, "that this defect is abundantly ſupplied by the concurrent ſuffrage of the fourth and fifth." "But theſe, as Dr. Chauncy juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, were times too far diſtant from Timothy and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, to be relied on for the truth of this fact; eſpecially, as in theſe times they had greatly departed from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010800_0056_0F81D14D5FE22BA0"/>of the goſpel.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dud. Lec. p. 51.</note> And if Mr. L's quotations from Iraeneus be true, this ſilence of the fathers for 300 years, concerning the fact in queſtion, is a certain evidence it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did exiſt. Iraeneus's words, as quoted by our author, are,— <q>We can reckon thoſe biſhops who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the apoſtles, and their ſucceſſors, all the way to our time.—We have the ſucceſſion of the biſhops, to whom the apoſtolic church was committed in every place.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 51.</note> Now ſince, Iraeneus lived in the ſecond century; if they had in his time, as he declares, "the true ſucceſſion of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in <hi>every</hi> church, and yet there is nothing to be found of Timothy and Titus in the ſucceſſion for Epheſus and Crete, as Dr. Whitby aſſerts; 'tis an undeniable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that they never were biſhops of theſe churches, let the writers in following ages ſay what they will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, it is evident from eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that the apoſtle John was at Epheſus, and <hi>reſided</hi> there for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time after Paul's departure thence, and after the writing the firſt epiſtle to Timothy, on which his pretended epiſcopacy over that church, is founded. Euſcbius, upon the teſtimony of Iraeneus and Clemens Alexandrinus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <q>that he returned to Epheſus, after his releaſe from baniſhment, and lived there, and among the Aſian church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es until Trajan's reign.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Euſcb. Hiſ. cul. Lib. 3.17. Iraen adv. Hae. III. 3.</note> Now if the apoſtle John reſided at Epheſus and ruled that church by his apoſtolic power, certainly Timothy was not, could not be the ſupreme bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Epheſus. Conſequently all attempts to prove epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy from this argument are to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. AND laſtly, we need not recur to eccleſiaſtical hiſtory for proof of this point. The ſacred ſcriptures abundantly prove, that not Timothy, but the elders of Epheſus, were the true and only <hi>biſhops</hi> of this church. This is evident from the account given of them in Acts 20.17—36. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, Paul had been ſucceſsfully labouring for near three years in and about Epheſus. Great numbers had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the faith. A flouriſhing church gathered and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010800_0056_0F81D14D5FE22BA0"/>ordained. And now that the apoſtle was about to leave them, never to ſee them more; as one deeply concerned for them, ſince he could not viſit the church in perſon, he ſends for the elders of it, preaches his farewell ſermon to them, and gives them his laſt directions and charge, in a moſt ſolemn and moving addreſs. In all which there is not one word mentioned, or the leaſt hint given, of ſetting a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon over them as their biſhop. So far from this, the whole government of the church is expreſsly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>them</hi> and them only, in a ſtate of equality. And what is remarkable, tho' Timothy was probably now preſent, not a ſingle word is ſaid of his relation to this church. No di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are given to <hi>him</hi> as the governor of it, nor the leaſt hint mentioned to theſe elders, to conſider and obey him as their ſuperior: But <hi>they,</hi> the elders, are the only perſons mentioned as the appointed officers in it. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly called its <hi>biſhops;</hi> yea are declared to be appointed ſuch by the Holy Ghoſt. The care and guidance of the church, in all things, is committed to them, and they are, in the moſt ſolemn manner, charged to feed, teach, <hi>rule and govern</hi> it, as its only proper paſtors or biſhops. And what puts the matter beyond diſpute, they are commanded to do this with an expreſs view to prevent the future diſorders which the apoſtle foreſaw, were about to ariſe in this church, by <q>grievous wolves, men ſpeaking perverſe things," thruſting themſelves in," "to draw away diſciples after them.</q> This is the expreſs reaſon aſſigned for giving this charge. To prevent this, they are commanded to <hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> and govern the flock committed to their care, and exerciſe that authority, which, as its proper paſtors or biſhops, they were veſted with, in warning their people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe grievous wolves, convincing theſe gainſayers, or by exerciſing their paſtoral authority, in way of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; to put to ſilence theſe corrupt teachers. But now how inconſiſtent will all this appear, if they were not the paſtors, but only the ſubject preſbyters of this church, as our author affirms? What propriety, in giving them, and them only, this ſolemn charge, when they had no power,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:010800_0057_0F81D14E1810B4A0"/>no authority to comply with the moſt eſſential branches of it? How abſurd, to direct them in the government and diſcipline of this church, both as to private members and corrupt teachers, when they could exerciſe no authority over either, and at the ſame time, intirely to omit Timothy, to whom, and only whom, upon the epiſcopalian ſcheme, the whole of this buſineſs belonged? The ſuppoſition is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. It deſtroys the whole force of the apoſtle's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and renders his diſcourſe quite impertinent.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle, no doubt, had a tender concern for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture welfare and good government of this church. He had long preſided over it in perſon. He was now taking his final leave of its officers, never to ſee them more.<note n="*" place="bottom">v. 25.</note> The elders underſtood him in this ſenſe. They took leave of him, as their apoſtolic father, in a manner moſt tender and affecting, with many tears. <q>Sorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee his face no more</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">v. 38.</note> This then was the proper time, to provide for the future guidance of this church, and its officers; to provide a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon to ſucceed him in the government of it, had this been the ſcripture model, as our opponents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. Had this been the goſpel plan, certainly Paul would not have concealed it from theſe elders, eſpecially at ſuch a time as this. He called them to record, <q>that he was pure from the blood of all men," "that he had kept back nothing that was profitable for them, nor ſhunned to declare unto them, the whole counſel of God.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">v. 20, 26, 27.</note> And then immediately adds, <q>that the Holy Ghoſt had made them the <hi>fixed</hi> overſeers, <hi>biſhops</hi> or paſtors of this church,</q> without ſo much as hinting that any one was to preſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. Had <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> "been profitable to them," the apoſtle muſt have known it. Had it been any part of the "counſel of God," he muſt have told them ſo; for he "kept back nothing of that." Now was the proper time to have done it when he was giving them his laſt, his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions. But neither before, nor now, does he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a word of any ſuch thing. On the contrary, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly commits to theſe preſbyters, in a ſtate of parity, the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:010800_0057_0F81D14E1810B4A0"/>whole government of this church, which plainly ſhews, that dioceſan epiſcopacy was no part of "the counſel of God," and therefore not of divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>IN this view of the caſe, the <hi>directions</hi> given to Timothy, while at Epheſus, (if indeed he was there when he received them,) will nothing weaken the force of this concluſion: And yet on them, the whole ſtrength of Mr. L's argument depends. For, granting he was there, when he received theſe epiſtles; yet all ſkilful chronologiſts agree, they were wrote, long before this convention of Paul, and the elders at Miletus; and moſt probably, before the church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus was ſettled according to goſpel order, with preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appointed in it. If this was the caſe, the <hi>directions</hi> muſt be ſent to Timothy, for there was no other officer to whom they could be ſent. His ſtay, however, at Epheſus, was but ſhort at the longeſt. He was ſoon called away by the apoſtle, and there is no account that he ever returned. If he did, it could not be as their biſhop; for this office was conferred upon the elders, by the expreſs direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Veſted with this office, the apoſtle found them, when they met him at Miletus; and in full poſſeſſion of it, he left them, when he took his final leave of them, never to ſee them more. Judge then, who is to be credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this eaſe; our author, who ſays theſe elders were only ſimple preſbyters, without any paſtoral authority in this church; or the apoſtle, who expreſsly charges them, to exerciſe ſuch authority in the government of it!—Mr. L. who confidently aſſerts, that Timothy was their only biſhop, to whom they and the church of Epheſus were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as their ſingle paſtor or overſeer; or St. Paul, who aſſures us, that theſe elders were appointed by the Holy Ghoſt, in parity, the <hi>overſeers</hi> or <hi>biſhops</hi> of this whole flock! <q>Look into the ſcriptures. Judge for yourſelves. If what I have advanced, is not fact, it may be eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. If it is an undeniable truth, it is a truth of great importance, if religion be ſo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I AM now prepared for a few remarks upon ſome ſelect paſſages in this part of Mr. L's defence, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this ſection.</p>

HE enquires,— <q>If the elders of Epheſus had power to ordain and govern, what need of <hi>ſending</hi> Timothy there?</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>leaving</hi> him there, he ſhould have ſaid. — I anſwer,</p>
            <p>IT does not appear from ſcripture, that this church had any ſettled paſtors at this time. But if it had, they needed the divine directions concerning ordination and government, contained in theſe epiſtles to Timothy, as much as we do at this day. And who more proper to receive, and put them in execution, than an evangeliſt, an extraordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, and a faithful companion of Paul? But till he can prove that Timothy was left there, as a reſident paſtor over that church, as fully as I have, that the elders were, this will be no ſervice to his cauſe. Barely his being <hi>ſent to</hi> Epheſus, will not prove this. If ſo Tychicus alſo was their biſhop, for he was ſent there as well as Timothy. And upon the ſame principle, Timothy muſt have been biſhop alſo of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, Theſſalonica, Macedonia, &amp;c. for to all theſe was he ſent as well as to Epheſus. This would be to make him a <hi>prelatiſt</hi> as well as a <hi>non-reſident,</hi> and exhibit a compleat idea of modern epiſcopacy. Again,</p>
            <p>HE demands a proof from facts recorded in ſcripture, <q>that <hi>mere</hi> preſbyters, in virtue of their office as ſuch, did ordain officers in the church of Chriſt.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 46, 47.</note> Anſwer,</p>
            <p>IF by <hi>mere</hi> preſbyters, he means, ſuch as thoſe in his church, profeſſedly ſubjecting themſelves to biſhops, and diſclaiming all paſtoral authority in ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; none will pretend to prove from ſcripture that ſuch ever did ordain. And good reaſon for it. The ſcripture knows of no ſuch order. But if he means ſcripture-preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, ſuch as thoſe at Epheſus; preſbyter-biſhops, ſuch as Timothy and Titus were directed to ordain; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved, ſuch preſbyters did in fact ordain, and that by virtue of their office. Of this ſort were thoſe, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Paul, Barnabas and Timothy, as I have already proved, <hi>by expreſs facts recorded in ſcripture.</hi> And what is more: The ſcriptures plainly ſhew, that none but ſuch ought to ordain; they being the only miniſters, authorized by Chriſt's general commiſſion, and veſted with all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers it contains.</p>

WHAT he quotes from Mr. Beach, reſpecting our firſt miniſters, who were ordained by the Engliſh biſhops, is no valid objection againſt this, even allowing that there was no expreſſed intention, either in the ordainers, or ordained, of conveying the power of ordination. For the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, not the intention of the ordainers, is what conveys the power in ordination, as I ſhewed in my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I now add.—Theſe firſt miniſters of N. England were ordained, I conclude, in the ſame manner as Mr. L. and his brethren were. Either therefore he is no miniſter of Chriſt, not being veſted with his commiſſion in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Or if the words uſed in his ordination, were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſſive of ſuch inveſtiture, in his caſe: they were equally ſo in that of our miniſters; conſequently, they were cloathed with all the powers the commiſſion contains, of which that of ordination is confeſſedly one.</p>
            <p>AS to the other part of this objection, the oath of cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical obedience; tho' it is far from being true, that this, as he affirms, includes in it <q>a ſolemn promiſe never to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain others;</q> yet allowing it did, ſuch promiſe, being evidently ſinful, can't be binding upon conſcience, but is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> null and void. A number of the Jews bound themſelves by ſolemn oath, <q>not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Act 23.12.</note> If this oath was binding, it was their duty to keep it; conſequently murder is a duty. For the murder of Paul or of themſelves, was a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their keeping this oath. But if it was not bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this inſtance, no more was it in the caſe he ſuppoſes, conſequently the objection is of no force.</p>
            <p>MR. L. ſays,— <q>Nothing is now claimed by our biſhops, but the very ſame that St. Paul gave in charge to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Nothing prohibited to the elders and preſbyters of our church, that he commanded the elders to do, at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 47.48.</note> Is this really the caſe? Do not their biſhops <hi>claim</hi> a power of adminiſtring the ſacraments, of baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper? But where will he find this mentioned in Paul's charge to Timothy? Do not the former <hi>claim</hi> the power of confirmation and abſolution? But does Paul men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010800_0059_0F81D14FB50F7F00"/>either, in his charge to the latter? The biſhops in their church, <hi>claim</hi> the whole excluſive power of eccleſiaſtical rule or government. But where do we find Paul giving this to Timothy? On the contrary, does he not expreſsly <hi>charge</hi> him, that thoſe preſbyters he was to ordain, ſhould be <q>men that ruled well their own houſes, that they might be able to <hi>rule</hi> the church of God?</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Tim. 2.4, 5.</note> Does he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly command, <q>let the elders who <hi>rule</hi> well be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of double honour?</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Cap. 5. v. 15.</note> But what occaſion for this, if the biſhop had the ſole power of government? I add; where does he find the apoſtle <hi>charging</hi> his grace, Timothy lord biſhop of Epheſus, <q>to entangle himſelf with the affairs of this life:</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2.4.</note> To intermeddle, and bear a chief part in civil matters, to erect courts, and preſide in them, either in perſon, or by his <hi>lay</hi> chancellor, for the trial of all cauſes, teſtamentary and matrimonial, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.? And yet he knows a ſet of biſhops, pretending to be the only ſucceſſors of Timothy and the apoſtles, who actually <hi>claim</hi> and exerciſe all the fore-mentioned powers. Paul tells the Epheſian elders, <q>that the Holy Ghoſt had made them paſtors or biſhops over the whole flock.</q> and charges them to exerciſe the powers of ſuch, to feed, to <hi>rule</hi> and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern this church as its proper biſhops, to uſe their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if neceſſary, in a way of diſcipline, and prevent falſe teachers creeping in, to draw away diſciples: And is there any thing, I aſk, of this kind, <hi>allowed</hi> to Mr. L. and his brother-preſbyters in their church? Not in the leaſt. He himſelf knows, that by the rules and canons of his order, he is abſolutely <hi>prohibited</hi> every thing of this kind.</p>
            <p>THUS have I anſwered every thing material in this part of our author's defence;—particularly ſhewed, from <hi>facts recorded in ſcripture,</hi> that Timothy neither was, nor could be a fixed biſhop of Epheſus, ſettled there, with governing, powers over theſe elders; but that this church was moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently ſettled upon the preſbyterian plan,—that St. Paul when taking his leave of it, never to ſee it more, very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly left the intire guidance of it, not to a ſingle perſon, not to Timothy, but to theſe elders in a ſtate of parity; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:010800_0059_0F81D14FB50F7F00"/>that this is the true ſcriptural plan of church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and government, and therefore, preſbyters, or ordinary paſtors, in ſuch ſtate of equality, have the power of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c committed to them.</p>
            <p>I HAVE nothing to add, but my moſt earneſt wiſh and prayer, that the great head of the church would guide us into all truth, and inſpire all proteſtants, eſpecially goſpel miniſters, with the ſpirit of meekneſs, forbearance and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards each other, even tho' not exactly of one mind in all points; that ſo, inſtead of worrying and cruelly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our fellow chriſtians, and thereby, giving advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us to the partrons of popery, infidelity and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion; we may all cordially unite, in oppoſing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies of chriſtianity, and promoting the grand and important truths, in which we all agree.</p>

               <hi>SECT. VIII.</hi> Mr. L's proof of epiſcopacy from the writings of the fathers, contained in his appendix, <hi>from p. 49, to 61,</hi> examined and refuted.</head>
            <p>OUR author propoſes, in this part of his work, <q>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what form of government prevailed, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the apoſtles. "To anſwer this enquiry, he tells us, he will exhibit a few extracts, from the ancient fathers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HIS firſt <hi>extract</hi> is, from that truly <hi>ancient apoſtolic father,</hi> arch-deacon Echard of England, who flouriſhed about A. D. 1699. But what purpoſe this <hi>extract</hi> is deſigned to ſerve, the reader muſt determine for himſelf, for I am not able to help him.</p>
            <p>HIS next is from Euſebius. He, I own, is one of the <hi>fathers;</hi> but far from being an <hi>ancient</hi> one: For he lived in the fourth century. And as he himſelf tells us, in his hiſtory <q>that he could trace no footſteps of any going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, only in a few narratives,</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> there is little depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon what he ſays, of things ſo remote from his time. However the paſſage quoted is this. <q>St. John, being by Domitian's death, releaſed from baniſhment, returned,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:010800_0060_0F81D15071AD8B68"/>and took the care of the church of Epheſus; and upon the invitation of the neighbouring <hi>churches, who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed only the miniſtry of preſbyters and deacons,</hi> he went to them, and conſecrated biſhops,</q> &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. L's def. p. 49.50.</note> I have carefully examined the paſſage in Euſebius, Mr. L. refers to; but find it very different from what he has quoted. None of the words, ſet down in italics, are to be found in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. The paſſage truly rendered, is as follows. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of John, he ſays.— <q>After the tyrant's death, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Epheſus; and being invited ſo to do, went alſo among the neighbouring nations, where he appointed bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, eſtabliſhed regular and compleat churches, elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the clerical office whomſoever the Holy Ghoſt pointed out for the ſame.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Euſeb. eccl. hiſt. Lib, III. cap. 23.</note> Tho' I will not charge Mr. L. with diſhoneſty, in thus pretending to quote from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, what is not to be found in him; ſince 'tis poſſible he might not have <hi>leiſure to conſult the original,</hi> but taking the tranſlation upon truſt, ſet down the paſſage as he found it, in ſome epiſcopal writer; yet every one muſt ſee, the words added, in Mr. L's quotation, intirely alter the ſenſe of the paſſage, and make it evident it was done, by <hi>ſomebody,</hi> to favour epiſcopacy, and impoſe upon the unlearned reader. With the addition of the words.— <q>who had enjoyed only the miniſtry of preſbyters and deacons;</q> the paſſage does indeed <hi>ſeem</hi> to favour the doctrine of three orders in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: but let it be read without this corrupt addition, and then let the intelligent reader judge, what it is to Mr. L's purpoſe; or whether any other eight lines, taken at random, from Euſebius, or any other author, will not as effectually prove epiſcopacy, as theſe here quoted? Striped of this addition the paſſage mentions but one officer, viz. a biſhop in theſe churches; and as that, in ſcripture, means the ſame as preſbyter, by his own conceſſion, it can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>HIS next quotation is from Irenaeus, <q>That Polycarp was conſtituted by the apoſtles in Aſia, <hi>biſhop</hi> of the church at Smyrna.</q> Anſwer. St. Paul, whoſe authority is at leaſt equal to that of Irenaeus tells us, <q>that the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:010800_0060_0F81D15071AD8B68"/>conſtituted the elders of Epheſus, <hi>biſhops</hi> of the church of Epheſus.</q> If therefore Polycarp's being called biſhop, proves him ſuch in Mr. L's ſenſe of the word; theſe elders muſt be ſo too. But then what becomes of his main argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for prelacy, from Timothy's being biſhop of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus? Or if he ſtill denies theſe elders to be biſhops, tho' they are called ſo, the ſame he muſt do as to Polycarps. And ſo this <hi>extract</hi> fails him alſo.</p>
            <p>BUT he tells us, the deſign of Irenaeus was to prove a ſucceſſion of apoſtolic doctrines, <q>but his argument is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually good in favour of a ſucceſſion of biſhops.</q> And this, he ſays, will prove <q>that biſhops were ſuperior to preſbyters.</q> Anſwer. Not till he proves there were, beſides theſe here called biſhops, any preſbyters in that church for them "to be ſuperior to. Irenaeus, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage quoted, mentions but one order only. This <hi>extract</hi> therefore, is ſo far from helping Mr. L's ſcheme of three orders, that it is wholly in favour of our's which has but one.</p>
            <p>THE ſame anſwer alſo will ſerve, for his three next <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> from Irenaeus. As there is no mention made in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, of more than one order, viz. biſhops, nor the leaſt hint given concerning any other; it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that Irenaeus knew of none, but ſuch biſhops or preſbyters as are mentioned in ſcripture. Conſequently that the doctrine of three orders, and Mr. L's dioceſan bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, was a ſtranger in the time in which this father lived: I ſhall only juſt add. That Mr. L's <hi>tranſlator,</hi> has again ſerved him ill. For in the firſt of theſe quotations the words of Irenaeus, as recited by Euſebius, are not <q>that Clement is he of whom mention is made Philip: iv. 3. as Mr. L. has it, but "that Linus is he, of whom Paul makes mention in his epiſtle to Timothy.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Euſeb. eccl. Hiſt. lib. v. cap. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>HIS next <hi>extract</hi> is from Jerom. <q>Quid facit, exceptà or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatione, epiſcopus, quod preſbyter non facit?" "What can a biſhop do, except ordination, that a preſbyter may not do?</q> Had Mr. L. anſwered this queſtion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own principles, the reader would, at once, have ſeen, how very little it was to his purpoſe. For is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:010800_0061_0F81D15179AF41F8"/>thing in the church of England, ordination excepted, but what is common to the preſbyter and biſhop? Certainly there is. Mr. L's biſhop can confirm,—hold ſpiritual courts, exerciſe diſcipline, &amp;c. But is a preſbyter allowed to do thoſe? Nothing leſs. But Jerom does not even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that <hi>ordination</hi> belongs only to the biſhop, by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right.</hi> And had Mr. L. read the epiſtle, from whence theſe words are taken, he muſt have ſeen, that the whole ſcope of it is to prove, that in the apoſtles times, biſhop and preſbyter were the ſame, both in name and office. This he aſſerts, in ſo many words, and proves it from the ſame texts and topics, as are uſed by preſbyterians at this day; and then goes on to ſhew, how, when, and upon what occaſion the government of the church was altered after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. <q>That one was afterwards choſen, who ſhould be ſet over the reſt, he tells us, was done as a remedy againſt ſchiſm.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hieron. Epiſ. ad. Evagr. Tom. II. p. 109.</note> When therefore he uſes the words Mr. L. has quoted, he evidently does it to ſhew, <q>what was the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the church <hi>in his time;</hi>
               </q> not what prevailed in that of the apoſtles. 'Tis pity Mr. L. will not be at the pains of reading the fathers <hi>himſelf.</hi> It might, perhaps, ſave his friends many a bluſh upon his account.</p>
            <p>THE next church he mentions, as upon the epiſcopal model, is that of Antioch. <q>In this, he tells us, was a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of believers, whom the apoſtles, Paul and Barnabas, took the government of for ſome time.</q> Strange! Two biſhops in one church at once! How different the <hi>modern</hi> epiſcopacy from the <hi>ancient!</hi> Formerly one church could boaſt two biſhops, and both apoſtles. But their <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> it ſeems, have made ſuch improvement in the prelatic art, that one biſhop now will ſerve for more than an hundred. This muſt be ancient epiſcopacy inverted. However, this was not the caſe long. <q>Paul and Barnabas, he ſays, were ſoon ſucceeded by Peter.</q> What, Peter biſhop of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och! We thought he had been metropolitian of Rome. But this was not long. <q>Euodius ſoon takes his place; to whom ſucceeded Ignatius;</q> Whoſe epiſtles, we are told, contain the very model and marrow of modern epiſcopacy.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:010800_0061_0F81D15179AF41F8"/>Accordingly our author is longer upon this favourite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, than all the reſt of the fathers; tho' I think he gives us but one or two <hi>extracts</hi> from him, and them but ſhort.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 52, 53, 54, 55, 56.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the epiſtles aſcribed to Ignatius, Mr. L. muſt know, if he has read Dr. Chauncy's ſermon, that they lie under very ſtrong ſuſpicions of forgery, or at leaſt of great adulteration and corruption. This the Dr. largely ſhews in his appendix, and offers ſuch arguments in ſupport of the charge, as makes it, at leaſt very highly probable, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this was the caſe. Theſe, Mr. L. does not attempt to anſwer. He indeed tells us. <q>that biſhops Beveridge and Pearſon have fully confuted, Meſſrs. Daille, L'arroque, and all others, in whatever they have advanced againſt theſe epiſtles." And I can tell him "that L'arroque un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to anſwer Beveridge and Pearſon, as appears by a manuſcript found among his papers, in which he had made great progreſs; but at the <hi>deſire</hi> of ſeveral perſons, who <hi>leaned too much to the epiſcopal cauſe,</hi> he did not finiſh this reply.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Nov. Rep. Lit. Tom. I. Art. 5. p. 56, 57.</note> A victory obtained by ſuch arts as theſe, can do no great honour to the conquerors. This ſtory, Mr. L. if he pleaſes, may confront with his, concerning Blondel in pag. 69 of his book.</p>
            <p>BUT if we ſhould allow theſe epiſtles to be genuine, they will really make nothing in favour of dioceſan epiſcopacy, but much againſt it. 'Tis true, they frequently mention biſhops, preſbyters, and deacons: But then it is equally true, that the biſhop deſcribed in theſe epiſtles, was eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially different from the dioceſan one. The <q>Ignatian bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</q> preſided over but one ſingle church, was therefore no more than a congregational biſhop, or paſtor of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church: Whereas the dioceſan one, preſides over many ſcores or hundreds of congregations. Again, the former had much the ſame authority over his preſbyters, as the rector of a pariſh, in the church of England, has over his aſſiſtant curates, who are not pretended to be of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent order, but have <hi>radically</hi> the ſame power with the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: But the church of England biſhop, is aſſerted to be a different order from the preſbyter; by divine right, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010800_0062_0F81D151F1E78EF8"/>to him, and veſted with the ſole power of ordination and government. A few <hi>extracts</hi> from theſe epiſtles will ſerve to prove this. <q>Let all follow the biſhop as Jeſus Chriſt; and the preſbyters, as the apoſtles."—"Let none do any of thoſe things which belong to the church without the biſhop."—"Where the biſhop appears, let the multitude, or congregation be."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ignat. Epiſt. ad Smyrn. ſec. 8. p. 37.</note> "If the prayer of one or two have ſo much efficacy, how much more the prayer of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and the whole church?

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad Philadelph. ſec. 2.</note> From theſe paſſages it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the dioceſe of the Ignatian biſhop, was no larger, than could meet together in one place, for public worſhip, with the biſhop and preſbyters. But it is impoſſible for a modern dioceſe, conſiſting of ſome hundreds of congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to attend divine ſervice in one place.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. It is plain, from theſe epiſtles, that the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were not to be adminiſtred, but in the preſence of the biſhop. <q>Let that euchariſt be accounted valid which is celebrated in the biſhop's preſence, or by his permiſſion; where the biſhop appears, let the multitude be;—it is not lawful without the biſhop, either to baptize or to make a love feaſt."<note n="§" place="bottom">ad Smyrn. ſec 8. p. 37.</note> "Take care to uſe, or frequent, one euchariſt; for there is one fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and one cup for union in his blood; there is <hi>one</hi> altar, as there is <hi>one</hi> biſhop."<note n="§§" place="bottom">ad Philadelph. ſec 4.</note> "Since every one of you <hi>by name,</hi> with common conſent, meet together,—that you may obey your biſhop and the preſbytery, with an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided mind, breaking <hi>one loaf,</hi> which is the medicine of immortality.</q> 
               <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">ad Epheſ. ſec. 20.</note> From theſe paſſages it appears, that as every altar, or communion table, had its biſhop; ſo all the communicants, in his whole dioceſe, ſteadily met together with the biſhop, to receive the ſacraments, and that it was not allowed to receive them, but from his hand, or in his
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:010800_0062_0F81D151F1E78EF8"/>preſence. But now, how different is the caſe from this in the church of England? There, one biſhop has many ſcores or hundreds of communion tables in his dioceſe, and a great many thouſand communicants; for whom it would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible, to attend the communion at one table, with their biſhop, and receive the conſecrated elements, at his hands, or in his preſence.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the Ignatian biſhop took care, in perſon, of all the poor of his dioceſe; which plainly ſhews it was but a ſingle congregation he preſided over. Thus Polycarp, biſhop of Smyrna, is commanded to do. <q>Let not the widows be neglected: Be thou, next to the Lord, their guardian. Let nothing be done without thy will. Let your religious aſſemblies be more frequent. Enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all <hi>by name.</hi> Do not proudly overlook the men-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and maid-ſervants.</q>

            </p>
            <p>I MIGHT eaſily fill ſeveral pages with extracts to the ſame purpoſe. But theſe are abundantly ſufficient to ſhew, that the biſhop deſcribed in theſe epiſtles, was not, could not be a dioceſan biſhop, but only a paſtor of a ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, agreeable to the practice in our churches. And notwithſtanding all the buſtle made, with theſe epiſtles, by epiſcopalians; ſhould the epiſcopacy deſcribed in them, once take place; it would be as certainly ruinous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, to the <hi>engliſh hierarchy,</hi> as that contained in the ſcriptures, and practiſed in our churches, would be. Then there would be no longer, any of thoſe large and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown biſhopricks, ſo much, and ſo juſtly complained of, even by epiſcopalians themſelves, containing ſome hundreds of churches and congregations, with but one ſingle paſtor to watch over, to inſpect, and govern the whole: But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry congregation, every church, would have its own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſtor for theſe important purpoſes; as the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians actually have. Hence it will follow; that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal ordinations at this day, are by no means the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ordinations of the Ignatian age, being performed by a ſort of biſhops, unknown at that time, and whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is inconſiſtent with, and deſtructive of, that of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natian
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:010800_0063_0F81D152AD9134F8"/>biſhop: Whereas, the ordinations, called preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, are truly <hi>epiſcopal</hi> ones, in the language of Ignatius. They are performed by ſuch pariſh-paſtors, as Ignatius's biſhops were; having the ſame charge, the ſame office, and power, as his had. And therefore, to preſs Ignatius into the cauſe of dioceſan epiſcopacy, and argue from the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's power, as deſcribed by him, in ſupport of that which modern biſhops claim, is but to impoſe upon the reader, by mere ſounds inſtead of arguments.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER would ſee more upon this argument, I would recommend to them the peruſal of Mr. Boyſe's <q>clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ancient epiſcopacy," and, "an enquiry into the conſtitution, diſcipline, unity and worſhip of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive church,</q> ſaid to be wrote by Sir Peter King. Theſe authors, eſpecially the former, have collected every thing from Ignatius, relative to the ſubject, and clearly ſhewn, that the Ignatian biſhop was but a paſtor of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle congregation, and therefore can afford no countenance or ſupport to modern epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>OUR author next mentions Clemens Alexandrinus, as declaring in favour of his ſcheme:<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 56.</note> But as he uſes, not Clement's words, but his own, and refers to no particular place for what he advances; it may be ſufficient to tell him, that when he does this, it will be then time enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him.</p>
            <p>HIS next voucher is Clemens Romanus. He is made to ſay, <q>To the high prieſt, his proper offices were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the prieſts had their proper order, and the levites their peculiar ſervices, or <hi>deaconſhips.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I grant there are words to this purpoſe, in Clement's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Corinthians: But that <q>he applies theſe words, as Mr. L. ſays, to the orders in the chriſtian church,</q> I utterly deny. I have carefully examined every thing in this epiſtle, as to this point, and can find nothing that looks like ſuch "an application?" And I challenge Mr. L. or any one elſe to point it out.

<pb n="125" facs="unknown:010800_0063_0F81D152AD9134F8"/>our opinion, more clearly, and fully, than in his words. Every thing he ſays, of the form of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government, exactly agrees with ſcripture.—He never diſtinguiſhes preſbyters from biſhops; but theſe names ſignify the ſame with him, as they do alſo with the ſacred ſcriptures. He makes the church of Corinth to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not to one ſingle perſon, but to a company of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops or preſbyters.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">vind. p. 351.</note> He reproves the Corinthians, for making an oppoſition againſt their <hi>preſbyters,</hi> and caſting them out of their <hi>epiſcopal office.</hi> Which plainly ſhews, that with him, biſhop and preſbyter are the ſame office, as they are in ſcripture. And having exhorted them to peace, and ſubjection to their ſpiritual guides; the more deeply to impreſs their minds with this exhortation, he tells them, <q>that the apoſtles, receiving inſtructions, and being ſent out by Chriſt,—went forth, declaring the glad tidings of the coming of the kingdom of God; and preaching thro' countries and cities, they conſtituted the firſt fruits of their miniſtry, for <hi>biſhops and deacons</hi> of thoſe that ſhould afterwards believe, having by the ſpirit approved them.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Clem.

            <p>MR. L's laſt teſtimony from the fathers, is from Jerom. <q>What Aaron and his ſons and the levites were in the temple; that ſame are biſhops, preſbyters and deacons in the chriſtian church.</q>

In his commentary upon Titus,<note n="§" place="bottom">Tom. 9. p. 103</note> having declared, <q>that preſbyter is the ſame with biſhop, that, according to ſcripture, one is the name of age, the other of office;</q>. and largely proved, from the ſame texts and arguments, as are uſed by preſbyterians, that in the times of the apoſtles, <q>the care of the church was equally divided among many, being governed by the common council of preſbyters;" he adds: "Theſe things are alledged that we might ſhew, that among the antients, the <hi>preſbyters were the ſame with the biſhops,</hi> but by little and little, the whole care was devolved on one, that the ſeeds of diſſention might be plucked up. As therefore the preſbyters know, that by the cuſtom of the church, they are ſubject to him who is their <hi>preſident,</hi> ("praepoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus;") ſo let biſhops know that they are above preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, more by the cuſtom of the church, than the real <hi>appointment of the Lord;</hi> and that they ought to rule the church in common." Again. "Among the ancients, biſhops and preſbyters were the ſame; for one is the name of dignity, the other of age.</q>

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:010800_0064_0F81D15718994590"/>with quotations from him to the ſame purpoſe. And as to the paſſage Mr. L. has here quoted from him, if he will read what a dignitary of his own church has ſaid upon it,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Stilling. iren. p. 265.</note> he will at once ſee that it is nothing in ſupport of his cauſe. He will there ſee, that the whole drift of the epiſtle is to chaſtiſe the arrogance of <hi>one,</hi> who had pretended, that dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were ſuperior to preſbyters. To confute this notion, he largely proves from ſcripture, that a preſbyter is ſo far from being inferior to a deacon, that on the contrary, he is really equal to a biſhop, being the ſame office, according to ſcripture account. Whereupon he immediately adds the words quoted by Mr. L. Now can it once be ſuppoſed, that a man of Jerom's good ſenſe, after he had been prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſbyter's ſuperiority to a deacon, by ſhewing that he was <hi>equal</hi> to, and in fact, a biſhop, ſhould immediately be guilty of ſuch an inconſiſtency, as to aſſert a biſhop to be <hi>ſuperior</hi> to a preſbyter, as Mr. L. by his quotation would make him to do? 'Tis abſurd to ſuppoſe it. <q>The plain meaning of Jerom, (as Dr. Stillingfleet obſerves,) is no more than this. "That as Aaron and his ſons, in the order of prieſthood, were above the levites, under the law; ſo biſhops and preſbyters, (which are with him the ſame,) in the order of the evangelical prieſthood, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the deacons, under the goſpel: For the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon runs, not between Aaron and his ſons under the law, and biſhops and preſbyters under the goſpel; but between Aaron and his ſons, as one part of the compariſon, under the law, and the levites under them, as the other; ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpel, biſhops and preſbyters make one part of the compariſon, anſwering to Aaron and his ſons, in that wherein they all agree, viz. the order of prieſthood; and the other part, under the goſpel, is that of deacons, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the levites under the law.</q> This interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jerom's words, will make him conſiſtent; whereas that of our author, makes him flatly contradict himſelf; and ſo cannot be admitted.</p>
            <p>THUS have I particularly examined all M. L's teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from the fathers, and, as I truſt, ſufficiently ſhewn, that
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:010800_0065_0F81D157D08BA050"/>they make nothing in ſupport of the cauſe he has underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to defend: On the contrary, that all he has mentioned, even Ignatius not excepted, are plainly on our ſide. More eſpecially is this the caſe as to Clemens Romanus, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all the fathers, as appears from the above quotations. That Jerom alſo was full in the preſbyterian ſcheme of church order and government, the impartial reader, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, is by this time fully convinced.—I ſhall add a few more teſtimonies from ſome of the reſt, and ſo conclude the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> to the fathers.</p>

IT would be eaſy to fill many pages, with extracts to the ſame purpoſe, from theſe and other ancient fathers, as Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Clemens Alexandrinus, Cyprian, the apoſtolic conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and canons, &amp;c. But theſe, I truſt, are abundantly ſufficient to ſhew, that dioceſan epiſcopacy, was a thing unknown in theſe ages: That the more early writers, make no diſtinction at all between biſhop and preſbyter, but uſe the names promiſcuouſly, to ſignify the ſame office, juſt as the ſcriptures do. And even in the later ones, where ſome diſtinction appears, it was no greater than that between the rector of a pariſh, and his aſſiſtant curates, who are yet of the ſame order; conſequently, that there is no foundation for dioceſan epiſcopacy, ſuch as our author pleads for, to be found in any of theſe writers: Modern epiſcopacy was an utter ſtranger to theſe times.</p>
            <p>MR. L. utterly denies <q>that there are any hiſtories, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of any one ſingle church in the univerſe, that has been <hi>preſbyterian</hi> from the firſt planting of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 71.</note> I believe the reader is convinced by this time, that the churches mentioned in the foregoing quotations, were really upon the preſbyterian plan. I ſhall adduce a few more inſtances of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p>IN the church of Alexandria, it appears from Jerom, that preſbyters actually <hi>ordained,</hi> for two hundred years, from the firſt planting of it. His words are,— <q>At Alexandria, from Mark the evangeliſt, to Heraclas and Dionyſius, the biſhop thereof, the <hi>preſbyters</hi> always named one, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of them, and <hi>placed</hi> in an higher degree, their biſhop: As if an army ſhould <hi>make</hi> an emperor, or the deacons ſhould chooſe one of themſelves, whom they knew to be moſt diligent, and call him <hi>arch-deacon.</hi>
               </q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Hieron. epiſt. ad Evagr. tom. ii. p. 109.</note> Hence it appears, that the biſhop of Alexandria, was no more than a <hi>prime-preſbyter,</hi> of the ſame office with the reſt: No more than an <hi>arch-deacon,</hi> of the ſame office with his brother-deacons; and that even this was confered, not by conſecration, from the hands of a ſuperior order, but by the preſbyters themſelves, who choſe and appointed him thereto. If preſbyters therefore could appoint and conſecrate their
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:010800_0066_0F81D158B308B280"/>biſhop, I hope it will be allowed that they had power to ordain a brother-preſbyter; conſequently that <hi>preſbyterian</hi> ordination was the original eſtabliſhment there.</p>
            <p>THAT the ancient Gallic or French church was preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, appears from what I have already quoted from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, paſtor of the church of Lyons in France. With him, preſbyter and biſhop are the ſame office, as they are alſo in ſcripture. And, (as Dr. Stillingfleet juſtly obſerves,) <q>he attributes, both the <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> he pleads for, and the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> thro' which it deſcended from the apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the order of <hi>preſbyters,</hi> and none other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Iriſh church alſo, in the early times of it, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently <hi>preſbyterian.</hi> Certainly it was not epiſcopalian, of the <hi>dicceſan</hi> kind. Nennius mentions St. Patrick's ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 365 biſhops in that church, in the early times of it. And Mr. Clarkſon ſhews out of Bernard, and Baronius, that there were, in that kingdom, well nigh as many bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops as churches.<note n="*" place="bottom">prim. epiſco. p. 40.</note> Theſe certainly could not be biſhops of the dioceſan kind, who have many ſcores or hundreds of churches in their cure; but were evidently congregational paſtors of particular churches, like ours at this day.</p>
            <p>MR. L. is at a difficulty to know what I meant, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <q>that the church of Scotland had been preſbyterian from the beginning.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">def. p. 58.</note> I will now tell him.—It was not that it was ſo, barely from the time of the reformation, as he pretends; but that this was its original conſtitution, and continued ſo to be, till popery had over-run that and all other churches; from the errors of which, when a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of chriſtendom was delivered, by the glorious light of the reformation; that church immediately reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her original conſtitution of preſbyterian government, and has retained it ever ſince.</p>
            <p>THAT the church of Scotland, was originally preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, is proved by a cloud of witneſſes. Proſper Aquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, in his chronicle, annexed to that of Euſebius, tells us, <q>that Palladius was ordained, by pope Caeleſtine, for the Scots, <hi>that had already believed in Chriſt,</hi> and is ſent to them to be their <hi>firſt</hi> biſhop.</q>

            <p>MR. L. ſeems to be ſure that epiſcopacy was the original conſtitution in England. If it was, I am ſure nothing he has ſaid proves it to be ſo. The authorities he has brought are by no means ſufficient for the purpoſe. In the firſt place, they aſſert no ſuch thing in the quotations he has made from them. They only mention that this church had biſhops; but whether dioceſan ones, or only ſcriptural
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:010800_0068_0F81D15AC0EEBD30"/>biſhops, congregational paſtors, they are wholly ſilent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they are teſtimonies ſome ten or twelve hundred years to late, to be depended upon, as authentic vouchers in this caſe. If St. Paul planted chriſtianity in England, as many ſuppoſe, 'tis natural to ſuppoſe that he would ſettle the ſame form of ordination, he himſelf had received, and this has been proved to be <hi>preſbyterian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING thus attended our author, in his ſearch after epiſcopacy among the writings of the fathers,—having par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly examined all his <hi>extracts,</hi> from them, and exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a number more from the ſame writings, in ſupport of the contrary opinion; I now freely ſubmit the whole <q>to the cool and candid</q> to determine whether they are of ſo much "weight in his favour" as he ſeems to "perſuade" himſelf they are. The impartial reader will now judge, whether Mr. L. has been able to find any more ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, on which to erect his grand fabric of dioceſan epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, among the writings of the fathers, than what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the new-teſtament; conſequently what little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he had, to be ſo very confident of having fully ſettled the diſpute in his favour, by an appeal to theſe writers, and that even before he had finiſhed his extracts from them.</p>
            <p>UPON quiting his favourite Ignatius, he has theſe words. <q>But is not this fact evident and undeniable, from the forecited paſſages, that in the next age after the apoſtles, epiſcopacy was univerſally received, in all the churches of Chriſt?</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 53, 54.</note> What now, I aſk, are theſe paſſages from whence <hi>this fact</hi> is ſo undeniably evident? Why barely one or two quotations, from the pretended epiſtles of Ignatius, without having, as yet, given the leaſt intimation, that theſe epiſtles lay under any ſuſpicion of interpolation, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or forgery, and without afterwards examining, or attempting to invalidate, any of the arguments brought by Dr. Chauncy, to prove their inſufficiency, in point of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, on that account. Beſides theſe, Mr. L. had, as yet, brought no teſtimonies from any writer, within two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, except from Irenaeus only; and theſe barely ſome ſcraps, detached from their connection,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:010800_0068_0F81D15AC0EEBD30"/>and which even then, favour his cauſe in ſound only, not in ſenſe; as has, I truſt, ſufficiently appeared, from the foregoing remarks. And yet this is the whole evidence, on which he affirms it <q>to be <hi>undeniable fact,</hi> that epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, in his ſenſe of the word, was <hi>univerſally</hi> received, in all the churches of Chriſt.</q> What may not one make to be <hi>fact,</hi> and <hi>undeniably</hi> ſo, upon ſuch evidence as this? Much to be pitied is the man, who is ſo far under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of prejudice, as to imagine ſuch evidence as this undeniable! Much more, if his prejudice puts him upon repreſenting that as <hi>undeniable evidence</hi> to others, which is truly no evidence at all!</p>
            <p>HE goes on — <q>Tho' this ſtrangely ſlipt Dr. Chauncy's obſervation, when he read the fathers, yet I ſuppoſe their teſtimony may be of ſome weight, with thoſe whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation this point has not ſlipt.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 54.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ANSWER. Dr. Chauncy never ſo much as hinted that this <hi>fact</hi> had ſlipt his obſervation. He well knew that no ſuch <hi>fact</hi> ever took place within that term of time, and ſo muſt every one elſe, who impartially reads the fathers. What the Dr. refered to, when he ſaid, <q>unleſs it had ſlipt his obſervation," was this, "that the mode of diction," biſhops, preſbyters, and deacons,</q> was not to be met with, till we come to Clement of Alexandria, who flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the cloſe of the ſecond century. If Mr. L. will be pleaſed to point out an inſtance, the Dr. no doubt, will readily own "it ſlipt his obſervation." 'Till then, he will have juſt occaſion for bluſhing, whenever he reflects, how groſsly he has perverted the Dr's words.</p>
            <p>MR. L. ſays, <q>he is ſurprized that the Dr. ſhould deny, that the ancients conſtantly aſſert the government of the church, to have been epiſcopal all along from the times of the apoſtles, without producing a ſentence from one of the fathers, to ſupport his denial.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 60.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ONE would thought, a man who engages in a public controverſy, ought to be ſo well acquainted with the rules of diſputation, as to know, that it belongs to thoſe who <hi>affirm</hi> a fact, to bring evidence in proof of it; not to thoſe
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:010800_0069_0F81D15B35B88870"/>who <hi>deny</hi> it. This was the caſe here. Dr. Hoadly <hi>affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> a certain fact to be declared in the fathers. Dr. Chauncy <hi>denies</hi> they mention any ſuch fact. This he has a right to do, without <hi>proving ſuch denial.</hi> The proof lay upon the affirmer. It lies upon all the advocates of epiſcopacy in this inſtance. It has often been called for: But the call has never yet been anſwered, by producing ſo much as a ſingle paſſage, within two hundred years after Chriſt, except from the juſtly diſputed epiſtles of Ignatius, wherein this fact is affirmed, either in direct terms, or in words from whence it can be fairly deduced. 'Till this is done, Dr. Chauncy, and all mankind have a right to deny the fact. Had Mr. L. thought of this, it might have ſaved him his great "ſurprize."</p>
            <p>HE adds.—<q>Inſtead of ſupporting this denial from the fathers, the Dr. has quoted the opinion of the moderns.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p 60</note> Mr. L. is quite miſtaken in the deſign of theſe quotations. They were bro't only to ſhew, that in the ages poſterior to the ſecond century, and even after the eſtabliſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, it was far from being indubitably clear, that this eſtabliſhment, and the practice upon it, had taken place upon the foot of a <hi>divine right.</hi> And in this view there are none, I imagine, ſave Mr. L. and his party, but what will think them pertinent and concluſive.</p>
            <p>IN anſwer to the Dr's demand <q>of an example of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ordination within the two firſt centuries,</q> Mr. L. inſtances in the "ordination of Titus by St. Paul."<note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 61.</note> But pray how came he by the knowledge that Paul ordained Titus? He affirms it, and that is all. If he had any proof, why did he not produce it? Sure I am, the ſcripture affords him none. But if it did, how will this prove he did it in the <hi>capacity</hi> of a biſhop? Paul himſelf was ordained by preſbyters: No doubt then he acted as a preſbyter in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Titus, if he acted at all. <q>But, ſays he, that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus had epiſcopal ordination, appears from his being left in Crete to ſet in order the things that were wanting,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>ANSWER. Theſe directions given to Titus, no more prove him to be biſhop of Crete, i. e. of a ſuperior order
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:010800_0069_0F81D15B35B88870"/>to the elders he was to ordain; than like directions given to Peter, prove him to be ſuperior to the other apoſtles. Beſides, thoſe whom he was to ordain, are expreſsly called biſhops.<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. i. 7. <q>

But if he was, how does this prove that he himſelf received epiſcopal ordination? This, if I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, is Mr. L's argument: Titus himſelf was a biſhop; therefore he was ordained by one, or had epiſcopal ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how does this follow? Paul and Timothy, he allows, were biſhops: And yet, it has been proved, and that from ſcripture, that they were both ordained by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. And from Jerom it appears, that he whom they called biſhop, in the church of Alexandria, was choſen from among, and ſet apart to his epiſcopal office by the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that church, for two hundred years, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it.</p>
            <p>AN example of epiſcopal ordination, not from ſcripture, but from the fathers of the two firſt centuries, was what was demanded. Mr. L. ſays he could produce many. Why has he not then done it? Was it for want of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or ability? Doubtleſs the latter. Thus after all his boaſted appeal to the fathers, they afford him as little relief, as the ſcriptures do.</p>

               <hi>SECT. IX.</hi> Examination of Mr. L's appeal to the firſt reformers for his divine right of epiſcopacy, <hi>from p. 61, to 65.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN both the pieces Mr. L. undertook to anſwer, it was obſerved, that this doctrine <q>of the unalterable divine right of epiſcopacy,</q> was a ſtranger to the firſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:010800_0070_0F81D15BED43C4C0"/>even in the church of England. This was done with a view to expoſe the bigotry of thoſe anathematizing zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, the modern ſons of that church, who, like Mr. L. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church and unchriſtianize all the proteſtant world but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Sundry teſtimonies were adduced, from the firſt reformers and later writers of the church of England, both biſhops and others, to prove that this was not the doctrine of that church, at the time of the reformation, and many years after.—That tho' for <hi>reaſons of ſtate,</hi> they concurred with the epiſcopal ſettlement in England; yet they did not look upon it to be of divine right, or ſo eſſential as to nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify all ordinations, unleſs thoſe performed by biſhops, in their ſenſe of the word. And it was particularly ſhewed, that the firſt who publicly maintained that uncharitable antichriſtian doctrine was the famous arch-biſhop Laud, of papiſtical and perſecuting memory; and that he was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly rebuked by his ſuperior for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>MR. L. declares himſelf of the ſame principles, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to defend them, by an appeal to the firſt refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. Let us examine his proofs.</p>
            <p>HIS firſt is from arch-biſhop Cranmer, in theſe words, <q>We read not that any, not being a biſhop, hath, ſince the beginning of Chriſt's church, ordained a prieſt.</q> If by biſhop, is here meant, a congregational biſhop, all preſbyterians will agree, that none but ſuch have power to ordain: But then it will be nothing to Mr. L's purpoſe.—But if a dioceſan biſhop is intended, then all that Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can be ſuppoſed to mean is, that the buſineſs of ordaining has been confined to ſuch biſhops, not as ſolely veſted with that power by the law of Chriſt; but only by human ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and the cuſtom of the church. For biſhop Burnet aſſures us, that Cranmer's opinion was, <q>That bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and prieſts, were at one time, and were not two things, but one office, in the beginning of Chriſt's religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Refor. Vol. i. collec. p. 223.</note> If they had one office, they had one and the ſame power: All therefore that Cranmer intends is, that this work of ordination, which was originally common, had been, by the cuſtom of the church, appropriated to biſhops.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:010800_0070_0F81D15BED43C4C0"/>This interpretation makes Cranmer conſiſtent, whereas Mr. L's involves him in a plain contradiction.</p>
            <p>HIS next <hi>extract</hi> is from biſhop Jewel, in theſe words, <q>We believe that there be divers degrees of miniſters in the church, whereof ſome be deacons, ſome prieſts, ſome biſhops.</q> That Jewel here only aſſerts a matter of fact, or what were the officers then in the church, not a matter of right, or what ought to be by divine inſtitution, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from what he ſays in his apology. Speaking of the various degrees of clergy in Jerom's time, he ſays; <q>Chriſt appointed not theſe diſtinctions of orders from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.—This is the thing <hi>we defend,</hi> St. Jerom ſaith, let biſhops underſtand, they are in authority over prieſts, more by cuſtom, than by order of God's truth. a prieſt is the ſame with a biſhop; they are both one thing, and the churches were at firſt, governed by the common advice of the prieſts.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Apol. part. 2 c. 3.</note> This plainly ſhews, that in the paſſage quoted by Mr. L. he does not mean to declare his <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>divine right</hi> of three orders; but only to aſſert a matter of fact; and ſo is no proof that Jewel owned the divine right of epiſcopacy.</p>
            <p>BUT Mr. L. ſuppoſes, this is proved to be the doctrine of the reformers, from the preface to the book of ordination. <q>It is evident to all men diligently reading the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, &amp;c.—that there have been theſe <hi>three</hi> orders of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp;c."<note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 63.</note> Upon which he obſerves. "It muſt be evident to any man of common ſenſe, that the reformers, who compoſed this preface, believed the three offices of biſhops, prieſts and deacons, to be of divine right, or none of them to be ſo; for they as poſitively aſſert that all are, as that one is.</q>—Anſwer. They do not aſſert that one is. This preface only aſſerts a matter of fact; that there had been ſuch orders from the apoſtles times. It does not declare that theſe three orders are of divine unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable right: Nor does it determine what kind of biſhops were from the apoſtles times, whether dioceſan, or only parochial. And if Meſſrs. Hoadly and Ollyffe, two epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal divines, may be allowed to underſtand the ſenſe of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:010800_0071_0F81D15C6C7B63E0"/>this aſſertion, as well as Mr. L. it will be nothing to his purpoſe. Mr. Ollyffe in his anſwer to Mr. Calamy, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this very preface, ſays, <q>The propoſition of this rubrick is formed or expreſſed, with as great a degree of latitude or moderation, as ever could be expected, from an epiſcopal church. <hi>It ſaith nothing of divine right or appointment.</hi> That is Mr. Calamy's addition, as Mr. Hoadly well obſerves. It ſaith nothing of the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their powers and officers; or whether they have been every where in every church or no: But only, that from the apoſtles times, there have been theſe orders, &amp;c. From which, the moſt that can be inferred is, that in ſuch churches where there has been need of them, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for them all, there have been three ſuch ranks of miniſters, for the government and inſtruction of Chriſt's church, from the times of the apoſtles; which yet by Mr. Calamy's leave, <hi>does not prove a divine appointment</hi> of all, (however otherwiſe it may appear to him,) there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been other things, in the apoſtles days, which yet, for all that, are not allowed to be of divine appointment</q> Here we ſee Mr. L's uncharitable interpretation of this preface, as tho' it meant to nullify all ordinations, ſave thoſe of the epiſcopal kind, ſtands expreſsly condemned, by two celebrated divines of his own church. As their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is more charitable and chriſtian-like, than Mr. L's; I preſume every perſon of candor will judge it the true one; and conſequently, that his argument, founded on ſuch a ſtingy interpretation, can't be admitted as proof, that the venerable compilers of this preface, were of his contracted and ſchiſmatical principles.</p>
            <p>THO' they here ſpeak of three orders in the church, yet they no where ſay, that biſhops are by divine right, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to preſbyters: Nor is there the leaſt intimation, that they looked upon all ordinations to be null and void, unleſs performed by a biſhop. For tho' they ſay <q>no man ſhall be accounted a lawful biſhop, unleſs admitted according to the form there preſcribed;</q> yet this is expreſsly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>"to that church of England."</hi> All therefore that can
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:010800_0071_0F81D15C6C7B63E0"/>be meant by this, is no more than a declaration, who they will allow to be accounted <hi>lawful biſhops of the national church of England:</hi> But this is no proof that they believed the divine right and abſolute neceſſity of dioceſan epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, or accounted thoſe churches to have no valid mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and ordinances, that are without it, as Mr. L. does. The contrary of this, is undeniably evident from their practice, as I ſhall ſhew.</p>
            <p>OUR author's laſt argument, to prove that the <hi>reformers</hi> were of his uncharitable ſentiments, in this point, is taken from the 3d, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th, canons of their church, which he has quoted at large.<note n="*" place="bottom">p. 63, 64, 65.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AS the canons of the church of England, as they now ſtand, were compoſed at ſundry times; at periods far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant one from another; ſome in the reign of Q Eliſabeth, ſome in that of K. James,  Mr. L. ſhould have told us which claſs, thoſe he has quoted belonged to: For if they were among the number of thoſe paſſed in K. James's reign; they can't be ſaid to exhibit the ſentiments of the <hi>firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> who had no hand in making them, being dead many years before. As he has not ſeen fit to do this, I might juſtly forbear any further notice of them, as being nothing to the purpoſe of his argument.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, allowing they were of the firſt claſs, they will by no means prove, that the compilers of them believed the unalterable divine right of epiſcopacy, and denied the validity of preſbyterian ordination. The ſubſtance of them is, (for they are too long to tranſcribe) <q>that if any perſon ſhould deny the church of England to be a true church, or declare her government by biſhops, &amp;c. to be anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, or repugnant to the word of God, or upon that account, or any other, ſeperate himſelf from her commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he ſhall be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicated.</q> But now there is nothing in theſe canons, that will prove the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of them believed dioceſan epiſcopacy, to be of unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable divine right. They might think it to be <hi>lawful,</hi> tho' not expreſsly of <hi>divine inſtitution;</hi> much leſs that it was <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to the being of the church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:010800_0072_0F81D15F6DA155E0"/>
AS to the <hi>charity</hi> of ſuch excommunicating, anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing canons, I muſt leave it to the vindication of Mr. L. and thoſe of his ſtamp: For as to myſelf, I utterly deſpair of ſucceeding in any attempt of that kind. Americans, bleſſed be God, have hitherto been unacquainted with ſuch <hi>damnatory</hi> canons. Their fulminations in this land, are heard, only like the diſtant thunders of the <hi>vatican.</hi> Had not Mr. L's zeal for epiſcopacy, got the better of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I ſhould have judged he would have been more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the reputation of his <hi>beſt conſtituted</hi> church, than thus to expoſe her nakedneſs, by bringing to view theſe <hi>notable</hi> canons, in a country where they are ſo little known. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his deſign was to let us know what we are to expect, if the ſcheme for ſending biſhops to America, erecting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual courts, &amp;c. in the colonies, ſhould take place.—</p>
            <p>But to return.</p>
            <p>THE above remarks, I truſt, make it ſufficiently clear, that it cannot be proved, either from the preface to the book of ordination, or from the canons, or indeed from any thing elſe Mr. L. has quoted, that the reformers were of his ſentiments, as to the divine right of epiſcopacy.

            <p n="1">1. FROM their <hi>expreſs declarations,</hi> both ſingly, and in a collective capacity. I have had occaſion already to cite ſome paſſages from biſhops Cranmer and Jewel, in which they expreſsly aſſert it, as their judgment, <q>that biſhop and preſbyter, in ſcripture, is one and the ſame.</q> The biſhop of St. Aſaph, Therlby, Redman and Cox, declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the ſame opinion. Biſhop Morton, in his catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic apology, declares, <q>that the power of order and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which the papiſts aſcribe to biſhops, doth, <hi>by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, belong to all other preſbyters.</hi> And particularly, that, <hi>to ordain,</hi> is their <hi>ancient right.</hi>

            <p>THESE things, I mentioned in my ſermon, to which Mr. L. has made no reply. I now ſubmit it to the candid read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether it is poſſible to ſuppoſe, that men who could expreſs themſelves in this manner, were of Mr. L's princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <q>that dioceſan epiſcopacy is of divine right," "and that all ordinations by preſbyters, are a mere nullity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MR. L's letter-writer, S. J. tells us, <q>the ſentiments of the firſt reformers, are not to be learnt from ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient expreſſions of individuals, but from their public
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:010800_0073_0F81D160251973A8"/>acts.</q> I have here produced inſtancies of both, in which, as individuals, and as public bodies, they give their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for the ſcriptural divine rights of preſbyterian ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and government, in terms, as expreſs and poſitive, as can well be conceived. From theſe teſtimonies it evidently follows, that epiſcopacy was not eſtabliſhed in England, at the time of the reformation, upon the foot of <hi>divine right;</hi> but only as a form of government, ſuited to the civil inſtitution of the ſtate, by which it was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS fact further appears from the <hi>practice</hi> of the church of England, conſequent upon ſaid eſtabliſhment. It is not denied that there have been ſome particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that church, all along, from the <hi>pontificate</hi> of arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Laud, to the preſent day, who, like Mr. L. have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed this uncharitable doctrine <hi>of the divine right</hi> of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and the invalidity of all miniſterial authority and goſpel adminiſtrations, where this is wanting. But that this is not the <hi>doctrine of the church of England,</hi> appears from her repeated practice to the contrary, in admitting mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to officiate in that church, who never had epiſcopal ordination. In the reign of K. Edward the ſixth Mr. Knox was improved by him, as his chaplain, and had the offer of a biſhoprick, tho' he had nothing but preſbyterian ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not even that, if Mr. L. ſays true. In the ſame reign, Peter Martyr, Martin Bucer, and P. Fagius, all fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, and who had been ordained only by preſbyters, had eccleſiaſtical preferments in the church of England confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them, without re-ordination.<note n="*" place="bottom">Owen's plea for ſcrip ordina. p. 118.</note> Mr. William Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham was made dean of Durham about 1563 tho' or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by preſbyters only.<note n="‖" place="bottom">ibid. p, 121.</note> In like manner, Mr. Travers, ordained by a preſbyter beyond ſea, was ſeven years lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer at the temple, and had the biſhop of London's letter for it.<note n="†" place="bottom">ibid. p. 122.</note> And even ſo late as the time of K. James I. bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Bancroft, tho' a rigid epiſcopalian, conſecrated Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and two others, biſhops for Scotland, without firſt ordaining them preſbyters, tho' they had received only preſbyterian ordination; and he alledged this as his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, "that preſbyterian ordination was valid."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="unknown:010800_0073_0F81D160251973A8"/>
NOW is it not abundantly evident from theſe <hi>facts,</hi> that the church of England, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> is not of Mr. L's principles, as to the point in debate? He aſſerts the <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy, and utterly denies the <hi>validity</hi> of preſbyterian ordination: But here we ſee, the church of England, and her greateſt dignitaries and biſhops, not only aſſerting in words, the <hi>validity</hi> of preſbyterian ordination; but repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly declaring this, to be the <hi>ſenſe and doctrine</hi> of that church, by admitting, from time to time, thoſe who had no other ordination, to the free exerciſe of the miniſtry, and placing them in the higheſt offices in the church. Whom now ſhall we believe? Mr. L. who pretends, from the rubrick and canons of this church, to prove that ſhe holds the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, ſchiſmatical doctrine aforeſaid? Or ſhe herſelf, who by her practice, denies it? Muſt we not ſuppoſe, that the firſt reformers, the biſhops and dignitaries of the church of England, underſtand her conſtitution and principles, as well as the <hi>miſſionary</hi> of Norwalk?—But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT preſbyterian ordination is valid, even in the ſenſe of the church of England, is evident, <hi>from the moſt public and expreſs acts of the king and parliament.</hi> The church of England is properly a parliamentary church. She expreſsly acknowledges the king <hi>as her head, inveſted with ſupreme power in all affairs, eccleſiaſtical.</hi> Her articles and canons are all enjoined, by authority of parliament. 'Till this is done, they are of no force. The parliament, therefore, eſpecially if conſidered as compoſed, partly of the <hi>biſhops,</hi> who all have a ſeat there, muſt be ſuppoſed to underſtand her conſtitution, and what doctrines ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. But now the validity of preſbyterian ordination has, in fact, been owned and eſtabliſhed, by the king and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at two ſeveral times. Soon after the <hi>reſtoration,</hi> A. D. 1661, there was an act of parliament paſſed, <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring and confirming thoſe to be miniſters, to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes,</q> who were then <hi>incumbents</hi> in the ſeveral pariſhes; tho' many of them had been ordained, after the biſhops were put down in the preceeding admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and ſo had only preſbyterian ordination.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cal. def.

AGAIN, the ſame was done, A. D. 1707, by the act of <hi>union,</hi> whereby England and Scotland were united into one kingdom. Previous to this, the parliament of Scotland paſſed <q>an act, for ſecuring the proteſtant religion and preſbyterian church-government in Scotland, to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q> Now this act was made an eſſential and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of the act of union, and ſo is confirmed by the king and parliament of Great-Britain, and thereby, the preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian order and government of the church of Scotland is as fully, to all intents and purpoſes, eſtabliſhed there, and by the ſame authority, as epiſcopacy is in England. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, ever ſince that time, every king of Great-Britain, upon his acceſſion to the throne, is obliged to take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing oath;— <q>I G.—king of Great-Britain, France &amp; Ireland, defender of the faith, &amp;c. do faithfully promiſe and ſwear, that I ſhall inviolably maintain and preſerve, the ſettlement of the <hi>true proteſtant religion,</hi> with the government, worſhip, diſcipline, rights and privileges of the church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as eſtabliſhed by laws made there, in proſecution of the claim of rights; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by an act intitled, an act for ſecuring the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant religion, and <hi>preſbyterian church government,</hi> and by the acts paſſed, in the parliaments of both kingdoms, for the union of the two kingdoms.</q>—</p>

            </p>
            <p>HERE again we ſee, the ſupreme authority of the nation, king, lords and commons, <hi>expreſsly</hi> allowing the religion of the church of Scotland, and her <hi>preſbyterian</hi> form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>to be the true proteſtant religion.</hi> As ſuch, they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it to perpetuity; and the king, by his <hi>coronation</hi> oath, moſt ſolemnly promiſes and ſwears, to protect and defend it. But how could all this be, if the church of England, and the king as the head of it, really <hi>believed,</hi> as Mr. L. ſays they do the divine right of epiſcopacy, and the <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and nullity</hi> of preſbyterian ordination and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Muſt not the king and parliament, who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the church of England, be ſuppoſed to underſtand her conſtitution on which ſhe was ſettled at the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:010800_0074_0F81D160314C0E60"/>and the doctrines ſhe maintains, as well as Mr. L.? Moſt certainly they muſt. Conſequently ſince they have ſo expreſsly declared, by their moſt ſolemn and public acts, "that a church, founded upon <hi>preſbyterian</hi> principles, is a <hi>true proteſtant church;</hi> and as ſuch, have eſtabliſhed it, and engaged to preſerve and defend it in perpetuity; it undeniably follows, that the divine right of epiſcopacy, was no part of the original conſtitution of the church of England at the time of the reformation, or a doctrine ſince owned by her, as ſuch. What raſhneſs, what effrontery then, is Mr. L. chargeable with, in ſo confidently aſſerting, as he does, <q>that the body of the church of England di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, at the time of the reformation, and I may ſay, ever ſince, have conſtantly believed and maintained, the divine right of epiſcopacy?</q> 'Tis pity gentlemen of ſuch uncharitable and ſchiſmatical principles, can't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, ſince it muſt be ſo, to enjoy their unſcriptural noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, without vainly attempting to fix the odious imputation upon others, and thus blackening the memory of the good old reformers, who deteſted theſe doctrines equally with us.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole then, if any weight is to be laid, upon the moſt expreſs declarations of many great &amp; learned men of the church of England, biſhops as well as others, at the time of the reformation, and ſince, <hi>in their individual capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> in favour of <hi>the validity of preſbyterian ordination and government;</hi>—if any heed is to be given to the repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in which that church has, by her <hi>practice,</hi> owned and approved of that doctrine;—if any regard is to be had to <hi>public acts of parliament,</hi> acknowleging and declaring preſbyterian churches and miniſters, to be <hi>true lawful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant miniſters and churches;</hi> it muſt be a moſt clear and indubitable fact, that the church of England, neither at the time of the reformation, nor ſince, hath eſpouſed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the doctrine of the <hi>divine right of epiſcopacy;</hi> but on the contrary does <hi>expreſsly</hi> own the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> and <hi>validity</hi> of preſbyterian ordination and government.

               <hi>SECT. X.</hi> Animadverſions on Mr. L's appeal to the foreign proteſtants, concerning the validity of preſbyterian ordination, <hi>p. 63, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN this part of his work, our author pretends to give us ſundry <hi>extracts</hi> from the foreign proteſtants: Not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to prove, that theſe foreign churches are of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal kind. This he knew was impoſſible: But tho' they are preſbyterians themſelves, yet that they do not allow our ordinations to be valid. Now, granting his quotations from Calvin, Beza, Le Mayne, &amp;c. to be genuine; which, conſidering the freedom he uſes with other authors, is at leaſt very doubtful; they will by no means prove that theſe men denied the validity of ordination, even among the diſſenters in England. What they ſeem to blame the old puritans for, is their ſeparating from the eſtabliſhed church of England, not for maintaining preſbyterian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Beſides, it is well known what arts were uſed in them times, by the ſticklers for uniformity, to ſollicit the opinion of foreign proteſtants in their favour, and get them to diſcountenance the ſeperation. <q>About this time, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral letters paſſed, between the engliſh divines, on both ſides, and ſeveral learned foreigners. Matters were falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented to them, and great arts were uſed, on the <hi>biſhop's</hi> ſide, to prevent ſuch perſons writing, who they found would not write in their behalf; and what they thought made for them, they publiſhed to the world in way of triumph. The foreigners were told, that unleſs they complied with the things enjoined, they muſt let in the papiſts to ſupply the cures. Several foreigners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dreading that, and hoping theſe things would ſoon be altered, ſpake more favourable of them than they deſerved.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pierce vind. p. 68.</note> Moreover theſe foreign divines knew, that epiſcopacy was ſettled in England, not as of <hi>divine right,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="unknown:010800_0075_0F81D161147BB6A0"/>but only by <hi>civil authority.</hi> Having this view of the engliſh hierarchy, they might think it more adviſable for their brethren in England, to ſubmit to it, than to go into a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>barely upon this account.</hi> For it is only on account of <hi>this,</hi> that they are, in Mr. L's quotations, ſuppoſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and for which they are blamed. Whereas this was but one thing, among many, that cauſed the ſeparation. But what buſineſs had Mr. L. with the diſſenters in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? The pieces he attacks, undertook the defence of the New-England miniſtry, not that of the diſſenters in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. There was no need of it. This has been repeatedly and ſucceſsfully done by many able writers of their own. Particularly by Meſſrs. Baxter, Calamy, Pierce, and more lately the diſſenting gentleman in anſwer to Mr. White. Beſides, who does he mean by <q>the diſſenters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</q> If he intends New-England; bating a few ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts and quakers, I know of no diſſenters, ſave thoſe of his communion. Epiſcopacy never was eſtabliſhed here, tho' its oppoſite is, to the no ſmall mortification of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and company. If therefore the foreign divines had ſuch a regard to peace, as to adviſe their preſbyterian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in England not to ſeparate, even from an epiſcopal church, by law eſtabliſhed; Who can ſuppoſe they would not condemn Mr. L. and party, in ſeparating from the <hi>eſtabliſhed preſbyterian churches</hi> here, and becoming <hi>epiſcopal diſſenters?</hi> Wherefore to come to the queſtion, as he has ſtated it; that is <q>whether our ordinations in this country are allowed to be valid by the foreign proteſtants?</q> In anſwering of it I will purſue his method, and <q>examine their public conſtitutions, their general practice, and their private ſentiments.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. FROM the <hi>public conſtitutions</hi> of the foreign proteſtants, it is evident, even to demonſtration, that they do and muſt approve of our ordinations as <hi>valid.</hi> If they allow their own to be valid, they muſt for this plain reaſon allow ours to be ſo; becauſe their conſtitutions, at leaſt ſo far as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is concerned, are preciſely the ſame with ours. Mr. L. I truſt, need not be told that our ordinations are ſtrictly
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:010800_0076_0F81D161C78C6F20"/>preſbyterian, agreeable to our conſtitution: But the ſame is the conſtitution of the foreign churches. <q>The proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant churches abroad, ſays Mr. Boyſe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ancient Epiſ. p. 281.</note> are divided into <hi>lutheran</hi> and <hi>reformed.</hi> For the <hi>lutheran</hi> churches we have the <hi>concord of lutherans</hi> printed at Leipſick, containing the confeſſion of Augſburgh, and the apology for the ſame—the Smalcaldic articles, Luther's greater and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer catechiſm.</q> From theſe authentic writings, we learn what the opinion of the Lutherans in this point is.—The words are,— <q>The goſpel gives to thoſe that are placed over the churches, a command to teach the goſpel, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſins, to adminiſter the ſacraments, and <hi>juriſdiction</hi> alſo. And by the confeſſion of all, even our adverſaries, 'tis manifeſt that <hi>this power,</hi> is by divine right, <hi>common to all</hi> that are ſet over the churches, whether they be called paſtors, or preſbyters, or biſhops.—Since biſhop and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor are not different degrees by divine right, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that <hi>ordination</hi> performed by a paſtor in his own church is valid.</q>

THE French proteſtant churches, in their confeſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Charles IX. ſay, <q>We believe all true paſtors, wherever they are placed, to be endued with <hi>equal power.</hi> under that only head, the chief and univerſal biſhop.</q>

               <note n="‖" place="bottom">art. 31.</note> Mr. L. need not be told that the article of the church of Scotland is the ſame upon this head.</p>
            <p>NOW can there be a more full and convincing evidence, of theſe foreign churches allowing of the validity of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, than this univerſal agreement and teſtimony of their public conſtitutions in this point? Mr. L. and thoſe of his ſtamp, tho' they renounce our ordinations, yet allow of thoſe performed in the <hi>romiſh</hi> church. The reaſon is, becauſe the principles of the papiſts, in this reſpect, are the ſame with theirs. Epiſcopacy is the doctrine of the church of Rome; the church of England therefore allow their ordinations to be valid, as being the ſame with her own. But now, with an evidence beyond exception it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that all the foreign proteſtants are ſtrictly of our principles, as to the ordaining power; from whence it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably follows, that they muſt allow and approve of our ordinations, as valid, becauſe they are the very ſame as are pointed out, in all their confeſſions of faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS point is alſo evident from the univerſal <hi>practice</hi> of the foreign churches. All the Dutch churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the united provinces, the proteſtant churches in France, thoſe of Geneva and the proteſtant cantons in Switzerland, &amp;c. are utter ſtrangers to biſhops, both name and thing. All their clergy are upon a level; all equally exerciſing the power of ordination, and every other branch of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial authority. And as to thoſe proteſtant churches which have officers they ſtile biſhops, ſuperintendents or ſeniors; they are little more than ſtanding moderators, pretending to no ſuperiority, by divine right, over their
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:010800_0077_0F81D1627038E8E0"/>brethren. <q>All theſe churches, ſays Dr. Stillingfleet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege no ſuch thing as the <hi>divine right</hi> of epiſcopacy, but ſtiffly maintain Jerom's opinion, of the primitive equality of all goſpel-miniſters.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iren, p. 411.</note> Nor can they do otherwiſe; having at bottom no other than preſbyterian ordination among them: For Luther, Calvin, Bucer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon, Bugenhagius, &amp;c. and all the firſt reformers and founders of theſe churches, who ordained miniſters among them, were themſelves preſbyters and nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>THIS again clearly proves, that they do in fact allow our ordinations to be valid; for they are the ſame with theirs. Theirs are performed by preſbyters, paſtors, by divine right, all in a ſtate of equality: The ſame alſo are ours. If therefore they allow their own, they muſt allow ours which are the ſame. And that this is the caſe in fact, is evident from particular inſtances of their practice. In Holland, tho' they allow a liberty of conſcience to thoſe of other denominations, yet no miniſters are ſupported by the public, but thoſe of their own profeſſion: But it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, as I am informed, that they do in fact ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one or more Scotch preſbyterian miniſters, juſt as they do their own. This plainly ſhews, that they look upon the preſbyters in Scotland, as their brethren, of the ſame church with themſelves, and undeniably proves, that they allow of their ordination, and conſequently of ours in this country, which is the ſame. The Dutch churches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Europe, beyond diſpute allow the validity of our ordinations. In America the caſe is the ſame. Here there are ſundry Dutch churches, originating from, and upon the ſame conſtitution with, the reformed proteſtant church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in Holland. Theſe allow the validity of our ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A number of years ago a young gentleman of Dutch extract, came to New-Haven, and was ordained by our miniſters, at the college there, as a miniſter for the Dutch churches in the county of Albany. This, as my author tells me, was done by order of the claſſis in Holland. The Reverend Mr. Wooſly, who was ordained by a number of Connecticut miniſters, over the church and congregation
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:010800_0077_0F81D1627038E8E0"/>of Southold on Long-Iſland; after he left that people, and removed to his plantation in Oyſter-Bay, preached and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered the ſacrament, in a Dutch church in that town, for 20 years together. The ſame did the Reverend Mr. Ketteltas ſince. He was ordained miniſter of Elizabeth-Town, by the preſbytery in New-Jerſey. After he left that people, at the invitation of ſundry Dutch churches in Queen's-County, Long-Iſland, he officiated as their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for ſome time. The ſame gentleman is now improved in the miniſtry, in the French proteſtant church in the city of N. York. Now theſe are ſo many expreſs inſtances, in which our ordinations have been, in fact, acknowledged and allowed to be valid by the foreign proteſtant churches. And yet in direct oppoſition to this inconteſtible evidence, in the very face of theſe ſtubborn and obſtinate facts, Mr. L. has the aſſurance, ſhall I call it? to tell his readers <q>that none of theſe foreign proteſtants, (meaning the Dutch, French, &amp;c.) will admit of a man ordained by <hi>our diſſenters,</hi> (as he calls us by way of contempt) to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſacraments in their churches." "That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and find as much fault with our ordinations, as the epiſcopalians (meaning himſelf and thoſe of his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flying principles) do." "And that our mode of worſhip, &amp;c. is condemned by all the foreign proteſtants.</q>

            <p n="3">3. FROM the <hi>private ſentiments</hi> of foreign proteſtants it appears, that they both approve of our method of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government, and condemn that of the epiſcopal church.

            <p>NOW who can ſuppoſe, that men of theſe ſentiments, could be friends to epiſcopacy? Who can entertain the leaſt doubt of their being, in principle, ſtrictly preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, when they ſo ſtrongly expreſs themſelves in favour of the latter, and in oppoſition, and even deteſtation of the former?<note n="§" place="bottom">Of the ſtrong attachment of the french proteſtants to preſbyterian principles, and their abhorrence of epiſcopacy, Mr. Hickman gives a ſtriking inſtance, from Hiſt-eccleſ. tom. I. p. 767. The caſe was this. One J. Antonius Caracciolus, biſhop of Troyes, turned proteſtant, and appeared before the proteſtant conſiſtory, deſiring to be admitted to the miniſtry. And altho' he had ſolemnly renounced and abjured his romiſh principles, and in the preſence of the conſiſtory, ſigned his abjuration of them, and his conſent to the proteſtant confeſſion of faith; yet they would not receive him as a miniſter, until he expreſsly promiſed <hi>to deſert and forſake his epiſcopal function.</hi> This he accordingly did; whereupon he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the miniſtry. This was done by the advice of that great and good man, Peter Martyr, who happened to be there at that time, in his way to Zurich. This therefore ſhews his opinion of epiſcopacy. Boyſe Ancient epiſcopacy, p. 284.</note> If theſe teſtimonies, from the <hi>public inſtitutions,</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:010800_0078_0F81D163354373C8"/>the <hi>univerſal practice,</hi> and the <hi>private ſentiments</hi> of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign proteſtants, do not amount to a full proof of their being ſtrictly preſbyterian in principle themſelves, and of their approbation, and allowance of our ordinations, as valid and ſcriptural, I muſt forever deſpair of ſeeing any <hi>fact</hi> proved, in any caſe whatſoever.</p>
            <p>BUT Mr. L. tells us, <q>the whole that is aimed at, in theſe confeſſions, is to condemn the uſurpation of the pope, not to condemn epiſcopacy.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">p. 65.</note> Anſwer. 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to demonſtration, from the foregoing teſtimonies, they meant to condemn both; and that for this plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe both are equally <hi>unſcriptural,</hi> both reſt upon the ſame foundation. I defy any man to condemn the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh tyranny, and at the ſame time, defend the engliſh hierarchy, upon any conſiſtent principles. Epiſcopacy is epiſcopacy, whether in England or Rome. Whoever op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it in the latter, muſt, to be conſiſtent with himſelf, condemn it in the former. Beſides, ſome of the above teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies, eſpecially Beza's, as expreſsly condemns epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy in Great-Britain, as at Rome. He calls it the <hi>peſt,</hi> the <hi>plague</hi> of the church, and equally ruinous to to its wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare in the former, as in the latter.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, Mr. L. appeals to the foreign churches, <q>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any preſbyterian miniſters are maintained by them, &amp;c. but only ſuch as have been ordained according to the method of thoſe churches.</q> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">p. 66.</note>—Anſwer: Doubtleſs none but <hi>ſuch,</hi> are received and maintained by them. And this again is a clear evidence that they approve of and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our ordinations to be valid, and that our miniſters and ordinations are the ſame, in their opinion, with theirs, ſince they do, in fact, as has been ſhewn above, receive and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in their churches, juſt as they do their own.
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:010800_0079_0F81D163ECD7E778"/>How injuriouſly then does Mr. L. treat the foreign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants thus to repreſent them as patrons of his unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcheme, and endeavour to faſten upon them, the odious imputation of maintaining his uncharitable and ſchiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principles? What impoſition upon the reader to attempt to beget in him a belief of this groundleſs aſperſion?</p>
            <p>I HAVE now gone thro' with my remarks upon Mr. L's book. Have very particularly examined, and I truſt, fully anſwered every thing in it, worthy of notice. Scripture, reaſon and authentic hiſtory, have been my guides thro' the whole enquiry; and, unleſs I am much miſtaken, his principles and conduct ſtand condemned by all three. The reſult is,—that neither in the ſacred ſcriptures, nor the writings of the ancient fathers,—neither in the opinion of the firſt reformers, the conſtitutions and practice of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign proteſtants, nor even in the principles of the <hi>true</hi> church of England itſelf, is there the leaſt ſhadow of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for dioceſan epiſcopacy, conſidered as of <hi>divine right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN Chriſt aſcended he left the eleven apoſtles, the only miniſters of his church; all veſted with the ſame commiſſion, all equal in power. Authorized by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they went forth,—preached the goſpel, planted churches, and ordained miniſters in them, veſted them with the ſame commiſſion they themſelves bore. No account is to be found of their fixing ſome in a ſuperior, others in a ſubordinate ſtation. The miniſters they ordained, were all of one order, promiſcuouſly called biſhops, paſtors, or el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As the general commiſſion is but one, ſo one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of introduction into office, one ſet of qualifications in order to it, one work or buſineſs for them when introduced, and one only, is to be found in the word of God. This was the order fixed by Chriſt, and followed by his apoſtles. They invariably adhered to that divine maxim of the great head of the church; <q>call no man your maſter upon earth, for one is your maſter in heaven, even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren.</q> This was tranſmitted to the primitive chriſtians, and obſerved in the pureſt and earlieſt ages of the church. A defection from this original <hi>parity,</hi> 'tis
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:010800_0079_0F81D163ECD7E778"/>granted, pretty ſoon aroſe. "The miſtery of iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan "to work," even before the apoſtles were dead. A thirſt of dominion and eccleſiaſtical pre-eminence, early opperated amongſt the miniſters of the meek and lowly JESUS. This increaſed from leſs to more, till <q>
                  <hi>that</hi> man of ſin, the ſon of perdition, who exalteth himſelf above all that is called GOD, or is worſhiped,</q> got himſelf fairly mounted upon the ſeven-headed beaſt, and enſlaved all chriſtendom with his uſurped dominion. From this yoke of anti-chriſtian tyranny, when great part of Europe was happily delivered, by the glorious light of the reformation, the ancient <hi>parity</hi> among miniſters, generally took place. By far the greateſt part of the proteſtant churches, recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the original ſcriptural plan of preſbyterian order and government. And where in any inſtance, as in England, they adopted the epiſcopal mode, it was not under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of divine right, but wholly in conformity to the form of government in the ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE above facts are indubitably clear, from ſcripture, and eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, ancient and modern. On theſe facts the reaſonings and concluſions are founded, contained in the foregoing pages. For the truth of the facts I appeal to the authentic writings aforeſaid. For the juſtneſs of the reaſonings and concluſions deduced from them, the candid reader is now to determine.</p>
            <p>IF dioceſan epiſcopacy be of divine right, it is certainly contained in ſcripture. If it be of ſuch vaſt importance, as is pretended, it muſt be very clearly and expreſsly revealed there. Doctrines of importance, truths eſſential to religion, are not left to be collected barely from dark hints and doubtful expreſſions; but are clearly revealed, and often repeated, in various modes of diction, <q>that he who runs may read them.</q> But is this the caſe with dioceſan epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy? The warmeſt advocate for it, I preſume, will not pretend it is. All that the learned labour of its ableſt cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions has hitherto been able to produce, is barely ſome dark hints and doubtful expreſſions, which a fruitful invention may turn to ſavour it; but theſe capable of a more rational
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:010800_0080_0F81D167AEEAA690"/>interpretation upon the contrary ſcheme. And yet to this point of <hi>doubtful diſputation,</hi> the moſt eſſential doctrines and expreſs precepts of our holy religion, it ſeems, muſt be made a ſacrifice. That men fulfil their promiſes, perform their covenant obligations, and religiouſly regard their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vows, is not only one of the firſt dictates of natural religion; but very expreſsly and repeatedly enjoined in the word of God. But when men, who have ſolemnly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated themſelves to the miniſtry in our churches, renounce their ordination vows, and take epiſcopal orders: When profeſſors among us, who ſolemnly promiſed and covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, angels and men, to walk in communion with us, rend themſelves off, and join the epiſcopal ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, under a pretence of the divine right of epiſcopacy, who does not ſee that <hi>doubtful points</hi> are preferred to <hi>poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precepts;</hi> and that more weight is laid upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, than the latter? If this is not to ſubſtitute <q>mint, aniſe, and cummin, inſtead of the weightier matters of the law.</q> 'tis indeed hard to ſay what is. And after all; what is gained, in point of <hi>valid miniſtry and ordinances?</hi> Why truly, upon their own principles, juſt nothing at all. If our miniſters have no power, then our adminiſtrations are invalid, our baptiſms a mere nullity. Thoſe therefore who have been baptized in our churbhes, are in a ſtate of mere heatheniſm, let them conform to what church they will. As this is the caſe with moſt of their miniſters in this country, they muſt, upon this principle, be ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only regular miniſters, that they are not even viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chriſtians; and inſtead of being the only perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to diſpenſe goſpel adminiſtrations, they have no right even to partake of them themſelves. Conſequently all they pretend to baptize, are ſtill in a ſtate of heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and ſo all their miniſters and churches, as well as ours, in the ſame wretched and deplorable condition. Who can ſuppoſe ſuch doctrines as theſe, are to be found in the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? who can imagine, claims and principles, productive of ſuch ſhocking conſequences, have any warrant from the goſpel of Chriſt? A moments cool reflection, methinks,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:010800_0080_0F81D167AEEAA690"/>might ſhew their abſurdity, and give a check to the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of them, in their warmeſt career of <hi>proſelyting</hi> zeal. Verily, gentlemen, a little more conſiſtency of principle and conduct here, would not be amiſs. Let us firſt ſee you concerned to ſecure for your ſelves, a valid baptiſm: Then it will be time enough to preſs us with the argument of your only valid miniſtry. When we ſee you properly concerned for your own ſafety, it may poſſibly convince us that you are ſincere, in your zealous attempts to promote ours.</p>
            <p>IF Mr. L. or any other, will juſt remove theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and favour us with a ſolid, ſcriptural and thoro' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the foregoing arguments, it will be kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and properly noticed. But if only bold aſſertions, falſe quotations, and a ſuperficial glance, upon here and there a ſentence, is offered to the public, under the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of <hi>a full anſwer,</hi> it will be treated with deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neglect.</p>
            <p>MAY the father of lights direct our enquiries, and the God of truth lead us into all truth. May the ſaving influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſpirit of peace and holineſs, ſo remarkable in the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians, be ſhed forth in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful effuſions, upon all orders and denominations. That ſo, however we differ in ſentiments in ſome leſſer things, we may all agree in "chooſing the one thing needful," and finally unite our hearts and voices, in endleſs hallelujahs, to our common Lord and Redeemer. AMEN.</p>
