            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is nothing more evident and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, than the <hi>Proof</hi> of a <hi>DEITY,</hi> in all thoſe Works and Wonders, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly appear with ſuch Marks of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, as loudly ſpeak their Author, <hi>GOD.</hi> For <hi>the inviſible Things of him, from the Creation of the World, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the Things that are made, even his eternal Power and Godhead:</hi> So that they who had only this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Being and Perfections from exiſting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that knew God only by the Light of Nature, and yet <hi>glorified him not, as God; were without Excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not only are the <hi>Works of Creation,</hi> in the vaſt Variety of their Natures, in their untold Numbers, in their ſhining Beauties, in their ſurprizing Order,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005228_0004_1016E92B07FBB380"/>Harmony, Direction, and Uſe; ſuch evident Proofs of a God: But the <hi>Works of Providence,</hi> are alike plain and unconteſtable Evidences of a ſupreme Being, that is infinitely wiſe, powerful and kind. In <hi>theſe,</hi> he hath not left himſelf without <hi>Witneſs,</hi> in that <hi>he did good. HE</hi> the true God <hi>did Good</hi> like a God, and, ſo as no other could do. And, this, he doth continually, in a Multitude of Ways, defending and upholding of us, in Life and Motion, &amp;c. For, in him we <hi>live</hi> and <hi>move,</hi> as well as have our <hi>Being.</hi> Every Breath we draw, is by new Leave and Power from him, and if he ſhould withhold the ſame, one Moment, in that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould die.</p>
            <p>Among the innumerable Inſtances of a divine and perpetually beneficent Providence, ſome are eminently <hi>marvellous,</hi> in the Perſervation, Defence and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his poor Creatures; and demand our moſt ſpecial Notice, as there are in them the more ſignal Diſplays of the Wiſdom, Power, Care, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a God; and by them, is given a more plain and ample Teſtimony for God. So that they who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>evil and unthankful</hi> after all theſe, are left <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Excuſe,</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>And when to all theſe, is added the moſt ſtrong and affecting Proof of the manifold Wiſdom and rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, in the <hi>Redemption</hi> of Rebel-Man by <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST;</hi> the Obligations to this glorious Being are increaſed beyond Expreſſion. And how can any under the Goſpel, be excuſed, who don't with warm Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Soul, improve theſe Evidences of the divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Benevolence to the Purpoſes of their Duty and God's Glory?</p>
            <p>But as the Proofs of a Deity, which are diſplayed all abroad in Creation and Providence, breaking forth,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:005228_0005_1016E8BD10629C50"/>and ſhining out from every Part of the Creation, as alſo in every Scene of Providence, are <hi>open</hi> to all ſerious Obſervers: So, the brighter and more engaging Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of a God in the Revelation and Gift of Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour, cannot <hi>eſcape</hi> the moſt pleaſing Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of all, whoſe Eyes are opened to behold the Glory of God in the Face of his Son. Never, O never do the Proofs of a Deity ſhine forth with ſuch ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clearneſs and ſweet Influence, as they do in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> in whom, the great and glorious God may be known, &amp; believed in; known, and loved; known, and rejoiced in and enjoyed for ever. This Kind of Proof (ſurely) cannot fail of having a moſt ſolemn, ſweet and practical Regard from all that have felt the Power of it, in their Converſion, and bleſſed Conformity to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And how often is it, that the <hi>Subjects</hi> whom <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> ſingles out, in a remarkable Manner, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the Perfections of God upon them; in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from bodily Evils; and ſo to make them Witneſſes for him: Are the <hi>very ſame</hi> whom <hi>Grace</hi> pitcheth upon too, for the ſame Purpoſe; in their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Sin and Hell. And ſo, almighty Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and rich Grace eminently meet at the Command of Sovereignty, which ſhines illuſtriouſly in them both.</p>
            <p>Thus it was in the Days of our Saviour, when the Miracles of Power, in healing Men's <hi>Bodies,</hi> were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with thoſe of Grace, in the healing of their <hi>Souls.</hi> And how beautiful the Sight now, when in ſome Imitation thereof, the Subjects of an extraordinary Deliverance by Providence, do appear to be alſo the Subjects of converting and ſaving Grace? The Finger of God, in ſome few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of late, has appeared in a very wonderful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in healing and reſtoring Perſons from long Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:005228_0006_1016E8BE9930B718"/>and Confinement; whoſe Difficulties had long baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled all Means, and ſeem'd beyond the ordinary Methods of Cure. And O how much more of God ſtill, has there been in ſuch Inſtances, when they have been hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought upon, by almighty ſovereign Grace too!</p>
            <p>God's Creatures are all his own abſolute Property, and he may ſingle out which of them he pleaſeth to be the diſtinguiſh'd Subjects of his Power and Grace. And <hi>this Perſon,</hi> of whoſe Deliverances I have undertaken to give ſome Account, has appeared for a long Series of Years to have been a remarkable <hi>Subject,</hi> and as it were a viſible <hi>Seat</hi> of the divine Wonders. God's Dealings with her have been very uncommon, and even ſingular all along. And by the <hi>whole Frame</hi> of his Diſpenſations towards her, it has look'd as if God might have ſome <hi>Reſerves</hi> of uncommon Favour for her, and Deſigns of diſplaying his ſovereign Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs in ſomething extraordinary with Reſpect to her, as the Event now ſheweth. Under ſome of the greateſt Weight of the Hand of Providence upon her, there often appeared a wonderful Uplifting of the Heart and Soul, by the Power of Grace at Work in her. And the Work of God <hi>in</hi> her, has ever appeared to bear ſome Proportion to the Dealings of God <hi>with</hi> her. And, now, what doth at laſt ſo evidently appear to be done for her, ſeems to have been aimed at, and deſigned in the whole <hi>Scheme</hi> of Providence, and <hi>Train</hi> of Events concerning her; ſo much, is it of a Piece with the reſt. And though no one could pretend to have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen it, yet now it has happened, it doth ſeem to be ſome extraordinary <hi>Reſult</hi> of divine Counſel and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, the Fruit of <hi>reſolute</hi> Mercy, which though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to appear in <hi>ſlow Progreſs</hi> for many Years (in Order to make the more illuſtrious Diſcovery of it ſelf
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:005228_0007_1016E8C0886961A0"/>in the Cloſe) at Length <hi>breaks forth</hi> and makes its Way through all Difficulty, appears more open, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts itſelf in a very diſcernable and ſurpriſing Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. A gracious Providence (it ſeems) had for Years together before this, been doing enough, in a more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Way, to fix her, and others Attention to God's ſignal Care of her, and to keep up a ſecret Hope of ſome greater Deliverances ſtill; but now, when the ſet Time was come, to favour her with Liberty, and to make the divine Power and Praiſe the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; behold, her Reſtoration; muſt take an <hi>unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Stretch,</hi> as if the Lord had not forgotten that <hi>Prerogative</hi> Character of his.— <hi>The Lord looſeth the Priſoners — the Lord raiſeth them that that are bowed down.</hi> And as if he would yet be known in that his <hi>incomparable</hi> Character, <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord—glorious in Holineſs, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Praiſes,</hi> doing Wonders. Verily, he hath <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her,</hi> in her <hi>low Eſtate,</hi> for, <hi>his Mercy endureth forever.</hi> And this, (as, I might obſerve) has been the Iſſue of much Prayer for her, as well as in Conſequence of great Faith, which has appeared to be wrought in her, and exerciſed by her. But, God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth whom he will to be the Subjects of his Mercy, he <hi>hath Mercy</hi> on whom he will have Mercy. And ſo he fits, whom he will, in and by them, to make his Power and Grace known, and to glorify himſelf before the World.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of publiſhing this Account, is not to extol the <hi>Subject</hi> of this Deliverance, but the divine <hi>Author</hi> of it. And not to ſpeak of what appears excellent in her any further, than it may ſeem neceſſary, to give ſome ample <hi>Teſtimony</hi> for God, in what he hath done for her. According to her own Words, <q>Oh let the
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:005228_0008_1016E8C604EC48D0"/>Lord humble me, and let none take Notice of me, but for God's Sake, and for his Honour.</q> And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch, as ſhe ſeems to view every Thing in her, that juſtly looks well to others, as <hi>God's</hi> Creature and Gift, rather than as her Excellence; and alſo to give all that God has any Way done for her, back again unto him in Acknowledgement and Praiſe, I hope it will not be accounted any Tranſgreſſion of Rule, to ſpeak of her as a <hi>Monument</hi> of the Power and Mercy of God, which <hi>cannot be hid.</hi> Yea, ſuch an <hi>open</hi> Inſtance hereof, wherein, the Lord hath been pleaſed to appear in <hi>his Strength of Salvation.</hi> Yea, 'tis ſo far from being the Deſign of this Narrative to magnify a poor Worm, the Subject of it, that it is rather to promote her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; by letting her yet more into herſelf to ſee ſtill more of her own Vileneſs and Nothingneſs in the Light of the Knowledge of God, and of his Works of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; which are here ſet before her; as a Glaſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe may (as in ſome entire View of God's Dealings with her) ſee what the Lord hath done for her; and this ranged, ſomething in the Order of her Experience of it. And O let her Eyes be turned inward upon her ſelf, as well as lifted upwards to God and Chriſt, and let her Soul be filled with ſacred Love, Gratitude and Wonder, that even the Lord would look upon ſuch a vile Creature, and ſingle her out, to be ſuch a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Almighty Power and Grace, ſomething as it was with poor <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> who <hi>bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaid, what is thy Servant, that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead Dog as I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Deſign hereof, is to fix the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Doings of the Lord, upon the Hearts of the Beholders hereof, and ſo to impreſs thoſe Truths, and that Senſe of God and divine Things, which ſome
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:005228_0009_1016E8C9DAFBD640"/>ſeem'd to have received by ſeeing how great Things the Lord had done for her.</p>
            <p>I have (with others) been ſundry Times to the Place, converſed frequently with her, and ſeen her the Subject of Deliverances, as I had before ſeen her, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Impotency. I have alſo made careful Enquiry into the Matters of Fact, concerning her; and got In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Credibility of the particular Witneſſes to them. And took the utmoſt Care, I could that that might be a juſt Account of Things, and have here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented them as they are, in their own native Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, without giving any determinate Opinion of the preciſe Nature of the Deliverance wrought for her, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the ſurprizingly free Uſe of her Feet, but leave the Reader entirely to judge thereof himſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it ſhall appear to him from the whole. Only obſerve, that there doth ſeem, upon the ſtricteſt Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination into it, to be plentiful Matter of the divine Praiſe and Glory, which I hope is the governing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Hiſtory. And in drawing out the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of it, and ranging of Things in their own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it will be ſomething neceſſary and not incongruous to intermix ſomething of her inward, <hi>Chriſtian Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> with the Train of <hi>God's Dealings</hi> with her: Becauſe the Deſigns of Providence and Grace, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally appear, to have been in Fact, carried on together. And I truſt this Intermixture will reliſh well with the ſerious Reader, as it doth actually reflect a <hi>Beauty</hi> upon the Work of the Lord, and a <hi>Glory to the Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add this further, that the Things here related, are what many do know and ſpeak of, without any Doubt of the Truth and Certainty of them. And that the moſt wonderful Event of all, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Her
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:005228_0010_1016E8CB63778378"/>ſudden riſing up, and walking and leaping as one at Liberty from long Impotency, didn't happen to her when alone, nor was the Thing done in a Corner, but a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, (who had been worſhipping with her at the Houſe) ſaw it, and wondred. And ſince that Time, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of her Deliverance growing yet ſtronger, 'tis the Opinion of many ſerious and judicious Perſons, that it is worthy of <hi>Notice,</hi> among the <hi>wonderful Works</hi> of the Lord, which he will have <hi>to be remembred.</hi> At whoſe Deſire, I have here given the following Account, in brief, and in the Order as follows.</p>

            <head>Mr. LORD'S Account OF Mrs. MERCY WHEELER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ercy Wheeler</hi> (Daughter of Mr. <hi>Iſaac Wheeler</hi> of <hi>Plainfield,</hi> and of <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife) was born in the Year, 1706, and from a Child was favour'd with a ſignal Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Health, until the 20th Year of her Age, wherein, ſhe was ſeized with the <hi>nervous Fever</hi> in the latter End of the Summer, in 1726. And thereupon, fell into ſuch Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as prov'd almoſt beyond Example. By the Summer following ſhe was brought ſo low as to be wholly confined to her Bed, which Confinement continued for many Years. And for ſeveral of thoſe Years was ſo reduced, and under ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Fever, that for a great while together, even every Day was expected to be the laſt.</p>
            <p>But, before I proceed to give the particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Weakneſs; I muſt obſerve, that when firſt ſeized with her Sickneſs, ſhe was under ſome Awakenings and Concern about her Soul, which grew upon her greatly in the Time of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005228_0012_1016E8D294E75950"/>that Sickneſs, and in about ſix Weeks, her Soul-Diſtreſs roſe to a Criſis, when ſhe experience ſuch a Change, and received that Comfort, which proved a continuing Thing, and of perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Service to her, in all her ſubſequent low E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Body. She appeared very calm &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in her Mind, patient in Tribulation, inſtant in Prayer, reſigned to the divine Will, and ſerious in her Diſcourſe; but otherwiſe made little, or no Diſcovery of her Converſion then. And therefore I ſhall refer the Account of this, to that Place in the Narrative, where it moſt naturally comes in, as to the Date of her own more explicit Relation of it—And further, will only obſerve here, that all along, even in the greateſt Extremity of her Pain and Weakneſs. She had much Faith and Hope, and Comfort in God through Jeſus Chriſt, and often enjoyed ſweet Communion with him by his Word and Spirit, which were abundantly with her. Yea, excepting ſome Seaſons of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Darkneſs and Fear, ſhe was very comfortable in the whole Courſe of her Confinement. And when ſhe could not converſe with her Friends, by Reaſon of her extreme Weakneſs, ſhe had, (by her Account afterwards) refreſhing Converſe with Heaven: Inſomuch, that ſhe would ſometimes ſay, <q>Since the Lord was with me, in that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and made it as a Palace to me, and with his Preſence, I could freely go back there, if it was his Will that I ſhould.</q> And it ſeems as if the Joy of the Lord was her Strength in her Weakneſs and Confinement, or elſe it don't ſeem how the Frame of Nature could have kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo long, under ſuch extraordinary Miſery,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005228_0013_1016E8D41D57FE50"/>and Impotency, before any remarkable Revival of Nature at all.</p>
            <p>And now, that God may have all the Glory of upholding her thus, in ſuch a low Eſtate, for ſo long a Time, and at length reviving her; here follows the Account of ſome <hi>Symptoms</hi> of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Weakneſs and low Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Her Fleſh conſum'd, 'till ſhe was reduced to a meer Skeleton; for, her Appetite was gone, and ſhe not able to eat, or bear either Bread, or Fleſh of any Kind, for the Space of <hi>five</hi> Years; and as to Proviſion, ſupported only, by thin liquid Food, and this ſome of the moſt mean in Nature and Dreſs, that can be imagined, and put into her Mouth only by Spoonfuls; and them, but three at a Time, twice a Day, and ſometimes but once in a Day. Thus it was during this 5 Years, or the greateſt Part of that Term.</p>
            <p>Her Strength had failed, to that Degree, that ſhe could not move her Head upon the Pillow, for a great while together, nor yet any Limb to help herſelf at all.</p>
            <p>And ſo weak in this Time, that when they turn'd her in the Bed, ſhe often, and uſually fainted.</p>
            <p>So weak that ſhe could not ſpit at all, but only open her Mouth, and let her Spittle run out of it.</p>
            <p>So weak in her vital Parts, that her Speech wholly failed her, ſo that ſhe was not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her Thoughts by Whiſpers, to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any, but thoſe of the Family, who had learnt by the Motion of her Lips rather than by any diſtinct Articulation, to know her Mind in ſome Meaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:005228_0014_1016E8D6D3B14E38"/>
Her Strength ſo gone in this Time, that ſhe ſcarce opened her Eyes at all. And when ſhe did, could hardly ſee, ſo as to diſtinguiſh Perſons, whom ſhe had been moſt acquainted with; and knew but a very few, of all that came to ſee her.</p>
            <p>Such was her extreme Weakneſs, that her Heart was not perceived to beat in all this Time, and ſhe generally lay with her Mouth open, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Breath, as if a dying, and as it was tho't, ſometimes, actually a dying; and once, to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance gone for a great while, ſo that they clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her Eyes, and thought ſhe would revive no more—Such were the Symptoms of her low State, which divers knew, and have declared from their own Knowledge.</p>
            <p>It may be noticed here, that in this Time of her extraordinary Weakneſs, a Variety of Means, with much Expence, were uſed for her, but all in vain, 'till after the Experiment of the cold Bath. Near the Cloſe of this Time of her low State, this was once uſed, and gave ſuch a Shock to her feeble Frame, that for a Month after, her Hands were drawn up and faſt clenched, and not a Joint from her Fingers Ends to her Shoulder, would bend any more, than one entire Bone. Her Feet alſo, were affected in ſome like Manner. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after this Shock, it was obſerved, that Means began to operate upon her. Not only were her Joints looſned, and her Fingers eſpecially, which had been ſo ſuddenly contracted, recovered gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to their proper Extenſion. But, ſhe began to revive with inward Strength. Indeed her Knees and Ancles didn't recover now, nor all along, any Thing like to her Arms and Hands. And even
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005228_0015_1016E8DAEC3185B8"/>theſe were not ſuddenly reſtored to their Uſe; for ſtill ſhe could not hold ſo much as a Spoon in her Hand to feed her ſelf; nor yet keep her Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers out ſtraight, when ſhe held out her Arm, but with their own Weight, they would drop. But yet ſhe was for ſome Time recovering vital Strength before ſhe ſpake out with an audible Voice.</p>
            <p>Thus after ſomething more than 5 Years from the beginning of her cloſe Confinement, ſhe began to mend. And in <hi>April</hi> 1732, on the publick Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Faſt-Day her Voice was reſtored to the Surprize of them about her; which, had theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markables attending it.—She had been for ſome Time now, under a Cloud, in which Time, ſhe beſought the Lord, for the Manifeſtations of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light and Love, and prayed that if ſhe was the Lord's, he would be pleaſed to give her ſome Token for Good, and having a great Deſire (if it might be) ſo to recover from her long Weakneſs and preſent Darkneſs, as to be able to ſpeak of what, ſhe was yet ready to hope, God had done for her, and eſpecially to ſpeak ſomething to her youthful Companions; her Thoughts ran much upon the Liberty of Speech, with earneſt Prayer that this might be reſtored. And accordingly, it was ſo; and that very ſuddenly and ſurpriſingly, ſo that ſhe ſpake out audibly, and what ſhe was firſt heard to ſay, was, <q>O what God has done for me now, he has opened my Mouth, that hath been ſhut many Years.</q> Upon which ſhe went on talking of God and divine Things in an agreeable Manner: And giving ſome Account of God's Dealings with her, which ſhe was much diſpoſed to ſpeak of, and withal, expreſſed a great Deſire
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005228_0016_1016E8BA4C9AF978"/>of others Converſion, and being devoted to God: But it ſeem'd to her, (as ſhe told me) <q>That ſhe had never done any Thing for God.</q> The Uſe of her Speech now, continued Forty eight Hours, and then failed again for about the Space of two Years.</p>
            <p>Now, it is not ſuppos'd that her Speech fail'd at firſt through any ſpecial Defect in the Organs of Speech, but, rather through univerſal Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Failure of vital Strength. So that, ſhe was not able to deliver Breath enough, to give the Air any forcible Vibration, to make an articulate Sound. And when ſhe did ſpeak, (it ſeems) ſhe had been ſome Time recovering vital Strength, which in ſome Meaſure prepared her for it; and that ſhe ſpake ſo ſuddenly, and with more Strength than ſhe had ſeem'd to have yet habitually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; might be owing to an extraordinary Viſit from God at that Time. And will it be difficult unto us, to conceive, that what of gradually reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Strength was wanting to enable her to ſpeak out thus, for this Seaſon, might be ſupplied with the extraordinary Influence of divine Thoughts and of Light and Comfort in her Soul? which for the Time being, might poſſibly diffuſe ſuch further Vigor and Strength into her animal Frame, and raiſe her Courage with her Diſpoſition to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert her ſelf thus, as was ſufficient for this Purpoſe. For if <hi>the Fear of the Lord</hi> (or the vigorous Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the divine Life) <hi>is Health</hi> (or Medicine) <hi>to the Navel,</hi> and doth invigorate the Seat of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Life? It ſeems, that, ſome extraordinary Senſe of divine Truth and Love, may do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in a languid State, to give new Springs to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005228_0017_1016E8E05C0ACD70"/>the Organs of Speech. Certain it is, that <hi>Heavineſs in the Heart of Man maketh it ſtoop:</hi> But <hi>a good Word,</hi> (of which Kind many were ſpoken to her Soul) <hi>maketh it glad.</hi> And, <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart,</hi> eſpecially, when refreſhed with divine Light and Joy, <hi>the Mouth</hi> more readily and powerfully <hi>ſpeaketh.</hi> It doth ſeem as if there was ſomething extraordinary in her being able to ſpeak for this 48 Hours, while under that powerful Senſe of divine Things; becauſe, ſhe fail'd again ſo ſoon; when yet, afterwards her animal Strength appeared, much as it was before. And now after this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; I am not about to ſay, whether her ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for this ſhort Seaſon, was deſign'd as a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of further Favour, in her continued Power to ſpeak; nor whether its Failure for the two Years, might be to try her Faith and Patience, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation; though the Event anſwered well to both.—For in theſe two Years, it pleaſed the Lord to give her remarkable Quietneſs of Soul, and Submiſſion to his Will; and tho' ſometimes in the Dark, yet for the moſt Part, ſhe appeared to know much of God, and as ſhe humbly thinks, was ſtrengthned more and more to believe and hope in God; 'till her Speech was reſtored to her again. But whatever was the Deſign of God in this extraordinary Diſpenſation, or however ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; the Thing was in Fact ſo, ſhe did ſpeak, and then could not for this Term of Time, as ſhe and others relate it.</p>
            <p>Sometime before ſhe ſpake again, ſhe had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Strength, ſo as to be able to ſit up in the Bed, and to <hi>feed her ſelf,</hi> which was now between ſeven and eight Years, ſince ſhe had <hi>ſo far</hi> helped
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005228_0018_1016E8E340913BB0"/>her ſelf, and was alſo able to whiſper more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly then ſhe had done in Years before, but, yet not able to ſpeak out.—And a little before ſhe did ſo, ſhe was led to meditate on the Power of Chriſt, in his opening the Mouth of the dumb Man—And on his Power to help her in that Caſe of Impotency that ſhe was in: at which Time, it ſeem'd as if her Faith was greatly aſſiſted, and ſhe enabled to truſt in the Power of Chriſt, and was help'd to take Courage from the Willingneſs of Chriſt, to help ſuch a poor Creature, as ſhe was. Soon after this, ſhe was enabled to exert her ſelf in the Uſe of Speech, even with ſurprizing Force and Freedom. The People by her, wondred, as they perceived her Mouth was <hi>opened,</hi> and her Lips <hi>ſhewing forth the Praiſes of God:</hi> And ſhe her ſelf, greatly affected with it. Now her Heart and Mouth, was full with the 103 Pſalm, <q>
                  <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy Name, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> She called upon others to praiſe God, with and for her; and wanted that even <q>
                  <hi>every Thing that hath Breath ſhould praiſe the Lord.</hi>
               </q> Her Speech now continued, and is (I truſt) through God's Grace abundantly uſed in praiſing of him. As ſhe appeared very much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and reſigned to God, under her various <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints</hi> by Providence, ſo upon every <hi>Releaſe</hi> her Soul ſeem'd to be the more enlarged in his Praiſe. And in the general Courſe of her extraordinary Trials and Helps, it was remarkable, that ſhe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had <hi>Relief,</hi> but, ſhe was firſt made <hi>willing</hi> to have every Thing as God would have it to be. And as this rendred her Confinement and low State eaſy to her, (becauſe ſhe ſaw it was the Will of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005228_0019_1016E8AF775B6300"/>God, that ſhe ſhould be in that State, and was therefore reconciled to it, ſo every Relief and Mercy, both in Kind and Degree derived its <hi>Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> from its being the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of the Lord to give it to her. When ſhe was very poor, ſhe wou'd ſay, <q>I am well enough, becauſe I am juſt ſo well as God would have me, and I dar'n't ſay I would have it otherwiſe.</q>—And when ſhe was better, ſhe would ſay, <q>I rejoice in the Eaſe and Help I have, only that God may be glorified in, and by me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſhe had had the Liberty of Speech ſome Time, ſhe more particularly related what God had hopefully done for her Soul in the Time of her Sickneſs; and eſpecially, that Experience of the Power of God upon her Heart, which, ſhe hopes is a <hi>ſaving Converſion</hi> to God. Of which, I ſhall in this Place, give <hi>the Account,</hi> as both formerly, and now lately ſhe has related it—And though it is what ſhe experienced about ſix Weeks after her Sickneſs began; yet foraſmuch as ſhe never gave any diſtinct Account of it, 'till after the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Speech the ſecond Time, I conceive this is the moſt proper Place to inſert it. And it is as follows,—</p>
            <p>
               <q>In the latter End of Auguſt 1726, in the 20th Year of my Age, as I was taking Care of my Siſter in her Sickneſs, and when ſhe was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of Death's Approach; (appearing to have realiſing Views and to be under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Senſe of eternal Things) ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to me, after this Manner, <hi>Siſter, you are young, and of an Age very much expoſed to Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—but you ſhould remember, that not your
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005228_0020_1016E8E8C2B878E0"/>Youth will exempt you from the Stroke of Death, therefore pray conſider whether you are prepared for it,</hi> &amp;c.—Which, was a Means, by the Bleſſing of God, of putting me upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: and not thinking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> State to be good, yea, knowing that I was not prepared to die, and not knowing how ſoon the Hand of the Lord might touch me, or how ſoon Death might come, I felt ſomething concerned about my Soul and Eternity. And in a few Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (viz) on the <hi>firſt of September</hi> following, it pleaſed God to viſit me, with the ſame Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which my Siſter had; and that, in a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Manner. And now her Words ſeem'd to be verified in this, that my <hi>Youth</hi> was no <hi>Fence</hi> againſt Sickneſs and Death, for I was very ſick, and Death in a frightful View of it, ſtared me in the Face, and I expected no other but to die in a little Time. And inſtead of my former vain Mirth, and youthful Follies, it ſeem'd as if I muſt be ſoon reaping the bitter Fruits of them. It pleaſed God with this Sickneſs, to ſend <hi>his Holy Spirit</hi> to convince me of Sin, and of my miſerable State—I expected to die, but it was ſomething beyond the Grave, which my Heart trembled and ſhrank at the Thought and View of. The Sins of my Life, were now ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before my Face. And even my whole Life appeared as one continued Act of Sin, or Series of Rebellion againſt God: And nothing but Deſtruction appeared before me, as my Portion. I attempted to cry for Mercy, but a Senſe of my Guiltineſs, and the terrible Apprehenſions of the Wrath of God, almoſt overwhelmed me.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005228_0021_1016E8EB6FCF8850"/>Thoſe Paſſages of Scripture in Prov. 1. 24-29. came to Mind, and took Hold of me.—<hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed, &amp;c. I alſo will laugh at your Calamity,</hi> &amp;c. I ſaw, that I had ſlighted the Offers of Grace, yea, been regardleſs of all the Warnings, Threatnings, Calls and Invitations of the Word; and ſet light by all Means. And it ſeem'd, as if my Day of Grace was over, my Concern held, and encreaſed for about ſix Weeks, and in this Time it often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me, that I was the moſt vile and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creature in the World. And in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and Anguiſh of Soul, it ſeem'd ſometimes, as if I ſhould have been glad to have changed Conditions with the Beaſts of the Field, looking upon my Caſe infinitely worſe than theirs, for that I had an immortal Soul, deſtroyed by Sin, which I expected muſt bear the dreadful Wrath of God for ever, for the Sin of my Nature, and the Sins of my Life, which I ſaw cleaved to me. Then, ſometimes, I ſhould have more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that the Day of Grace was not paſt, that there might be Hope for ſuch an one as I. And was particularly encouraged from theſe Paſſages, <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found—They that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> And now, I was (with more Courage) put upon ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; if haply God might be found: but then, ſuch Texts would come into my Mind, <hi>Without Holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord. — And the Sacrifices of the Wicked are an Abomination to the Lord.</hi> So that I could not get any <hi>laſting Eaſe,</hi> and <hi>Relief,</hi> by all my <hi>Duties</hi>—But, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I was made to ſee ſuch Evil in my ſelf,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005228_0022_1016E8ECF7D4BD68"/>and Sin in every Thing I did, that the more I did, the worſe I ſeem'd to be: And the more dreadful my Caſe appeared, for that my Prayers, and all could not help me. It ſeem'd, as if I was loſt, and could never recover my ſelf, but the more I try'd, the worſe I grew; until my Diſtreſs was ſo great, that Sleep wholly depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my Eyes, ſo that I never ſhut them to ſleep for three Days and three Nights together. And when urged to try for Sleep, and to uſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Means for that End, my Concern was ſo great that I dare not, leſt I ſhould awake in Hell, and I wondred I was not there, and ſaw that I could not charge God with Injuſtice, if he ſhould immediately ſend me there. But on the 4th Day; after I had been thus kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake by the terrible Apprehenſions of God's Wrath, and had lain, as one expecting the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the dreadful Sentence of everlaſting Condemnation, and had ſeen the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs of God, in ſuch a Sentence; it pleaſed the Lord, thro' the unſearchable Riches of his Grace and Mercy, unexpectedly to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf, in another Manner, in and thro' the Redeemer; by theſe Words of the bleſſed Saviour in Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give yon Reſt.</hi> By which, I was made to ſee Chriſt's Allſufficiency, infinite Sutableneſs, and Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſave juſt ſuch a ſinful miſerable Wretch, as I had made my ſelf. It now appeared <hi>real,</hi> that Chriſt was calling and inviting me to come unto him; and O the <hi>Divinity</hi> which I ſaw in the Invitation, and in the Way of Salvation by
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005228_0023_1016E8EFF7D624C8"/>him: And it ſeems, as if I was <hi>conſtrained</hi> to come (as laden, and born down as I was, with my Sins) and <hi>made</hi> to venture my Soul, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ALL with him. I think I was made to bow to his Terms, and reſign up my ſelf to him; and (if I miſtake not) found an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Willingneſs, and Deſire, to take him for my Prophet, Prieſt, and King; and at the ſame Time found my weary Soul refreſhed and comforted, and filled with Wonder and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at the infinite Grace and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the bleſſed Redeemer, that ever he ſhould look upon one ſo vile as I am. And when I thought what a glorious Being, and what Love and Grace, I had ſinned againſt, my Heart broke under it, and this opened the Springs of Sorrow: And, Oh! Bleſſed be the Lord, the almighty Phyſician, who healeth the broken in Heart, that of his ſovereign Grace, he has (as I hope) healed my Soul. To him be Glory for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, I have given a brief Account, of her firſt notable Experience of the Work of God, upon her Soul, which has been followed with an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Chriſtian Experience,</hi> in the Courſe of her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Life, and Trials and Deliverances; <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of which, will be neceſſarily wrought into the remaining Part of the Narrative, unto which I now return.</p>
            <p>In a little Time after this continued Power to ſpeak, ſhe was able to <hi>ſit up</hi> in the Bed, and to have her Cloaths on. About which Time her <hi>Sight</hi> was reſtored, ſo that ſhe could ſee to read a little, which ſhe had not done for near Eight
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005228_0024_1016E8F3D15001C0"/>Years. As I have obſerved, her Sight failed through extreme Weakneſs of Body, and as her Strength increaſed, this was reſtored, and nothing more gradually than this. Firſt ſhe could only diſtinguiſh groſſer Objects, and then leſſer, till ſhe could diſtinguiſh <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> which ſhe then knew, as well as ever ſhe did, though at the ſame Time, ſhe had loſt the Knowledge of almoſt all Things that had been ſo long lockt up from her Senſes. When firſt carried abroad, juſt to take the Air, and, the Works of Nature open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her View; they were almoſt as new and ſurpriſing, as if they had but then ſtarted into Being. Indeed, ſhe had almoſt loſt every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Idea, and Remembrance of the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting World without Doors, that ſhe ever had any Knowledge of; but had made a happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency (even by this Time) in the Knowledge of divine Things with which ſhe was ſo converſant.</p>
            <p>When ſhe was releaſed from this Eight Years cloſe Confinement to her Bed, and could bear the Air, a little; ſhe more evidently recovered Strength; and in about Three Years more had gained ſo much as to be able to be held up in ſome erect Poſture, and ſo by Degrees to be led, or rather carried and born up, between two, ſhoving her Feet along carefully upon the Floor, leſt they turn'd aſide: For, even at this Time, her <hi>Ancle-Bones</hi> were exceeding looſe, and ſeparate, by Reaſon of the long and great Relaxation of the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Tendons;</hi> that ſhe could in no wiſe lift them up and uſe them, as Perſons are wont to do, that yet have not Strength to walk without Help: Yea, ſo looſe and ſeparate were
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005228_0025_1016E8F5586E8058"/>they, that a String muſt ſometimes, be uſed about her Feet and Ancles, to keep her Feet in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Poſition, as ſhe lay in the Bed. And alſo, her Knee-Bones, were ſo weak and looſe, that after ſhe was able to turn herſelf in Bed, ſhe ſometimes put them out in doing this.</p>
            <p>But yet in the main, ſhe gradually recruited, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in ſome intervening Pits of the <hi>Pleuriſy</hi> and other <hi>Fevers,</hi> and various Diſtempers, which retarded her Recovery from her long Weakneſs; for, as it was obſerved, there was ſcarce any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper ſent into the Place, but ſhe had a Share of it. Twice ſhe had the <hi>Throat-Diſtemper.</hi> The firſt Time, ſhe was ſeized with it, ſhe was under the Effects of it from <hi>October</hi> to the <hi>July</hi> following, before any great Revival. And the laſt Time, which was ſo lately, as in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1740, ſhe had it ſo bad, that ſhe was obliged to take to her Bed again, and never could help herſelf more, any Thing conſiderable, 'till the laſt Day of the <hi>May,</hi> after. This now, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back again into the Depths, where ſhe was tried with new <hi>Scenes</hi> of Providence, but, ſupported alſo, with new <hi>Supplies</hi> of Grace.</p>
            <p>At theſe Seaſons, ſhe had great <hi>Trials,</hi> and great <hi>Conſolations</hi> to ballance them. She gave me the Account thus—<q>Once I was near choak'd, and thought I ſhould die. And was ready to hope for it, if it might be the Will of God. My Evidences for Heaven then, O how clear were they? I had great Comfort in God. I can't tell how great. Upon ſome Abatement of my Diſtemper, I was ſorely exerciſed with extreme Hunger for Bread, but muſt not have it. I thought I ſhould gladly have taken it out
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005228_0026_1016E8F80F31B5A0"/>of the Mouth of the Dogs, if I might have it. A little after, I ſaw a Piece of Bread given to a Dog, which wrought ſtrangely on my Mind, and proved a Temptation to Uneaſineſs, which brought on great Darkneſs. Could I belong to God, (ſaid I to my ſelf) when deny'd the Bread that was given to the Dogs! Oh how it ſeem'd for a little while! Clouds and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs covered my Soul. But in this Time, thoſe Words in Iſai. 41.10. came to Mind, <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I am thy God; I will ſtrengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, I will uphold thee with the right Hand of my Righteouſneſs:</hi> Which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved upon my Heart, firſt to bow me to the Will of God, and afterwards to comfort me. After theſe, were given in theſe Words, in Matth. 4.4. <hi>Man ſhall not live by Bread alone, but by every Word which proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</hi> Oh how was I help'd hereby? And then was repeated the former Words in Iſai. <hi>Fear not,</hi> &amp;c, which came now, with great Power and Conſolation. And about three Days after, I was able to take Bread ſafely, and was reſreſhed and ſtrengthened thereby. But, I was made to ſee that I had been ſinfully impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in the Deſires of Death, for it appeared evident to me, that I ought to wait God's Time; and alſo, that I had been out of Frame, under the other Trial.—It ſeem'd ſometimes, as if God chaſtened me to make me willing to <hi>die,</hi> and chaſtened me to make me willing to <hi>live;</hi> yet, in <hi>neither,</hi> muſt be my own <hi>Chuſer:</hi> But, to live, or die as he pleaſed—And it came to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005228_0027_1016E8F9DE4AB708"/>that, that I was many Times afraid to chuſe any Thing for myſelf here, leſt I ſhould croſs the Will of God.</q> This only for a Specimen of her Experiences under the Dealings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.—</p>
            <p>When this laſt mentioned <hi>Illneſs</hi> was over, and the <hi>Hyſterick Diſorders</hi> which had mixed in with all, were abated; ſhe mended by more ſenſible Degrees; ſo that on the 25th of <hi>July</hi> 174<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſhe began to go with <hi>Crutches;</hi> bearing her Weight with them, and ſlipping her Feet carefully along upon the Floor; for they were not yet capable of their proper Uſe and Motion, by Reaſon of the forementioned Relaxation, which ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. In this Manner, ſhe went at Times, for the Courſe of Ten Months, in which Term ſhe often made Trial of her Strength to go without Crutches; and on the very Day of her great Deliverance, ſhe gat up, and ſtood alone, as ſhe held her Hands on her Knees to ſteddy herſelf; but cou'dn't lift up a Foot, to take a Step. And never in all this Courſe of 16 Years did go one Step alone, until that wonderful Event happened, on the remarkable 25th of <hi>May</hi> laſt; which, ſeem'd ſo viſibly to crown all that Providence had done for her before.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here, diſtinctly tell what preceeded, attended, and followed it; in which Method, the Reader may have the clearer View of it.</p>
            <p>As the neighbouring <hi>Miniſters</hi> had frequently, at her Deſire attended religious <hi>Faſts</hi> and <hi>Lectures</hi> at her Father's Houſe; ſo now, at her Requeſt a <hi>Lecture</hi> was appointed to be there on Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, this 25th of <hi>May,</hi> and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Lord</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005228_0028_1016E8FF2F0D5578"/>of <hi>Preſton</hi> invited to preach it. On the Saturday Evening before, ſhe had a very painful Senſe of her Infirmities, and alſo an extraordinary Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the Power and Sweetneſs of God's Word; which both ſupported her under her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Trouble, and alſo encouraged her Faith in God, and Hope that it might be better with her. Thus, <hi>God ſtrengthened her, with Strength in her Soul,</hi> and ſo, proportion'd the <hi>Strength</hi> to the <hi>Day.</hi> For, in this Time of her great Exerciſe, with Pain in her diſorder'd Joints, and with Weakneſs in her vital Parts, the Lord appeared for her in the Uſe of his Word, as he had been wont to do. And firſt he ſet home that Word upon her Heart, <hi>Let Patience have its perfect Work.</hi> The Sight ſhe now had of the Will of God in her Affliction, that all was as God, the wiſe, the good, and faithful God would have it, together with the View ſhe had of her own Unworthineſs of any Favour, greatly promoted her Patience and Submiſſion. Then, came that Direction and Promiſe to her Mind, in Rev. 2.10.—<hi>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life,</hi> which greatly encouraged her to hold out. And then, as if ſhe muſt have a more abundant Conſolation, thoſe Words in John 11.40.—<hi>If thou wouldſt believe, thou ſhouldſt ſee the Glory of God,</hi> were brought home with great Power upon her Soul, which led her to view the Help there was for her in God, in the Way of believing; and from that Time, ſuch was the powerful Impreſſion of that Word, that ſhe could not help thinking that God would ſome Way or other, glorify himſelf in her further and remarkable Deliverance. Thus her Mind wro't
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005228_0029_1016E900B6F33AF0"/>from Day to Day, 'till ſhe had a ſtrong Perſwaſion, that ſhe ſhould be healed, and that the Power of God would be ſeen in it, though ſhe knew not how. And whatever Suſpicion ſhe had at Times, that her Faith in this Matter was not of God, and whatever Temptations ſhe had to ſtruggle with, which ſuggeſted to her, that all her Faith about being healed, was deluſive, yet, it prevailed over all Diſcouragement and Oppoſition, and kept up for the moſt Part, during theſe three or four Days 'till her Deliverance came. On the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Lecture, her Pains were very great, and her Ancles (as ſhe obſerved) diſordered and ſeparate as uſual, yet ſhe <hi>ſtaggered not through Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> but was enabled, (as it ſeem'd to her) to believe againſt <hi>Hope,</hi> i. e. Againſt all human Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; for all Hopes of healing in the ordinary Way, ſeem'd to be cut off, and a <hi>Doctor</hi> juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon the View of her diſordered Joints, had ſaid, he thought ſhe would always be a <hi>Cripple:</hi> But yet, her Faith was ſtrengthened to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it did'nt ſeem to her any Thing the more difficult for God to heal her, becauſe her State was as it was. So far from this, that her Faith ſeem'd to riſe the <hi>higheſt,</hi> when her own difficult State appeared the <hi>plaineſt.</hi> And, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding every Diſcouragement in Nature, ſhe remained perſwaded, that God would glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her healing, and her Tho'ts ran much upon its being done on the <hi>Lecture-Day</hi> at Hand. On <hi>the Morning</hi> of that Day, her Faith grew ſtronger ſtill, and ſhe could not help thinking, that ſhe ſhould ſee the Glory of God <hi>that Day;</hi> but, this no Way ſerv'd to ſuperſede or prevent her
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005228_0030_1016E903632E7840"/>earneſt Prayer to God for healing. For, ſhe felt her Soul let out much in ſeeking to the Lord Jeſus to heal her. And her Faith was more and more ſtrengthened by meditating on the <hi>Miracles</hi> of Chriſt; eſpecially, on his healing the poor <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Man,</hi> that had lain ſo long at the <hi>Pool.</hi> It ſeems, it had been the Lord's Manner with her, to encourage, and help along, her Faith and Hope by directing her to the View of his Miracles, wrought upon one and another, wherein, ſhe had often a clear Repreſentation of her impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Caſe; and alſo a Soul-reviving View of the Power of Chriſt; ſo ſhe had at this Time, and it didn't ſeem difficult to her, to think that the Lord could and would help her. With this Faith, ſhe entred the Day; and was <hi>ſtrong in Faith</hi> and diſpoſed to <hi>give Glory to God:</hi> Her Mind in an extraordinary raiſed Frame; and could ſcarce keep from expreſſing it out full. When Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> came to attend the Service ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, She had a great Deſire to tell him what ſhe had lately met with, and what her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Faith was about her healing; but could not do it. And when ſhe ſaw how ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from it, it appeared to her, that it was beſt ſhe ſhould keep her Faith to <hi>herſelf,</hi> leſt by her <hi>publiſhing</hi> it, there might be an Expectation among the People of ſomething extraordinary, or otherways that Improvement be made of it, which might not be for the Glory of God. Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> began with <hi>Prayer:</hi> And however earneſt therein, for her; yet it ſeemed to her, as if he was not ſo earneſt for her healing, as he uſed to be at other Times. For, ſo intent was her
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005228_0031_1016E90515188EF8"/>Mind on God's glorifying himſelf in her heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he not having any ſuch particular Faith as ſhe had, was not led to expreſs himſelf ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwerable to her raiſed Thoughts of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Thing. However, ſhe ſeem'd to be in a happy Frame in Prayer, and Singing. And when Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> proceeded to the <hi>Sermon,</hi> though it was <hi>trying,</hi> and kept her Thoughts employed much in Self-Examination, yet it did not <hi>lower her Faith,</hi> but tended all to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> her. He preached from Iſa. 57.15. <hi>I dwell in the high and holy Place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the Humble, and to revive the Heart of the contrite ones.</hi>—After he had given ſome <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the humble Heart, and had ſpoke of the gracious Preſence of God, promiſed to ſuch an one, &amp;c. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>examine,</hi> whether thus humbled?—She thought ſhe could anſwer to his Rules of Trial, and ſay Amen to them, and take the Comfort thereof. After he had gone through with his Examination, he ſaid, <q>The Lord will revive the Hearts of the Humble, and if you are truly humble, God will revive you; depend upon it, he will, and fear not. Yea, if for his Glory, he will revive and bring you out of a Furnace.</q> Which ſeem'd to ſink into her Heart, as if the Lord did indeed ſet it home by his Spirit: Then by the Power of the Word upon her Soul, ſhe fell a <hi>Trembling;</hi> but this without any <hi>Diffidence</hi> and <hi>Terror;</hi> for it was given to her at that Time, to believe that the Lord would revive and help her, and bring her out. This involuntary Shaking now, continued but a few
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005228_0032_1016E90A07681E40"/>Minutes; and Nothing in her Behaviour was there, to interrupt the religious Exerciſe of the People. Her Mind and Heart kept up, in a raiſed Frame; but yet ſhe was compoſed thro' the whole, and was more and more confirm'd in it, That the Lord would ſhew his Glory in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. After Service was over, Mr. <hi>Newel</hi> asked her how ſhe was; but ſhe was too much overcome, to tell how. And when ſhe began to ſpeak, it was ſomething abruptly—(ſomewhat like as the Spouſe, when overcome with Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, begins thus—<hi>The Voice of my Beloved:</hi>) Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewing that her Mind was full of Thought, and that her Ideas crowded ſo faſt to the Door of Out-lett, that they could not obſerve the juſteſt Order in their Expreſſion, and Manner of coming forth.</p>
            <p>She was now ſet upon the Bed, ſomething ſpent and overcome. Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> came, and ſat down by her, and diſcourſed with her a little, but ſoon perceived her to be too much overcome for any Converſation almoſt: ſhe expreſt a great Deſire of ſubmitting to the Will of God; but cou'dn't help talking about her Healing, and ſaid, ſhe ſaw that Chriſt was <hi>willing</hi> to heal her. Upon which, Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> replied, that ſhe ſhould have the Will of Chriſt concerning her. But by this Time ſhe was ſo overpowered with the Senſe of God (as ſhe expreſſed it) <q>That ſhe could hardly ſpeak, and could not tell what to compare herſelf to, but, <hi>An Atom drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Sea:</hi>
               </q> So ſwallowed up was ſhe, with the Thoughts and Senſe of God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Way ſurrounded with his Power. And
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005228_0033_1016E90B8F0E89B8"/>then only obſerved to Mr. <hi>Lord,</hi> that it ſeem'd to her, as if GOD was with her of a Truth— and ſo ſtopped—Upon which he replied, <q>If ſo, then you are well of it, and I will leave you for the preſent,</q> which he thought beſt; becauſe ſhe was much ſpent, and he was afraid ſhe would be quite overcome with any more Converſation then. So, he gat up &amp; walked away among the People, that were yet tarrying in the Houſe. And no ſooner was he gone from her, but it turn'd in her Mind — <q>The <hi>Lecture</hi> is ended, and the Service <hi>all over,</hi> and I am not healed; what is become of my Faith now? Won't it be with me, as it uſed to be?</q> Whereupon a Cloud of great Darkneſs came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her, for a Minute or two; in which Time, ſhe was led again into her ſelf, to ſee what a poor unworthy Creature ſhe was, and had ſome ſuch Thoughts of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God's Will, that ſhe felt a Diſpoſition to be as God would have her be. Then thoſe Words were repeated to her, — <hi>If thou wilt believe, thou ſhalt ſee the Glory of God.</hi> By which her Darkneſs was carried clear off, and under the Influence of this Word, NOW, ſhe ſeem'd (as ſhe expreſt it) <q>to be <hi>wholly taken out of her ſelf, into the Hands of God;</hi> and enabled to believe that he could and would heal her.</q> Immediately upon which, ſhe felt a ſtrange irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Motion and Shaking, which began firſt with her Hands; and quickly ſpreading over her whole Frame; in which Time, ſhe felt a kind of Weight upon her; a ſort of racking of her Frame; every Joint as it were, working; and as
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005228_0034_1016E90E5EE37880"/>if ſhe was with Hands ſqueezed together, in her weak Places. As this Trembling went off, her Pains went with it, and ſhe felt <hi>ſtrong,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the <hi>Seat</hi> of Life, where ſhe had been moſt remarkably <hi>weak;</hi> and from thence Strength diffuſed it ſelf all over her animal Frame, into her Hips, Knees, Ancles &amp;c. She felt ſtrong and well, as if ſhe had no Diſeaſe upon her, and was under no Difficulty. And as ſhe had this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of new Strength and Freedom, ſhe felt as if ſhe was a raiſing up, and muſt riſe; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>roſe up</hi> and <hi>walked</hi> away among the People, with evident Sprightlineſs and Vigour, to the Aſtoniſhment of her ſelf and thoſe about her. She went this Time near 16 Feet, crying out, <q>Bleſs the Lord Jeſus, who has healed me!</q> but was ſoon damp'd with this Tho't, that ſhe was only in a <hi>Frenzy,</hi> and <hi>not healed;</hi> and the more ſo, when Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> (ſurpriſed at ſeeing her to walk thus, whom he had juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore left impotent and overcome too, ſo that ſhe could hardly talk) did obſerve to her, that ſhe was in a Frenzy, and accordingly took hold of her and led her to the Bed, and bid her ſit down; yea, even thruſt her down. But ſhe could not be confined there; feeling yet ſtrong and at Liberty, ſhe quickly roſe up again, with thoſe Words in her <hi>Mind, I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love,</hi> and with the high Praiſes of God in her <hi>Mouth.</hi> Her Soul being filled with ſuch Admiration and Love, as ſhe declared was inexpreſſible. Now ſhe walked ſeveral Times acroſs the Room with Strength and Steddineſs; which even conſtrained the People to think and
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005228_0035_1016E90FF0745F88"/>ſay, Verily, This is the Power of God! and they wondred and praiſed the ſame. And it was about 6 of the Clock in the Afternoon that the Thing was done, at which they all marvelled, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving united in a Prayer, and in Praiſe, on this remarkable Occaſion, they were diſmiſſed to their ſeveral Homes, ſtill wondring and rejoicing at what their Eyes had beheld, and their Ears had heard that Day.</p>
            <p>Thus I have related the Matter as exactly as I could have it, both from others and her ſelf. And as it may be expected, by ſome, in ſuch a Matter as this, here follow ſome <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> to her State before, and after this Event related; which, when I have inſerted, I ſhall go on with the Hiſtory, and relate briefly the Conſequences of the Event, which will exhibit further Proof of the Reality of it.</p>

Now to return to the Narrative, and to ſpeak particularly of the Conſequences of this Event, from the Cloſe of that Day, on which it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo forward to this Day—I have given Account of her walking alone, and with evident Tokens of new Strength, in the Preſence of many Witneſſes, on that Day of her Deliverance. So ſhe continued able to walk all the Evening after, went to her Bed, ſtood up and undreſt her ſelf, which ſhe had not done before in 16 Years. She lay down to reſt, believing in God, and giving thanks for the Wonders he had done, but, thro' the abundance of Thought, ſlept but little that Night. Sometime in the Night felt ſuch Return of her pains, as gave her to think, God was about to try her; And moreover it was Suggeſted to her, <q>Tho' you have had Strength to walk, yet it will be ſoon taken away, and how will you bear that?</q> But this Temptation was preſently over, as ſhe felt her Will bowed to the Will of God, and it ſeemed to her, as if ſhe was made willing to go back again to Priſon, if it was the Pleaſure of the Lord, that ſhe ſhould; and the whole Term of her being there, now ſeemed ſhort to her from the ſweet Review ſhe had of God's preſence with her there. In the Morning her Pains continued, but her Faith tho' tried, ſailed not. As ſoon as the Light favoured her, ſhe reach'd for her Bible, and began to read, and found new Strength by the Word. Tho' it had been darted into her Mind, "You won't be able to riſe and walk." She found preſent Relief by that Word.—<hi>All Things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him that believeth.</hi> And reading the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of three Miracles which Chriſt wrought, ſhe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:005228_0038_1016E91940E946C0"/>was ſtill more encouraged and ſtrengthened in her Faith—Her Pains abated, and it ſeem'd, as if ſhe was bid to ariſe. She roſe up, and dreſt herſelf, without Help, which ſhe had not done before in all the Time of her Weakneſs. When dreſſing her ſelf, it came into her Mind to view and feel of her Ancles, which ſhe found to her Admiration and Thankfulneſs, were cloſed and firm, where before they were ſeparate and looſe. As on the other Day, when ſhe was, as it were, taken by the Hand and lifted up, ſhe perceived that immediately her Feet and Ancle-Bones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Strength: So now, ſhe ſaw, that they were cloſed up; as they never had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all her Impotency. And ſo, ſhe had an Evidence of her Healing, from <hi>Sight,</hi> as well as <hi>Senſe.</hi> She dreſt, and walked, praiſing God. After having walked about the Houſe a while, ſhe went abroad, and over to her Brother's Houſe, about twelve Rods. This was all new Exerciſe, to her; and opened to her new Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and let in new Reflections. And the Diſcovery and Senſe of God in her late De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, ſeem'd to reflect a new Light upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing ſhe ſaw and met with. She could turn her-Eyes no Way, but the World about her, ſeem'd full of the Evidence of a God and Providence, which all ſerv'd to keep her Soul at Work, and in its Exerciſe of Love and Duty to God.</p>
            <p>On this Day (viz.) the Day after her Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, Mr. <hi>Newel</hi> (who was then preaching at <hi>Plainfield</hi>) preached a Sermon at her Father's Houſe, from thoſe Words, in Joh. 5.14. <hi>Afterwards Jeſus
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005228_0039_1016E91BF74769B8"/>findeth him in the Temple, and ſaid unto him, Behold, Thou art made whole: Sin no more, leſt a worſt Thing come unto thee.</hi> Which proved a ſeaſonable Word unto her, as thereby ſhe was taught the Danger, which thoſe are yet in of ſinning, who have been the Subjects of great Deliverances, and ſo was led to ſee her Danger of Pride, Sloth, Unthankfulneſs &amp;c. And as ſhe had diſcovered a great Deſire to be, and even a Perſwaſion that ſhe ſhould be in the Houſe of God the next Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; ſo in hearing this Sermon ſhe was much confirmed therein. And accordingly on the very Sabbath following (though cloudy and rainy, and before ſhe had been uſed to the Air much) ſhe was enabled to ride to the Houſe of the Lord, which was near three Miles; and had not been upon an Horſe, in ſixteen Years before. As ſhe was paſſing thereto, it was ſuggeſted to her, <q>You are got from your Father's Houſe, and going where you know not, and it may be will never return.</q> Upon which, ſhe had a Thought of being carried back directly; but the Temptation was repelled with that Word, <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Sion, which cannot be moved.</hi> And (as ſhe expreſt it) it ſeem'd to her, as though the Lord, by a ſtrong Hand, brought her to his Sanctuary, where ſhe was enabled to attend on the publick Worſhip all the Day, without Pain, or Wearineſs, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Cold.—On the firſt Day of June, Mr. <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Preſton</hi> preached a publick Lecture there from Acts 3.6—10.— <hi>And immediately his Feet and Ancle-Bones received Strength, and he leaping up, ſtood and walked, and entred with them into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005228_0040_1016E91FC0F87960"/>walking and leaping and praiſing God, and all the People ſaw him walking and praiſing God.</hi> Which were ſo true of her, that, on that Day ſhe entred with them into the Temple walking, &amp;c. and all the People ſaw it. — On the 14th of <hi>June,</hi> another Sermon was had there, from <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. And ſhe attended then, and walked from the Meeting-Houſe, to a private one, many Rods. She has been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to walk ever ſince, and generally has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the publick Worſhip on Sabbath-Days from the firſt, and begins to travel abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Towns. The laſt Week ſhe rode to <hi>Norwich,</hi> which is 15 Miles; and was at the publick Worſhip and Communion with us the laſt Sabbath; and walked both to, and from the Houſe of God, Morning and Evening. — Thus evident is her Reſtoration, and increaſing Strength and Health alſo. For, never did ſhe, in all her former Revivals, recover Health, nor ever could ſhe take Food and Sleep for that Purpoſe; as now, ſince this laſt Deliverance. And for this Reaſon has the <hi>Narrative</hi> been the more readily delayed unto this Time; that <hi>Days</hi> might give the <hi>ſtronger Proof</hi> of what was ſo ſudden and ſurprizing. Thus it conſtantly appears, to have been no <hi>Frenzy</hi> of her's, that ſhe firſt walked; but a <hi>Fact,</hi> and Work of the Lord; for ſhe has done ſo, many Months, and is as like to do ſo ſtill, as any other Perſon.</p>
            <p>And a further Teſtimony for God, is yet exhibited, in her moral Conduct. She walketh <hi>praiſing GOD</hi> wherever ſhe goes. It ſeems, as if her Soul was in Health, and proſpered. She
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005228_0041_1016E9214A38C688"/>appears to have an abiding Senſe of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Soul, and to walk up and down in the Light of God's Countenance; rejoicing in God and Jeſus Chriſt, as her All. But, with great Self-Diffidence and cautionary Fear, leſt ſhe ſhould ſome Way or other diſhonour God, and be a Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Block to Men. And ſo I ſhall cloſe up the Narrative, with giving the Reader a <hi>Specimen</hi> of her daily Reflections, and Breathings of Soul, in her own Language—</p>
            <p>
               <q>Scarce one Day now, do I look abroad, but the <hi>Works of Creation</hi> ſhew me God, and lead me to him: And yet dare not ſay that I live one Minute as I ought—I want to ſee more of the <hi>Dealings of God</hi> with me, that I might live more to him— Oh how ſhould I live! entirely devoted to God, as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant End and All—If I could praiſe God, it ſeems that I ſhould be content in any Condition, that he would have me in— Oh what a Life ſhould I live? Never a Soul ſo indebted to God as I am. It was the loweſt Stoop that ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> made, when he look'd <hi>upon me</hi>— When I think how he has paſſed by Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and has had Mercy on me, the Vileſt of all; how ſurprizing? 'Tis only becauſe he will have Mercy on whom he will have Mercy— And yet how unthankful am I! My Heart is ſurely worſe than others. O my Ingratitude! How good is God, and how holy! —It ſeems that I never did any Thing —And without Chriſt I can do nothing—I long that Chriſt may be all; and what is all elſe compared with him! Oh that I may
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005228_0042_1016E92459485DC8"/>live wholly on him, and to God by him!— But I am afraid to ſpeak, leſt it would be to ſhew my ſelf: and yet I know that if others have any Thing to boaſt of, I've nothing, whereof to glory. O that God would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, and glorify himſelf!</q>—Such Kind of Reflections and Breathings go into her daily Converſation. And was it the Obſervation that Chriſt made of his Diſciples? <hi>I am glorified in them.</hi> May this be eminently true of her; and let all that has been here ſaid, be ſo received, that Chriſt may be glorified in and by her. Yea, when, <hi>CHRIST comes to be glorified in his Saints,</hi> may He be <hi>admired in her, as in all them that believe.</hi>
