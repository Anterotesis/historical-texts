            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE reaſon of my preſuming to addreſs you on the ſubject of the culture of Wool, is, becauſe it is a matter on which the gradual abolition of our National Debt depend, i. e. upon induſtry and population of America, as the ſame is held forth in the following obſervations. That this is the real fact, I ſhall now undertake to prove: ſo always, and provided, That you will patronize the following ſcheme— What ſay you, Gentlemen, to this matter?—Now this great principle of patriotiſm, I prove thus:</p>
            <p>Permit me, gentlemen, in paſſing, juſt to obſerve, that here, and no where elſe, lies all the <hi>life</hi> of our true policy —To cloath and feed ourſelves, and our neighbouring na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I take this as a <hi>poſtulatum</hi> that will without difficulty be granted.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall, gentlemen, open myſelf fully on that important ſubject; not for the ſake of telling you a long ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (which I know the genuine patriots, are not particularly fond of) but for the ſake of the weighty inſtruction that I flatter myſelf, will neceſſarily reſult from our Shepherd's ſcheme. It ſhall not be longer if I can help it, than ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a matter requires. The American Shepherd addreſſes us in this manner: He ſays, the reaſons for my preferring this Shepherd's ſcheme, are: <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is becauſe I want to ſee a plan for improving the preſent condition of the poor white people. <hi>Next,</hi> It is becauſe I wiſh to be beneficial to my country. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is becauſe I wiſh to throw my mite into the beſt public treaſury, and therein improve it.</p>
            <p>Come—help me raiſe the ever memorable Shepherd's Hall, and the profit thereof will be commenſurable to your
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:047213_0004_1022B82B4D742338"/>
public ſpirit: yes, and will be your exceeding great reward. I labour not for myſelf only, but for all them that patronize the ſaid ſcheme.</p>
            <p>He ſays, too, the poſition by me maintained is, that this ſcheme is more excellent, than the Yankie's Tontine bank; which is as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a ſcheme to increaſe the declining number of ſheep in America, and make wool our ſtaple commodity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſhort of the matter is this: Let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a number of well diſpoſed perſons appropriate a <hi>ſmall ſum</hi> of money each to the culture of wool.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Again, let it be ſuppoſed, that 6000 ſheep may be paſtured three miles round the Shepherd's Hall. Now here ariſes a neceſſary query to thoſe well diſpoſed perſons, viz. What will three years produce of the ſaid paſture be?</p>
            <p>That the culture of wool will produce an incredible trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury may be ſeen from the Engliſh manufactures. This ſcheme properly executed will make the American exports exceed her imports, which is the higheſt degree of our American patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm. Q. E. D.</p>
            <p>Again, let it be ſuppoſed, that government will be propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to the ſaid Shepherd's company, and give them a tract of land, &amp;c. And that government will lend them a ſum of money at 4 per cent. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe the increaſe of the people will by induſtry reimburſe the coſts, and populate or furniſh a barren part of our land with the beſt ſort of people. Three things are here very remarkable: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the ſtate will thereby obtain 4 per cent. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That government will thereby obtain a number of uſeful people. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That government will thereby thus obtain the mechanic arts, and that this plan <hi>properly executed</hi> will employ a number of emigrants, viz. Shepherds, Ploughmen, and many other artificers, &amp;c. in all an induſtrious and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent city.</p>

               <hi>viz.</hi>—That no Engliſh <hi>ram</hi> ſhould be conveigled to North America; a plain proof this, that we may make wool a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commodity, and out-vie England: juſt in proportion to the differential quantity of the land in England, and the quantity of land in the United States of America. All that I would be underſtood to imply, is, that when the number of our ſheep increaſe proportionable to the number of our acres of land; then we ſhall actually and <hi>de facto</hi> out-vie Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and thereby make ourſelves independent, or not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon England, &amp;c. or not depend upon manufactories. It is plain, therefore, that our imports of woollen drapery will there by decreaſe, and our exportation of woollen drape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will thereby increaſe.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid, reſpective to the nature of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſcheme implies its importance. But the way to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it will more fully appear in conſidering the formation of the articles of the company of the American Shepherds.</p>
            <p>☞ N. B.

When once a company can be eſtabliſhed, with a fund ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to begin, there is no doubt but that it will have 6000 ſheep in every county in each ſtate: yes, 6000 ſheep in every American townſhip.</p>
            <p>To conſtitute the capital of the ſaid company, ſubſcriptions for ſhares therein, at one Spaniſh dollar each, payable after the articles of the ſaid company are made, and when a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number of perſons have ſubſcribed, they will have the right to form the articles of the conſtitution of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the American Shepherds.</p>

            <p>Note 1. Americans! This—all this—is pre-meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt you, <hi>viz.</hi> War and ruin, by the perfidious court of London. It is plain, therefore, that we ought to prohibit her merchandize.</p>
            <p>Note 2. Our preſent mercantile ſyſtem is—that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the culture of European wool; if ſo, then we are <hi>not yet</hi> independent! Is this common ſenſe? Is this a proof of our being independent? Is this the way to pay our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal debt? Is this a prudent ſcheme? Whoever thinks ſo, muſt be little acquainted with independency, and domeſtic manufactures.</p>
            <p>Let it be ſuppoſed, that the murrain among the European ſheep, and the peſtilence, or an epidemical fever among the European people occaſion the culture and manufactures of European wool to fail; if ſo, then the indolent Americans ſhall look to the culture of American wool, and ſee that they are all naked, the rich and the poor, and are not aſhamed.
<q>This being <hi>ſub judice</hi> it is only prophetic; and what is prophecy but a narrative preceding the fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Note 3. Being an extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated the 10th of November 1791.—
<q>We ſhould think that no cotton can be carried home from Bombay this year, and even the year following. They have had about Surat and thoſe places a moſt dreadful famine, which occaſioned an unheard of mortality among the natives. When this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity will end, is not known yet: and thoſe of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants who ſerve it, will firſt think of cultivating rice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they meddle with cotten.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You cannot expect a ſingle pound of cotten from this country; whatever quantity we have here, will all go to China.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Claypoole's Daily Advertiſer, dated Auguſt 9, 1792.</note>—I muſt add, that this extract is an apology for the preceding letter, and for the miſcellaneous notes add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it.</p>
            <p>Note 4. Argument 1. It is argued, That if our Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can hat-makers buy imported, foreign Wool, and that the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047213_0007_1022B83458B2AD78"/>
directors of our National Manufactory give a generous price for American Wool; then it is high time to make Wool our ſtaple commodity:</p>
            <p>But the <hi>firſt</hi> is true; therefore alſo the <hi>laſt.</hi>
