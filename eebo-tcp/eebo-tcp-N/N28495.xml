            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE excellent perſon who is the ſubject of our text, was one who truly adorned his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his eminent ſervices. Being high-prieſt of the Jews, it was doubtleſs under his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that young JOASH was concealed in the temple ſix years, when ATHALIAH cut off all the reſt of the ſeed royal. It was through his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037963_0003_10102DEDE277DA40"/>
inſtrumentality that Judah was recovered from the tyranny and idolatry of <hi>"that wicked woman,"</hi> and the prince ſet upon the throne of his anceſtors. He continued through life to be the chief counſellor and prime miniſter of the king, <hi>"who did that which was right in the ſight of the LORD all the days of</hi> JEHOIADA <hi>the prieſt".</hi> And it was he who aided his ſovereign in repairing the houſe of GOD, and reſtoring the temple worſhip. Thus we ſee why it is ſaid of him, that "HE DID GOOD IN ISRAEL."</p>
            <p>FOR this he obtained at his death an honor which was refuſed to JOASH himſelf. For after the death of the high-prieſt, this prince turned aſide to idolatry, and ſlew the ſons of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; for which he was ſlain by his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and buried in the city of David, but <hi>"not in the ſepulchres of the kings."</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as when JEHOIADA died, old and full of days, <hi>"they buried him in the city of David, among the kings;"</hi> treating him with a reſpect ſimilar to that which was conferred on good HEZEKIAH, who, when he ſlept with his fathers, was buried <hi>"in the chief of the ſepulchres of the ſons of</hi> DAVID; <hi>and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem did him honor at his death."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037963_0004_10102DF04F5A38B8"/>HENCE it appears to be agreeable to the will of GOD, that his diſtinguiſhed ſervants, whom he has been pleaſed to employ in doing much good, ſhould be honored at their death, by having ſome ſuitable reſpect paid to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>AFTER I have ſhewn what reſpect is to be paid to the memory of eminent men; and the ground on which they are to be honored at their death; I ſhall direct your attention particularly to the occaſion on which we are at preſent convened.</p>
            <p>WE are, no doubt, to ſhew reſpect to the memory of the excellent of the earth, by mourning for them, after the example of JACOB's ſons mourning for their father—of Judah and Jeruſalem mourning for JOSIAH, and other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſame kind. This mourning, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is not to be confined to inward and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret grief; it is fit that this grief be expreſſed by ſome external tokens, ſuch as viſible badges of mourning, or funeral elegies; and that the remembrance of the perſon be perpetuated by ſome kind of records, or ſepulchral monuments. This is the way in which we manifeſt our ſorrow
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037963_0005_10102DF1F9B5DD60"/>
and reſpect for our private friends or relatives deceaſed: JACOB erected a pillar for his RACHEL, called <hi>"The pillar of Rachel's grave;"</hi> and DAVID bewailed his ABSALOM, ſaying, <hi>"O my ſon Abſalom! my ſon, my ſon Abſalom! Would GOD I had died for thee, O Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon!"</hi> And it is ſuitable, that in ſome ſuch way we expreſs our ſorrow, and manifeſt our eſteem for the faithful friends and benefactors of our country. Thus did DAVID and his people at the death of ABNER: They rent their clothes, girded themſelves with ſackcloth, and mourned before him. <hi>"The king followed the bier; he lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept."</hi> Undoubtedly, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſigns of mourning were not wanting at the threſhing-floor of Atad, where JOSEPH and his company <hi>"mourned for</hi> JACOB <hi>ſeven days, with a great and very ſore lamentation,"</hi> ſo that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites took notice of it, and ſaid, <hi>"This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians."</hi> On the death of SAUL and JONATHAN, DAVID wrote a very pathetic funeral elegy, which ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſecond book of Samuel; and in the Chronicles we are told, that <hi>"All Judah and Jeruſalem mourned for</hi> JOSIAH; that JERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIAH <hi>lamented for him; and that the ſinging men,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037963_0006_10102DF38B91EA00"/>
and the ſinging women ſpake of</hi> JOSIAH <hi>in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Iſrael; and behold they are written in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations."</hi> Thus it appears, not only that it is agreeable to the will of GOD, that his eminent ſervants ſhould be honored at their death; but likewiſe what kind of honor or reſpect is to be paid to their memory.</p>
            <p>LET us, in the next place, attend to the ground on which this honour is to be conferred on ſuch perſonages. It is becauſe they are the ſervants of the great GOD, whom he has ſignalized by placing them in high ſtations, and employing them in important ſervices to the church, or to the ſtate. We are expreſsly told, that the reaſon why JEHOIADA had the honor of being buried among the kings was, <hi>"becauſe he had done good in Iſrael, both towards GOD, and towards his houſe."</hi> When we pay reſpect to great men for their own ſakes only, we rob GOD of his honor, and become guilty of a kind of idolatry. But when we regard them as the gifts of Heaven— as men whom GOD has qualified and raiſed up for eminent ſervice, and beſtowed on us as bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings from his hand; the honor conferred on them, in this view, is conſecrated to GOD, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037963_0007_10102DF7E5EDE278"/>
ultimately redounds to his glory. Under this impreſſion, we may give ſcope to our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and freely extol the virtues, and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the praiſes of the men <hi>"whom the KING of kings hath delighted to honour."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT now calls your attention, as the ſpecial buſineſs of the day, is the tribute of reſpect that is due to the memory of our departed friend, and the friend of our country, the renowned WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. It is, perhaps, beyond my power to inform this aſſembly on the ſubject, or to increaſe its eſteem for the memory of this moſt excellent man. His character and his deeds are well known to all who are capable of knowing them. Yet in honor of the Father of our country, it is ſuitable, on this occaſion, to expreſs the ſenſe which we entertain of the worth of this ineſtimable gift of Heaven, with which GOD has favored us ſo long, and which in the ſovereign and wiſe diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his providence, he has been pleaſed to recall.</p>
            <p>WHETHER we conſider this illuſtrious perſon as a warrior or a ſtateſman, we cannot but admire the goodneſs of GOD in enduing him with tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſo ſuitable to his ſtation. His wiſdom and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037963_0008_10102DFC032148E8"/>
prudence, his magnanimity, perſeverance and fidelity, cannot fail to arreſt our attention. In him we beheld greatneſs without pride, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility without meanneſs. In him firmneſs and reſolution were blended with gentleneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Never was a Commander more loved by his ſoldiers, or more revered by his very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies. Never did a man more fully poſſeſs the confidence of his fellow citizens, nor was ever one more highly eſteemed both by his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and by foreign nations.</p>
            <p>A MAN thus qualified, was a fit inſtrument in the hand of the GOD of armies and the Sovereign of the world, to be employed in accompliſhing great and valuable purpoſes. What he has achieved, as well in the chair of ſtate, as in the high places of the field, America has witneſſed, and the world has been informed.</p>
            <p>WHEN we were reduced to the neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending our lives, our liberty and our property, againſt one of the moſt powerful and warlike nations of Europe—when we had neither fleets nor diſciplined armies—when our troops were without arms, ammunition or clothing—WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037963_0009_1010210519257448"/>
at the call of his country, ſtepped forth and girded on the ſword. He inſpired our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with confidence—taught them the uſe of arms, and led them to conqueſt. His ſkill in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging an inferior force againſt ſuperior num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; his prudence in avoiding a general action without a proſpect of ſucceſs; and his prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſeizing the favorable moment of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous combat, will be admired as long as hiſtory ſhall record the deeds of warriors.</p>
            <p>THE effects of his military ſkill and proweſs were the ſalvation of our country, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and independence of the American States.</p>
            <p>AT the cloſe of the war he laid down the ſword, reſigned his commiſſion, and retired to the peaceful ſhades of Mount Vernon; where he hoped to end his days in quiet repoſe, free from the burden of public care. But, by the unanimous voice of his fellow citizens, he was yet twice called to the PRESIDENCY of the UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED STATES, and twice he obeyed the ſummons. The high approbation with which he executed this office, as well as the conſpicuous part which he acted in the celebrated Congreſs that conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to independence, and in the Convention
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037963_0010_10102E00A9F7AED0"/>
which framed our excellent conſtitution, are fully atteſted. None had it in his power to do ſo much towards reconciling the jarring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and ſentiments of the different ſtates, and ſtilling their political ſtorms, as the man who not only poſſeſſed, but was univerſally eſteemed to poſſeſs, the higheſt degree of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and integrity, added to the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate prudence. To his management, therefore, in war and in peace, under the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a gracious Providence, it is in a great meaſure to be attributed, that we this day ſit with ſo much tranquillity, each under his vine and under his fig-tree, in the enjoyment of both civil and religious liberty.</p>
            <p>THE bleſſings, therefore, which GOD has conferred upon us, by means of this great and good man, are not merely of a civil nature; but, as it was ſaid of JEHOIADA, ſo it may be ſaid of WASHINGTON, that <hi>"He did good—both towards GOD, and towards his houſe."</hi> The frame of our civil government, and the liberty which under it we enjoy, which have been ſo much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by him, are circumſtances highly favorable to the intereſt of religion.—A government ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſimilar to ours, ſeems to be eſſential to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037963_0011_10102E05096209E0"/>
GLORIOUS REIGN OF the MESSIAH, which we are looking for with earneſt expectation. We are aſſured from the prophecies of the old and new teſtament, that the time is coming, <hi>when the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the LORD; when they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all GOD's holy mountain; when his watchmen, his miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervants, ſhall ſee eye to eye, and lift up the voice and ſing together; and when there ſhall be one fold, and one</hi> SHEPHERD. Now, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſuch increaſe of divine knowledge, ſuch perfect peace, and ſuch concert and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in religion can ever take place, ſo long as civil governments, whether Chriſtian, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, Mahometan or Pagan, take upon them to preſcribe what religion people ſhall profeſs, and compel them to worſhip GOD, or their pretended gods, according to their ſeveral dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates? Certainly it is not. So certain is it then, that all religious eſtabliſhments by civil author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and whatever elſe may hinder men from judging for themſelves in matters of religion, ſhall be removed out of the way, and every man be permitted to worſhip GOD agreeably to the dictates of his own conſcience, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the Holy Scriptures, and be protected in his religious as well as in his civil rights.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037963_0012_101021069E5D0E58"/>
Such is the ſtate of things under our happy gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; and ſuch muſt be the ſtate of all the nations of the earth, before the <hi>univerſal reign of the</hi> REDEEMER can take place. From ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture prophecies, and from events by which they have been fulfilled, and by which they are dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilling before our eyes, we have reaſon to believe, that this long expected period is not very far diſtant. We may, therefore, look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and exult in the proſpect of the time when <hi>"the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdoms of our LORD and of his CHRIST,"</hi> and when JESUS ſhall reign triumphantly, <hi>"from ſea to ſea, and from the river to the ends of the earth."</hi> And it muſt afford us no ſmall degree of pleaſure to reflect, that ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is made in our happy country for this glorious event, by the eſtabliſhment of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious liberties.</p>
            <p>NOW as GOD has honored our illuſtrious CHIEF, by employing him ſo ſignally in accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this important work; let us honor him this day, by rendering unfeigned thanks to the AUTHOR of all our bleſſings, for raiſing up among us ſo diſtinguiſhed a perſonage, and making him the inſtrument of ſuch ineſtimable benefits.

This is the manner of honoring him which beſt becomes us as Chriſtians, and beſt accords with the character of the deceaſed; who in both his public and private conduct, always manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deep ſenſe of the ſuperintendence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, and of his conſtant dependence on the Great Diſpoſer of all events.</p>
            <p>AND while we deplore his removal from us, let us learn by his example to acquieſce in the wiſe diſpoſals of Heaven, adopting the language of this excellent man, when, viewing from the oppoſite bank of the Hudſon the capture of Fort Waſhington, he lifted his hands and eyes towards heaven, and ſaid, "FATHER, <hi>thy will be done."</hi> Piety was not the leaſt diſtinguiſhing trait in this great man's character. This it was that rendered him truly illuſtrious, and gave him a decided pre-eminence above all the great men of the earth in whom this quality was wanting.</p>
            <p>AND as we can no way honor him more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than by imitating his pious example; ſo there is no way by which we have ſo fair a proſpect of ſecuring to ourſelves the ineſtimable bleſſings which he has been the inſtrument of procuring.

It is a great error to ſuppoſe, that the juſtice of our cauſe will always enſure ſucceſs, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of our adverſaries defeat their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For if by our crimes we forfeit our rights and privileges, we may be deprived of them by being ſuffered to fall under the power of the moſt unrighteous enemies. It is only while we humbly <hi>"walk with GOD,"</hi> and <hi>"put our truſt under the ſhadow of his wings,"</hi> that we may look for his gracious protection. Then indeed, we may confidently hope, that he will, from time to time, raiſe up to us ſuch Counſellors, and ſuch Defenders as our exigencies may require. He who could furniſh America with a WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, can never be at a loſs for ſervants qualified to execute his beneficent purpoſes towards them who place their confidence in him. On his Almighty arm be all our depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and for every deliverance, and for every ſalvation which we may experience, to him be all the glory. AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, AMEN.</p>
