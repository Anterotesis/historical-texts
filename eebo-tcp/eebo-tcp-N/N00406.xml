            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Introduction.</head>
            <p>IT is reported of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that great <hi>Atlas</hi> of the <hi>Papal</hi> Interest, that after his Death, there was a sharp Contest in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> whether his books should not be called in &amp; burnt, as having in them as much exposed the cause by his over liberal Concessions, as supported it by his cunning Sophisms. And we are told that the Papists have hanged <hi>Erasmus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Hell, because he profest himself a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and yet wrote too much like a <hi>Protestant.</hi> The <hi>Hands were</hi> Esau'<hi>s, but the</hi> Voice <hi>Jacob's.</hi> And what Reason <hi>G. K.</hi> hath to expect the like treat at the hands of his brethren the <hi>Quakers,</hi> will be obvious to any that shall read his late pernicious <hi>Pamphlet</hi> pretended to be emitted for the Discovery of the false Doctrines of some particular sorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Religion, but indeed to Bid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the True Religion, in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal fundamental Articles of it, as they have been in all Ages and places acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000502_0011_0FA6A6DE3A6D8CD0"/>
lodged by the Church of Christ; which he hath clothed <hi>in a rough Garment to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive withal.</hi> For however he expresseth a right spirit of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> in his nonsense, fallacious way of declaring himself, and bitter Reviling of the Orthodox, which is enough to proclaim him one of that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; yet might any Credit be given to his words, and the commonly received Sense put upon his Expressions, it is apparent that he hath mightily betrayed the Cause he undertook to patronize, and (setting aside his <hi>Billings gate</hi>-Rhetorick, a gift sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome separable from these men) hath said more against <hi>their</hi> received Principles (if they ever had any) than against <hi>ours:</hi> For if he speak the Judgement of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, it is certain that <hi>G. F.</hi> and other Rabbi's of that Sect were mistaken, for they speak quite another thing; except he will tell us, we poor Ignorants understand not the Language of their spirit, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards neither <hi>Grammer</hi> nor <hi>Logick;</hi> and this is the <hi>Hercules's</hi> Club, where-with they are wont to knock all our Reasons in the head, and brain them at once.</p>
            <p>However, his Design is easily discerned. The <hi>Devil</hi> himself, that spirit of Delusion, knowing that some principles are rivetted
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000502_0012_0FA6A6E1188972C8"/>
in men's Minds, will nourish them (tho' he be the <hi>Father of Lies</hi>) that he may graft his <hi>Falsehoods</hi> upon the stock of them: and why should not his <hi>Messengers</hi> do the like in Imitation? See 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15. He hopes by some large Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to gain Credit with the Simple, and perswade them to say as they, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 9. for whose sake only have we undertaken him, and not for any need of Refuting his Errors, which have been so often Cashier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there being no <hi>New-Revelation</hi> in them, but what has been the Vomit of ancient <hi>Hereticks</hi> licked up by him, and again dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged.</p>

            <p>In his Title he talks high and looks big, and would hold the world in hand that he had at once routed, broken &amp; disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the Orthodox Churches in Christendome, and proved that they had neither <hi>Doctrine, Ministry, Worship, Constitution, Government, Sacraments,</hi> nor <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> but what are Surreptitious, and not belonging to the true Church of Christ: and truly if men would be dared out of their Religion, he hath bid as fair for it as any we know, but how farr they fall

When we read his <hi>Inscription, Benhad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He had so much <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> to crowd into the Title, that he is fain to borrow a Room in the left-hand page, to put in a few Scripture Citations, maliciously abused and misapplied, which, whether they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> let the Day declare: we are not to stand or fall at the menacing Praedictions of an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He directs his Epistle to us, giving his word for it (so far as it will go) that the book was written in good will to us; and if to <hi>slander</hi> and <hi>calumniate</hi> with bitterest Invectives, may pass for a Demonstration, he hath proved his Love to be <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:</hi> any truly it is as much as we expect from one of his humour.</p>

There is little observable here, but what will be met with, in the Preatise, and <hi>once</hi> to Answer such paltry stuffe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if not to much: It may therefore be passed over with two or three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks.</p>
            <p>He calls us to <hi>turn our minds to the Light of Christ within us,</hi> for our better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; we have done it as well as we can, &amp; it tells us, That his Assertions are bold, presumptuous, and Haeretical.</p>
            <p>He tells us, It is the <hi>same spirit that gives to all Readers a right under standing of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> but if so, why then have not all the same understanding of it, but Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Can it be the Spirit of God, who is alwaies the same?</p>
            <p>He bids us to <hi>Believe in Christ, and joyn our minds to His divine Illumination, and He will anoint the eyes of our Understandings, &amp;. we shall have our eyes open to see</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q. d.</hi> If we will see of <hi>our selves,</hi> then He will give us Ability to see: this may be no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in a Quakers Logick.</p>
            <p>We have him also in a fit of <hi>Charity,</hi> (and we are beholden to him, for we shall not a alwaies find him in so good a mood) granting that <hi>some of us may be in some sense of the true Church:</hi> which how it should

be when we have neither <hi>Doctrine, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, Worship,</hi> &amp;c. of a true Church among us, let <hi>him</hi> see to <hi>that:</hi> But we have him afterwards, putting on his Spectacles., and then he retracts his Charity with a witness.</p>
            <p>We have him also nibling at the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of <hi>Perseverance,</hi> which we shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find him beating down with Axes and Mauls, and there shall take him to task. Only It is worth the while to observe, what a notable (and no doubt inspired) Doctrine he recommended to us, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

            <p>But let us see how he proves it; and here we have a Reason for it, and then a tedious Induction of diverse Instances, and they make it as plain as can be, except you be in the Darkness.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reason is <hi>Because</hi> (and if every thing that men put <hi>Because</hi> to, may stand for a Reason, <hi>his</hi> is a good one) <hi>there are many things wherein God doth reveal of His Counsel to His Children, which are not in the Scripture, either expresly or consequentially, altogether, Necessary for their peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi> i. e.

               </gap> his Light to us, to teach us how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this grace and comfort, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of the Scriptures to that end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us see how far his Instances will help him; he gives us <hi>Five,</hi> though <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>purpose</hi> had bin worth <hi>five hundred</hi> such as these.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first respects a man's <hi>Assurance of his present state of Grace, in his inward Calling;</hi> as he entitles it. <hi>The knowledge whereof,</hi> he saith, <hi>is a part of God's Counsil; i. e.</hi> it is God's will, and his duty that he be acquainted with it. That it is a duty we never denied; but that it is <hi>by</hi> the Scripture that we <hi>know</hi> it to be a duty, we believe, see 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. But then, the <hi>Assurance it self cannot be infallibly gained by Scripture or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Consequence, but only by the Spirit of God:</hi> and for this he cites <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. very unhappily for himself, if he had thought of it; for by this very Citation, he gives us another point; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that it is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000502_0022_0FA6A6EB79F24250"/>
by the Scripture that we come to <hi>know</hi> that we must have our assistance from the Spirit alone; nay more, he grants that the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives the infallible marks of such an estate; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Why only this? the Work of the Spirit is neither Scripture nor Scripture-Consequence; and who knew not that as well as he? But if the Scriptures be the Instrument which the Spirit useth to work this Assurance in us by his instance is impertinent. We as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and believe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Spirit of God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or Efficient of all Grace in the hearts of Believers; and therefore is called <hi>The Spirit of Grace.</hi> 2. That he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000502_0023_0FA6A6EC39B3A310"/>
we had not known to be such; and if the Spirit should apply any other evidence but what is according to Scripture, by <hi>G. K.'s</hi> own Doctrine, <hi>we are not bound to believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The next instance refers to an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Call to the Ministry;</hi> and runs upon the same foolish notion with the former, and needs no further Answer: only let it be here laid by in store, That he pretends to owne such a distinct Office in the Church, which the Practice of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers makes a Gift Common to all they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be of the true Church, both men and women,</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his third Instance he begs a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which will never be Granted him, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that men are to tarry for an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Call</hi> to <hi>pray or perform any religious Duty;</hi> which being Voluntary on the Spirit's part, he concludes cannot be <hi>known simply by the Scriptures.</hi> But let it be here remarked,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Moral Duty depends on the Precept, and not on inward Motions: Prayer (which he refers to in particular) is to be <hi>without ceasing,</hi> 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 19. i. e. every day, and on all occasions. 2. That the Motion to do any thing, which is at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000502_0024_0FA6A6ECF991E658"/>
time upon us, is to be tryed by the Scriptures, whether it be of God, for we are bidden to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> and are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to the Law and Testimony</hi> as our Rule, and if it be not <hi>there</hi> Revealed, <hi>G. K.</hi> tells us <hi>we need not believe it.</hi> 3. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to stir up the Grace that is in us; and how often have we <hi>David</hi> at this? yea, when we want the Spirit for Prayer, we are to pray for the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to his next instance referring to our Enquiring and discovering what is the mind of God in our Carriage under His Hand, and in the management of our weighty Affairs; when he hath said all he can, the Word of God, or the Scripture, is that which must ultimately resolve us, That, to know What is Duty, depends on Divine Revelation, we are Agreed: That God did sometimes reveal His Will <hi>extraordinarily</hi> to His Servants of Old, we deny not, but that the Word of God in Scripture is that which to us in Gospel Times, since the Canon was perfected, Answers all the other wayes of Revelation is an Article of our Creed, and we think we have Scripture-warrant for it, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. &amp;c. As to the Case of <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi> which he talks of, &amp; instanceth in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000502_0025_0FA6A6EDB83FAC68"/>
carriage of <hi>Abraham's</hi> servant, it is quite aliene to his purpose: for who ever assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God's providence is bound to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Scripture Rules, being supream &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary? But still in our serving of this Providence, and knowing how to use it to His glory, and particularly to know what is the mind and will of God to us in this Providence, we have no other Rule to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our selves by, but the Scriptures; and tho' the Spirit must reveal it, yet this is the thing Revealed.</p>
            <p>Where as he tells us, that <hi>Philip, Peter, and others, were extraordinarily called to such and such services,</hi> it is readily replied, that That was extraordinary, and without warrant for us ordinarily to expect the like: moreover, the things they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, were such as the Scripture satisfied them to be according to God.</p>
            <p>Finally, We deny not but that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth still put an impulse on the spirits of His people frequently, but is it self-evident, or must not the Warrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it be tryed by Scripture-Rules? Let <hi>G. K.</hi> if he can, give an instance of a Quaker that ever had such a self-evidence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordinary Call, as <hi>Philip Peter,</hi> &amp;c. had in former dayes. How impertinently
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000502_0026_0FA6A6EEDCEE20C0"/>
he quotes <hi>Fam.</hi> 4. 15. to prove his Assertion, [<hi>if the Lord will</hi>] may soon be seen. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it of a Will not to be known by the Scripture, but by the Spirit without it; whereas any man of common sense may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the sense of that Text is this; That when a man is satisfied that his design is Lawful, he is then to acknowledge that his affairs are subject to the Ruling Providence of God, who may either <hi>further</hi> or <hi>impede</hi> his Undertaking as He will; and how comes he to be satisfied in this but by the Scriptures? If Providence furthers him, he is satisfied that it was Gods Will to suffer it; if He puts a stop to it, it discovers the secret Will of God revealing it self in this particular, &amp; how to demean himself under this he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from the Word; and what is all this to their <hi>inwardly feeling a Command or Permission,</hi> which he idly talks of?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Here we are told of <hi>God's Answering the returns of the Prayers of His people;</hi> A Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism! <hi>i. e.</hi> Nonsense. And we have him at length concluding his impertinent <hi>fourth</hi> Paragraph, with Assuring us, That <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture promises applied by the Spirit are the inward Voice of God to His children:</hi> but why hath he been all this while fighting with his own shadow, if this be all he intends?</p>
            <p>

Sect. 5. Now he draws his Conclusion, <hi>Therefore the Scripture doth not contain all the Word or Words of God:</hi> whereas we thought that if he had concluded from the premises, he should have said, Therefore it <hi>doth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all these are nothing but Scripture, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expresly or consequentially. He brings in <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>The word grew &amp; multiplied</hi> to prove his Assertion; but we might ask him, whether he intends its multiplying by new Inspirations or Revelations, or by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied Efficacy? Did not he himself resolve us, that there was no new Doctrine? and thence we infer that there was no new <hi>Word,</hi> in the sence we are disputing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. What have we here? <hi>Christ</hi> &amp; <hi>His Apostles expounded the scriptures by Inspiration, &amp; yet taught no new Doctrine.</hi> Sure he forgets himself, was not the whole frame of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Dispensation a New Model? And hence there were new Institutions; see <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. Chapt. 8. 7, 8. &amp; 13. 10. for which things there was required extraordinary Inspiration; &amp; therefore to his Demand, <hi>Why may it not be so now?</hi> we answer, Because the Canon is perfected; and whereas he asserts that it is so, because <hi>some do at this day expound the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the same spirit;</hi> though it be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for if it be the Scripture it is not a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000502_0028_0FA6A6F238A261F0"/>
new thing revealed; yet we have also to charge him with a Fallacy purposely used, in the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> if taken personally, for the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> it is beside the case, if for His <hi>Gifts,</hi> or the manner of His dispensing of Himself <hi>to</hi> &amp; <hi>by</hi> His servants, we have but his word for it, and that not very well agreeing to <hi>1. Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. and if his own Rule be true, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that <hi>such mens Exposition as have no infallible spirit cannot be the word of God,</hi> he hath thrown himself as well as us, and his book is to be little regarded, being full of Mistakes, Nonsense, &amp; Lies: had he been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, he would not in his 12<hi>th Article</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, have charged that upon us which we never believed, much less professed.</p>
            <p>Sect. 2. Here we have a great stir about the word (<hi>Logos,</hi>) but indeed a meer <hi>Logo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machy,</hi> and lest he should not have senses e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to lose it in, he falls into <hi>Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies:</hi> Somebody might do well to ask him, what different fense he finds between, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, Words, Talk,</hi> &amp; <hi>Speech?</hi> But the knack is, it signifies the Scripture only in a <hi>thirteenth rare &amp; improper sense;</hi> and yet this is more than some of his friends will allow it.</p>
            <p>But let that pass. He hath two or three <hi>Queries</hi> to puzzle us withal; though he takes upon him to answer them himself.</p>

His first Quaery is, <hi>Whether the Scripture contains all the Word or Words of God?</hi> and that he denies, for the reasons already giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, which are none at all: Well, if they will not set us down, he will try what Scripture. <hi>Metaphors</hi> will do; and now we must observe that <hi>The Word is compared to the</hi> Rain <hi>&amp; Dew,</hi> De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But let us ask him (if he may be spoken to after such a profound Revelation as this) whether he allows it to be a good Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture Allusions, to apply all that is in the thing alluded <hi>to,</hi> to that which it is compared with? or is it more safe to restrain it to that particular thing for which the Comparison was made? Why then may not the Word be Resembled to the Rain &amp; Dew, for the <hi>fruitful Efficacy</hi> of it on the hearts of God's people? and to Bread, from the <hi>spiritual Nutriment</hi> it affords? wiser men than <hi>G.

            <p>As to the Word [<hi>Inspiration</hi>] it is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly understood (in Divinity) to intimate an <hi>Inward, extraordinary Discovery of the mind of God, made by the Holy Ghost in the hearts of His servants;</hi> so, 2. Tim. 3. 16. and so we difference it from those ordinary and mediate wayes in which we come to this acquaintance. [<hi>Revelation</hi>] is applicable indeed to any way in which a thing is made known to us which we knew not before: and so the word may be (as sometimes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) applied to any Discovery which is made to us of the Will of God. But this word hath also attained a particular Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation to such a Knowledge of Divine Truths, as would never have been attained by the best Improvement of natural light or reason, without the Manifestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and this is either <hi>Immediate</hi> or <hi>Mediate,</hi>

            <p>Sect. 2. And pray what do we assert, but what he seems plumply to grant here <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That the rule to try all doctrines is compleatly contained in the Scriptures:</hi> only the business is, that this must <hi>in no wise prove the ceasing of new revelations, or inspirations, or prophecying.</hi> Let it for the present suffice to say, that he who goes about to confound terms which are used for distinction, has some cheating trick to impose upon us: it hath therefore been the guise of <hi>Hereticks</hi> in all ages; but possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he will interpret himself more fully in the next.</p>

            <p>To what purpose he (p. 16.) concludes this long Section with a Comparison taken from humane sciences, which are taught only to such as have innate principles in them upon which Teachers build, we know not, if it be (as it <hi>seems</hi>) to prove that men have the seeds of all Divine Truths in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, and therefore the Revelations of God's Spirit are only the drawing out of these Principles into exercise, by the meet improvement of their Reason, and discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only that the knowledge whereof they had in them seminally before; it labours of two faults, <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Impertinency.

            <p>When he saith (p, 19.) <hi>to be taught of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as the Prophets &amp; Apostles, what is it but to be taught by Divine inward Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> It it is a meer Sophism. We consider

the Prophets and Apostles, either as such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, or as they were Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for they had this double Capacity: to say that all were or are taught as <hi>they</hi> were, in the former sense is utterly false, as has bin proved; to acknowledge them so in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sense, proves not such Revelations; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himself, was not <hi>alwaies</hi> inspired, but sometimes gave his Judgment as one <hi>illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. 1.

That <hi>Intuitive</hi> as well as <hi>Discurssive</hi> Knowledge may be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Christians in different degrees, we never questioned; but when he hath made all the splutter he can about his <hi>intuitive</hi> knowledge, he can never prove it to be any other than that inward Satisfaction which the Spirit of God affords to the minds of His people about the things that are contained in the Holy Scriptures, by the particular and personal Application of them to their hearts, and let <hi>G.

own mind, and not being as yet settled: The Question then is, <hi>What (as a</hi> Rule) <hi>is to set men down, &amp; put an end to these Debates?</hi> and let us go together as long as we can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. He seems here to bid fair for an Agreement, at least in the first sort of the Controversy, i. e. between men &amp; men, for we have only outwardly to deal one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and he assures us that <hi>the Scripture is the Touchstone by which the Doctrine is to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and then surely it must <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> or what is the Advantage of Trying? Only he spoils all by telling us. <hi>They have a greater proof,</hi>

               </abbr> 
               <hi>the inward Testimony of the Holy Ghost.</hi> We would only for the present ask him, (though that is not all we have to say to him) whether this inward Testimony be greater (<hi>as a rule</hi>) to judge another by, &amp; set him down? and this because his words import that we are to judge by the Scripture whether the Testimony be from the Spirit or no; for in what other way can the <hi>Spirit of the Prophets be subject to the Prophets?</hi> else when a Quaker comes to tell us he hath a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> and this is a Testimony above the Scriptures, it would be <hi>impudence</hi> in <hi>us</hi> to <hi>search</hi> the Scripture, if the thing <hi>revealed</hi> be so or <hi>no.</hi>

no Rule, or an inferior one? how absurd!</p>
            <p>Sect. 3. Here also he begins fair, and would make us believe he is good natur'd, for he gives <hi>the Scripture a preference to all other Writings,</hi> and for that reason allows it to be <hi>a sufficient</hi> outward <hi>Standard;</hi> and one would think <hi>that</hi> were enough to try Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies between men and men, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them, though his Reason is but awk; <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Because <hi>Scripture-Writers had greater Measures of Wisdome</hi> &amp;c. so that he allows them a gradual difference of Revelation, and not specifical, which may be judged of by what hath been already said, and what is it to us <hi>how</hi> or in what measures God revealed Himself extraordinarily to His Prophets, who pretend to no such Revelation at all? It sufficeth, that the lowest degrees of these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations were infallible, and therefore one Scripture is not less so than another: Nor shall we trouble our selves to prevesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his <hi>Rabbinical Fopperies</hi> about the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of Revelation, by which (no doubt he hath raised his credit much with the poor blind Quakers; whereas indeed, if a man had studied to make himself a <hi>Fool in print,</hi> he could not easily have done it more effectually; and though we grant, That <hi>God revealeth Himself gradually to His servants,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000502_0047_0FA6A704F915EC10"/>
and to</hi> some <hi>more than to others;</hi> yet his Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 3. proves not what he brings it for; it intends not that the Fathers did not know the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (we find the Contrary, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 14. 26. 24. 27. 20.) but that He did in His providence rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie Himself by the name of <hi>Almighty,</hi> in Protecting and defending of the Patriarchs, but now He would most eminently display that of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the compleating of the promises which He had made unto them.</p>
            <p>In fine, he confesseth (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) That the Quakers degrees are <hi>so low that they are not in the state of Perfection, but they may by humane frailty in some measure or way, more or less</hi> (tread softly) <hi>decline or depart from the pure infallible teachings of the spirit;</hi> and then we hope this kind of spirit is not superior to that which spake infallibly in the Scripture; and from which we are assured that the Prophets, and Apostles in their Dictating or Writing the Scripture, did not <hi>decline in any measure or way more or less.</hi>

            <p>When he infers from hence, that <hi>their Doctrine is to be tryed by the Scripture; and their spirit by the Spirit of Truth:</hi> We would ask him what Difference he here puts between Doctrine and Spirit; and let him (if he can) shew how their spirit is to be tried but by
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000502_0048_0FA6A705C0619C48"/>
their Doctrine, or what Spirit they can be tryed by which will carry Conviction, but only that which breathes in the Scriptures: and it would be a great stroke he would drive, if he could reconcile our being led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly by the Spirit, to our being mean while in the same things left to mistakes; which is the very sense of his Words.</p>
            <p>Sect. 3. Here also he will grant <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (or the Spirit speaking in it) to be a</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge <hi>in a figurative sense, so we do not restrain it hither, but allow Him to speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> without <hi>Scripture:</hi> But this hath been already detected of vanity, for how shall we jugde of the Spirit, but by the Scripture? That the Spirit of God must open our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to discern the spiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word of God, we never doubted; and that Prayer and Meditation are helps to it, who questions? But what's this to the purpose? In summe, the Spirit is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,</hi> but to call Him the <hi>Rule</hi> is Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense.</p>
            <p>Sect. 4. We had waited long to know the Reason why, <hi>Cap.</hi> I. S. I. he calls the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>Outward Rule,</hi> and now he fairly tells us, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Because the Spirit is the inward rule.</hi> i. e. <hi>To determine all Controversies, at least such as we have in our selves a debate about.</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:000502_0049_0FA6A70679620C58"/>
The Text alledged is impertinent, for the Testimony of God there spoken of is the Scripture witnessed to by the Spirit: and we must distinguish between the Testator &amp; the <hi>Testimony,</hi> the latter of which only can in any proper sence be called the Rule, and let it here be well observed, That the Scripture is a Judge in it self, and doth alwaies carry the Determination in it, whether we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it or no, so as to be able to make use of it as such. And further, That it is not necessary that we have a <hi>saving Illumination</hi> for the meer <hi>Doctrinal</hi> improvement of it, since the Scripture is delivered in humane Language, and there is a logical knowledge of it to be attained by Industry, so far as to decide Controversies in Religion, by such as are not savingly illuminated, nor is it the spirit of the Disputant, but the convincing light of the word of God it self, which is to sway our Judgements and set them down sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as to the Doctrine.</p>

            <p>His Charge in this Section, that we assert, <hi>Natural and acquired gifts of letter Learning</hi> (without <hi>a divine Inspiration</hi>) <hi>to be sufficient to qualifie a Gospel Minister, and that</hi> Grace <hi>or true Piety is only accidental;</hi> may look black at the first view: but let our Judgement in that point be fully weighed, and we shall have no reason to be ashamed of it.</p>
            <p>That a man may be so Qualified, as to be capable of being Called to the Office of a Minister by a <hi>Gospel Church,</hi> and yet not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pious, we fear not to assert, but still we believe that no man can discharge any Office of Trust acceptably to God, without saving Grace. We here presume (and shall have occasion to prove it anon) That there's a <hi>mediate</hi> Call necessary to introduce a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the work of the Ministry; since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles times; and they who are to call them, must have some <hi>rule</hi> of discerning to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Call by, which must be something

            <p>His arguing the Necessity of Saving Grace because, <hi>Spiritual gifts are requisite,</hi> is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>illogical,</hi> nor doth it at all help him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these also were purchased by Christ for he hath purchased other things for us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Grace. That there is a specifical Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Gifts and Grace, is certain (though both may meet in the same man, &amp; we seek for both in every Minister, to the best of our discerning) that these are sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of beyond doubt; that a man may have Grace, and yet not spiritual gifts <hi>G.

            <p>Sect. 4. And that these <hi>spiritual Gifts were discernible</hi> we deny not.

            <p>And whereas he censures us for <hi>Limiting one man to preach only,</hi> it is not true; we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of one to preach one part of the day, and another on the other part, where they are to be had: only we require that they be such as are fit for the Ministry; and we would not have others to do it. Nor did the Apostle intend that there should be any Confusion in this Affair, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29. &amp; and to very little purpose doth he quote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>He tells us that <hi>the Apostles design is to shew that God had chosen the line of Jacob before the line of Esau, and that only to be His Church in the peculiar dispensation of the Mosaical law.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> is here treating of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, hath been fully evinced by many learned Orthodox. That he makes way to this by asserting the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, is cleer in the Chapter: That his Instance of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> did hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically intend what <hi>G.

If therefore he grants an eternal <hi>Election</hi> to be typified in it, (as he seems to do) the <hi>Reprobation</hi> must

            <p>In this Chapter he proceeds more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to urge and maintain the Doctrine of <hi>Universal Redemption,</hi> and we might dismiss him for his Answer to the writitings of the <hi>Anti-Remonstrants,</hi> but because many may not be advantaged with those discourses, we shall make a few brief Remarks upon his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. His first and main plea is from the words of Scripture, which express it in Universal terms, <abbr>viz,</abbr> 
               <hi>All, all men, every man, the world, the</hi> whole <hi>world:</hi> (as for that of the <hi>Body,</hi> Eph. 5. 23. <hi>Paul</hi> himself there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it of the Church, and its strange that the World and the Church should be of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual extent) some of ours (whom he calls the <hi>Adversaries of Truth</hi>) have answered, (though it is not our whole Answer) that by <hi>All,</hi> is not meant all <hi>particulars,</hi> (i. e. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals</hi>) but some of all <hi>sorts,</hi> all the <hi>Elect.</hi> His Reply is, that <hi>the word</hi> [All] <hi>must needs be as full and universal with respect to Christ's death and the benefit of it, as it is with respect to</hi> Adam'<hi>s Fall:</hi> and who denies it? But it is not so in <hi>his</hi> sense, except he will plead
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000502_0094_0FA6A73587693780"/>
for universal <hi>Salvation,</hi> as well as Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, else the benefit is not parallel to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and so he indeed seems to plead, by Citing 1. Tim. 4. 10. for the proof of his Assertion; but yet this he afterwards denies. We are here to consider, that <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Christ</hi> are in Scripture made parallel in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: as <hi>Adam</hi> is a common Head, so is <hi>Christ:</hi> hence, as Adam hath a natural seed, so hath Christ a spiritual seed: as Adam ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined all his seed, so Christ Redeemed all <hi>His:</hi> as Adam's seed are called the world, because they comprize all the men and women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world by natural Generation; so Christ's Seed are called the world, because they comprize all the men and women that belong to the world to come. But then we must remember; that Christ's Seed are a number selected out of the other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though they are <hi>all</hi> because He loseth none of His Elect, yet not all the Individuals of Adam's posterity; for there are they of whom Christ saith, <hi>They are none of my sheep.</hi> Nor doth he interpret but <hi>pervert</hi> that in, 2. Cor. 5. 14. <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead:</hi> for the Apostles intention there, is to prove that all God's Elect were dead, because Christ died for them all: The word [<hi>All</hi>] therefore, doth not signifie

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. Whereas Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. makes a Difference between His Redeemed and the world, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Did Christ dye to <hi>condemn</hi> men, or to <hi>save</hi> 'em? see <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 17. why then are they not saved for whom He came to dye? Was He not able to draw them to Him or to save them that come, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost?</p>
            <p>That he saith, <hi>Many are guilty of final Impenitency a considerable time before they dy;</hi> seems to be a Contradiction, though he saith it is none. We believe indeed that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are left of God to persist in impenitency
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000502_0096_0FA6A73681EB93C0"/>
till they dye; but then they are none of those for whom Christ died, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37.</p>
            <p>But we have him acknowledging, (<hi>pag.</hi> 96.) That <hi>He dyed not for all, with equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or degree of Love,</hi> and thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing, that <hi>they that are saved have more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant cause to bless God for His abundant mercy than the other; though they have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain.</hi> We grant, the damned have no cause to complain, because they suffer justly: but we would fain know where he placeth the inequality, since (at the bottom of the same page) he tells us, That <hi>God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no greater measure of inward grace to one than to another.</hi> Oh! but he suits <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences eminently:</hi> And is this all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? We thought there had been differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent dispensations of grace cleerly intimated in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. and one would surmise that what <hi>G. K.</hi> saith (<hi>ibid.</hi>) that <hi>God drawes, moves, enclines, perswades</hi> (and that is more than meer swasion) <hi>them to come, and when they fall infallibly reclaims them, &amp;c.</hi> had been grace, and more than meer Suiting of Providences; especially, when he there also tells us, That <hi>He and not</hi> they <hi>made them to differ from others:</hi> and here against Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth he bring that to prove his Assertion 1. Tim. 1. 14,—16. <hi>And the grace of our

Nay, (<hi>p.</hi> 93.) he tells us, That <hi>God by His infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible perswasions of love and grace, prevails in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly with the Elect;</hi> and is not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of grace <hi>grace,</hi> yea more grace than where there is no such Effect?</p>

He well knew that Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, without sufficient help, would render his Doctrine ridiculous; here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us, how a sufficiency of meanes is afforded to all men; and First, That <hi>Christ by His Death procured for all men an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of divine grace, light, life,</hi> &amp;c. the Contrary to which is true; He purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these only for his <hi>Elect,</hi> for whose sakes He died. The Scripture makes a difference between his being <hi>head of the Church,</hi> Eph. 5. 23. and his being <hi>head over all things</hi> to <hi>the Church,</hi> Cap. 1. 22. But supposing a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, what benefit can they have by it if it be not applyed? Well, he will give an account of <hi>that</hi> too, as good as he can, (<hi>p.</hi> 100) <hi>Where outward meanes fail, God supplies this with inward teachings, and some other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wayes of Providence:</hi> and are these suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to lead men to Salvation, or bring men to Christ?

            <p>There are Three things, which we will here not only assert, but also give Scripture proof for. 1. That Christ is not the Light of nature in all men. Is it the light in men that was born of a Virgin, hanged on a tree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ried in a grave, all which he else-where confesseth of Christ? Besides the Apostle expresly saith, that men in their natural est<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate are <hi>without Christ,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. and that <hi>except men be in the faith, Christ is not in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

That the Light of Nature left in fallen man, is not sufficient to point him out the way to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; had not they the Light of Nature of whom it is said, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 4. that <hi>the Lord

Doth not the Apostle describe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural estate by this, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8. and what sales he, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.? but we have him confessing this amply in <hi>p.</hi> 120. That man in his state of integrity had Light sufficient to have guided him to felicity, we believe; but all the Light of nature in fallen man, will not <hi>objectively</hi> reveal the truths necessary to be known in order to salvation. It had never told men of Christ, and the Satisfaction that is made to the Law by his Righteousness. 3. That God hath not any way imparted such a light universally to all men; which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Scriptures do prove. Besides if this Light be connate with men, what needed <hi>G. K.</hi> to make such a splutter about <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelations?</hi> and if it be only by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where will he find evidence that God hath so reveal'd Himself to all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. That from the <hi>Law written in mens hearts,</hi> he goes about to prove that man has such a <hi>sufficient light,</hi> is weak, for the Apostle speaks plain, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. (which we are turned to) of the law given to man at the first, which is become weak through the flesh, and cannot give life; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. And his pleading from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:000502_0110_0FA6A743AE407058"/>
               <hi>That it is sufficient to make them inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, that it is therefore sufficient to make them</hi> excusable <hi>that frame their lives to it,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not. The fall of man hath left him without strength to obey it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. The Light of Nature discovers to man that Duty which he doth not, and, by reason of Sin, <hi>cannot</hi> do; which leaves him inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18, 19, 20. but it is Christ only that can take off guilt, and remove Condemnation; and the light of nature nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discovers His person, nor the way how to get pardon by Him.</p>
            <p>His arguing (<hi>pag.</hi> 121) That <hi>Because for mens not glorifying God, He gave them up to a reprobate mind, therefore they were not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates from the beginning,</hi> hath no face of a reason in it; for, besides that (if we should take the word <hi>Reprobate</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. in such a sense) a man may be reprobated before he be left up to make the open discoveries of it: the meaning of that place is, that God left them to a mind that chose dross rather than Silver, preferred wickedness before Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and so was a mind disapproved God.</p>
            <p>And when He tells us that <hi>The light the Gentiles had is a new gift and grace of God to them,</hi> he saith nothing at all till he can
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000502_0111_0FA6A746EEB6A9F8"/>
prove that there is such a gift common to all men; nor do all his alledged Scriptures speak one word that way: inward convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and warnings of wrath to come (which we deny not to have been in heathen) will not amount to it, being only the Actings of a natural Conscience under legal Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which indeed shew to man some of his Misery, but nothing of his Remedy: and that place on which he puts a peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <hi>Luc.</hi> 12. 20. <hi>God said, thou fool,</hi> &amp;c. is as little to his purpose as any; for, if we cannot tell how God said so to him, yet it is enough that He did it by awakening of his Conscience, may, that he did it Providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and what's this to a sufficient Light, telling men how they may be saved; it is a meer Wheadling and not Arguing.</p>
            <p>It is therefore impudence in him to assert (<hi>pag.</hi> 122.) That <hi>though God's Dispensations of grace be various, and the Gospel Dispensations</hi> (fine words!) <hi>be best; yet whoever is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in any one of these is accepted of God; and yet none is accepted but in</hi> Christ, <hi>or for His sake;</hi> and give no other proof for it, but his <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> which is of no value among sober men: and hence to conclude, That <hi>the inward Dispensation that is among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that have not Christ outwardly preached,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:000502_0112_0FA6A7470205BEF8"/>
hath its glory, and great service to those that are faithful in it,</hi> is to talk at liberty himself, and deny to all others a liberty to judge.</p>

            <head>Reflections on Chapt. 7. of Justification.</head>
            <p>The Doctrine of Justification is one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal pillar of our Faith, we cannot forego one clause of it without greatest hazzard: let him not then think to wheadle us out of it, his attempts so to do must be detected &amp; defeated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. When he saith, <hi>God doth not just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifie men in their Ungodliness, but</hi> from <hi>it,</hi> would be true, if he had not perverted it afterwards. To justifie a man is to uphold and defend him in such a way, and to <hi>say to the wicked, thou art righteous;</hi> this is far from God. But to justifie a man <hi>from</hi> his ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, may admit of a double Interpretation, if it intend that He absolves a man from his ungodliness by a gracious act of <hi>pardon</hi> &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, it is true: but if it intend a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of his sin from him by cleansing him from his filthiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and purging the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it out of him, (as he after inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets himself) this is no Justification at all, but belongs to <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. He saith, <hi>They are only the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that are justified;</hi> if he intends that
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:000502_0113_0FA6A747B858F8F8"/>
whom God doth justifie, He doth also sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, it is a great truth; but if he puts <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> (which is a Concomitant) to be a <hi>cause</hi> of Justification, yea, the <hi>material</hi> cause, (as his following Discourse evidently insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates) it is a deceit: and here he mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when he saith, That <hi>we are the seed of Christ by Sanctification:</hi> which is only a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which Christ bestowes on His seed, and not a cause of their being so. And when he tells us, That <hi>Christ bestowes Adoption only on His brethren,</hi> it is as much as if he had said that Christ only Adopts the <hi>Adopted.</hi>

            <p>

Here he falls into down-right Popery confounding those two great benefits of <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which (tho' inseparable) are to be distinguished.

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. One Errour begets another: a false principle will afford mistakes for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions; and here we see it: he took <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> for <hi>one</hi> thing, and so he tells us, that <hi>God justifies not only by faith in Christ, but by a real inward righteousness too:</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi> thought that these two ways of having a justifying Righteousness were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent

               <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. but herein he follows his Fathers the Papists; and whereas he sales That <hi>The graces of Sanctification are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of obtaining Justification from Christ;</hi> he mistakes the order of Christ's Benefits; for its certain that there is none of these graces in the man habitually, much less the Exercise of them, before <hi>Justification:</hi> for, in &amp; with the souls applying it self to Christ by Faith, it is <hi>justified;</hi> and it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred that <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, it is the <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4. 5. Such God finds them in themselves, when He comes to justifie them. And when he saith, <hi>Jesus Christ cannot be applied to men for justification, unless the man be made righteous;</hi> its either a Contradiction or a Sophism. If they be made righteous for their justification, the Application of <hi>Christ</hi> for their Righteousness is superfluous: If he intends, that the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Justification makes them righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it is fallacious: it makes them so in a <hi>Law</hi> sense, but not in a <hi>moral</hi> sense, not justification, but <hi>Sanctification</hi> doeth that: his Similitude is from that which hath no Likeness; his Scripture Citations are not to the purpose, that in 1. <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 7. Speakes of Sanfictication; that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15. speaks of the visible Right to Church-Communion,

which men are to prove by their Obedience or if he will not admit of that, let him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Faith,</hi> which layes hold on the Righteousness of Christ, is the great Gospel Command, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Real and true beginnings of faith and Sanctification</hi> (saith he) <hi>may be fallen from:</hi> What means he by this? There are some previous and preparatory common works that are wrought in men; such as Conviction of sin and misery by the law, and <hi>the terrours of the Lord</hi> that make men affraid, and may put a stop to their lewd courses, yea, and work a reformation in many things, and make a natural Conscience to act more strongly than before: if he meanes these, we deny not but they may be lost; but then we deny them to be the beginnings of true justifying or saving faith, called the <hi>Faith of God's elect,</hi> to distinguish it from other faith, and those which he instanceth in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. belong to this head; they had through these arrived to a Temporary Faith, but not to that which is saving; and therefore the Apostle charitably exempts his <hi>Hebrews</hi> from any such danger; as having other things in them, <hi>vers.</hi> 9. His instance from <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. relates only to a visible Church state, which
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000502_0120_0FA6A74EF857B0D8"/>
all that stand in are not true Believers. That of the <hi>Angels fall,</hi> is impertinent, for they were under a Covenant of <hi>Works.</hi> Their Faith in the <hi>thorny and stony ground</hi> was but a temporary Faith, it had not a saving root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for that Reason abode but a while. And we must distinguish between a false faith and one that is not saving: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blame-worthy for men to lose some things, the keeping whereof will not save them; such are all the moral principles which men have imbibed, such as the young man had, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. And it is to be observed, that the good ground is differenced from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three, by the epethete <hi>good,</hi> to shew that the other were not so in a spiritual sense: and though <hi>God's children feel many</hi> thorns <hi>&amp;</hi> stones <hi>in their hearts after Conversion,</hi> yet their hearts being in saving measures softned and broke-up, they receive their Denomination from the better part, according to Scripture. Nor will the <hi>Parable of the</hi> Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>begin.</hi> help him at all: we grant, the <hi>oyl</hi> there signifies <hi>true saving grace;</hi> but then by <hi>Lamps</hi> we are to understand an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: by <hi>Vessels,</hi> the heart; the <hi>foolish Virgins had oyl in their Lamps,</hi> i. e. they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and made a profession and show of Grace, though they had none really; the

His allegation from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may at first seem to have a face of a plea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, but it only seems so. Other Scriptures assure us that no true believer shall finally &amp; totally fall away from grace; and Scripture doth not contradict it self. Several things might here be offered; briefly Consider, 1. This is but a conditional expression, and therefore asserts nothing to his purpose. 2. God is pleased sometimes, to curb in His people's Corruptions by such Conditional Threatnings, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 14. for they have nothing in themselves, but what they might lose if God did not secure it; &amp; God so preserves His People as to stir up <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>care</hi> in them. 3. And what if we say, That God speaks to them in respect of the <hi>typical part</hi> of the <hi>typical Covenant,</hi> to whom the promises and threatnings concerning the <hi>typical</hi> blessings of <hi>Canaan</hi> were made on these conditions, which they might either keep or break, and by breaking fall from them, and

            <p>That <hi>David</hi> is a <hi>clear instance of one that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally fell from grace,</hi> he proves not: the sins he committed were great, the Aggravations heinous, but if he had totally lost his grace, why doth he pray, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 11. <hi>take not thy holy Spirit from me!</hi> Nor doth it follow (as he intimates,) that because a justified man may fall into Murder and Adultery, therefore the <hi>worst of men may believe that they are true &amp; real Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Nor doth it follow that <hi>if these men dy in their sins they shall go to heaven immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately:</hi> For tho' God suffer (for holy ends) His Children to fall far, yet as not to fall totally, so He will give them Repentance: tho' <hi>the just fall,</hi> yet <hi>he shall rise again:</hi> Nor will God suffer them to dy, before He hath recovered them. Neither yet doth our Doctrine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage to any hope of such who so defile themselves, and dy without Repentance.

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. His first Essay is against the <hi>Church</hi> considered as <hi>visible:</hi> and here he cavils at the description of the visible Church given by the Assembly; <abbr>Viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That it consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together with their Children:</hi> insinuating that we hold that <hi>nothing of grace, or of the power of godliness is requisite to constitute a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our visible Church:</hi> but this is all Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not understanding what we mean by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> nor what by <hi>Profession.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>visible</hi> Church they speak of, and he also after grants that there is such a thing: and what is it that makes it visible? it must be something that makes it discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others: Here then observe, 1. That there is inward Grace required absolutely to make any one a living member of Christ, &amp;c. so of the <hi>Church of the first-born.</hi> 2. That this sincerity of heart is to give its evidence to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by an answerable life and conversation: There is a <hi>confession of the mouth, as well as a

beleeving in the</hi> heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. 3. These Fruits are they by which others are to judge of mens Sincerity, and accordingly to declare them to be visible members of the Church: this rule the Apostles themselves followed in their owning of men. 4. That such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession may, <hi>be,</hi> where sincerity is <hi>not;</hi> and thus Hypocrites may belong to the visible Church; there were such in the primitive times, <hi>Simon Magus, Demas,</hi> &amp; those, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. were such. 5. There may be many Irregularities in the Conversation of such, which yet do not presently unchurch them; such there were in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatia.</hi> 6. That when such are become scandalous, there are Church-<hi>censures</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ; and these can be administred to none but under the consideration of their being Members of the Church visible: thus <hi>Paul</hi> delivered <hi>Hymeneus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to satan.</hi>

            <p>And it is grosly untrue, that <hi>Independents require no more than such a profession</hi> as he talks of, <hi>to make them members of their church:</hi> for they whom he calls <hi>Independents,</hi> distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church visible, or Christianity at large, &amp; Membership, or Fellowship in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational</hi> Church, and have not been wont to be charged for their <hi>Lawness,</hi> but rather <hi>Strictness</hi> in Admission. Nor doth it argue them of Hypocrisy, or contradiction, because they separated from another Church, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the <hi>Episcopal,</hi> it being well known that they did it mainly because their terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were such as they could not in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comply with; tho' also their promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous Admission of all sorts of ignorant &amp; scandalous persons to the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> added to the incitement: as for the <hi>Presbiteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Churches, we did not separate from them

            <p>Sect. 2. How daringly doth he here assert that <hi>we find no such Church in all the Scripture, owned to be the church of Christ, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form or profession of religion makes such;</hi> when the whole New Testament acquaints us with no other, if he keep to his subject, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a <hi>visible</hi> Church?

            <p>The last Mine he has to spring is to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish our Sacraments and Sabbaths,</p>
            <p>Sect. 1. That the word [<hi>Sacrament</hi>] is not to be found in the New-Testament, we grant: but it hath obtained to be a Word used in the Church, for many ages to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press that by, which is evidently enough laid down in Scripture, nor doth he dispute us about the Lawfulness of using such words.
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000502_0146_0FA6A76683DF39E8"/>
But when he saith, <hi>there is no word in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to answer that word, except the word</hi> [<hi>Mystery,</hi>] we cannot go along with him; that the word [<hi>Mystery</hi>] is at all used in this sense, we suppose cannot be proved; but there are two <hi>other</hi> that <hi>are;</hi> and imply as much as we intend by a Sacrament, <abbr>viz.</abbr> a <hi>Sign</hi> and a <hi>Seal,</hi> which are both used of the Sacrament of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. and by parity of Reason are applicable to the New-Testament-Sacrments: that <hi>Baptism</hi> is such a <hi>sign:</hi> is evident from, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. that the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is so too, see1. Cor. 11. 26. for how is the Lord's death shewed forth in it, but by an instituted <hi>sign?</hi> And when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can shew as good a plea for their other five, as we can for these <hi>two,</hi> we will then confess the injury we have done in denying them.</p>
            <p>Sect. 2. Now for <hi>Baptism!</hi> What need he to combat <hi>Infant-Baptism?</hi> If there be no <hi>Baptism,</hi> then none of <hi>Infants:</hi> only he loves to be wrangling. and what Cavil against <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> if neither <hi>that</hi> nor Dipping be of force by Divine <hi>Institution?</hi> Thus some <hi>must be meddling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> we plead not for it; we say <hi>Baptism</hi> is a Gospel-Ordinance; that <hi>Water</hi> is the Element to be applied, that it
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000502_0147_0FA6A7673A572670"/>
may be done either by Dipping <hi>into,</hi> or <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on</hi> of water, there being no express Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for the one more than the other; that, it being a <hi>sign,</hi> it hath no other <hi>Efficacy</hi> than by the Blessing upon the Institution, that as a sign. It may signifie, by pouring upon one part of the Body; that the <hi>Face</hi> is most ready and convenient, and why may we not allude to that of Christ to <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 13. 10. that we do it on the <hi>Forehead</hi> particularly, is a slander. When be asks us, <hi>Why</hi> John <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Christ by</hi> Dipping <hi>Him in Water?</hi> We think his first Question should have been, Whether he did so or no? and it is certain he cannot prove that he did. Our <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from infant Circumcision to infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> is good: for, it was the same Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the same promises that <hi>Abraham</hi> and we had, <hi>Circumsion was a sign of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Faith;</hi> and so is Baptism; and <hi>Infants</hi> are as capable of the one as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the promise is still to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Baptizing of Infants was not the practice of the Church during the first century,</hi> is arrogantly affirmed by him, against Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: <hi>Orig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

been universally practised in the Church ever since the Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And sure he mistakes when he saith that in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Neither circumcision nor Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism there mentioned is outward:</hi> Whereas the Apostle is arguing from the sign, to the thing signified by it, in respect of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; &amp; then mentions Baptism it self intimating that it signified the same thing, &amp; therefore laid them under the same obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Holiness: there is therefore a <hi>sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Dying with Christ; because in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance there is an engagement laid upon us to dye to the world. And what a poor shift is he put upon, when to evade <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. he acknowledges the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> but tells us <hi>it saith nothing of water?</hi> doth not the very Word imply it, and the Gospel assure us that <hi>Water</hi> was the Element? Furthermore, We have two Baptisms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. it must then be <hi>one</hi> of these two, but the Disciples could not bapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise with the latter, it being Christ's alone prerogative. In citing of <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 15, 16. he fraudulently omits that clause, <hi>for of such is the Kingdom of God:</hi> and <hi>G. K.</hi> assures us that <hi>that Kingdom is on</hi> earth, <hi>as well as in Heaven;</hi> and if so, then they are Subjects of the priviledges of this Kingdom, as far as

capable: and of the same import is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. for all his cavil against it? nor doth it follow that <hi>they may receive the Lords supper as well;</hi> because that is above their Capacity at present: a Child may be an Heir, and yet not be put into actual possession of all that he hath a right to: and though <hi>Christ Himself baptized not,</hi> yet His <hi>Disciples</hi> did by <hi>His</hi> Authority.</p>
            <p>Sect. 3. <hi>That Baptism with water properly belonged to</hi> John'<hi>s Ministry,</hi> is easier said than prov'd: that <hi>It is expresly contra-distinguish'd from</hi> Christ'<hi>s baptism, by</hi> John <hi>and</hi> Christ <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> is an errour; the outward Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration is distinguished from the Efficacy, which depends upon Christ, and not on the Minister: but not <hi>contra</hi>-distinguished, for these are two, but not <hi>contraries,</hi> but conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants, as being indeed, two parts of the same Sacrament. And that it belonged not limitatively to <hi>John's</hi> Dispensation appears, because Christ gave order for the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Philip</hi> baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Eunuch with water, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul</hi> baptized, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 15. Nor will he ever disprove the <hi>Baptizing with water,</hi> being <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. till he can prove that there is some other ministerial Baptism, for which he must run to his Revelations, Ten
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:000502_0150_0FA6A76BB795EF48"/>
thousand of which are worth nothing. And what an infatuation is it to tell us, <hi>there are no other words of institution,</hi> but the words of Institution? What more would he have? Nor doth he evade by telling us, <hi>they could baptize with the Spirit as well as beget sons and daughters to God;</hi> for this was done minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erially by dispencing the Ordinances, which Christ only can bless to that end, though He own His servants as workers-together with him in their place; but they ever renounced their doing any of these things <hi>by their</hi> own <hi>virtue.</hi> Yea, also <hi>Baptism</hi> is signified in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to be one way in which they made disciples of them: But he fore-saw that we would tell him, that the disciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ's Dispensation, and after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, baptized with <hi>water;</hi> &amp; has provided a fine Evasion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>It was done by</hi> Toleration, <hi>as many things else by the Law;</hi> but we suppose that Infant-Baptism was not of the Law, but of the preparation of the Gospel: yea, an Institution which Christ Himself confirmed by his commands, and so, not a meer Toleration. And when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he was sent to baptize,</hi> it is meant not so much to baptize as to <hi>preach;</hi> he was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle &amp; had diverse Ministers waiting upon him, who were ordinarily imployed in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:000502_0151_0FA6A76C77EBA898"/>
such as by his Ministry were prepared for it: his Thanking of God therefore that he baptized so few, was not because the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance it self was not Authentick, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, but because as there was no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity ordinarily for him to do it <hi>personally,</hi> so it eventually prevented occasion of their <hi>naming</hi> themselves from <hi>Paul:</hi> this Reason he gives 1. Cor. 1. 14. if <hi>G. K.</hi>'s pretended reason had any weight, he had broken his Commission in baptizing of <hi>any.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Somebody ows him thanks for his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that allows <hi>Babes and children their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>provided they are cordially zealous for</hi> spiritual <hi>Baptism;</hi> and he grants <hi>there are some few such</hi> (only Christ is little beholden to him for making a sacred Institution of His a <hi>George-on-horseback</hi> to invite children to their books) but for us, we are not thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, for we are not so much as babes, but <hi>meer Hypocrites, and Formalists:</hi> did he ever read, 1. Cor. 4. 8. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10. we have alwaies professed our zeal for the inward Baptism, &amp; our whole Ministry is a witness to it, only we are for both Baptism with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Holy Ghost, and the Quakers pretend to be only for the latter; and which is most agreeable to the mind of Christ, let the Scripture determine: and indeed they
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:000502_0152_0FA6A76D37E5C8B0"/>
thus take away the very means appointed by Christ for enjoying that other.</p>
            <p>Sect. 4. Nor doth he treat the sacred Supper with any better language. He grants <hi>That Christ had an outward supper of the Pascal Lamb:</hi> i. e. that He had the sign without the thing Signified; <hi>i. e.</hi> that Christ are the passover hypocritically, which is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Blasphemy. When he saith, <hi>Our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament hath no inward spiritual signification to us,</hi> he arrogates God's Prerogative, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can judge the heart immediately: and his reason is groundless, for we never denied <hi>a real and spiritual partaking in Christ,</hi> though we allow it not in the Quakers carnal sense, but spiritually.</p>
            <p>When he takes notice of <hi>Christ's drinking first, and drinking twise at the Sacrament;</hi> he bewrayes his ignorance or perverseness; if that place be more obscure, it is to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by such as are more clear: the other Evangelists mention the order of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; By Christ's first blessing and giving the Bread, and after that the Cup; and <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he received the Order from Christ Himself thus, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed kept two Sacraments at one Meeting, the <hi>Passover</hi> which He now antiquated, and the <hi>Supper</hi> which he now instituted; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:000502_0153_0FA6A76DF93DBB78"/>
Cup belonged to the Passover, which also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented Christ, and Jewish Antiquity tell us, it was their custom to conclude that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with such a Cup.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 188. we have him there introducing a <hi>new</hi> Sacrament, which he tells us they have at their <hi>ordinary Meals,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers do consecrate them, sometimes by Praying, sometimes by silence,</hi> (a new way of Consecration) and to this he shrinks up this Gospel Ordinance; which is pure <hi>Familism,</hi> endeavouring to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all instituted Worship out of the Church, under a pretence of continued holiness, a fine way to extirpate Religion out of the world, by Evacuating the Appointments of Jesus Christ. We beleeve that there is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feeding on Christ, which beleevers are to practise daily by the exercise of Faith; and are Satisfied that our <hi>Eating &amp;c.</hi> should be alwais <hi>to the glory of God,</hi> and might possibly say as much of that <hi>as,</hi> and with more truth <hi>than</hi> he. But Christs institution is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond that, and is appointed as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial help of our Faith in these exercises, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in therefore <hi>they are behind us,</hi> they pretend to no more than we do, and in our measure endeavour, whereas we are also for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Institutions of Christ, to help us in all other duties; and we think that our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:000502_0154_0FA6A76EBAF458A0"/>
is beyond theirs, as being an holy Ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gospel Worship, and theirs is only the Common duty of all men: we believe that <hi>outward eating is but a</hi> sign <hi>of the</hi> inward, <hi>and therefore not to be rested in,</hi> but because it is a sign: and Christ hath enjoined the use of it, we dare not omit it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> all <hi>outward Eating and Drinking is a natural and necessary sign of the Inward,</hi> we utterly deny; that it is accommodable to it by way of resemblance, we acknowledge, else Christ would not have chosen it for this end: but we use them for figures upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of His institution, and not because of a natural Analogy; else we might multiply Sacraments at Pleasure; and yet we grant it to be as much a natural sign, as <hi>the outward world is a figure of the inward,</hi> which he saith <hi>Paul expresly calls it.</hi> I. Cor. 7. 31. when there is not one syllable expresly or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially intimating any such thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. But if the Sabbath may but be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier'd, the other Ordinances will fall. Here then, his <hi>first cavil</hi> is against <hi>the</hi> first day <hi>of the week,</hi> but if he decries any <hi>outward Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> at all (as he calls it) the First day needs no more Vindication than any other: touching the Change of the Sabbath, such as acknowledge the Sabbath to be moral &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:000502_0155_0FA6A76F7ABFD738"/>
by divine precept, may find it made good by many, <hi>Sheppard, Owen</hi> and others. His Cavil also against <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. hath been fully answered by the fore-cited Authours, and he seems himself to grant the cause, for he tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 103.) <hi>It is commendable in Christians to set apart the first day of the week for rest from Employments and to help the mind in its spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exercises:</hi> now, they must set this day apart rather than any other, either because the day it self hath some Betterness in it, or because Christ hath put an Excellency upon it; the former cannot be proved, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be only by His sanctifying of it; to be a Day of Rest.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Changing of the Seventh Day, which was the Jewish Sabbath, into the First which was the Christian-, <hi>to put the first day of the week in the Room of Christ;</hi> for not to say, that it is hard to prove that the Seventh Day was meerly a Jewish Type of Christ, for it was appointed before there was any Revelation of Christ, or occasion for Him; (<abbr>viz.</abbr> in <hi>Innocency;</hi>) but if it were, yet the Sabbath it self was not so, but a time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Divine positive precept for the performing of natural and instituted Duties to God in, and is therefore of a natural and perpetual consideration, &amp; cannot cease to be
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:000502_0156_0FA6A77038A7D478"/>
necessary, till such duties cease, or men can do them without taking time to do them in.</p>
            <p>And is he not run quite out of breath, when he tells us that, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8, 9. <hi>saith nothing of one day in seven, but only of a seventh day,</hi> we thought <hi>that</hi> had been one day of seven: but suppose him to mean, that it left it not arbitrary, but fixed it; we may in part grant it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that it fixed it to the Seventh day, which God saw meet to appoint, but that it necessitated it to the last of the Seven, so that God could not alter it to the first of the seven, there is no need to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and the Scripture will prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, because He did afterwards change it.</p>
            <p>And whereas he so often pleads that, <hi>The Sabbath is Christ and nothing else,</hi> he poorly proves it from. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 9. 10. it is there said that <hi>Christ entred into His rest,</hi> and doth that mean, that he entred into <hi>Himself?</hi> his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting that in <hi>the New-Testament there is no outward day</hi> is nonsence; what inward day did he ever hear of? He thinks the words <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward,</hi> may be applied to <hi>every</hi> thing, but he must run up the folly a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further; <hi>we cannot prove</hi> (saith he) <hi>that the fourth Command enjoined the Jews to keep an outward seventh day:</hi> we know that it was a Seventh day, it is expresly so
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:000502_0157_0FA6A772E2A20338"/>
said, and if he can find out an inward one, it will be a rare invention: we are sure that it was a day to be celebrated from the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Evening. Nor is his allusion to the tenth Command of any strength; that that <hi>only enjoins inward duty</hi> &amp; <hi>not outward,</hi> is a grand mistake: every Command of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue respects the actions as well as the heart, and so do the fourth &amp; tenth.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Prophets are not wont to rail and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and that <hi>he</hi> doth; as if he had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated to it, particularly <hi>p.</hi> 198. and all this he chargeth upon strangers, whom he had no knowledge of.</p>

            <p>WE had now done with him, but that he hath printed at the End of his <hi>Call</hi> the Copies of three Letters, two of his and one of ours, nor needs much to be said to these.</p>
            <p>As to his first Letter, all the Reflexion we shall here make is, that he tells us in it, that <hi>the false Doctrines which he chargeth upon us, were such as he was assured by the Spirit of God that we taught them, and that they were false:</hi> Now the Spirit of God assures none of a Ly, and that in matter of Fact. But we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore intimated, that the 12<hi>th.</hi> Article in his Charge, is none of ours, but the contrary; by which it appears that <hi>G. K's</hi> Spirit teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to ly.</p>
            <p>What we have to say in Justification of our Answer to him will be seen in our Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions on his reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He tells us, <hi>We called his letter a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; heretical paper, and give no satisfactory
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:000502_0160_0FA6A774B825D720"/>
reason for so doing;</hi> We had then no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but we hope we have now done it to the Satisfaction of the sober.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>When our carnal weapons were gone, we found no spiritual ones:</hi> We suppose it is now evident that he was mistaken, if the Word of God be the <hi>sword of the Spirit,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He vaunts that <hi>We have no courage to appear in the open field, but lurk in our dens where the honest Quakers have no occasion to heare us:</hi> but we say, it is their own fault; for our preaching is open, and our doors shut out none but those that will not come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He calls us <hi>Beasts of prey, and Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds, that creep out only in the dark;</hi> but this charge is very impertinent and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; it was in his Language night with us, when our Liberties were taken away, and then (if at all) we refused to come out, and then <hi>G. K.</hi> comes daringly; he then is the <hi>Forrest-beast,</hi> by his own doom.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He boasts of his great Conquest in his book, and yet (like an Hypocrite) would arrogate nothing to himself, no, he is but like the <hi>Barly cake which tumbled into the host of the Midianites,</hi> only his Conquest is not like to hold the parallel, for we suppose we have

            <p n="6">6.

Ought not the Shepherd to be aware when the <hi>Wolf</hi> comes to his flock? Nor did we ever pretend to make our people savingly holy, any further than as God blessed our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
