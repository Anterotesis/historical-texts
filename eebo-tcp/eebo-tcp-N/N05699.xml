            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>II. <hi>From the general Tendency and Influence of Religion.</hi> The great things of Religion are reveal'd &amp; ſet before us, in the Word of God: And when we conform to that Revelation, and comply with the Demands of it; when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and act and live, as God requires we ſhould do in his Word, we are then Religious. The <hi>Bible</hi> is the compleat <hi>Standard</hi> and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our <hi>Religion:</hi> There are indeed divers important Articles of Religion, concerning God, the Difference between Vertue and Vice, and our Duty and Happineſs, that are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by the Light of Nature: But all the great Truths and Duties of Morality, are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, and incorporated into his Laws, are refin'd and purifi'd, and ſet in the faireſt and ſtrongeſt Point of Light, and raiſed to their higheſt Perfection in the Chriſtian Inſtitution.

When this Fountain of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is purified; this vitious and deprav'd Temper is rectifi'd, and chang'd to Holineſs, this will gently, yet powerfully lead &amp; engage Perſons, as, to approve themſelves to GOD in all other Branches of Chriſtian Duty, ſo ſaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to exert themſelves in their Places, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Welfare of the <hi>Public.</hi> Now, the Goſpel and Religion of JESUS, is admirably deſign'd &amp; calculated, to produce this bleſſed Effect, and this bleſſed Effect it does &amp; will actually produce, wherever it is cordially and ſincerely entertained, and ſubmitted to. Hence we are ſaid, <hi>To be ſanctifi'd by the Word;</hi>

Purity &amp; Holineſs, and a governing Diſpoſition to pleaſe &amp; obey GOD in all Things. As the Laws of Religion requires, the univerſal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Vertue and Holineſs; they that are truly religious chuſe to obey GOD &amp; lead holy Lives; there is a bleſſed Agreement &amp; Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, tho' not a perfect one, between the Temper of their Minds, and the ſacred Laws of Religion: they are not only aw'd &amp; influenc'd by the Authority &amp; Command of GOD; but they find an inward Propenſity &amp; Diſpoſition, to devote &amp; approve themſelves to GOD, not only in the Duties of Piety &amp; Godlineſs, but in the Performance of all relative &amp; ſocial Duties, and to exert themſelves in their Places, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare of Mankind, and the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and Happineſs of the <hi>State.</hi> A good Man indeed may labour under Miſtakes, as to the true Intereſt of the <hi>Public,</hi> as he may in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matters, &amp; ſo from wrong Apprehenſions may fail of his Duty; he may likewiſe be wrought upon, by Temptations from within, or from without to neglect his Duty in Particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but theſe Things, I hope, are no Parts of his Religion; they are ſo many Inſtances of his Want of Religion, or the Imperfection of it. Religion in it's native and genuine Influence makes men better, more uſeful &amp; greater Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, in the various Relations and Characters of Life, and forms them to a prevailing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007230_0012_102B40B9354F27E0"/>
to pleaſe and Honour GOD in all their Ways, and to further and promote the <hi>public Intereſt</hi> and Happineſs. No good Man will live in the habitual, known neglect of his Duty to the <hi>Public:</hi> his own Heart, and the ruling Temper of his Mind, will excite and prompt him to honour and obey GOD, and to do good to Men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Religion is the Intereſt and Happineſs of a People, as it has a particular moral Influence to avert impending Calamities, and to draw down Bleſſings &amp; Salvations upon the State.</hi> Practical Religion, that Temper of Mind, &amp; that courſe of Life, the Goſpel is intended to form Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to, has evidently a particular moral Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency &amp; Influence, to ſkreen &amp; ſhelter a People from public Calamities, &amp; to draw down public Mercies and Salvations. This renders a People acceptable and dear to GOD, whoſe alwiſe, good and powerful Providence, orders &amp; over-rules all the Affairs of this lower World. The mighty Influence, Holineſs, Devotion and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent humble Prayer have, to ſecure &amp; protect a People, and to engage the ſpecial Bleſſings of GOD upon them, is apparent thro' out the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

And God, in all Ages of the World, is a Prayer-hearing GOD, and his Ears are ever open to the humble Cries of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But, this Point may be further illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</p>
            <p>III. <hi>From ſome particular Branches of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that directly and obviouſly ſubſerve the Intereſt, and promote the Felicity of the civil Community.</hi> The Particulars I ſhall adduce for this Purpoſe are ſuch as theſe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Faithfulneſs in Rulers.</hi> Whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Model of Civil Rule, a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may be caſt under, 'tis of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to it's Welfare; that they, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to Places of Truſt and Power, be wiſe and good and faithful Men; theſe are great Bleſſings to the <hi>Public:</hi> now, 'tis Religion that adorns Rulers with their moſt valuable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications: this, I know, is not the only Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007230_0013_102B40BB26176378"/>
nor is every good Man fit to rule over Others: there are divers other and inferior Principles, that may Influence and prompt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to do conſiderable Good, in their Places; tho' Holineſs and a true Principle of Religion, ſhould not be found prevailing, and bearing Sway in their Hearts: but Goſpel Holineſs, is the moſt valuable Ingredient, the divineſt Touch, in the Character of Rulers. When the Supreme Love of God, and of Chriſt his Son, and a fervent Charity &amp; Benevolence to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are ever glowing in their Hearts, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is planted deep there; This Sacred, this powerful Principle, tends to awaken and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate all their Powers, to promote the Peace &amp; Welfare and Felicity of their People; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect &amp; ſkreen them on every Side, to guard &amp; ſecure their valuable Rights and Privileges: This determines them, to a firm and ſteady Adherence, to the Rules of Juſtice &amp; Equity, in all their Adminiſtrations; and to that Plan of Government, which fixes their own Powers and Prerogatives, as alſo, the Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the People; carefully avoiding all guilty Reaches, after deſpotic &amp; arbitrary Rule, on the one Hand, &amp; equally careful, they don't tamely ſuffer their Authority and Laws to be inſulted and trampled upon, on the other. This leads them, to conſult and ſtudy the true Intereſt of the Community; that they may be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007230_0014_102B40BCB0AC6B30"/>
Miniſters of God to them for Good;—may frame ſuch Laws, as are wiſely deſign'd and calculated to advance their beſt Intereſt—that breathe forth Terror, to the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; but Praiſe &amp; Encouragment to thoſe that do well.</p>
            <p>It diſarms Temptations of their Power and Influence, or renders them Proof againſt them, and victorious over 'em;—Temptations from within, from the Luſts &amp; Corruptions of their own Hearts; and from without, from the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Bribery of Others, or from popular Uneaſineſs &amp; Clamour;—Inſpires them, with a noble Fortitude and Reſolution, with a firm and ſteady Hand, to carry the Laws into Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; to check and bridle, the unruly and licentious, and to chaſtiſe the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; to ſuppreſs Immorality and root out Vice, that Juſtice &amp; Judgment may run down the Streets, as a River, &amp; Righteouſneſs as a Flood that overflows: This will fill their Hearts, with a paternal Affection for their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and a tender Concern for their Well-being and Proſperity—Inſpire them with the noble Ambition, of approving Themſelves, Fathers to their Country, &amp; Benefactors to Man-kind; will animate their ardent Prayers, to the great Father of the Univerſe; that He would Shower his rich and numerous Salvations upon them. The Light and Purity, of their amiable Life,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007230_0014_102B40BCB0AC6B30"/>
and pious Example, will have a happy and powerful Tendency, to put Iniquity Itſelf to the Bluſh, and to Shame the wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane from their ungodly Courſes; or to allure and charm them, into the Paths of Holineſs &amp; Righteouſneſs. The happy and direct Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch <hi>Rulers</hi> to promote the Intereſt of the <hi>State,</hi> is obvious to all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Branch of Religion, that Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately promotes the Welfare of the State, is, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Loyalty in the People.</hi> As Rulers are raiſed up by GOD, not for their own Sakes, but the People's; there is the higheſt Reaſon, they ſhould be treated with Reſpect, Honour and Submiſſion. For People to treat their Perſons or Characters, with Rudeneſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect; to ſlight &amp; vilify their Laws, or raſhly cenſure their Adminiſtrations; to cheriſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy and mutinous Diſpoſitions, or give into Seditious &amp; riotous Practices, is very inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable;—This is to counteract the great, and good, and beneficial Deſign, of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and is highly injurious to the <hi>Public:</hi> on the Contrary, to treat them with a Deference and Reſpect, ſuitable to the Dignity of their Places; freely to Submit to their Authority &amp; Laws, and chearfully to afford them (as in Point of Juſtice &amp; Equity, they are bound to do) a ſuitable and honourable Maintenance, according to the Rank they hold in the State,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007230_0015_102B40BEB45A5030"/>
and the Importance and Dignity of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; and to bow the Knee before God, the Father of Lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect Gift; that He would bleſs their Perſons, and proſper and ſucceed their Adminiſtrations: this, 'tis apparent, has a direct Tendency, and is very neceſſary, to the <hi>Public Weal and Tranquility.</hi> Now, the Laws of <hi>Religion</hi> indiſpenſably exact, and a Principle of it prevailing in the Heart, will lead and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe People, to a chearful Yielding all due Honour, Submiſſion and Loyalty, to their civil Rulers. Theſe are the Laws of Chriſt; <hi>Let every Soul be Subject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God: the Powers that be are ordained of God.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom xiii 1.</note> Submit yourſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake.</hi>

this, naturally and Immediately conduces, to the Well-being and Happineſs of Man-kind, and to the Peace and Proſperity of the <hi>State.</hi> Now ſuch an upright &amp; amiable Conduct, the Laws of God indiſpenſably require. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth Righteouſneſs.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. xi. 7.</note> To do Juſtice and Judgment, is more acceptable to the Lord than Sacrifice.</hi>

When Perſons are peeviſh &amp; litigious, and ready to take Fire on the ſlighteſt Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are apt to put the worſt Conſtruction, on the Words &amp; Actions of others, and by artful, malicious Inſinuations, or inhuman &amp; barbarous Comment on their Imperfections, they foment Jealouſies &amp; mutual Averſions; when ſuch a Temper prevails &amp; becomes common, 'tis no Wonder, if the ſacred Bonds of Peace are burſt aſunder, and conſum'd; and the <hi>Body politic</hi> is thrown into Diſorders, unnatural &amp; fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Contention &amp; Strife is an inteſtine Malady, that preys upon the Vitals of a <hi>State,</hi> and naturally tends to its Ruin &amp; Deſtruction: now, <hi>Religion</hi> is deſign'd to heal the vitious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Men, to ſuppreſs &amp; root out, thoſe Luſts, &amp; evil Qualities, which are the unhappy Sources of Contention &amp; Strife; and to unite Man-kind in the ſtrongeſt Bonds of Love and Peace. It requires, that we make it our Study and Endeavour, to live in Love, in Unity and Harmony with our fellow Men. <hi>Let all Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, &amp; Wrath, &amp; Anger, &amp; Clamour &amp; evil ſpeaking be put away from You, with all Malice.

That Sacred <hi>Volume,</hi> that contains <hi>our Religion</hi> came down from GOD, and is attended with ſuch apparent Marks &amp; Evidences of its divine Original, as powerfully recommend it to all Mankind: and as the Religion of the Goſpel is moſt wiſely contriv'd, and powerfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the Tranquility of the State; if the Matter be conſider'd in this Light, 'tis plainly incumbent on the Rulers of a People, as they would promote the Peace &amp; Happineſs of the Community, which is the End &amp; Buſineſs of their Office, to ſee that the <hi>Miniſters of Religion</hi> are ſuitably encouraged &amp; ſupported. The <hi>public Means of Education</hi> likewiſe are to be regarded, as <hi>public Means of Religion,</hi> and as ſuch, to be tenderly cheriſhed &amp; liberally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.

favourable Point of Light; and powerfully to recommend it, to the moſt cordial Patronage, and generous Regards of the Government.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>We ſee hence, in Proportion as Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality prevail, the Foundations of a State are weakned, Its Felicity impair'd, and the juſt Judgments of offended Heaven, may reaſonably be fear'd.</hi> As Vertue &amp; Religion raiſe a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Honor &amp; Felicity, Sin tends to ſink and ruin them, and it raiſes the Indignation of the moſt high GOD, and expoſes their moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Intereſts to be ſwept away by his deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Rebukes. In this View of the Caſe; what Reaſon—what abundant Reaſon have we, to reflect on the State of this Land, of this Colony in particular, with a trembling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern! For, how is this Land degenerated from its primitive Purity and Holineſs!—ſtain'd &amp; contaminated with Iniquity &amp; Vice!

How is that Reliſh for ſerious Godlineſs, and ſtrict Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which render'd them, the excellent and honourable of the Earth, vitiated among their
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007230_0022_102B40CC59A239B0"/>
Children? And what Vice, what Immorality almoſt can be named, but 'tis practis'd among us? Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Falſhood, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, Uncharitableneſs, Uncleanneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Prophaneneſs, to mention no more—Theſe tend, in the natural Train of Things, to ſink and ruin us: but that is not all; they ſtir up the Indignation of GOD againſt us; they break down the Wall of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting Providence around us, and throw open the Flood-gates, to all Manner of Evils &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities to ruſh in upon us. How long it may pleaſe a long-ſuffering GOD, to bear with a rebellious People, or how ſoon, he will whet his glittering Sword, and his Right-Hand will take hold on Vengeance, we know not; but this we well know, that it infinitely concerns ſuch a People, without Delay, to repent of their Sins, reform their Lives, and return obediently to GOD and their Duty.

               <hi>Honoured Fathers,</hi> I doubt not, 'tis with Satisfaction and Pleaſure you reflect; that the Holy Religion we all profeſs, with unſearchable Wiſdom is deſign'd and calculated by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author of it, not only to anſwer &amp; attain, its primary and great Deſign, the Happineſs and Salvation of Men in the coming World; but, likewiſe, ſo ſuited, in the beſt Manner ſuited, and directly tends, to further and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Welfare and Felicity of civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities on Earth.

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007230_0023_102B238E83A32318"/>
recommend <hi>Religion</hi> to You, as the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and excellent, the moſt important and neceſſary Thing in the World. As You are Men, and the Subjects of GOD and his SON, your higheſt Intereſt, your Peace and Comfort and Tranquility in this World, and your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs &amp; Well-being in the next, are depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Point: and as You are the Rulers of this People, your Intereſt &amp; Proſperity are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in it 'Tis therefore of the utmoſt Importance, that in all your Conduct, &amp; all your Adminiſtrations, <hi>Religion</hi> be your prevailing, your governing Principle: under the bleſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence thereof, you are ſteadily, vigorouſly to exert yourſelves, to promote the Tranquility &amp; Welfare of this Government; by framing ſuch Laws, as are requiſite, for the ſuppreſſing and rooting out of Immorality and Vice, and the promoting Righteouſneſs and every ſocial Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; by lodging the executive Authority and Power, in the Hands of faithful Men—Men that fear GOD and hate Covetouſneſs; and effectually providing, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> that the Laws of the Colony, be faithfully, thoroughly executed; by protecting and cheriſhing the Miniſters and Churches of CHRIST; and by extending your conſtant, generous Regards to <hi>the School of the Prophets.</hi> This laſt is a Matter of ſo great and general Importance, (as any one will the more eaſily perceive at
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007230_0024_102B40D04D86D078"/>
ſuch a Time, when ſo many Flocks of CHRIST are deſtitute, and as Sheep without a Shepherd, and are looking and crying thither, in vain cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a ſupply;) as might well juſtify a Warmth and Importunity of Addreſs, which in a Matter of little Moment, would be quite inexcuſable, before an Audience, I ſo highly, ſo juſtly revere: but I chuſe rather to take it for granted, that You are fully ſenſible of the Importance of the Caſe, and that your Fatherly Protection, your conſtant Smiles, and generous Support, will chearfully be afforded to that <hi>Seminary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, Permit me to recommend it, as of the biggeſt Importance, that You be careful to promote <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſo the Welfare of the <hi>State,</hi> by animating your People to every Thing that is laudable and praiſe-worthy, by your own Example, Countenance and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; by frowning upon the vicious, the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and unjuſt; by Scorning the Scorner, after the Example of GOD, and ſhewing Grace and Favour to the lowly and virtuous; by ſetting Religion in all its Beauty &amp; captivating Charms before our Eyes, in the Holineſs and Sanctity of your own Converſation. <q>Evil Rulers have ever been able to render Vice reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and cannot the righteous do as much for Virtue? is Virtue (the greateſt of all earthly Bleſſings! the faireſt and the lovelieſt

of all human Accompliſhments!) the only Thing, which Power cannot render ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable? Which Majeſty cannot manifeſt to be lovely? nor Courts, becoming? Can the higheſt Examples only influence to Evil? GOD forbid? this were to ſtrip Grandeur of its nobleſt Prerogative, as well as its trueſt and richeſt Intereſt. Let our Rulers hear the Advice of a Ruler, (the wiſeſt of all earthly Rulers) upon this Head;</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Reverend Fathers and Brethren.</hi> We are not only Members of Civil Society in Common with Others, and as ſuch, under Engagements to promote its Welfare, and to do this, in thoſe Ways and Methods, Religion dictates and preſcribes; but, we are by divine Deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Appointment, <hi>the Miniſters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> and as ſuch, under peculiar Obligations to advance its ſacred Intereſts.

and building them up to a Meetneſs for the heavenly State.

We muſt likewiſe explain and Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, the various Precepts of Morality, and Rules of holy Living, and place them in their
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007230_0026_102B40D4B717F548"/>
native and amiable Light, and enforce them on the Minds of Men, by the ſtrongeſt and moſt engaging Motives; ſuch eſpecially, as are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the bleſſed Goſpel, than which, none can be more ſtriking and powerful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reverend, Reſpected,</hi> You well know, 'tis the plain, ſerious, affectionate Preaching of CHRIST crucified, and his unſearchable Riches, the Merit of his Croſs, the Prevalence of his Interceſſion, and the Power of his Grace, and the other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Doctrines of the Goſpel, that are nearly connected therewith; GOD has been wont eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to own and bleſs; and we may chearfully expect, he will ſtill own and bleſs to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of Faith towards our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Repentance from dead Works, and all the excellent Fruits of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, in Life and Converſation. And if we thus plant, thus water, (ſtill enforcing all our Miniſtrations in the Houſe of GOD, by the ſanctity and exemplary Obedience of our own Lives) and GOD ſhall pleaſe to give the Increaſe; we ſhall be the happy Inſtruments of promoting the moſt important and valuable Intereſt of our fellow-men; of forming them to Loyalty and Subjection to Civil Authority, not for Wrath, but for Conſcience Sake; and to the diligent Practiſe of the various Duties and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Chriſtian and Social Life; and ſo of

And when we conſider the ineſtimable Worth of immortal Souls, commited to our Care; the Danger, the amazing Danger, many of them are in, of periſhing and being miſerable forever; the gracious Proviſion made in the Goſpel for their Salvation; and the ſtrict and ſolemn Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we muſt quickly render to GOD the Judge of all, of our Conduct in the Miniſtry; ought not theſe affecting Views, to quicken and animate all our Powers to advance the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Intereſt of the Redeemer, in the World; and the Happineſs and Salvation of our Fellow Men? May CHRIST JESUS our divine Maſter, who purchas'd the Church, here on Earth with his own Blood, and being return'd to his Throne in the Heavens; has committed the Care of it to his Miniſters; ever afford us his gracious Preſence,—make us wiſe to win Souls, and faithful in our LORD'S

There is great Need of a Reformation: the Sins and Abominations to be found among us, are ſo many and ſo great; that we may well fear the angry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> and the fearful Rebukes of his Providence: and how ſoon it will pleaſe the Judge of all the Earth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by our numerous Tranſgreſſions, by our Impenitence, our Contempt of the glorious Goſpel, and the Means of it, to pour his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation on a thankleſs Land, and inflict his

Vengeance on a polluted guilty People; we know not: be ſure, if You continue incorrigible and unreform'd, You muſt expect, ſooner or later, that Wrath will overtake You; and that the deſolating Judgments of Heaven will light upon You. It infinitely concerns You, <hi>Sirs,</hi> that without Delay, You repent and return to GOD and your Duty. See to it, that Religion be planted deep in your Hearts, and that it has a prevailing, Sovereign Influence on your Lives;—that you live in the ſteady Practice of all the amiable Duties of it; of ſerious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Piety towards the bleſſed GOD; of Loyalty and dutiful Submiſſion to our Civil Rulers; of Juſtice and Equity, of Truth and Faithfulneſs in all your Dealings; of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Sobriety, and of Diligence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in your ſeveral Callings; ſtudying the Things that make for Peace, and the Things, whereby You may edify one another; and adorning the Doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all Things.</p>
            <p>This is the appointed Way, and a Way which in its own Nature tends to promote the public Welfare &amp; Happineſs: and to this, you are all bound, moſt ſolemnly bound, as You have named the Name of CHRIST, and taken upon You the Profeſſion of his holy Religion.</p>

If you approve yourſelves to GOD the ſupreme Ruler of the World, in the ſincere Practice of Holineſs and Goſpel Obedience; and walk humbly, fruitfully and obediently before Him; This will be Matter of Support and unſpeakable Conſolation to You, when You come to leave the Society of Mortals here on Earth, and to lay down your Heads in the dark and ſilent Grave; This will enable You, to look up with Confidence and holy Boldneſs, in that great Day of the Lord; when all the civil Diſtinctions that obtain, among Men ſhall be no more; when all the tranſitory Scenes of Time ſhall diſappear; when the Kingdoms and Empires of the Earth ſhall melt away; and CHRIST himſelf ſhall deliver up the Kingdom, to GOD even the FATHER, and GOD ſhall be all in all.</p>
