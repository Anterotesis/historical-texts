            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS I have sometime said unto you, so I now write, That there be none on Earth that have so great and eminent a Calling from man to take care of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that they be instructed in the wayes of life by Christ Jesus, as your selves have. For, besides the <hi>Right Honourable Corporation</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> our Soveraign hath ordered a Trust to be committed to such as shall be in y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I finde few English Students willing to engage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so dim a Work as this is. God hath in mercy raised up sundry among themselves to a competent ability to teach their Countrymen. Many have been sent forth by the Church this Winter to divers places, and not without good success, through the grace of Christ: of which I shall (if God will, and that I live) give you an account at your next

Sitting. I finde it necessary for me to instruct them (as in Principles of Art, so) in the way of communicating the good knowledge of God, which I conceive is most familiarly done by way of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues;</hi> an Essay whereunto I do here present unto you: purposing, if the Lord will, and that I live, to do more of the like kinde hereafter. My earnest Request unto your selves, is, That in all your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Colonies you would take care that due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of Lands and Waters may be allowed them, whereon Townships and Churches may be (in after-Ages) able to subsist; and suffer not the English to strip them of all their Lands, in places fit for the Sustenance of the life of man.

            <p>THese <hi>Dialogues</hi> are partly <hi>Historical,</hi> of some things that were done and said; and partly <hi>Instructive,</hi> to show what might or should have been said, or that may be (by the Lords assistance.) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after done and said, upon the like occasion. It is like to be one work incumbent upon our <hi>Indian</hi> Churches and Teachers, for some Ages, to send forth Instruments to call in others from Paganry to pray unto God: Instructions therefore of that nature are requisite; and what way more familiar, then by way of <hi>Dialogues</hi>? For sundry weighty Reasons I desire and endeavour, that our Learned <hi>Indians</hi> should learn at least the <hi>English Tongue;</hi> our <hi>Indian Churches</hi> holding Communion with the <hi>English Churches,</hi> must perform that Service in the <hi>English Tongue.</hi> If the Lord give life, and length of dayes, I may hereafter put forth these or the like <hi>Dialogues</hi> in the <hi>Indian Tongue;</hi> but what I shall live to do, is known to God. While I live, I desire to follow this Work, and serve the Lord with all my might, according to my poor measure of Ability, and wait upon the Lord for his Blessing, by the concurrent prayers of the faithfull.</p>

                  <p>Touching your question, Whether praying to God doth exempt us from Sicknesses, Poverty, and fills us with food and garments: I answer, If praying to God did bring with it outward plenty and worldly prosperity, then all carnal people would pray to God, not because they love God, or praying to God, but because they love themselves, and love food, clothing, and worldly pleasures; but the benefits of praying are spiritual and heavenly, it teaches us to know God, and the evil of sin; it teacheth us to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For Religion teacheth us to be diligent in labour six dayes, and on the seventh day to rest, and keep it an holy Sabbath; and God hath promised that <hi>the dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If your praying to God do indeed teach you the true way of being rich, as you say, how then cometh it to pass that you are so poor still? for you have prayed to God these twenty years and more, and I do not see that you have increased in riches very much, you are still poor: where be your Riches? where be your flocks and herds of Cattel? where be your Clothes? what great Houses have you built? where be your fields of Corn, Barns and Orchards? Alas, you are not like the English; and therefore I doubt upon this point, it is not as you say, that praying to God teacheth you the right way to be rich.</p>

                  <p>This is one of the least, the last, the lowest of those things that our Religion teacheth us. There be two sorts of riches; Earthly riches, of which onely you speak, and Heavenly riches, which Gods Word calleth true riches. These Earthly riches are but temporary, and shall soon perish, but the true riches are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and eternal, they last for ever. And we have spent these twenty Years in seeking chiefly after heavenly riches, for so God commandeth us in his Word, <hi>Seek first the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> as for these earthly riches <hi>they shall be added to you,</hi> so much as you need. And the Word of God commandeth us to <hi>be content if we have food and clothes</hi>; Now we have food and clothes more then we were wont to have before we prayed to G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The true riches which we spend our time to seek after, are, 1. The knowledge of the great God, who hath made this vast World, and governeth the same by his Wisdome and Power, and who hath made Man, and governeth us by his holy Laws and Commandments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The knowledge of our selves, to be miserable sinners, and do daily offend and sin against God, provoking his wrath against us, to punish us for our transgressions against his holy Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The knowledge of Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world, who hath in unspeakable love took a course to deliver us from the wrath of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The knowledge of the grace of God in Jesus Christ, whereby he bringeth us to repent of our sins, to convert and turn from all our evil wayes, and to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to walk with God in the wayes of holiness and righteousness before him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The knowledge of the Means of grace, the Ordinances of God; whereby we walk with God in wayes of Civil Government, in wayes of Justice, and good Order. And in the Ordinances of Worshipping God, in the sanctifying of the Sabbaths, and walking in the Communion of Saints, by the Word of God, and Prayer, and Singing of Psalms.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the knowledge of the estate of all men after death; how the godly men that penitently believe in Christ, go to Heaven when they die; and the wicked, that refuse to repent and believe, they go to Hell, and there abide till the Day of Judgement: at which day or time, when it cometh, all men shall rise again and be judged according to their deeds in this life; and then shall the godly go with Christ to eternal Glory, and the wicked shall be cast into Hell Soul and Body, and there be tormented with the Devils for ever.</p>

                  <p>But all mankinde have an higher and better part then the body, we have a Soul, and that Soul shall never die: Our Soul is to converse with God, and to converse in such things as do concern God, and Heaven, and an eternal estate, either in happiness with God, if we walk with him and serve him in this life, or in misery and torment with the Devil, if we serve him in this life. The service of God doth con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But the service of the Devil is in committing sins of the flesh, which defile both body and soul, and reach to Hell, and will turn all to fire and flame to torment your souls and bodies to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Now consider, all your pleasures and delights are such as defile you with sin, and will turn to flame, to burn and torment you; they provoke God to wrath, who hath created the Prison of Hell to torment you, and the more you have took pleasure in sin, the greater are your offences against God, and the greater shall be your torments.</p>

                  <p>The Book of God is no invention of English-men, it is the holy Law of God himself, which was given unto man by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore English-men had any knowledge of God; and all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they have, they have it out of the Book of God: and this Book is given to us as well as to them, and it is as free for us to search the Scriptures as for them. So that we have our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from an higher hand, then the hand of man: it is the great Lord God of Heaven and Earth, who teacheth us these great things of which we speak. Yet this is also true, that we have great cause to be thankful to the English, and to thank God for them, for they had a good Country of their own, but by Ships sailing into these parts of the World, they heard of us, and of our Country, and of our nakedness, ignorance of God, and wilde condition; God put it into their hearts to desire to come hither, and teach us the good knowledge of God; and their King gave them leave so to do, and in our Country to have their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to serve God according to the Word of God. And being come hither, we gave them leave freely to live among us: they have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased of us a great part of those Lands which they possess; they love us, they do us right, and no wrong willingly; if any do us wrong, it is without the consent of their Rulers, and upon our Complaints our wrongs are righted. They are (many of them, especially the Ruling part) good men, and desire to do us good. God put it into the heart of one of their Ministers (as you all know) to teach us the knowledge of God, by the Word of God, and he hath Translated the holy Book of God into our Language, so that we can perfectly know the minde and counsel of God: and out of this Book have I learned all that I say unto you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you need no more doubt of the truth of it, then you have cause to doubt that the Heaven is over our head, the Sun shineth, the Earth is under our feet, we walk and live upon it, and breathe in the Air; for as we see with our eyes these things to be so, so we reade with our own eyes these things which I speak of, to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Gods own Book, and we feel the truth thereof in our own hearts.</p>

                  <p>It is an ill time for you to come to perswade us to pray to God, when praying to God is so opposed, hated and hindred; you may be more like to prevail with us, when praying to God is of credit, honour, and good esteem.</p>

                  <p>We know there be many sins among the English, which provoke God to be angry with them, and to punish them, to the end he might bring them to repentance. When we exhort you to pray, and to serve the God of the English, we call you to imitate the virtues and good wayes of the English, wherein you shall be acceptable to the Lord: We do not call you to imitate their sins, whereby they and you shall provoke the anger and displeasure of the Lord. And what though God doth chastise his people for their sins? it is his wisdome, faithfulness and love so to do: a Child will not run away from his wise and loving Father, because he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stises him for his faults, but will love him the better, fear him the more, and learn thereby to be a good Childe. The wise English love God the more, for his wise Chastisement of them for their sins. And why may not I use it as an Argument to perswade you to choose him to be your God, who will love and encourage you in all virtue, and love and punish you for all sins, that he might bring you to repentance and amendment of life. Gods Rods have more encouragement to a wise heart, then discouragement in them.</p>

Touching the fear of Thunder, the Word of God saith it is terrible, and the bruit Beasts tremble at it: it is sometime called <hi>The Voice of God,</hi> by reason of the terribleness of it; and the reason of its terrour to man is, because we are great sinners, and have deserved Gods wrath, and it should move our hearts to repentance for our sins, and take heed of provoking the anger of that God, who is able to utter so terrible a voice, and can dash down destroying fire upon us worms, who are no wayes able to defend our selves.</p>

                  <p>Now my Kinsmen and Friends let us discourse a little about the Question propounded, <hi>Why we pray unto God before and after Meat?</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ did so before meat, as it is written of him in many examples; and we are not to doubt but he did the same after meat, because the Lord hath commanded the same so expresly, saying, <hi>When thou hast eaten and art full, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware lest thou forget the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to shew you what great reason we have thus to do, consider that God doth some of his chief works in this world, in the matter of our eating, which no creature can do: for take you a Tray of meat, and ask, Who can turn this into blood, and flesh, and sinews, and bones, and skin? and who can give every part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy its due proportion, that one part shall not overgrow the other, but every part alike? Who but God can do this? And


<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000161_0015_0FA2B47134D93490"/>
who but God can make our bodies to grow to such an appointed stature, and then to grow no more? And who but God can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our health, and turn away sicknesses? Now these marvellous things God doth for us every day, and every time we eat, and therefore is it not very good reason that we should pray and give thanks to God at such time as he doth such great and obliging things for us?</p>
                  <p>Again, God provideth all our food for us; he provideth Corn, not we our selves, we do but a little towards it, the great work is Gods: all that we do is to put our Corn into the ground, and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ep the ground clean about it, but God makes it to grow, he gives it a root, a blade, a stalk, and ears, whereby one Corn shall become three or four or five hundred. Who but God can do this? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Corn is of his providing.</p>
                  <p>Again, who provideth water, and watereth the Corn? is it not God? for when Springs and Rivers are dried up, what can men do, but cry to God? and then God will bring Clouds, like great Bottles full of water, and drop them down upon the withered and parched Earth, and thereby make the Corn and Grass, and all fruits to grow. Who but God can do this?</p>
                  <p>Again, God provides Flesh for us to feed upon, for he maketh the grass and herbs to grow, and when the beasts do feed thereon, he doth turn those Leaves into blood, flesh, sinews and bones; and this he giveth us for food, and turneth it into blood, flesh, sinews and bones in us. All these wonderful works God doth, in the matter of feeding us; and therefore is it not good reason we should then pray to him?</p>

                  <p>Do all you praying <hi>Indians</hi> thus do when you are weary and tired with labour, or travel, or hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do you pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go to rest? what is the reason of your so doing?</p>

                  <p>We alwayes do so: and if any should at any time through sloth and sleepiness fail so to do, we judge our selves for our sin, &amp; repent, and confess our sin unto God, and beg pardon and mercy for Christ his sake.</p>
                  <p>And there is great reason thus to pray unto God before we go to rest; for be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>des what I said that God giveth us rest, and therefore it is fit humbly to ask it of him; There be many other Reasons why we should thus do: for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. VVe must give God thanks for all the mercies we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all the day, which are more then the moments of the time that we live.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. VVe must pray for Gods protection of us when we are asleep, we lye like so many dead men, and how easily might mischief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us, either by Fire, or by an Enemy, if God did not defend and keep us; but when God is our keeper we may rest quietly, in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without fear, under the covert of his hand: and by faith in Gods protection we sleep quietly without fear, whereas you that do not pray, nor believe, nor commit your selves to God, you do alwayes sleep in fear and terrour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moreover, our sleep and rest is a great reparation of our strength and spirits, and preservation of our health. VVhile we sleep our food is boiled up within us, and digested into all parts of our body, and new spirits are extracted out of our food, and sent up both to our head, heart, and all parts of our body, so that we are fresh and strong in the morning after a good nights rest. Now all this is the special work of God, beyond the power and skill of man to perform for us, and therefore it is great reason to pray for this blessing when we go to rest.</p>

And VVestward, not onely all the <hi>Massachusets</hi> pray, but also a great part of <hi>Nipmuk</hi>; yea and <hi>the fields are ripe unto the harvest</hi> in many places more, whom I will not name until they have given up themselves to the Lord, to forsake their vanities, and to pray unto God. The Church of Christ at <hi>Natik</hi> have sent forth many into many parts of the Country, to call them in unto Jesus Christ. I am sent unto you, and I have good hope that God will bow your hearts to pray unto God. So that the <hi>praying Indians</hi> are many, and like to be more every year: And our hope is the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Lord hath raised up sundry of our young men (who were children when we first prayed unto God) unto good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scriptures, and are able to teach others the good knowledge of God, and are fit to be sent forth unto all parts of the Country, to teach them to pray unto God.</p>

Tear our hair from our heads, our skin from our flesh, our flesh from our bones, you shall as soon perswade us to suffer you to do so by us, as to perswade us to part with our old delights and courses.

You say you have many Gods, but they are no Gods. There is but one God, the great Creator of this great World. Did your Gods make this World? the Heavens, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Clouds, the Seas, and the whole Earth? No, no; God made this whole world.

<list>
                           <item>1. His wonderful Birth; <hi>A Virgin conceived.</hi> Of which, see <hi>Luke</hi> 1.26, to 39.</item>

                           </item>
                           <item>3. What Christ did for us, and doth, signified by his Name <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; He taketh away our sins.</hi> And this he doth two wayes:
<list>
                                 <item>1. He taketh away our sins out of Gods sight, by dying in our stead, and so meriting a pardon for all our sins.</item>
                                 <item>

He taketh away our sins out of our own hearts, by working Repentance in us, and Faith in his Name, giving us his Spirit, and sanctifying of us by his Grace, and leading us in all holiness of life and conversation.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>The third part of this Text is, how Jesus Christ is enabled to do these great things for us. This signified by his second Name, <hi>God with us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Christ was God and Man in one Person; and that maketh his death of infinite value with God, to obtain a pardon for all our sins.</p>
                     <p>And this maketh him of infinite power to overcome our hearts, and turn them unto God.</p>

                  <p>Oh I am surprized, I am amazed, you have ravished my Soul, you have brought a light into my Soul. I wonder at my self: where have I been? what have I done? I am like one raised out of a dark pit; you have brought me forth into the Sunshine. I begin to see about me: if I look back, and down into the pit where I have been all my dayes, I wonder at my self what a dead dark thing I have been; when I look upon you, I see you like an Angel of light. I have heard of this business of praying to God, some have spoken ill of it, some have spoken favour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You have dealt with me like as the Fishers do by the fish, you laid a Bait for me to make me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it, and bite at it, but I saw not your hook, until you had catch'd my Soul; and now I am catch'd, I see it was not for my hurt, but for my great good. The light which I do already see is a beautiful and desireable thing, and therefore I pray you go on, and tell me more of this new way.</p>

                  <p>The two first things you are to consider of now you are come into the light, and your heart willing to attend unto this great work of praying to God, are these:

                  <p>Of God, know his Greatness, Goodness, VVisdome, and Power. He hath made all things in this great world; all things above us are his works, he made the Heavens, the Sun, Moon, Stars, Clouds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all things below, the Seas, the Earth, and all things that are in them: he made Man, and gave him dominion over all his works in this world, and a Law of Life, under the penalty of


<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000161_0030_0FA2B481CC208DA0"/>
damnation: and all this God did in six days; so great is God above man. The Law which he gave to man is holy, just and good: but man by the temptation of evil Angels, who by their sin became to be Devils, I say man broke the Law which God gave him, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against God, turned Rebel against God, and served the Devil: and in this rebellion all the children of men go on to this day.</p>
                  <p>Gods Law is in Ten Commandments, wherein he requireth of man to know and worship God, fear his Name, and keep his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths; and other Laws forbid Lust, Murther, Stealing, and all other evils. Moreover, God hath annexed unto his Law a great Promise, <hi>Do and live,</hi> with a just Punishment, <hi>Sin and die</hi> eternally; namely, that all the breakers of this Law, and sinners against him, shall be punished in hell fire with eternal torments. And this is the condition of all mankinde, and it is our estate, that by our sins against God we have deserved to die, and then to be cast away down into hell fire, to be tormented among the Devils, who tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to sin, and whom we have served in our life time: now toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them we must be tormented for ever.</p>

                  <p>Oh you have now killed me again: By the first light you shewed me, I thought you had made me alive, and I joyed in the light, but I understood it not. Now your light is become a sword, it hath pierced through my heart, by it I now see I am a dead man. Alas, I have been a sinner all my dayes, I am guilty of more sins then I have lived dayes, many sins in a day have I committed: Night and day have I offended God, and broke his Law. I have served the Devil and not God, I have done nothing that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, I have only served the Devil, and committed sin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have deserved to be damned in hell, and to be tormented among the Devils for ever, whom in this life I have served with so much delight; And now poor miserable I, what shall I do? These Trees under whose shade we sit, why fall they not upon me and crush this rebellious worm in pieces, and send me away to the place of eternal torment? These Rocks and hills about us, why fall they not upon me and break me into dust and powder, and send me away unto perdition? will God regard these complaints of mine? what are these tears of mine? can they quench hell fire? nay, will they not rather be oyle unto those flames? I am in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, help I can finde none; the greatness of Gods Majesty and power, against whom I a finite poor worm have sinned, doth most amaze me. I pray help me further to understand the great majesty of God.</p>

                  <p>I will (as well as I can) declare it unto you. God is One in Three; <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> which we must believe and admire, though we cannot demonstrate. I shall at this time say no further of that point, onely thus much; God one in Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, in his infinite Wisdome and Understanding, conceiveth the Image of himself as the onely adequate object of his infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. God <hi>conceiving</hi> is the Father: God <hi>conceived</hi> is the Son; this intellectual act of <hi>conceiving,</hi> is called Begetting: God <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,</hi> and God <hi>conceived,</hi> by an infinite act of volition, loveth himself; and this <hi>Love</hi> is the holy Ghost, proceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son. God as he is Father hath made all things, and given man a Law. God in the dispensation of the Covenant of Works hath agreed within himself that the Son of God should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume unto himself an humane Nature, which is subject unto the Law of God. This glorious Person is God and Man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, named <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> This glorious Person Jesus Christ, is a Person of more worth then all Mankinde beside. This glorious Person Jesus Christ came into this world, and offered to God by Covenant his own life in our stead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and died for us to satisfie divine Justice for the sin of man: with this Sacrifice God hath said he is


<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000161_0033_0FA2B484889A31B8"/>
satisfied for the sin of man. Thus Jesus Christ hath honoured Gods Law, by satisfying of divine Justice, and now Jesus Christ hath power to pardon whom he will.</p>

                  <p>God hath made a new Covenant of grace which he hath opened in the Gospel, and Jesus Christ hath published it to all the world: and the sum of it is this; That whosoever shall penitently turn from sin towards God, and believe in Jesus Christ, he shall have a pardon of all his sins, and be partaker of eternal life, through the grace and mercy of God in Jesus Christ. <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi>

                  <p>In the same manner the Spirit of God by the word is able to create Faith in you to believe in Jesus Christ. This work the Lord useth to work in us by the Promises of the Gospel. Now I will propound unto you at present but one Promise, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28, 29. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall finde rest unto your souls.</hi> Now I ask you, Are you weary and heavy laden with your sins?</p>

                  <p>We are surprized by the night, we must rest under these Trees this night. I do account this day well spent, though we have made but little progress toward the place of our intendment: but I have been about the work I came abroad upon, though not the persons I intended. Thus God doth over-rule the wayes of men; he foreseeth and ordereth that which we had no thoughts upon: and therefore in that we have spent this day in such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and Discourse, wherein we have seen so much of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ with us; let us now spend this night in prayers and praises unto the Lord, who hath found us before we sought for him. You were going about another business, you little thought of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jesus Christ by the way, and finding mercy to your Soul, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of your sins, and to become a <hi>praying Indian.</hi>

                  <p>Your discourse doth heighten my admiration. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God hath thought of me when I thought not of him; he had a care of my Soul when I had no care of my self; God hath pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me out of darkness, and brought me into a most wonderful light, that I should be forced to see the wonderful things of Gods Law, &amp; of my eternal condemnation by it, my helpless and hopeless condition that I was in.</p>
                  <p>And then, that the Lord should open unto me a possibility of escape, that a ransome and remedy might be found by the infinite wisdome and mercy of God; and that Jesus Christ had not onely accomplished that great work, but offered the fruit and benefit of it to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and called me to rest in him, and to be trust my Soul with him for pardon of all my sins, and for eternal life in Jesus Christ. These things are matter of my admiration, and shall be to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. My life remaining shall be spent in admiring, and in obeying and suffering, as you have now taught me; I shall account nothing too dear for Christ, who hath not accounted his own most precious life too dear for me. Whereas I am now instructed, that he being


<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000161_0036_0FA2B486F624B3D8"/>
God and Man in one person, his life was of more value then all the lives of all mankinde; and that he did not forbear to offer that precious life for me; I must, I will, by his grace assisting, admire at this mercy for ever: and therefore the motion that you made of spending this night in prayer and praises unto his holy Name, it is a most acceptable motion to my heart. My experience suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me matter abundantly to pray and praise his Name, but my ignorance is such as that I cannot tell how to utter my minde in words of knowledge suitable unto so great mercies as I have now experienced.</p>

                  <p>Your discourse doth lead me out to inform you in a great point of the grace and kingdome of Jesus Christ, and that is the gift and grace of Prayer, which the Spirit of Jesus Christ teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every new born Soul to perform: for so the Scripture saith, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.15. <hi>He hath given the Spirit of his Son, whereby we cry,</hi> and crying is an earnest manner of praying; and the matter of our cry is to say <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> that is, to call God our Father, and to ask him a Childes portion in the Name of Jesus Christ, as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that whatever we ask in the Name of Jesus Christ, it shall be surely granted, either the same thing or a better; for we are foolish children, and know not what is best for our selves, but our Father doth: and therefore when we make our prayers and request to God, we must leave the matter to his love &amp; wisdome, to give us what, and when, and how he will.</p>
                  <p>And because we are ignorant what to pray for, therefore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God who dwelleth in our heart, he is called the <hi>Spirit of Grace and of Supplication</hi>; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings, which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the minde of the Spirit, because he maketh interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the Saints, according to the will of God.</hi> Where we see that our weakness is supplied by the assistance of the Spirit, and he help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to pray for such things as please God, and in such a manner as pleaseth God. And this is the condition of every true convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believer, that he can pray, and desires to pray, and is ever lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his heart to G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our state in this world is not perfect, corruption is killed but in part; there be old roots remaining, which upon occasion offered will still be stirring, acting, appearing, as a tree that is cut down, the old roots will be growing, which must be kept down with a speedy cutting off. A field that is well weeded, will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce new weeds again, out of that natural propensity of the earth to bring forth weeds; but a watchful and diligent husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will be often weeding over his Corn fields: and so will our hearts be sending forth new weeds of sin, but we must be daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to watch and weed them out; our hearts have a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity to sin, and therefore must be kept with all diligence.

                  <p>The night spent in prayer hath let me finde a sweet taste in it, though I do already finde that it is a weariness to my flesh. I thank you for this Counsel, I desire I may remember and do it. What further Counsel will you give me?</p>

                  <speaker>Wab</speaker>
                  <p>You must be much conversant in the Word of God, and though you cannot yet reade the Word, yet you must get the help of others, and learn the word of God by heart; and you must meditate upon the same night and day, for so <hi>David</hi> did, Psal. 1.2. And the meditation on the Word will sanctifie the heart, and kill corruption, and will mightily help you to subdue it.</p>

                  <p>I see my self very ignorant, and therefore I am very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to learn Catechism, because I have heard and do perceive that is the foundation of all knowledge in Religion, being wisely gathered out of the Scripture.</p>

                  <speaker>Wab.</speaker>
                  <p>You say right about Catechism; we do therefore teach it our Children, that the principles of good knowledge may be sown and rooted in them from a Childe: and for that reason also do we send them to School, to learn to reade the Word of God, that they may be acquainted with the Word from a Childe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pen.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh what a loss is this to me, that I am to begin to learn Catechize and the Word of God now I am a man, which I might have been acquainted with from a Childe, had I been brought up among the <hi>praying Indians.</hi> How happy are your Children that are thus brought up. I suppose you are very diligent in this matter in Training up of your Children.</p>

                  <p>We have great cause to judge our selves for too much negligence in this point. A fifth Counsel I give you is, That you be constant and diligent in the exercise of the Worship of God in your Family, in these points: 1. You must Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pray in your Family, and teach them in Catechism, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures. 2. Alwayes before and after Meat you must pray and give thanks to God.</p>

                  <p>A sixth Counsel I give you is, That you do carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, and to come to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

                     <p>MY aged Uncle, I am glad that it hath pleased God once more to give me an opportunity to see you alive in this world. It is not unknown unto you, that I and many others have undertaken a new way of life, which is known to many by the name of <hi>Praying to God.</hi> The way that I formerly, and you still live in, is a way of worshipping the Devil, it is a way of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sin: and though it is a way pleasant and easie to the flesh, yet it leadeth to destruction and eternal torments. Man is made for another life after this life is ended; and though our body dieth and turneth to dust, yet the Soul is immortal, it dieth not, but at the death of the body it departeth to a place of eternal being, either in glory, or in misery. If we pray to God with a right heart, penitently turn from sin to God, and believe in Jesus Christ, then we shall have a pardon granted us, and eternal happiness with Jesus Christ. But if we do not turn to God, but worship and serve the Devil, and walk in the wayes of sin, then at death our Soul must be dragged to hell, and there tormented for ever among the Devils, whom we have obeyed and served in this life. These things, and many more, we do perfectly know, and believe to be true by the Word of God, which is the Sun-light of the Soul, even as the Sun is the great light of the outward world.</p>
                     <p>God hath put it into my heart to desire that your Soul might be blessed for ever; and the Church hath sent me, and I come in the Name of Jesus Christ to tell you these things, and beseech you to turn from these vain and evil wayes, and to believe in Jesus Christ, that your sins may be pardoned, and that your Soul may be saved in eternal glory.</p>

                     <p>Your love and desire of my good, I have no reason but to accept with kindness; but me thinks one thing in your discourse is doubtful. We see with our eyes, and know certainly that the


<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000161_0040_0FA2B48C44836540"/>
body dieth, and turneth to rottenness and dust, and why may not the Soul do so likewise? we see not what becometh of it, and to make such a stir, and change our course upon uncertainties, I have no liking to it, my Age inclineth me rather to be quiet, and not meddle with such unseen intricacies, utter for younger heads to minde.</p>

                     <p>Our bodies are the product of the seed of man, and that is made out of the food we eat, and our food grows out of the earth, so that our bodies are made of refined earth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at death turn to earth again, out of which it was made, and so God speaketh, <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.</hi> But the Soul is not s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; it is a Spirit, of a purer nature then earthly things, and it is immediately created by God, and therefore dieth not. Besides, we are assured by many infallible proofs out of the Word of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd by evidence of good Reason, that the Soul is immortal, which point we are taught in our Catechism. And not onely so, but G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d hath taught us, that at the end of the world the body shall be raised again out of the dust, and the Soul and body joyned together again, and then the person shall be judged by Jesus Christ, according to their deeds done in the flesh: those that live and die in their sins, shall be turned into hell, to be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by and with the Devils; but they that turn to God, and believe in Jesus Christ, shall be judged to go with Christ to heaven, and be ever with him in eternal glory.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this consideration doth more sharpen my request and intreaties of you, how shall I endure to see this body of yours, which I so respect and love, and that Soul of yours also, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unto eternal torments. And I pray you consider what a wound and torment it will then be, to remember, I was exhorted and intreated to turn to God and live; mercy in Christ was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, but I refused it: and therefore deservedly do you lose what you refused, and deservedly you suffer that torment you did choose, rather then to trouble your self with this business of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and believing in Jesus Christ.</p>

                     <p>These are great and deep things that I understand not: you young men have your blood warm, and your wits fresh and ripe, you can reade and understand these things. I am old and cold and dry, and half dead already, I have not strength enough left to be whetted up to such a new edge; let me alone to die in quiet, why should I take upon me such a disquiet to my minde, and disturbance to my self, and to my people? I have two Sons young and active men, I am very willing that they should take up this new way, perswade them to it if you will, but as for me, I am too old for such an undertaking.</p>

unto you: 1. To do well for your self as well as for your Sons, for your soul is as preceious as their souls be And 2. the most effectual means to perswade your Sons unto this way of wisdome, is for you to set them an exa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh the bitterness that my soul felt, in the horrour of my damned estate! No tongue can utter what my soul felt. I had a taste of hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in my soul; my meditation of Gods Omnis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="40" facs="unknown:000161_0043_0FA2B48E7752A8A0"/>Then God opened the mouth of this dear Servant of his, who told me that the infinite mercy and wisdome of God had found out a ransome, a way to satisfie Justice, and fulfil the Law, and to save poor condemned sinners, and that he himself had found mercy in that way. This bred some hope in my soul, and stayed me from sinking quite down, when I heard of a possibility: but still I was in distressing doubt and fear that it was but some delusion, because I could not see a possibility for Man or Angel, or any Creature, to satisfie and give a ransome to infinite Justice.</p>
                     <p>Then he declared to me, that it is true that no Creature could give a ransome to satisfie Justice, but God himself was able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the infinite Justice of God. To that I yielded, that God himself might satisfie his Justice, but still I was in the dark, I could not see this could possibly be. Then he opened me, that adored Doctrine of God his being One and Three, how God was one in Essence, three in Persons, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d the Father, God the Son, and God the holy Ghost; how the Father doth by an eternal intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual act conceive the Image of Himself, as being the only adequate Object he understands himself; and this is called the Begetting of the Son, by an intellectual conception of his own Image: and these two Subsistencies, do by an eternal act of Volition love each other; and this Love is the third Person in Trinity, proceeding from both the Father and the Son.</p>
                     <p>Now the eternal Majesty of God agreed within himself, that God the Son, the second Person in Trinity, should assume humane Nature to himself, and become a man, subject to the Law. This glorious Person is the greatest subject that ever the Law had, and this glorious Person is able perfectly to fulfil the Law, and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pay a ransome satisfactory to infinite Justice, who hath done it. This depth of divine Wisdome my soul admired, and shall do to eternity.</p>
                     <p>But still I was at a loss how I should be interested in the ransome that this glorious Person hath paid. Then did this Messenger of God declare unto me, that this glorious Person Jesus Christ had undertaken both parts of this work: First to atone, and reconcile God to man, by paying the ransome required, and by perfect fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Law: Secondly, to subdue the soul and will of man to turn, and submit to be reconciled to God. But this work of converting a soul to God is such, that as no man can convert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so no other Creature is able to do it, onely God himself can do it; and for that end, both the Father and Son have sent forth the holy Ghost, the eternal Spirit, to work upon the hearts of men, and to create the work of Faith in them by the Word, and then to take possession of, and dwell in believing souls, to mortifie their lusts, to sanctifie their hearts and lives, and to lead them in the way of grace unto glory.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:000161_0045_0FA2B49339ECEB20"/>He took that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>In these words we may observe these things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Vineyard</hi> where men labour, is the Church, and this way of praying to God; and sheweth that it is a laborious and a good work, and will cause us to bring forth good fruits, grapes and wine, which is pleasing to God and man. But beware of bringing forth sowre grapes; especially suffer no briars and thorns, but cut them down, and root them up, and cast them out.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Lord of this Vineyard</hi> is Jesus Christ, who calleth all men to come into this his Vineyard, and do these works. And this day I do in the Name of the Lord Jesus call you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to pray to God, come and work in this Vineyard. Hearken to this Call, and be no longer idle, follow your sins no longer, you have lived in sin long enough, stay no longer, but come in when you are called. Happy are you, if you obey and come; woe be to you, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Here be the several seasons of mens coming in, or the several Ages of men that do come in.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some come in while it is morning, that is, while they be young: therefore I call you Boyes, Youths and Girls, come you unto the Lords Vineyard, and give unto God the first-fruits of your dayes.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Lord went forth at the <hi>third hour,</hi> and called in young men and young women into his Vineyard: Hearken therefore you young men and young women to the Call of God, and come in.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Lord went forth at the <hi>ninth hour,</hi> that is, he called in men and women full grown, to ripeness of parts, and strength; you are called this day to come into the Lords Vineyard; be you perswaded to come in, and serve the Devil no longer: now turn unto the Lord.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Lord went forth the <hi>eleventh hour,</hi> that is, a little bfore night; and this doth mean you old men, and old women, come you into the Lords Vineyard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you see the Lord will accept you if you come. Do not think you are too old to serve the Lord; if your dayes be near finished, you had the more need come in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lest you die in your sins, and perish for ever.</p>
                     <p>When he had finished, an Objection was made by one; <hi>We dare not come in to pray to God, for we hear you are very severe if any be found<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Answ. <hi>Wab.</hi> God hath appointed punishments of sin to be Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick for their souls; and though Physick be bitter and sharp, yet its very wholesome, good and needful. If you were invited to dwell at such a Town where there is a Physician, would you say, No, I will not dwell there, because if I be sick I must take Physick; sure you would therefore go dwell at that place. So it is in this

In his life time we accepted his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at his request; and <hi>Msquammog</hi> his leaving us, is his own act and not ours. And therefore, beloved Sachem, let not your heart fear that praying to God will alienate your people from you; nay, be assured it will more firmly oblige their hearts unto you. This I know by experience, for the more beneficent you are unto them; the more obligation you lay upon them. And what greater bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence can you do unto them, then to further them in Religion, whereby they may be converted, pardoned, sanctified and saved.</p>

the power of <hi>non praying Indians,</hi> contrary to publick and evident Conditions. Against this, did some of the wiser sort (who saw the Trap) firmly stand; giving this Reason: The Fox came to the Lambs door, and would fain come in, but the Lambs refused. Then the Fox desired to let him put in but one Claw; the Lambs refused, saying, If he get in but one Claw, he will not rest till he have wringled in his whole body.

Besides you may put it to the trial, put it to the publick Vote; if you should do so, I do think that they will all promise to stick unto you if you pray to God: and then this Objection is cut off in the beginning of the work.

                  <p>As my Brother hath said, I acknowledge this to be (in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at least) a strong temptation. This was the temptation of <hi>Josias,</hi> that drew him to his Apostacy, he forsook his praying people, and adhered unto those who did not pray to God: but this was because his own heart did not love praying to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did better like of the wicked wayes of the <hi>non praying Indians.</hi> But what got he at last by adhering to the worst sort of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?

Likewise this very thing which you propose, was a temptation to <hi>Cutshamoquin</hi>; His praying to God did make such of his people as loved not that way, to waver in their subjection to him, and it did begin to make him waver in the matter of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God: but God did mercifully preserve him, and kept him stedfast to his dying day. But this he did, he went sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he used them kindly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let it not therefore be unacceptable unto you, to imitate so great, so good Examples. If Sachems might sin, and no body might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them, because they be rulers, and the Ministers and people are the subjects, it were the most miserable condition in the world to be a Sachem or a ruler, they run to hell without controll, and no body may say unto him, Why do you so?

                  <p>The former points we discoursed, I am willing they should still lie soaking in my heart and minde. I am not ready to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, or to draw forth any further speech about them. I choose rather to draw forth some of my other Doubts and Objections; unto which, if your Answers be as considerable and weighty, as they were to my former doubts, I shall then see cause to lay them up also a soaking, and pondering in my heart. Know this, that in the rowlings of my thoughts, the disquiet turnings and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings of my minde, do oft-times molest me with variety of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. I am sometimes in grief and anguish of minde, especially when I over look my life past, and remember the many sins and follies that I have stained my life and honour withall, I think with my self, What a fool have I been, that for the love of a lust, which Dogs and brute Creatures delight in, that I, a Man, a Sachem, should be so besotted, as to stain my honour, wound my Soul, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and expose my self to eternal damnation, and all this for a short delight that is gone with a blast, and leaves nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde but shame and sorrow; and these are durable and indelible, a sad effect of sensual pleasures. Ah what a fool have I been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I should have imployed my self in higher and greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the honour of God, and the good of my people.

                     </gap>te my pleasures, which have left such a sting and torment in my soul, which all my Estate and Honour cannot ease me of, but they are like to torment me for ever. I am never without wicked company to draw me out unto such iniquities, but none of them can ease the torment of my minde and conscience, though some apply themselves so to do, I do finde their remedies are false and uneffectual.</p>
                  <p>But I have quite lost my self, I did not intend to open and pour out my minde and thoughts about these matters; but full vessels are ready to run over. I will come to that which I did intend.</p>

But you give the reason that lieth in the bottom of your heart, when you say, By reading of the word they will learn new light, which will molest and trouble them that love and walk in their old lusts, and deeds of darkness, and therefore you will keep them from the light. But I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider at what a dear rate you purchase your quiet in your old ways of sin and darkness, which lead you to hell, when you will compel all your people to live in sin and darkness, for fear lest when they finde the light of Gods Word, they should molest and trouble you in your lusts and sins.</p>

I have heard that in the other part of the World there be a certain people who are called <hi>Papists,</hi> whose Ministers and Teachers live in all manner of wickedness and lewdness, and permit and teach the people so to do: and these wicked Ministers will not suffer the people to reade the Word of God, and pretend the same reason as you do, Because they be ignorant. But the true reason is the same which you plainly speak out, lest by the knowledge of the VVord, they should have light to see into their vileness, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest them in their lusts and sins. And they are so cruel, that if they finde any one that readeth the word of God, they will kill him. They choose rather to lead all their people with them to hell, then to suffer them to see the light whereby they may be saved, lest when they see the light, they should discover their filt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now this is another reason why they will not suffer people to reade the Scriptures, because then every body would finde out their false dealing; and therefore if any body finde them out, they will presently kill them.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in respect; much more may the words that God speaketh, command all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>This Point also being a great Principle in Religion, I will take the same course in it, as I did in the former. I will shew you what Answer we are taught in our Catechism, and I will touch some of the proofs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Reason to prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God, is, Because they teach us the first Creation of the World, and all things in it, which no man nor Angel doth know or can teach, onely God; and this is proved in the first Chapter of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where we reade the wonderful work of God in the Creation of the World, where man was last made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second Reason is from the holiness and perfection of the word of God. No man or Angel could give so holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Law, as G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds Law is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.8, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, 10, 11. also <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.6. <hi>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> the Lord are pure words; as silver tried in a furnace of earth pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Reason is, Because the word of the Lord is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by such Miracles, as onely God himself is able to perform. <hi>Moses</hi> the first writer of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did many great Miracles, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Red Sea, and in the VVilderness; so did many other Prophets: but especially Jesus Christ did many wonderful Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Because the Scriptures doth reveal unto us Jesus Christ, and salvation by Christ, according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

My Counsel is, mingle hope with your fear, <hi>viz.</hi> that God doth outwardly afflict you, that he might drive your distressed soul into the bosome of Jesus Christ, who will graciously pardon all your sins, and save your soul from those eternal flames, which you so much dread. It is Gods usual way of grace, to put his Lambs into distress, that he might cause them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Consider that Text, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7 3, 4. <hi>Sorrow is better then laughter; for by the sorrow of the countenance the heart is made better.

                     <p>I know not where to begin or end. The world hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes promised me fair, but it hath ever failed me; my mornings have had some brightness, but my rising day is alwayes clouded, and full of darkness, and I know not but my Sun will set in thick darkness and despair. You know my Father was a Sachem of the Blood, &amp; I was brought up under such high Capacities &amp; Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations; I have been Chosen and Advanced, as you know, to the degree of a Sachem, but so filled with Crosses and Distresses, that I never enjoy my self, nor one quiet day, my griefs are multiplied like the waves of the Sea, they break in upon me, and are ready to overwhelm me.</p>

                     <p>You have prevented me, or rather the Spirit of God hath put into your heart by power and grace, that which I intended to have presented to you by way of Advice and Counsel, namely, To be frequent and abundant in reading the Scriptures, for you see that all Soul-cordials are laid up there, fetch them out therefore from that divine Treasury, and make use of them for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. I know the Devil will oppose you in this matter, and keep you from conversing in the Scriptures, because they are <hi>the sword of the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 6.17. whereby we resist his temptations, as Christ himself hath set us an example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.4, 7, 10. when the Devil as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted him with a temptation, he drew forth the sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a Text of Scripture, and opposed the temptation thereby, and that presently conquered the Tempter. Do you the same, you cannot imitate a better pattern then our Lord Jesus Christ; and it is his Command also that we should so do, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> made them his meditation day and night, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.2. and he had the like experience that you now have found, and came to the like resolution, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.93. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for with them thou hast quickned me.</hi>

                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:000161_0073_0FA2B4AF768E9168"/>And whereas you say that your sorrows and griefs are but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow: I answer, That the question is not what kinde of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it is, so much, as what the effects of it is; for no matter what the sorrow is, if it drive the soul to Christ; our salvation is by Christ, and not by sorrow: the use of sorrow is to imbitter sin, and the world, and to drive the soul to Christ for relief and rest; if worldly sorrow, or rather sorrow about worldly things do this, it hath its end, and proves to be a godly sorrow. Sorrows are not to merit any thing from God, but to force the afflicted soul to fly to him for refuge. We shall finde examples in Scripture, where sorrows about worldly things have effectually driven the soul to fly to God for refuge. <hi>Psal</hi> 88.18. <hi>Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.</hi> This was an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction, and yet in the first verse of that Psalm, it drives him to fly and cry to the <hi>God of his salvation</hi>; and this is an act of faith. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.15. <hi>But mine adversaries they rejoyced, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered themselves together, yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not. With hypocritical meekers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>eeth</hi>; that is, some broke jests upon him at their Taverns and Tiplings, and others scorned him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all these were outward afflictions, but they drove <hi>David</hi> to fly and cry to God, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Lord, how long wilt thou l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ok on? rescue my soul,</hi> &amp;c. and this is an act of faith. So it was with <hi>Iob</hi> in his affliction, <hi>Iob</hi> 30.8, 9, 10. the basest of the people made songs and jests upon him; but mark what end God made with <hi>Iob.</hi> So <hi>Iames</hi> speaks, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.12. Therefore whatever your griefs be, turn them into prayers, and cry to God for relief, and then your grief hath a sanctified end, and you will at last learn to say after <hi>David,</hi> in that high strained string of Faith and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes,</hi> Psal. 119.71. And <hi>ver.</hi> 67<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of that Psalm, <hi>Before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted I went astray, but now I have kept thy word.</hi> And therefore what though your afflictions be outward afflictions, seeing God is pleased mercifully to bless them unto your spiritual and eternal good.</p>
                     <p>But I further observe, that sundry of your expressions do hold forth a spiritual sorrow for your sin, and a fear of Gods wrath, and an earnest desire to flee from, and escape wrath to come. I pray therefore express your self what sorrows and griefs you have of that kinde; for although such sorrows do not deserve any thing at Gods hand, yet they are of a more spiritual nature, and spring from a deep reverence and fear of God, and do more immediately and effectually drive the soul for refuge to Jesus Christ, who onely delivereth the soul from the guilt and condemnation of sin. Utter some drops of those soul-wounding terrours, which afflict you in the sense of your sin guiltiness.</p>

My sinful habit and disposition by nature, doth viciously incline me to sin, against my desires, purposes, promises, and resolutions.

Now what acts of life doth this babe perform? they are two: 1. By mortification and repentance he purgeth out all his sins; and this act of life you effectually do by your penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions. The second act of life is, he desires the sincere milk of the word that he may grow thereby. The new creature is fed by the same means by which it was begotten: the word of God is the seed of God to beget the new creature, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. and then the word of God is milk to feed and nourish the new creature. Now this is the thing that I observe in you, that as a new born babe you desire the milk of the word: and note this word, <hi>Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My dearest friend, God hath made you an instrument in his hand to lay before me unspeakable consolation; and I cannot deny but I feel it in my heart, I am another man then what I was, I looked on my self the most miserable of men, I now am happy being united to Christ. O blessed change! I am in admiration at this, I admire the grace of Christ to a dead, lost, damned sinner. I am come into a new world, I have other desires then I had, and other purposes; I see things in another frame then I was wont to see them. I must live a new life, and steer a new course.</p>
                     <p>But in this point my soul desires to begin, I am not mine own, I am the servant of Jesus Christ, he died for me, and by his grace I desire to live unto him. And now I finde my self greatly to need Counsel how to order my self in my future course; what shall I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>You do partly know that my people, and some chief ones among them, have had but a smal measure of respect for me, but I have great reason to overlook it, and bury it, because in his infinite mercy C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I would to God that all my people were as I am, and tasted and felt what I have found; but that is not yet so.

                     <p>It joyes my heart to hear these gracious breathings of Gods Spirit in you. I taste in your discourse evident tokens of a living childe of God. I see that my judgement about the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual state of your soul, was not a product of precipitate charity, but an effect of the spirit of right discerning. I will encourage you in your godly purposes, with a modest application of some of the Angels words to <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg 6.12, 14. <hi>Go on, thou mighty man of valour, and go in this thy strength, and thou shalt save thy people. The Lord will be with thee.</hi> But for the manner of your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this matter, my thoughts incline me to propose this way: Be open to own the grace of God bestowed on you, to confess your former known crooked and dark wayes, and the change which God by his grace hath wrought in you. At present, let your first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to stay a while at <hi>Natik,</hi> adjoyn your self to the Church, who when they hear your Confession, will joyfully receive you. In due season, request of the Church to send some able, pious, and fitting Teachers with you, among your people. Prudent Counsel may be taken how to prepare and predispose your people for such a motion. I do not doubt but the Governour and Magistrates of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> will be easily intreated to interpose in so good a work, which may tend to the bringing in so many people to the service of Jesus Christ.</p>

And now I have one request further unto you, That while we are together in this solitary opportunity, we may spend some time in conversing with God in Prayer, turn all those things that have passed into Prayers, and the future matters also; let us spread them before the Lord, and beg his guidance and blessing.</p>
