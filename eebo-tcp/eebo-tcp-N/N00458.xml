            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is a vanity no less common than dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, for such as enjoy the Gospel, and have a relation to the Visible Church, to <hi>boast themselves because of Gods Holy Mountain,</hi> as if they were therefore <hi>secure from all fear of evil:</hi> supposing that the Covenant will be their safety, and saying, <hi>though we walk in the imagination of our heart, no ill shall come upon us.</hi> The Design of this Discourse, is to undeceive such Enfatuated Souls, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them see what ground they stand upon, and how <hi>dreadful the place</hi> is, in which they are. It is a singular favour of <hi>G</hi>od to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken within the pale, and enjoy the benefit
<pb facs="unknown:000581_0003_0FA70FDA02423F40"/>
of the means of grace; but, as it may be abused, so their condition will be tremendous who shall at last fall under this guilt. That which first gave occasion to the Preaching of these Sermons, was the awful consideration of a Duty Ministerial, due to such as, being born of Professing Parents, having received the seal of <hi>G</hi>ods Covenant, and upon their asserting of this Covenant, and putting of themselves under the Discipline of Christ's Appointment, have been acknowledged, and admitted under our watch; and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be accounted for in the great Day. The thought that these should perish at last, must needs be solemn. The hazzads which they lie exposed unto of so doing are amazing. To deny them their Title to, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the Gospel priviledges, seems to be <hi>to bid them go and serve other Gods:</hi> The fear lest they should by the abuse of these ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their guilt and misery, cannot but fill serious souls with great sollicitude: Their great addictedness to vanity, and the small discovery of their being in good earnest for Religion, looks portentously. The awful hand of God which is our against them in several terrible Judgments, is deeply affecting: and who that fears God would not do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to pluck them out of the sire, and save them from burning? These therefore are firstly concerned in this Treatise; and it is

And there are two Observations here:</p>

in a better state than the other, are here to be considered: we may in particular referr to <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 1, 2. where we have the principal things taken notice of, <abbr>
                     <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A vineyard is a S<hi>elect</hi>-Plat of ground taken off from that which is <hi>common,</hi> at the Choice of the owner. It is designed for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial use, and therefore the prudence and pleasure of the Owner is employed in making choice where, and on what spot he will have it, and by this Choice it is separated from his Other Land, and devoted to such an use. Thus the <hi>Church</hi> is a particular Company of men, taken from the rest of the world, at the pleasure of <hi>G</hi>od, to be to him <hi>a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar people.</hi> Though he is Lord of all the world yet he hath not as yet pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the bounds of his Church to all, but it is planted where and as he sees meet, Christ therefore assigns it to his meer pleasure, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vineyards were wont to be planted on <hi>Fruitful Hills;</hi> so is the Church of God, <hi>Verse.</hi> 1. <hi>An Hill</hi> for it's Conspicuousness and pleasant S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000581_0013_0FA70FE7968CACB0"/>
Plants as are to be planted in it. All places in the world, and all persons are in themselves alike capable of being spiritually fruitful; but where God plants his Church, he makes such places Fertile; and if there be any place where fruit is brought forth to his praise, it is there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Vineyard is wont to be <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>enced</hi> in for its preservation, and safety from damage: The barren Wilderness useth to be left open and common, for all manner of wild Beasts to range in, and feed upon; but a Vineyard is Fenced, <hi>verse</hi> 2. And as a Fence is to divide between that and the other ground, so to be a security to it, that Beasts may not come in and devour it; because so all the Industry and Cost of the Owner would be lost, and the Plants exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>d to be trodden down and wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus hath God made a Fence between his visible Church and the rest of the World; he hath set up a Wall or Hedg about it, to keep out such as are Enemies to him and his people; and carefully preserves is from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: this respects the special Providence of God, or that care which he takes in looking after it, in being a <hi>Wall of Fire round about it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A Vineyard is wont to be planted with <hi>Select-Plants.</hi> In the Wilderness Plants grow of themselves; but in a Vineyard none are suffered, but such as are set by the Keeper at the pleasure of the Owner, and he is wont to make choice of such as are most likely and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000581_0014_0FA70FE94EC32CC0"/>
promising; and here the skill and choice of the Husbandman determines. There is a special Providence of God in bringing men into the visible Church, and giving them a Station there; he takes whom he will, and leaves whom he will; &amp; usually in the first Plantation of Churches, there are men eminent and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>verse</hi> 2. <hi>He planted it with the choicest Vines,</hi> Jer. 2. 21. <hi>I planted thee a noble Vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Husbandman is wont to use greatest care and pains in Manuring of his Vineyard: and this is exprest, <hi>verse</hi> 2. <hi>He gathered out the</hi> S<hi>tones,</hi> &amp;c. and there are two things in it; a removing of all impediments, that would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fertility of it, as throwing out stones, and weeding up such hurtful Plants, as are apt to spring up, shade the other, and eat out the heart of the Land; and the applying of all dunging digging and mending to it, that is accommodable to make it bear. Thus hath God been wont in his visible Church, to give them all helps and advantages in Ordinances &amp; Providences to further &amp; encourage them in Holiness, and Godly Conversation: there are no prudent courses omitted or neglected: He therefore calls them to judge in this Affair, <hi>verse</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Vineyards were wont to have <hi>Towers</hi> built in them, <hi>Verse.</hi> 2. They were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being Robbed, and for that Reason they set a Watch-house in the midst of them,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000581_0015_0FA70FE9F8C21B08"/>
where they kept some or other to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of the Vineyard, and secure it from Thieves: This points to Gods special Care of, and Vigilant Providence over his Church, looking after it, that it be kept from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads of such as would be willing to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in it: thus we have Gods declaring his care in this respect, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 2. for this cause all such as <hi>Devour it,</hi> are said <hi>to offend, Jer.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They used also to have a <hi>Wine-Press</hi> placed in the Vineyard, <hi>Verse.</hi> 2. And the use of it was to Tread the Grapes in, and press out the juice of them, and so Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Wine to be drunk; for both the Fat and the Press are Comprehended in this word. This word, [<hi>Winepress</hi>] is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture used <hi>Metaphorically</hi> for Gods Judgments upon his enemies and the afflictions that he brings upon his people, and for the sufferings of Christ: Properly it was an instrument of preparing the fruit for some noble Service; and it notes to us all the helps which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to his People in his Church, for their faithful serving him, and making their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence acceptable to him: and here the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ challenge the first place, without which we could not be accepted; though all other helps to both Faith and Obedience are also comprehended.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Vineyard is planted with a <hi>Design</hi> of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000581_0016_0FA70FEAB59CF5D8"/>
the Owners <hi>Profit,</hi> All wise Agents design something in what they do: no man plants a vineyard, but he would eat and drink of the fruits of it; it is therefore with this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he is at the cost and labour with it; and so God <hi>looked that his Vineyard should yield grapes, verse</hi> 2. This is spoken after the manner of men; God knows what every one will do: but it is rational to expect in the ordinary course, that a vineyard, well manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will answer the Owners design; and why should not the visible Church do so, in respect of God, who hath been at as much expence upon them?</p>
               <p n="9">9. All Plants in a vineyard do not <hi>answer</hi> the Owners <hi>end</hi> and <hi>expectation.</hi> There are some that bear no fruit at all, others that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and their fruit is sower, and not fit for the use for which it was planted; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some other improvement may possibly he made of it: and all that are in the visible Church, do not answer the husbandry that hath been laid out upon them. As there are fruitless branches in a vine, so there are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less fig-trees in a vineyard, that do just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to expectation, <hi>verse</hi> 2. but this will come in an after consideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On what account the visible Church is said to be Gods Vineyard?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not only on a general account, as the whole Creation is called his, but upon more
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000581_0017_0FA70FEB80DCDB10"/>
special and peculiar reasons, it is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledged for his propriety, and that more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because he hath <hi>done</hi> all that for it where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by it is made a vineyard, it is all <hi>his doing;</hi> he planted, he fenced it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all the cost and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which hath been laid out upon it is his charge: God tells them that he <hi>planted</hi> them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 21. and whom shall the vineyard call Master, but him who made it so? all the World lay in common, all mankind were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like by their Apostasy, and God was under no obligation to them, or necessity lying on him to extend this favour to any, or to these more than others, to bring them into such an estate as that, but he, <hi>of his good pleasure,</hi> because he had a mind <hi>to make them his people,</hi> dealt thus with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because the visible Church, and they that are in it, are by <hi>Profession</hi> devoted to him. There is an outward Sanctification, or Consecration of them to the Service of God: They do by Covenant, declare that they are none of their own but his. This properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Profession of Christians, and they that deny it, deny themselves to be such: they say they are Gods propriety, and have given themselves up to him and his Service. Every time they renew their Covenant, they anew assert it: this is their plea with God in trouble, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>We are called by thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:000581_0018_0FA70FEC2D9F2F18"/>
3. Because he expects more <hi>Service and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> from these than from other men, He will be glorified in all men; but he looks that these should <hi>glorifie him:</hi> he requires it, waits for it, and will be very angry at them if they do not pay it him. He reckons that all which he hath done for them more than others, should engage them to love him more than they do, and to endeavour to bring forth <hi>much fruit,</hi> whereby he may be <hi>glorified,</hi> Joh. 15. 8. and if they fall short here, they frust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate these expectations, <hi>i. e.</hi> they come behind of what in reason was to have been expected of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because all the <hi>profit</hi> of the vineyard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him. Who is the Owner but he who receives the Rent of the vineyard; or he unto whom it is in Justice due? It is true, <hi>G</hi>od is not profited as to his eternal glory, by the best Services of any of his Creatures; but his <hi>Declarative Glory</hi> is in this way advanced, his Church therefore are peculiarly said to be to him <hi>for a name, and for a praise, Jer.</hi> 13. 17.</p>

2. That God is to be <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>adored</hi> in all the <hi>Tribulations</hi> that come upon his Church at any time. Is it his vineyard? then certainly there can be no breach made in its hedge, no beast of prey get into it to devour, nor inroads be made upon it, but by his permission, and over-ruling Hand; and when it is so, it is a witness of his displeasure; it faith there is some fault that he finds with it, that it doth not answer his expectation; that its returns have not been according to the improvement: they are therefore to look beyond instruments; yea his Church do acknowledge his anger in it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 18. and this tells us what is the duty incumbent on the people of God, when at any time it is so, <abbr>

               <p>That Christ designs a particular person in our Text, hath been already observed; and that it is one that is planted in the Vineyard, is in so many words expressed.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the people of God are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, particularly and personally compared to <hi>Trees,</hi> is observable: sometimes to the <hi>Cedar</hi> for its stateliness and perpetual green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, P<hi>sal.</hi> 92. 12. and to the <hi>Palm Tree,</hi> for its growing the faster under weight, <hi>ibid.</hi> and often to Fruit-trees: to the <hi>Olive,</hi> for its excellent fruit, and great bearing, <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 8. and to the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> in our Text. This is applied to Professors, not for what they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000581_0026_0FA70FF6B09AC3A8"/>
always are, but for what they ought to be, and they contradict their profession if they are not so: and what God righteously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of them, on account of the manuring which he affords them: and here let these things be observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> bears <hi>good</hi> and <hi>sweet</hi> fruit, thus we read, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 11. it is a fruit-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tree, and its fruit is pleasant and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; it was therefore a great part of their Food in those <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries; and God expects of them that are in his Church, that they should be fruitful; he loves no barren ones there. <hi>Christ cursed the Pig-tree that had no fruit on it;</hi> and he expects that they should bear pleasant fruit, the works of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> and <hi>true Holiness;</hi> such as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self may take pleasure in, and that may be truly comfortable to themselves, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commends their Obedience by such an expression, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>I saw your Fathers as the first ripe in the Fig-tree, at her first time.</hi> Unfruitful Professors are a disgrace to their Profession; and wicked ones are worse, who bring forth such fruits as are worse than none.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a Tree very <hi>profitable</hi> to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not only because its fruit is good, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is wont to bring forth in great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the Owner was well paid for his labour in tilling and tending of it; this is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000581_0027_0FA70FF7CD120DD8"/>
in <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 18. <hi>who so keepeth the Fig-tree, shall eat the fruit thereof;</hi> and who indeed would take pains to cultivate that which will yield him no profit? God expects that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should be profitable in their genera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they live to some good purpose. It is true, God is not essentially benefited, by any thing the Creature can do, all that it hath and is, it from him; but there is a great deal of honour redounds to the Name of God, his declarative Glory is exalted by the fruitfulness of Christians, <hi>John</hi> 15. 8. and the contrary is to his dishonour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Figtree requires <hi>Husbandry</hi> to make its fruit pleasant and profitable. There is vast difference between those that grow wild in the Wilderness, and such as are planted in a Vineyard, and there cultivated; they are neither so fruitful, nor are their fruits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. Then is the Fig-tree most like to answer its end, when it is planted in a good Soil, and looked after with suitable care. <hi>G</hi>od doth not expect that from them that are out of the Church, which he doth from these: it is no wonder to see them barren to good works, and bearing of wild unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant fruits, but from these better is looked for; and indeed there are none that can please God, or know how to serve him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, but those who are brought under
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000581_0028_0FA70FFCEA3AD250"/>
the enjoyment of the means of Grace; hence that in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> puts forth and bears <hi>early.</hi> As soon as ever the Spring comes, this is one of the first Trees which by budding and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, gives evidence to it: it presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the influences of Heaven, and shews it self, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 32. God looks for early fruit of those that are of his visible Church; the Professors who are born and brought up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means, should begin betime to devote themselves to his Service: they should receive impression by all the influences of the means of Grace. God looks that the Children of the Church should <hi>Serve</hi> him from their <hi>Child-hood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The fruit of the Fig-tree <hi>Ripens Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some figs are ripe and it for use before others, and all the time of Harvo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, there are some ready for use every day, till the bearing time be over; hence we read of the <hi>First ripe Figs, Hos,</hi> 9. 10. Thus God would have Professors to be bringing forth of their fruits every day, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole season of their serving him, <hi>i, e. all their lives long, Psal,</hi> 1, 3. <hi>Bringeth forth fruit in his season,</hi> They should begin, and hold on in the service of God, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways doing something which may be for his Honour, and the good of their own
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000581_0029_0FA70FFEAF1008E0"/>
Souls, and not be weary of it as long as they live, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 14. T<hi>hey shall still bring forth fruit in Old-age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The Fig-tree <hi>easily</hi> parts with its fruits when they are ripe, for the use of such as come to gather them. A little wind, or an easie shaking of the Tree, makes them to fall, <hi>Nahu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus should Professors be <hi>ready for every good work:</hi> they should be ripe and forward for any thing wherein they may serve God; and profit others: as soon as the <hi>wind blows;</hi> the Spirit of God suggests to them, they ought to attend him, and put forth to acts of piety: when ever they find an occasion of doing any thing for God, they should not be hard to be brought to do it; but do it with all forwardness and Cheerfulness of mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In what sense they are planted in Gods Vineyard?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> As they stand more nearly related to God in the Gospel-Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then do. We are here to observe, that besides the Everlasting Covenant which is Contracted between God and his truely called ones, there is another Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between God and Men, which is not Common to all, but restrained to the Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and such as are related unto

And this is of a larger extent then the former, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>They are not all Israel, which are of Israel.</hi> In <hi>that</hi> there are only God's chosen ones; in <hi>this</hi> there are others besides.

               <p n="1">1. That God hath his Elect <hi>scattered</hi> up and down among others, who must be brought in to enjoy Salvation. These are, in their Natural State, <hi>strangers, and far from God,</hi> but they must be saved: and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for their sakes that God ever empaled a vineyard, set up a Church in the World.

               <p n="2">2. That the Gospel is the great <hi>Instrument</hi> of Gods Appointment for Conversion. Not that his power is limited or stinted to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

way in it self, but because he hath chosen it, as that which his Infinite Wisdom hath thought most convenient, and accommodable to his design: this therefore is said to be <hi>the power of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nto Salvation,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. and they that are without are declared to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope,</hi> Eph. 2. 12. In the Gospel-way, God treats men according to their own nature, by making offers, and discovering to them the way of life, and so convincing and perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as reasonable Creatures: and in it are all those discoveries made, which point men how they may be saved, and sent to quicken and encourage them to attend upon the same.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Gods <hi>Providence</hi> orders it that this Gospel shall be Preached there where his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are seated. If he hath any of his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in such a place, he takes care that the means of Salvation shall be brought unto them, because this is the way that he hath designed their Salvation by. That the sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Gospel in the world, and its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to one place, and not to another, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the peculiar conduct of Gods Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is clear from Scripture, see <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6, 7. Now, because his Elect must be called, in order to their being saved, and the <hi>G</hi>ospel is the ordinary <hi>Medium</hi> of Conversion, he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put this honour upon it; he therefore Commissions it unto them, and his over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

hand causeth them to enjoy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Gospel, when it comes, is not Preached to these only, but to many others. God is pleased to make use of the Ministry of men, in the dispensation of his Gospel; and he doth not tell them, (how then should they know?) who in particular belong to the Election of his <hi>G</hi>race; but he hath bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them <hi>to Preach it to every Creature,</hi> Mark 16. 15. They are to cast their Net into the Sea, and take whom they can catch, to offer Christ and Life by him, unto all, to invite every one that hears them to come to him for life: the offers are to be general, <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Gospel offers a <hi>Conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to men. In all Treaties and Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between God and Men, <hi>Prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pts</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> are put together, and there is a close connexion made between them, there is a certain dependence of the one upon the other, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. God reveals a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the <hi>G</hi>ospel to men, he opens to them the terms of it, and requires that if they will be related to him in it, they must put themselves under these conditions: and in the visible Covenant, he accepts men on such conditions: <hi>they promise</hi> so to do, and <hi>he promiseth</hi> that if they fullfil according to their engagement, he will do so for them.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:000581_0033_0FA7100242A36658"/>
6. Hence men, by openly <hi>owning</hi> and <hi>submitting</hi> to Gospel Termes, bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under this Conditional Covenant. It is a grand mistake to think, that there are none in Covenant with God, but those who are absolutely under the Promise of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the very notion of a Covenant implies a dependent Condition, to which the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of it referr. The Visible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then, thus stands: God offers Christ, and Salvation by him, in the Gospel, tells men, if they believe and repent they shall be Saved; presents the <hi>G</hi>ospel Ordinances as means to work Faith and Repentance in them, and so bring them to Salvation: they accept of the offer professedly, submit to the termes, and now they are taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Covenant, and must stand or fall to the Conditions of it: when they have thus done, they are said to be in God's Vineyard; and on this very account it is, that a People in the Visible Covenant, have so many warnings, and cautions given them, as, <hi>Psal</hi> 50, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What advantages do they hereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I may say with the Apostle in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Much every way.</hi> Here let it be by way of caution observed, that this state of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, doth not secure unto them Eternal Life, because herein they do stand probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000581_0034_0FA71002D4CC8DF0"/>
for it, and may, through their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, come short of it at last. But yet there are many Priviledges which such are made Partakers in, above these who are not in the Vineyard; in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They have the <hi>way</hi> to eternal life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them, whilst others dwell in <hi>Darkness and the Regions of the shadow of Death.</hi> These live in the <hi>Light</hi> of the Gospel, and this is to be looked upon as a great Priviledges, hence that, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 15. 16. And it must needs be so, because they are thus brought nearer to Salvation than the other, there is now hope Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, whereas the other are declared to be <hi>without hope, Eph.</hi> 2. 12. Salvation depends upon Revelation, and God never useth to send his Gospel, but there where he hath this life to dispense: now it is to them that these <hi>Oracles</hi> are <hi>committed Ro.</hi> 3 2. And these Oracles point men how they may obtain Salvation, it is therefore called the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of peace and salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They have the <hi>offers</hi> of Eternal Life made to them. Where-ever the Gospel is enjoyed, there are made to men the Tenders of Salvation: They are not only told that there is such a thing, but they are invited to accept of it, they are called upon and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled not to reject it: they to whom this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000581_0035_0FA71006EFA6F1B0"/>
Embassy is committed, are <hi>to pray men to be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. This the Heathen live without; God doth not so much as vouchsafe to ask them if they are willing to have Christ and life by him: they are his enemies, and there is no Herald sent to them to proclaim peace among them: but Christ pleads with those that are in the Church, and complains of an affront given him, if they refuse, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have the</hi> Promise <hi>of Salvation made to them on</hi> C<hi>ondition: therefore are the</hi> Promises <hi>said to be</hi> theirs, Rom. 9. 4. <hi>for by having the Covenant, they must have the Promise too, because it is Essential to it, and there cannot be a</hi> C<hi>ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without it. It is true, it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yea they have the <hi>means</hi> of Salvation, both outward and inward: and hereby they are in the fairer probability of obtaining it.

Thus they who are in the Visible Church are under all means for their spiritual profit, none of which Heathen enjoy: they have the outward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the Ordinances, and the inward strivings of the Spirit of God; they have <hi>line upon line, &amp;c.</hi> and all the mercies and afflictions that befal them, are under the like dispensation, made serviceable to the treaty of the <hi>G</hi>ospel, to perswade them to accept of and embrace the Salvation offered.</p>

               </gap> God requires it, and well may he observe whether they do answer this injunction of his.

            <p>There are three Observations which we may gather, and briefly improve from this passage.</p>

               <p>In clearing up this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What fruit is it that God expects?</p>

They that are placed in the visible Church are fig-trees, they seem at least to be so, they bear such leaves upon them; not that God can be deceived in any, he knows what they are indeed, but by their outward profession they declare themselves to be such: they say they are Gods people, <hi>called by his name,</hi> devoted to his service; they are visibly <hi>plants of Righteousness.</hi> The fruits then which God expects of such are the fruits of righteousness; that they should live a life of <hi>faith which works by love;</hi> that they should serve and obey him in all things, should walk in an holy conformity to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, should <hi>do the works of God;</hi> live answerably to the <hi>teachings of the grace which hath appeared to them, Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12.

               <p n="2">2. On what account he may be said thus to expect it?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Though God condescends to speak to us in our language, yet it becomes us always to interpret him so as is becoming his Sacred Majesty. All things therefore that imply any infirmity in men, are to be removed from our thoughts in our interpretation of him, in what he declares to us. Here then let us observe that when men are said to expect a thing, it implies, 1. That they are at some loss about it before hand. 2. That they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it in an hope. 3. That this hope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon probabilites that may be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; so they may miss. We are not to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any such thing concerning the great God, for, <hi>what he desires, he doth:</hi> he knows all things a forehand, for they depend upon his All Efficiency, he cannot therefore be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or lose his hope. This expectation therefore is not to be attributed to him in respect of his <hi>secret will,</hi> decrees, or purposes; as if he had left any of them dubious or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, or depending on the creature, on which he must wait before he can determine what will be, this is altogether incompatible to the Divine nature: But it must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of his <hi>revealed will,</hi> in respect of the transactions that have past between <hi>G</hi>od and his People: for, as he treats with them as men, so he is said to look for this or that from them, after the manner of men.

               <p n="2">2. We are to distinguish between the end of the <hi>purpose</hi> and of the <hi>precept.</hi> If we speak of Gods purposes, <hi>he knows all his works</hi> concerning them, <hi>before the foundation of the World,</hi> and here he can never be at a loss or disappointed: but that is <hi>secret</hi> to us, and therefore belongs not to our curious search,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000581_0049_0FA7101D816D3430"/>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. But then the precept of <hi>G</hi>od is that in which he is pleased to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to us, and shews us what is his will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Duty, or what he hath seen meet to make a duty incumbent upon us; now in the preceptive discovery of Gods Will to his people, he hath told them what it is they ought to propose to themselves as their end, and what are the means which they are to make use of in order to their obtaining it; and this is that which we call <hi>mans</hi> end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is commanded to seek it, and <hi>Gods</hi> end too, because he hath enjoyned men to seek it, and which he intends also to bring about in all these whom he hath ordained to <hi>eternal life, Joh.</hi> 28. 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the end which every one in the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church is called and pointed to, is to bear fruit. It is true, <hi>G</hi>od hath a purpose of his own concerning them, which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be frustrate, he will have his honour by them, whether they fructify or no; which way soever it falls, he will have his glory, <hi>Paul is a sweet savour of God, in them that are saved, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> them that perish.</hi> But this is that which God enjoyns them all in: this is his positive command, which he hath laid upon every one that are taken so near unto him: that they do serve and obey him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 2. <hi>This people have I formed for my self, they shall shew forth my praise.</hi> God requires this
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000581_0050_0FA7101EDA1A6F20"/>
of every one, and what men require, they are wont to expect: for, because all men owe Obedience to all the commands of God, and his people are under peculiar, as well as general obligations hereunto, who that is so related would not look that such should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him? for men then to fail in this res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, is to come short of their end; and God complains as if he had done for them in vain, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That all the means that are used with them look directly this way. We are wont to judge of mens designs, by their actions; and by their designs we rationally judge of their expectations; for all men have a secret hope that their designs will succeed, else they would not be at cost to promove them. Now he that shall but rightly consider the nature and tendency of all that is done by God to &amp; for his visible Church, and every one in it, must needs say that all hath a direct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reference <hi>to</hi> their bearing the fruits of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: for what else doth the <hi>G</hi>ospel Covenant oblige men to, but to glorify God? and that is by a <hi>rightly ordered Conversation;</hi> what else do all the <hi>G</hi>ospel commands serve to, but to <hi>shew man the way ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of each, to see how it sprouts, buds, blossoms, sets for fruit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not omitting of one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here three things may be enquired after,

                     <item>1. What is this curious observation of God?</item>
                     <item>2. How it appears that he doth this by every individual?</item>
                     <item>3. Why he so doth?</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What is this curious observation which God makes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We may come at something of this in the following Conclusions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an essential <hi>Omnipresence</hi> of <hi>G</hi>od with all his creatures: This is one of the Divine Attributes or perfections which belong to God; it belongs to his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and is fully and frequently ascribed to him in the Scripture: Because he is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Immense and Uncomprehended Being, he must needs therefore be every where: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause place cannot contain him, he must of necessity contain all place: hence that, <hi> I Kings</hi> 8. 27. <hi>behold, the Heaven, and Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens cannot contain thee;</hi> the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, is the third Heaven, which is the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most limit of place, and there is none beyond it: hence there is no getting away from him, or absconding ourselves any where, where he is not, <hi>Psal,</hi> 139. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence it follows that he must certainly be <hi>Omniscient.</hi> If he be every where, he
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000581_0063_0FA710334D46DD60"/>
must needs know every thing. Not only doth God assume this Atribute to himself, but it also is necessarily inferred from his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence. We are to conceive of God under the Notion of an Intelligent Being; knowledg is therefore ascribed to him; and that not in the concrete only but in the abstract, without an Hyperbole, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>I am Understanding,</hi> wheresoever then God is, he is there by his knowledge: his knowledge is his Being, and must be Inseperable from it; and, because his perfections are him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and he is an undivided Being, where he is, there he is in all his Attributes; although he makes the manifestations of them to the Creatures according to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Omniscience of God must needs comprize in it a distinct knowledge of all Creatures in particular, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> all their action. Universal Understanding cannot be Confined meerly to Universals or to Generals, but it must reach to individuals; and that not meerly as to their beings or natures, but their actions too; none of these must be hid from him; nay it saith that he minds, regards, takes particular notice of them; he is for this reason said to <hi>count them, Job.</hi> 31. 4. and, to <hi>be acquainted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

of men, which are very deep; the <hi>thoughts</hi> which others can hardly guess at; we are then assured that there is no <hi>hiding of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel from him.</hi> God is all Eye, &amp; that eye is fixt upon all things, and therefore is said to <hi>behold</hi> them, and look upon them <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 13. 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence God cannot, in propriety of speech, be said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o know one thing more than another; or to observe one thing more intensly than another: if we consider this observation as it is in God, it cannot be more or less, intended or remitted; for God doth all things like himself, he is the same <hi>G</hi>od; he cannot know or see one thing more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly or clearly than another; all things come equally under his cognizance; he is no more intimately acquainted with the things in heaven, than with those in hell; his actual knowledge of all must be infinite, and in that which is infinite, there are no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: All Beings are comprehended in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. and therefore intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them all belongs to him; yea and all Beings are to be improved by him for his glory; he must therefore know them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all their motions, that so he may not miss of his glory by them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are yet some persons and things in which God will have more of his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glory to shine forth than in others: it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000581_0065_0FA71036E81EC080"/>

                  </gap> all his works; and he will be glorified in them all; yet not in all alike: some things he will be more seen in than others; he hath not put into all things a like capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting his perfections: he hath not laid out so much upon some as he hath done upon others; and therefore he doth not look for so much from those as from these: he hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to some creatures a more excellent being, and endued them with more noble Faculties, and they have <hi>larger capacities, Job.</hi> 35. 9, 10. he providentially bestows more advantages and helps on some than he doth upon others; and he will be no loser by any thing that he doth, he will either receive, or recover more from them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 48.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This glory of his is most of all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his (Vineyard) or, Church: there is a glory which he will have by irrational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>his works shall praise him;</hi> but there is a special glory that he will have by men; hence there are the great Attributes of his Justice and Grace are concerned about them, and must be made to shine out in them; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, there are some whom he hath a more special respect to: all are under the conduct of special Government, and to be led to be everlasting monuments of his glory: but he hath a peculiar people among these, a selected number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gathered out of these, whom
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000581_0066_0FA7103738F3A2B8"/>

               <p n="7">7. Hence he is said, after the manner of men, to have a special inspection over these: because he lays out more upon them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects more from them; he is therefore said to look more peculiarly after them: as one which has a plat of ground planted with choice plants; and on which he lays out more than ordinary cost, will he not expect more from it, &amp; be more curious in observing of it, and all the plants there growing; and takes but little care of the rest of his ground in comparison of what he doth for this; God is therefore said to know them after a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. is said to wink at the other, to suffer them to go on in their ways, as if he were careless or not concerned about them; but for his vineyard, to be looking there for grapes, to be visiting it, and coming again and again to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How it appears that he doth thus by every individual?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Besides the consideration, of what hath been already mentioned, that Gods all-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge respects all individuals, both persons &amp; actions, and that <hi>G</hi>od hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

that he is concerned for in his visible Church below; these things are to be observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God doth particularly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally either Commend or Reprove these. It is not only his Church in <hi>G</hi>eneral, or these and these bodies of Professors, that he so expresseth himself unto, but to persons also. An evident instance for this we have in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> G<hi>en.</hi> 4. <hi>Begin.</hi> And this is intimated by Christ in another Parable, <abbr>
                     <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> of the Wedding Supper, where the Lord observed that one person that had not on the <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> and treats him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.

If the visible Church be gone to decay, and there be a <hi>Noah</hi> in it that is righteous, <hi>G</hi>od notes him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends him fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. That Gods Mercies and Judgments are very signally observable in these; not only do these respect the Church in general, or this or that particular Church, but these and those individual persons in it. Not only when Gods People do walk closely with him, have they more observeable and admirable deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances conferred upon them; and when they highly provoke him, do they meet with
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000581_0068_0FA71038AFC3EBA8"/>
more stupendous visitations, and <hi>Come down wonderfully;</hi> but this is oftentimes apparent in particular persons. Sometimes when the Church is preserved in peace and prosperity, yet particular <hi>Sinners in Zion</hi> are animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted upon; &amp; thus <hi>the Fig-tree</hi> in the <hi>Text;</hi> when <hi>G</hi>od is bringing of Judgments upon the body of a Church, yet there are some who must first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Why <hi>G</hi>od takes such a curious and distinct Observation of these, to see what fruit they bring forth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The ground of this will appear if we lay these things together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which <hi>G</hi>od expects of his Visible Church, is fruit, this hath bin already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former Doctrine. God would be honoured and served by some in the World; other men pay him no Tribute, bring forth no fruits that he can tast any pleasancy in; he therefore for that end planted his Church that from it he might receive some revenue in the world; that all the world might not <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y in Wickedness,</hi> and nothing but dishonour him, as all the residue of mankind certainly and unavoidably do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence God is honoured by his Visible Church proportionably to the good fruits which they bear. This is the proper and only way in the which they can so serve to his praise, as to answer the end of their being a Church. The rest of mankind shall answer his designs upon them, in some other way; for God will have his honour upon all: but except these serve God, <hi>do the works of God,</hi> yeild the fruits of Obedience, they live in vain: and consequently, the more careful and constant they are in these services the more honour
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000581_0070_0FA7103A4A939C70"/>
they bring to God. Every act of true Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience hath of this in it, when then these are multiplied, God hath great glory by such.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Church consists of individuals, and consequently the honour which God hath by his Church, is by the individuals in it. The Church is an aggregate body, it is made up of particular persons; and the duty of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fruit lies upon every one of them: what therefore God expec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of his Church is personally expressed, as well as joyn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly; a Vineyard consists of particular plants; by the bearing of these, the fruitfulness of the Vineyard is known? and the way for the Owner to know whether it answers its ends, Is to go from tree to tree, and see how they bear; and in no other way is he acquainted with the state of the whole. If every one in the Church be faithful to God, that is a faithful Church indeed: so many as there are belonging to it that are otherwise, do make It to come so far short, and to be unto such a degree barren; God therefore observes each, because he will know the state of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
               <p n="4">4. These individuals are there planted by his special Providence; men are ready to think that all these things are casual, and meerly eventual, and do not see an higher hand in them; but gracious Souls acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

a peculiar favourable Providence in it. They are <hi>lines</hi> that are here <hi>fallen</hi> unto them <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 7. It is a Metaphor taken from the custom among men, in laying out and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mens Allotments. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a peculiar remark made upon this; <hi>this &amp; that man was born in Zion,</hi> P<hi>sal</hi> 87. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. and as there is much of Gods good will display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it self to them, in making it their portion to be in his Church, so there it some special aim at his own glory in <hi>it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> every one; and therefore <hi>according</hi> to our <hi>conception, G</hi>od <hi>is</hi> singula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. <hi>God must have glory by them that do not bear, as well as by them that do. That it is awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that all those that are in the visible Church do not yield the fruit expected, will be considered in the next Doctrine; although these do not glorifie God; but</hi> come short <hi>of it, yet God must not, will not be a loser by them. No man would willingly be a loser by any thing that he doth, if he could help it; God can help it, and he wilt. But he is not glorified in the one, after the same manner that he is in the other; the one is</hi> found to the <hi>praise</hi> of the glory of <hi>his</hi> grace, <hi>the others are to be made monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the</hi> Glory <hi>of his Justice.

of the state of each one, that he may get himself a name in them accordingly,</hi> Rom. 9. 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There are particular and personal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that God hath to distribute to men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fruits they bear. These Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God stands obliged to in the Covenant Promises and Threatnings; for both of these belong to the Gospel-Covenant in which the visible Church is empaled: there is therefore a Day of Judgment appointed, in which Christ will not only sit upon the world, but also upon his Vineyard, in which he will give each one his recompense according as he is found; and this is personal: for, <hi>we must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us give an account of himself to God.</hi> In the dispensing of these recompences, God will proceed with men, <hi>according to their deeds, Rom.</hi> 2. 6. and that will be very diversly, <hi>verse</hi> 7, 8, 9. and it is of infinite moment, whether man be adjudged to happiness or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: and how <hi>shall the Judge of all the earth do that which is right</hi> in all this, if he do not observe who bear fruit, and who is barren? and the more curious must the observation be, if we consider, that not only fruitfulness and barrenness, but the more fruits there are of either sort, the more recompense is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To see that we bring forth good fruit. If God be so curious, let it make us to be so too. They that would approve themselves to an all-seeing and heart searching God, had need to take heed to themselves, and beware of being imposed upon. God not only looks whether we bear, but what we bear; let us do so too: and here let us know, that <hi>the tree must be made good, if ever the fruit be good: grapes are not gathered of thorns.</hi> It should make all that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selve Christians, to be afraid of living one day in a state of unregeneracy; for as
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000581_0077_0FA71044D4139A48"/>
long as we so do, we do nothing at all that will turn to account. See that you have a principle of <hi>G</hi>race within, and then take heed that your lives be the continued exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To take care that we bear much fruit. When you have gotten grace into your Hearts let in be your industrious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring it forth into action through your whole life and Conversation. The best of us have <hi>another Law</hi> in our <hi>Members,</hi> which will be putting it self forth, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such works as must be burnt <hi>up: G</hi>race must be carefully Nourished and Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, else it will be born down and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Carnal part within us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To be sure to bring forth secret fruits. Here is the least d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nger of Hypocrisy. We may do many things <hi>which</hi> a love of Applause <hi>&amp;</hi> Commendation from men may excite us to but our secret service, which is done out of the reach of the eye and observation of others, is that which is in the least danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieveing us; because herein we have better evidence that we <hi>set God before us:</hi> and that you may he truely thus engaged, here is your help; to be always thinking, God is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000581_0078_0FA71045766DD680"/>
us upon Carefully and Cheerfully doing thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God sees, he will aprove us if we thus do. He looks with great Approbation upon the Faithful Endeavours of his <hi>C</hi>hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; it pleaseth him highly to see them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for him and his glory in all that they do. And what should please or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy us more or better, than that the God we profess to serve, takes Content in our Duties, and <hi>Smells a sweet savour</hi> in <hi>them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus only shall we answer the end of our being planted in Gods Vineyard. The reason why <hi>G</hi>od looks so exactly, is, as we heard, because he would not miss his end, that if we answer it not one way, he may have it of us in another: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, if we do thus, it is the way for us to be continued in the Vineyard, and have the constant influences of his Grace; for <hi>to them that have, more shall be given:</hi> God will not be wanting to us, if we take heed to be faithful to him in our improvements, and therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We shall not lose our labour. For if <hi>G</hi>od observes in particular, then he will not forget to reward us in particular. There is a great recompense promised to them that are faithful, and it is a strong consolation to all such as are so, to consider that he who
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000581_0079_0FA710468B054DE8"/>
hath thus promised, keeps the account of all the care and fidelity of his people, even to the most secret Duty which they do in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and our Saviour hath given us this Assurance, <hi>That our father that seeth in secret will reward us openly.</hi>

               <p>This is a necessary inference from the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Coming</hi> to this figtree, <hi>looking for fruit, and finding none,</hi> for if God be aimed at in this owner, as we have observed, he could not miss, or not find fruit, if there had bin any; Being omniscient.

one mentioned which is enough to intimate that such a thing may be, and so sufficient to put every one upon self-examination;) yet it is certian that it intimates that there are more.</p>

All <hi>Profane</hi> persons that are in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church; and it is a matter of sad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, that there are too many such, who call themselves Christians, and yet are always doing the <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> of which we have a Catalogue, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19, &amp;c. they mind nothing that is good, but are wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to vanity and debauchery, and yet they can boast of their Church-priviledges, and bolster themselves up in wickedness by them: such were they, <hi>J</hi>er. 7. 9, 10. the very lives and conversations of these declared them to be graceless, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 9. the cursed fruits that they bear discover that they have an <hi>evil root of bitterness</hi> in them; and charity must put out its eyes, before it can think better of them: God will never acknowledge the <hi>vintage of Gomorrah</hi> to be fruit.</p>

as far as words will go; and possibly too they may have a shew of fruit upon them: they may do a great many things so far as the matter of duty reacheth and in that part of their conversation which lies open to the view and observation of men, may use much severity and strictness: but these are not the fruits that God accepts; they are not found b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

it is such as hath left him neither ability nor disposition to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. &amp;c. for if a man must be good in order to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable of doing good, the natural man is capable of doing none: for he <hi>is Conceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

So that he can as well withhold from acting as from sinning; and by these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed acts of such a principle, the habit is fortified, which adds to the barneness of the Soul a deeper rooting and confirmation in it; and nature, being strengthened by custom, is yet made more unlikely to do any thing that may answer <hi>G</hi>ods expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it is more setled in its evil way: and therefore God puts stress upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>q. d,</hi> Whatever might have bin hoped before, yet now they are next to hopeless.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider that God expects fruit of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in his Church. He looks for it, &amp; you can no otherwise answer the end of your being set there. This hath been already e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced, and it hath a mighty plea in it; for doth not <hi>G</hi>od deserve it of you? Is it not an ill requital of all his care and cost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. And <hi>G</hi>od observes as well as expects: and should not this be a consideration of weight with you, to think that whatever I am doing, Gods jealous eye is upon me: if I am barren, he keeps the account of that, and if I am fruitful, he will not forget that: He that knows that he is always under the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inspection of the great <hi>G</hi>od, had need to be careful of himself.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if you be not fruitful, he will not always bear it: and this your very reason may assure you of: though he be patient, yet be can be weary with for bearing: and this is a solemn consideration, &amp; should carry great aw in it to all our hearts, you cannot promise your selves always to be indulged, unless <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000581_0096_0FA7105E3892ECE8"/>
leads you to repentance.</hi> And for your help here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be sensible of your native barrenness, and go to God to remove it: sense of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency is the first step to profitableness: A proud opinion of our own righteousness, is the main <hi>remora</hi> to our Conversion. God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>can teach us to profit;</hi> when a barren heart is felt, and burdensome, he is ready to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his help to all those that come to him, and pray against it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware of hearkning to Satan, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the Spirit of God. This is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of multitudes under the <hi>G</hi>ospel; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan enveagles them with his Temptations, and they comply with them: the Spirit of God comes and solicits them and they regard him not. Hearken to him, and he will <hi>work your works in and for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Improve the means with diligence. The means of Grace are sutable, but if they be neglected they will not profit us. Hearken to Counsel, take warning, receive instruction, embrace the Encouragements given you, and apply all to practice.</p>

            <p>Before I proceed to the consideration of the deliberation it self, give me leave to make a few brief glancing remarks, upon the person deliberated withal, <abbr>viz</abbr> the <hi>Dresser of the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</hi> And here we may observe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The dignity which Christ puts upon his Ministry, and the trust which he puts in them.</hi> It is a great honour that is done unto men to put them into places of trust. God hath a singular respect to, and care which he takes of his Church; to betrust any then with the office of looking after and dressing of this Vineyard, argues a great deal of confidence that he puts in them, and honour that he confers upon them. God is a great King, and these are his Children, for to them <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Adoption;</hi> and it is a noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made Tutors to a King's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: men are wont to be curious in their
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:000581_0100_0FA70F5AB4311D50"/>
choice of such: and God is much more, in the directions which he hath given about the qualifications of such whom he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in this station. <hi>Moses</hi> mentions it as a great preferment which God had advanced <hi>Korah</hi> and his Brethren unto, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 9.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence they who despise the office and work of the Ministry, despise God. Such as reproach them, reproach God himself. It is not to be denied, but that there are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se who are preferred among men to the place of the Ministry, whose unworthy Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in it, and mismanagement of it, makes them deserve to be exploded, and not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be called by God, or approved of him: but this ought not to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as redounding to the ignominy of the work it self, or the contempt of those whom God hath made faithful in it. It is true, Christ could do his work without them, but he hath pleased to chuse this way to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense himself in; and that employment which <hi>G</hi>od himself hath seen meet to put honour upon, ought not to be vilified or thought light of, by such as profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be his people, and to hope for his salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are here also <hi>acquainted with the Duty of Gospel Ministers.</hi> The Title her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </hi> Their
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:000581_0101_0FA70F5B91F38CF0"/>
work is to dress the Vineyard. The word signifies <hi>one that is to work about the vines; i.e.</hi> to do the business that appertains to the tending and looking after them: and this intimates that there is no little care and charge lying upon those that are engaged in the Ministry, no little labour incumbent on them to be exercised withal; and this will appear from the consideration of two things in the Comparison or Title.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Vineyard hath a great many plants in it, all of which belongs to the Vine-dressers care, and every one of which calls for dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.  A Church is a Company of visible believers, or professors, with their Children, in some there are more, in others fewer: now each individual of these belongs to his Charge; and it is a solemn Charge that Christ hath laid upon him, 2, <hi>Tim</hi> 4. <hi>begin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A Seasonable administration belongs to these and to that end, care is to be used to <hi>know the state</hi> of the Vineyard; and that is by the several plants which are in it, Not only Truths, but seasonable Truths are to be preached; and he that hath souls to look after, must needs have a great care lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a deal to be done to and for the Vineyard, and the several plants that are in it. He that hath a Vineyard to look after, shall never want work: there
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:000581_0102_0FA70F5C51FC62A8"/>
are so many things that belong to the dressing &amp; tending of it; there is digging, &amp; du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It will be to do again and again. There is no less lying on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, if they will prove themselves faithful: there are <hi>Children,</hi> tender plants in the nursery, to be looked after, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from those beds into the rows, when they are fitted for it: there are <hi>grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> who should be laboured with that they may be prepared for full communion: and there are those that have <hi>attained</hi> to it: each of these have their portion to be allotted to them. There are the <hi>unbelieving,</hi> who are to be called upon and not let alone; the <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> who are to be solemnly warned; the <hi>Scandalous,</hi> who are to be, according to their merit, censured; the <hi>Careless,</hi> that are to be seasonably reproved; the <hi>Sorrowful,</hi> that must be comforted; the <hi>doubting Souls,</hi> that must be satisfied; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is the Word and Ordinances which are to be dispensed to all in publick; the <hi>sick</hi> that must be visited; <hi>Corrupters and Seducers</hi> must be watched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; Families in private must be visited; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and an account is to be given in to Christ the Lord and Owner of his Church,

of all this, as they expect a reward of <hi>G</hi>race at his hands: and if they have wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or omitted their duty in these regards, they are in danger of being <hi>cut in sunder</hi> by him, and made to receive their <hi>portion wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Faithfulness appears in a care to mind the work we are in, to discharge the trust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in us, to spend and be spent in the work of Christ, and for the good of Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be <hi>instant in season and out of season?</hi> To divide to every one the portion belonging to them, rebuke to whom rebuke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this as God gives them strength and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, not shunning any thing which God hath Commanded them to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there are such placed by Christ in his Church, is evident. The love and care which Christ hath for it, cannot but put him upon it to provide such for it: and when his people have bin never so degenerate, and offered the greatest affronts to such as these, he hath yet sent them, and enabled them to bear all, and discharge their duty notwithstanding: It is he that <hi>thrusts out labourers into his harvest;</hi> and he can make them labourers indeed: there have bin such formerly; <hi>Paul</hi> was so, he could appeal to the consciences of this <hi>Ephesians.

               <p n="1">1. That it is not their fidelity, but Gods blessing which gives the success. They are but Instruments used by <hi>G</hi>od: their desires may be sincere, their endeavours hearty, and industrious; but the hearts of men are not to be wrought upon by them, but require Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power to influence them.

               <p>Hence fidelity and not bare success shall be the Ministers trial and crown another day.

But when they shall come to stand before Christ's Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and are to receive their reward, that man shall have no more commendation than this: he did no more for God, though <hi>G</hi>od did more by him: nay, if there be degrees of reward according to what men have done and suffered for Christ, I am sure this man hath done as much, and suffered more: and if this were not the support of the hearts of some of Gods Servants, they would sometimes saint within them, Christ comforted himself with this, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 5. <hi>Though Israel be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, I shall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord.</hi>

               <p>Those of Gods servants that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Grace to be faithful, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding desirous to do good, so they cannot but be very observant to see what success their labours have; and as to the general state and frame of the people they are sent to, it is practically obvious, by the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they give to, and improvement they make of the means of <hi>G</hi>race which are affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them.

It is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of sinners that are under the means of Grace, to be told of their sins and have the denunciations of <hi>G</hi>ods wrath laid before them, before it siezeth them, that so to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a space to repent, they may have a loud call unto it: and this appertains to the singular long suffering of God, which he extends to such, and will render them the more inexcusable, if at last they by their impenitency force him to make <hi>a way for his anger;</hi> he therefore first <hi>slays them by the mouth
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000581_0113_0FA70F67799A8948"/>
of his Prophets,</hi> before he executes his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon them in his Providence; and because he useth his Ministers as Instruments, by whom he gives these warnings to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he therefore moves their hearts to eye and observe, and be deeply affected with the things that give him provocation, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly guides their studies and meditations that way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God often doth it with gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, sometimes to his Ministers, to quicken them to a more earnest and repeated diligent endeavour for the people, both by interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Sometimes to unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sinners themselves, by giving a blessing to such endeavours, and perswading them to hearken to their solemn counsels, and accept of the calls to Repentance, that being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fruitful, he may have mercy upon them

            <p>WE have been considering the Person deliberated with, it follows that we take notice of the deliberation it self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which as hath been observed, there are two things to be handled distinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The complaint of the Owner against this particular fig-tree, in which he gives the ground and reason of the following sentence which he pronounceth.</p>
            <p>In which observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great pains and patience which he had used with this tree in expectation of its bearing: the Patience is expressed in that he had waited three years upon it, suffering it all this while, in hope that it would bear in so long a time at least why our Saviour useth the definite number of three, is divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guessed; some think that he aims at the three years of his publick Ministry, which at had spent in that work, when this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000581_0117_0FA70F6B394295A8"/>
was uttered, and the year requested in the following verse, to aim at the fourth cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in which he suffered: others suppose it to aim at the nature of the fig-tree, which if it be not wholly barren, will bear at least once in three years and then it intends that God had waited upon the sinner as long as there were, any rational hopes of his receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, or profiting; or till there was <hi>no</hi> apparent <hi>remedy,</hi> as the Scripture sometimes phraseth it. Not that the day of grace is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o be limited to three years, but during <hi>G</hi>ods pleasure, and his pains is intimated, in that all this while he kept coming and looking; which signifies the frequent reiterated means of grace that are used With sinners, and the often applications of the Spirit of <hi>G</hi>od, to them, during the day of Patience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The missing of his expectation after all this; <hi>and find none:</hi> and that is the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the provocation, that not only at first coming, but after so often coming, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained still as it was, unfruitful.</p>

               </gap>phasis put upon this complaint; <hi>looked:</hi> the word is sometimes used as a note of attention, when some observable thing is pointed at, and therefore it is also often used as a note of <hi>Admiration,</hi> when some strange thing that is to be wondred at is <hi>mentioned which calls</hi> for <hi>Astonishment</hi> from the <hi>Beholders.</hi>

               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:000581_0118_0FA70F6EEFCA44A8"/>
There are two <hi>Observations lie plain in</hi> the words.</p>

               <p>Thus is the Landlord here brought in making of particular remarks upon what he had done; and what he had observed.</p>
               <p>There are several <hi>Propositions</hi> contained in this Doctrine, a brief explication of which will serve for the clearing up the Truth contained in it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>PROPOSITION I:</head>
               <p>That <hi>G</hi>od useth a great deal of Patience with some sinners under the Gospel. Though he affords them the means of Grace, and they do not presently give them due enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, but neglect them, yet he doth not always presently fall upon, and cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000581_0119_0FA70F6F0605E2A8"/>
from these means, but suffers them to live a great while under them, and waits upon them. Here observe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Patience of God is Soveraign and Arbitray. It is an act of his meer good pleasure: as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ows to no sinners a room in his Vineyard, or so much as an offer of Grace; so, upon their neglecting to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the means, and refusing the offers of Grace made to them, he might righteously take away his Gospel from them, or them from it; and although he would be severe, yet he would be very just. The New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a Covenant of Grace, and all that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> done for men in it, is therefore free: as he acts his pleasure in chusing who shall be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vineyard, he doth it no less in <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> their continuance in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This patience is exerted towards some and not all. As <hi>G</hi>od is Soveraign so he makes use of his Soveraignty, to let us know that he is so. How many are there that are born in places where the Gospel is enjoyed, who never live to years of understanding, to have any offer of Grace made to them; of whom, though God can work his Grace in them by his spirit, and hath given godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents good reason to hope well concerning them, (but this dispensation is a secret;) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this is a truth, that they are taken out of the Vineyard, before they are capable of the moral
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000581_0120_0FA70F703B90AC28"/>
means used in it. We find also such to whom the Gospel hath been offered, and at their, first refusal of it they have been discarded, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 45, 46. yea such an injunction Christ laid upon his Disciples; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence also God useth his pleasure in the timing his Patience to these and those. All that are waited upon have not the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the day of grace, and season for bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruit; but some a longer, and some a shorter time, having no other bounds, but his will: nor hath he told any sinners how long it shall be: he would not have any such to presume, but calls all to improve the present time; doth not acquaint them when he will put an end to his Patience if they repent not: some sinners are cut down in their full strength, others are suffered to live and grow: old, and all this while God is patient, he bears and forbears, for there is no hour in which they are open not to his displeasure, and giving him provocation to fall upon them in his anger: &amp; there are some whom he will make to experience his <hi>forbearance to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,</hi> Rom. 9. 23.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="proposition">
               <head>PROPOSITION II.</head>
               <p>That in this day of Patience, God takes a great deal of pains with sinners, to engage
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:000581_0121_0FA70F7076639D50"/>
them unto fruitfulness. The Owner did not only tarry three years, but he was all this while <hi>coming, i. e.</hi> upon all occasions; and he comes to <hi>seek fruit.</hi> Gods coming to sinners under the <hi>G</hi>ospel, doth not intend a meer observation, but also the endeavours that he useth with them for their good, in the application of means to them in such a way as to invite and encourage them; and this will be evident if we consider, when God may properly be said to come? Gods coming is not to be understood only in respect of his Omnipresence, for that all Beings are equally sharers in, but it intends his application of himself to them for the perswading of them to Repentance. There is therefore an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and an inward coming here to be taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God comes outwardly to men in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in his Providences. These are the external means which he makes use of, which are suited to the nature of man, and have a voice of God in them. The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are primarily so, being appointed of God to discover his mind and meaning to the children of men; in which he reveals to them the way of profiting; declares what is his will and their Duty; shews them their native barrenness, and where their fruit is to be had; calls upon them to attend the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of neglect, sets before them the gracious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of Obedience, and is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally putting them in mind of the things which they are apt to forget. God indeed useth the Ministry of men in these respects, but they are <hi>Ambassadors</hi> that represent God himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. to <hi>hearken</hi> to them, is to <hi>hearken</hi> to him; to <hi>despise</hi> them, is to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise</hi> him. Thus God comes every Sabbath; and Lecture; in every Ordinance that is Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, every Sermon that is Preached, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry counsel and warning that is privately gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 4. 7.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>God comes also inwardly to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ts in these Ordinances and Providences. There are the near approaches of God to them, which though others discern not, yet they themselves cannot but be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of.

and moves upon the hearts of men, leaves some touches there, which are for their awakening, and put them under Conviction, and upon considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There are oftentimes secret whispers in mens Souls, which say to them, this is your concern, which fasten this and that cord upon them; which under such Providences as they met with, makes them to reflect and consider, which put them upon purposing and promising, or at least upon thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deliberation with themselves: and as long as it is so, God is coming inwardly as well us out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. It is true, this inward application i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. That God keeps an exact account of all this patience, and these pains. He hath a Book of memorial, in which he enters upon the record all his layings out upon them. Books of Register are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ascribed to <hi>G</hi>od, after the manner of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:000581_0124_0FA70F740A8C68B0"/>
men, to intimate to us, that he hath the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account of such things with him, that he keeps them in remembrance, and forgets none of them. For this reason we have him so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in his word, giving his people close hints of what he had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n doing for them at this &amp; that time, and how long he had bin at it, <hi>Jer</hi> 25.2. and else-where. He observes and keeps the account how many Sermons they have heard, what Counsels were given to them here and there, how many Sabbaths, they have had the advantage of, how many of his servants he hath sent to speak to them, what they said; how many applications his spirit hath made to their souls, how long it is from the first day to this And if any shall enquire, what makes God so accurate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording these memorials, There are two reasons for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God sets an high value upon these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his which he thus affords unto men. He looks upon them to be extraordinary kindnesses, That any should be planted in his Vineyard, and there have the priviledge of all the tendance of it: he therefore saith of such, that he hath known them after a singular manner, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. and there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a day wherein men are spared notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their unprofitableness, never an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that he makes to them, but it is of great worth: they are favours which carry
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:000581_0125_0FA70F74499FC2A8"/>
in them singular demonstrations of his good will, and they bring with them the greatest advantages to the children of men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve none of them: God challengeth men, if they can to tell him, <hi>What he could have done more for them:</hi> well then may he keep the records of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>G</hi>od intends to call sinners that have neglected them, to an account about them. They are indeed free favours, if we consider our merit, and we could never have claimed them, or Gods liberty who had no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from us to bestow them upon us: but they are not so free as to be forgotten, or as if we were no way concerned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we use or abuse them: no, in the day of accounts, which is coming, they are all to be reckoned for. When the Lord made up the reckoning with his <hi>Servants,</hi> he dealt with each of them according to the number of <hi>Talents</hi> which they had received of him. Sabbaths, Sermons, and Sacraments; and Mercies, and afflictions must be answered for. Now that a true Reckoning may be made, an exact account must be kept, men must be made Debtors in Gods Book for all these Items; they must be charged in order to their being answered for; and that they may so be, they must be Registred.</p>

respect to their bearing, or barrenness. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards have always an eye unto something that is done, it is not therefore enough that God observes and remembers what he nath done for men, but he also must have on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side the account of what they have done: how else shall the accounts be adjusted between them; or by what rule shall he give them their rewards? especially if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

There is a reward of Grace, and a reward of Vengeance, a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of Life, and of Death; there are some that do bear fruit, that do improve the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and layings out of God faithfully, and for these there is a <hi>C</hi>racious remuneration; blessedness is secured to them by promise, and they must receive it: but there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that neglect the means, and instead of yeilding the good fruits of holiness, do bring forth the vile fruits of sin, and by that means <hi>turn the Grace of God into wantonness;</hi> these are to be rewarded with misery; there are punishments appointed for them.

                  </gap>ts and improvements. There is not only a distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of rewards, to be made, according as men are found fruitful or barren; but they are to be measured according to the degres of either. It is true, the recompenses of fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness are of meer grace, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we can do, that will earn any degree of happiness for us; but yet if God please to proportion glory hereafter, according as he measures out grace here, who shall forbid him? if the Lord will say to him that hath <hi>gained ten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But as to unfruitful ones, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that every offer of grace despised, is a new provocation, every Sabbath neglected is a farther affront offered to the goodness of God, and should he not make these mens suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to be accordingly greater, than theirs who had less time, and fewer endeavours u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with them, he would be a loser in some of his works, which he must not be. The Declarative <hi>G</hi>lory of God then calls for it: and because he will have glory answerable to his expenses, he must keep the account: hence we read of his rewarding <hi>men according to

               <p n="1">1. That a place in the visible Church is a dangerous station.

Is all charged upon them, and are their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments under it set down to their score? doth God write down every thing? it will then be a large scrowl that all such will have to be called to an account for: and O that bareless sinners would think much of this; it might serve greatly to put the aw of God upon their hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence see the great folly and danger of all such as boast of their priviledges, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the improvement of them. How many are there who talk high of what they enjoy? they are placed in Gods House, they are favoured with all the benefits of the <hi>G</hi>os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: but in the mean while, they are regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to themselves, and to their lives; they

take no heed to themselves how they live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these liberties; and yet they value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves according to these things: and what multitudes are there who have found that this kind of computation hath proved their undoing? these must needs run a fearful risk and will be sadly disappointed, when after they have boasted and bragged of their great enjoyments, they shall be summoned to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for all, and a fearful scrowl shall be drawn up against them, of their horrible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, contempt and unprofitableness under all? when they shall sadly be convinced, that it had been better for them to have grown in any other Soyl in the world, then to have had a place in the Vineyard?</p>

               <p n="1">1. The neglect of this duty is one great reason of the barrenness of professors.

               <p n="2">2. This reckoning, if any thing, will quicken you to present duty. I am sure that it carries matter of awful awakening in it, and helps to convince us how much we are concerned to see that our matters be good; to think that we have to do with a God, who is so strict in observing and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and is consequently like to be so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action reckoning, with us. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it to be an argument of strong perswasion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Be frequent and distinct in observing all the ways in which <hi>G</hi>od comes to you. There hath been a summary account of this given in the explication of the Doctrine: and if <hi>G</hi>od distinctly observes them, do you do so too; and that both outwardly and inwardly: and be very particular: remember this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that Lecture, this mercy, that afflection, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> what was spoken in your hearing, and what there was whispered in your hearts: and reckon, not only the seasons that you did enjoy; but what you might have enjoyed if you had not willingly, at least negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted; for God certainly doth so; and you must expect to hear of it again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Examine you selves particulatly what use you have made of these things. Set down the improvement over-against the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment: this is the way to have the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts clear. Say to your own Souls, God

came to me at such a time in his Word, and spake thus, what impression did it make on my heart and life: he came in such a mercy, what did I render to him for it? he spake to me by such an affliction, how did I resent it? what is my profiting by all these things? and that your account may be full, enquire after your carriage both in the time, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards: what impression did it leave on your hearts? did you entertain God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, or did you reject him? and how did it in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="1">1. Let the Conviction of barrenness quicken you to repentance, and diligence. How many, if they would draw up the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts faithfully, will find that they have ill requited God, and never born any fruit? and who is there but may sadly say, I have not come up as I ought, to an answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to what God hath been doing for me? and what doth this call for, but that we go to God and bewail it, repent of it, and seek to have the accounts adjusted by Christ our Surety? and to ask of him grace that we may be up and doing, and redeem the time that remains, in better diligence, serving him more and better.</p>

               <p n="1">1. When men may be said to be barren after all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It hath been already expressed under a former Doctrine, what are the Characters of a fruitless tree in the Vineyard. All I shall here add is only to observe, that there is a two-fold barrenness that may be taken notice of in professors that sit under the means of Grace, and have long enjoyed <hi>G</hi>ods patient strivings with them, <abbr>VIZ;</abbr> total and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Total barrenness is when men, after all, remain in their natural state, unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God. Every Child of <hi>Adam,</hi> in his unconverted state, is barren: he is utterly uncapable of bringing forth any fruit that is acceptable to <hi>G</hi>od; he is a briar and thorn, and cannot bear figs. The sinner, before conversion, hath no saving principle in him, and therefore he <hi>cannot serve</hi> G<hi>od;</hi> his best moral actions are but glitering abominations: as long therefore as he abides thus, and doth not truly turn to God, he is the same man that he was born: whatsoever men obtain by means, though they get a great deal of literal, knowledge in the things of God, and obtain so much of a civil and moral conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as the young man in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. yet if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="132" facs="unknown:000581_0137_0FA70F80F39FE588"/>
he be not savingly changed, if he be not throughly turned to <hi>G</hi>od, he is an <hi>empty vine,</hi> his works are <hi>dead works,</hi> he is still <hi>dead in trespasses</hi> and sins. Nature under all its moral refinings, is but nature still; grace is another manner of thing, and he is a stranger to it; he is yet <hi>in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and bond of iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Partial barrenness is when Professors do not bring forth fruit answerable to their tilling. When Christians have a new princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of grace in them, and do bear real fruit, but it is little they bring forth, nothing in comparison with the cost and Pains that is laid out upon them: and good scarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be called so, in them from whom far better is expected. <hi>G</hi>od doth not afford to all his people alike advantages; and a tree may be counted fruitful for one Soil that may be reputed unfruitful in another: and it is apparent, that some Christians that enjoy the same helps, that grow in the same Vineyard, do abundantly less for God than others do; now these may be said in a degree to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: and although the Doctrine more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially arms at the former, yet these also come under the consideration of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whence it is that they are so? <hi>i. e.</hi> that they abide unfruitful after all endeavours patiently used with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are these things here to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:</p>

               <p n="2">2. In respect of partial barrenness.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a root of corruption, tending to unfruitfulness, in <hi>G</hi>ods children in this life, <hi>Paul</hi> hath his <hi>body of death</hi> which pesters him; and what is the tendency of Death but barrenness? <hi>a dead womb</hi> is a barren womb; a dead heart, a barren heart.

<pb n="135" facs="unknown:000581_0140_0FA70F860DE4AFB8"/>
contrary to them, and this was the things which made <hi>Paul</hi> so unable <hi>to do the things that he would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There are a great many Temptations that the Children of God do meet with to hinder them in their constant serving of God. The World we live in, is a place of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every thing is full of it: and the tendency of it is to abure or discourage the Christian from his work. There are the Temptations of carnal pleasures, of worldly encumbrances, of difficulties and threatning dangers in Duty. Riches have their shares, and so hath poverty: peace hath its allure-ments, and persecution it's affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The corrupt part that is in us, often takes advantage by these Temptations to obstruct the Christian in his business. It is by these things that <hi>the Law in his Members brings him into Capativity?</hi> and if the Spirit of God leaves him to himself to try what is in him, it is always so: he either dallies with allurements, and diverts unhappily to these things, and spends his time with them; or he stops at discouragements, and sits still dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned; and by these means he neglects the work of God, which causeth the fruits of Holiness to grow very thin upon him, as the grapes on the vines after the Vintage, <hi>Micah.</hi> 7. 2.</p>

3. Wherein this appears to be so great an aggravation of their <hi>G</hi>uilt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This will be seen by laying those things together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is the duty of sinners to hearken to the voice of God. Whatever pleas men may pretendedly make of their own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, it gives them no discharge from the obligation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Duty which is lying upon them. God is the rightful Lord and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver; and his commands have an Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence due to them from the creature, who cannot with hold it without the guilt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Besides, the Gospel takes off all excuse here; because it looks upon men as being without strength in themselves, and hath accordingly provided and offered all help to them in <hi>Christ,</hi> whose spirit is ready and able to do all that is wanting. Now it is certain that God requires fruit of all that enjoy the means: he <hi>looks</hi> for it, <hi>Text.</hi> It is <hi>his will</hi> that they bear it, 1 <hi>Thes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this Patience of God gives men a great deal of opportunity to bring forth fruit, if they had an heart to it. This life is a time of serving God in; that which follows is the time of reward: the longer therefore men live in Gods Vineyard, the greater season they have of doing him service: every day that they are there continued, puts a new</hi> price into their hands, <hi>which, when once Gods patience is at an end,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000581_0142_0FA70F8962A13FE8"/>
men must never more expect to enjoy: and hence the more of it is now allowed them, which they improve not, the more opportunity is lost: it gives them</hi> space <hi>to bethink themselves, to reflect upon their Ways and courses, to recover their lost time, and to</hi> redeem their season, <hi>by a better and more diligent improvement of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The means afforded them are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as means, to the end of fruitfulness. Means indeed are to be looked at in their proper place, and acknowledged as so; and in this respect there is nothing wanting to them, which is proper and suitable in this affair. Our fruit is <hi>a reasonable service, Ro.</hi>

4. Hence this patience, and these pains which God useth are leading to Repentance. If the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Forbearance</hi> of God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised towards heathen are so, <hi>Rom,</hi> 2. 3. How much more are these <hi>G</hi>ospel endeavours so, which he lays out upon men that are under the dispensations of it? They lead by way of Conviction shewing men what reason there is why they should so do; and they lead also by way of Invitation: there is an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the things themselves, patience saith that God is not willing these sinners should perish, else he needed not to have waited no them, who every day gave him provocation; and that hath a loud call in it. Every time <hi>G</hi>od, comes in an Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. Hence the more men have of these, and continue unfruitful under them, the more is God despised, and his favours abused. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenness under Gods patience &amp; pleading with men, addes contempt to unprofitableness, and by this means all the expense that is laid out upon them comes to be lost, as to their benefit, &amp; they do what in them lies to frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate God of his just expectation. For a tree in the <hi>W</hi>ilderness to bear nothing is not so much, but when it is transplanted into the

Men are wont to cut up trees in their Gardens by the hands of their Servants, who look after them; God will do this to these with his own hand, only he would have his Ministers to give them faithful notice of it. But I supose there is something more in it then so: Let us then here observe, that there is a twofold
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:000581_0153_0FA70F9606E75580"/>
cutting off of sinners according to Scripture; the one is <hi>Ministerial,</hi> the other <hi>Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This latter is Gods prerogative, and he doth it by those Judgments which he brings upon them, in which also he often uses the Instrumentality of second causes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth it by war, sometimes by pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential diseases, sometimes by the hand of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil justice to which he suffers them to expose themselves; and he hath many ways to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish it by; but in this the Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is not concerned. The former of these belongs properly to them, as they are the Ambassadors of God, sent to treat with men about the affairs of the Kingdom, who, if men will not accept of the terms of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and comply with the Articles offered them, are, after all means used to bring them to it unsuccessfully, to proclaim war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. They are first to call and counsel, and plead with sinners, and if that will not do, then are they to warn them, and if they accept not of that, their business then is to threaten them, and tell them what they are to expect; and this the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, calls <hi>killing of them, Hos.</hi> 6. 5. and in this sense must <hi>Jeremiah'</hi>s Commission be interpreted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 10.</p>

1. That though Gods Patience be himself, and therefore Infinite, yet it is exercised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Wisdom and pleasure. Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes considered as in God, are God, for he is one individed Essence, and pure act, and therefore every vertue which we ascribe to <hi>G</hi>od, must be acknowledged to be Infinite in him: but yet as they are made to shine out in his works of Efficiency, we are to account them voluntary, and managed according to the Wisdom of God: he therefore measures them out to the Creature more or less, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own discretion. For men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to argue from the Divine Nature of <hi>G</hi>ods love, mercy, forbearance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to please themselves with an opinion that he must be boundless in his expressions of them to the creature, is a vain fancy, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which <hi>G</hi>od warns men against, lest they should so cheat themselves into ruine, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God must and will be glorified in all those Attributes of his which he displays to the children of men. God doth all things for himself; his own glory is his own last end in all his works of Efficiency, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he manageth the whole discovery of them, with an eye fixed on this end: he had been glorious in himself, if he had never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested any of his Perfections to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but if he do thus make himself known, he will bring about his declarative glory by
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:000581_0158_0FA70F9E35425E70"/>
it: it is that which is dear to him, and he will not part with it. If therefore he be patient with sinners, and wait upon them when he might destroy them; if he deferr his revenge, and suppress his anger, he will have the honour of this, he will get to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a name by <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That for which God waits upon sinners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel is to see if they will bear fruit. That which is the end of a tree's planting, is that which a man expects of it, and for that it is he lets it grow, and waits from year to year to see if it answers the end,</hi> Text. <hi>Men are planted in Gods Vineyard on purpose for fruit; there are none standing there of whom it is not expected. Now the Husbandman knows that time must be allowed to trees planted, for their fructifying; and he is wont to think, that though such a tree doth not this year answer his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but goes over, and bears nothing; yet it is possible it may make amends for it the next year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if then it also misseth, yet if it doth but blossom, and bid fair for it, though all fall off and dy away, he is willing to try one season more, as being loth to cut it down if it may be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but still all his patience is, because he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it may at last bear: Thus God expresseth his waiting upon sinners to be upon such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi> Zeph. 3. 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That all the while that any remain unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Gods Vineyard, they cast contempt on
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000581_0159_0FA70F9EF8361B30"/>
Gods Patience.</hi> For this reason impenitent sinners are said to <hi>despise it,</hi> Rom. 2. 3. <hi>G</hi>od looks upon himself to be scorned, and his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be trampled on by such persons; for hereby they do withstand and directly set themselves against the very design of the <hi>G</hi>ospel, they do, as to the present efficacy, make void all the pains and endeavours that are laid out upon them; they <hi>turn the grace of God into wantonness: G</hi>od waits for their repentance, and they answer it with obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and impenitence, which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: and when is mercy despised, but when it is abused? and what greater abuse can be offered to it than this?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence <hi>G</hi>od is hereby greatly dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore must needs be very highly provoked. For Sinners to offer an affront to any of Gods Attributes, is a reflection of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour upon him. Men count themselves disparaged when they lose their labour; and Gods Honour is trodden upon by Sinners when they abide unprofitable in his vineyard, If then he be bound for his glory in all, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e <hi>Jealous for his great Name,</hi> it must be an high provocation that is thus offered to him; and we must not think that he cannot resent it; no, he declares that his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is <hi>grieved</hi> by such things, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 40. and <hi>they vex him, Isa.</hi> 63. 10. and therefore God himself is brought in making that complaint,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000581_0160_0FA70F9FB24629B8"/>
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. <hi>I am pressed under you as a Cart that is pressed with sheaves.</hi> God speaks as a man, who though he bears, and is patient, as to any discovery of himself, yet is inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary, and finds a burden which he would willingly be eased of: intimating that he is displeased at such things; and he is wont to express this di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pleasure of his, partly in the solemn warnings of his Ordinances, partly in the rebukes of his Providence, which he lays upon such, in sore and heavy affliction; to signify, that though for the present he bears with them, yet he is dissatisfied at them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That impenitent sinners grow worse and worse under the Patience of God, and so add to the provocation. The means of grace under which men are continued during the long-suffering of God, are either a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life,</hi> or of <hi>death.</hi> Now impenitency or unprofitableness makes them to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death, and that is by hardening them in sin; and therefore we find that <hi>evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> are said to <hi>grow worse,</hi> and this is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effect in such; for their hearts being naught, they misimprove all the means to nourish their corruption, and so grow more obstinate, which operation being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the <hi>G</hi>ospel calls for, which is that they should grow better by it, must needs lay in the more anger of God against them, and therefore the longer they thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000581_0161_0FA70FA08834AD70"/>
the more must his jealousie be enflamed against them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Men at length grow hopeless, and then Patience is bootless. For if the proper end of <hi>G</hi> ods patience be to wait for fruit of them, to see if it will not at last repent them of their barrenness; if they will not think <hi>of their ways, and turn their feet unto Gods Commandments;</hi> then the design of it is at an end, when all expectation of this is over: as long as the Owner supposeth that his tree may in time become serviceable, there is some reason for his letting it stand in the Vineyard, but when all grounds of so look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it fail, and he utterly despairs of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such thing, what should he let it stand for any longer? That there is such a state which sinners do in time arrive at, we are told, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 16. not that any are gone so far as to out-do Almighty power, but so as to despise all manner of means, and grow obstinate and remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. Hence God is now put upon it to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own glory of them, by bearing no longer.

If men think the Sanctuary to be a shelter for wickedness, a place where they may safely sin, and be out of the reach of danger, they wofully cheat themselves.

It saith,</hi> if you believe you shall be saved, <hi>but it saith too,</hi> if you believe not, you shall be damned; <hi>it saith, if you bear fruit you shall be commended, but it also assures you, that if you bear none you shall be condemned: yea, as it hath</hi> better promises, <hi>so it hath more severe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings than the first Covenant had. Think it not to be enough to say, I am in the Covenant, and so to run away with a carnal confidence, that all is well: But put your selves upon a thorough search, and enquire what part of the Covenant you stand under; there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween being under the Covenant-promise, and threatning; nothing is more comfortable than the former, nothing more amazing than the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and know it, that if you abide barren still, this is your condition, and you may well expect to have the threatning accomplished upon you.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. In generall, that God frequently falls upon such sinners, when they least expect it. Not but that they have reason and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds for this expectation; if they would entertain them; for indeed their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry barrenness is enough to excite it in them: but when they, through carnal confidence and vain security; indulge themselves in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance of many more days of tranquility, shut their eyes against convictions, and so live without fear of evil; then God breaks in upon them, and makes them to feel the impressions of his indignation; when they say, <hi>To morrow shall be as this day; and much more abundant,</hi> when they despise warnings, and trample upon threatnings, and say, the <hi>Vision is for many days to come.</hi> Thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour declares that it shall be done to the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful</hi> S<hi>teward, Mat.</hi> 24. 50 51. this <hi>Paul</hi> tells us shall be the lot of such as neglect a day of grace, 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 3.</p>

neglects not the husbandry of it, but gives it the tendance that is proper, and he is wont to do so, till he resolves with himself that there will no good come of it, and so to remove it away. Thus God doth by men in the visible Church; let them be never so sinful and vain, yet they shall have the Ordinances, and possibly many convictions of the Spirit, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenings and terrors, which are a witness that Gods day of Patience is not at an end with them; but it doth not say but that they may speedily be cut off: <hi>the man without the</hi> W<hi>edding Garment</hi> is taken from the Table: this therefore is no plea sufficient to build your confidence upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>G</hi>od frequently withdraws his Spirit from the means, as the first effect of his departure from unfruitful sinners.

Look where we will, and observe the frame of things, the state of affairs at home, abroad, in publick, in private concerns, and they all witness that God hath a controversy with us, and that it is begun: and how many are taken by it? and now let us ask, why is all this? <hi>what means the heat of this anger?</hi> is it not for the barrenness of Gods people? is it not because he hath been <hi>coming to sick fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finds it not?</hi> I am sure every unprofitable soul hath reason to think of it, and that with trembling too, and to say, will not this Judgment find me out? and suppose it should sieze me in particular, will it not be a righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon me? when God is bringing of his Judgments upon his visible people, they that <hi>forget</hi> God, had need to <hi>consider</hi> with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

               <p n="1">1. What is contained or implied in this cutting down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The Metaphor here used, sutably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents those Judgments of <hi>G</hi>od which fall upon unprofitable ones, in the progress of them; we may therefore take up the allusion in several particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Cutting down a fig-tree in the vineyard argues the Owners great displeasure at it. It saith that he can bear it no longer there: as long as he afforded it dressing, it shewed that he had a favour for it; but this action Proves that now he hath none. Cutting down a timber tree may be with approabati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to put it into the building which he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it meet for; but cutting down a fruit-tree is from disapprobation, because he sees it unworthy of his care. Hereby therefore is expressed that God is exceeding angry at men; that his pity and compassion is ended, and his wrath is kindled. God hath no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in him, properly essential to him, but we ascribe them to him with respect to his Providence. The Scripture therefore signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies such things to be the fruits of his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4 4. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 28. <hi>Job.</hi> 20. 28. Godly men are taken away by death, but it is to make pillars of them in the Celestial Temple; to transplant them into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:000581_0172_0FA70FB1D98971F0"/>
Paradise; but these are cut down to shew that God hates them. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Cutting down is Properly for destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. This is the true import of the word here: it is not a promise, but a threatning, when a tree is cut down and rooted up, it is by that very act destroyed; it kills it, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently dies upon it, it withers up, the sap <hi>&amp;</hi> leaves are presently gone, there is henceforth no more possibility that it should bear any fruit; it puts an end to all hopes of any such thing. Christ therefore intends that God will destroy the sinner; he before seemed to have some sap in him, and bear the leaves of a fair profession, it may be: but new as the <hi>Fig-tree Cursed</hi> by Christ, <hi>he withers up to the very roots<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The Apostle speaks of some in the Visible Church, <hi>whose end is destruction, Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for such a person: he shall have no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Grace, no more strivings of his Spirit, no more dews of Ordinances; he puts an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to all warnings, counsels, perswasions, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>He saith to the Clouds that they rain no more upon him, Isa.</hi> 5. 6. it puts a full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to his day of grace, withdraws from him all the means of good. There is a vast difference between afflicting his professing people, and cutting them down; a man may be afflicted for his good, but if he be cut down, it is for his hurt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is an instrument used by the Husbandman, for the cutting down of the tree withal. This is fitted and prepared for the purpose. Men use an ax in this service, and they are wont to sharpen it that it may do it effectually. Thus we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>The ax is laid to the root of the tree.</hi> This is the ax of Divine Vengeance, and God is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pleased to do this by the instrumentality of second causes, fitted by him for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: these are for this reason called his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in Scripture; his <hi>Ax<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> his <hi>Saw,</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="169" facs="unknown:000581_0174_0FA70FB32EF48DB8"/>
him alive; it chops him down, and there is an end of him here: sometimes he delivers him up into the hands of an Enemy, and he slays him without pity: these do it but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally; they are <hi>G</hi>ods Tools, and it is he who makes use of them for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are usually divers stroaks given for the cutting a tree down, it is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily done at once, but several blows; it is a successive action; every stroak doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward it, but the thing is accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by degrees, it falls not till the last be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and thus God often proceeds gradually to the destruction of such sinners; he first <hi>kills them by Prophets,</hi> and afterwards by his own hand; he first smites them with spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al plagues, and after that with temporal judgments. It is true, God sometimes to shew his power and the strength of his hand, useth a sharp ax, and strikes a fearful blow, by which he cuts them down at once, but for the most part he doth it by divers Judgments successive; and it is to be observed that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which God doth to them, after once he hath clapt the curse and seal of his wrath upon them, is a stroak given towards their cutting down, a step directly to their ruine <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Cutting down is in order to casting out. When the Husbandman is come to
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:000581_0175_0FA70FB4114F6198"/>
this work, it saith that he is resolved this tree shall stand here no longer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as soon as that is done he presently throws it out of the vineyard; it is there to continue no longer: if he had intended it a room in his Orchard, he would have let it grow still, for it was because he could not endure to see it there that he thus dealt with it. Thus God, when he comes to bring this Judgment upon unfruitful professors, he removes them by it out of the visible Church, he takes them away from all relation, to, or benefit of the priviledges that hitherto they had enjoyed there. There is an Ordinance of Christ, instituted in his Church, whereby men are cut off from communion with his people, which is a ministerial cutting them down, and is a sigure or token of what God himself will do to such if they repent not, but go on to provoke him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. C<hi>utting down is for some other use. When the Owner cuts up his fig-tree, and casts it out of the Vineyard, he doth not throw it away and make no improvement of it; no, though it will not bear figs, yet it will make fires; and so it will not be altogether unprofitable, though it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers not the end of its planting, yet there is an use that he puts it to; he therefore makes it up into faggots, and so burns it as he hath occasion for it; and such is the improvement which God makes of such as did not serve and glorifie him
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:000581_0176_0FA70FB707A39CB8"/>
in his Church; he cuts them down, he destroys them; but still he makes use of them; though they are not fit to be</hi> vessels of honour, <hi>yet he makes them</hi> vessels of dishonour, <hi>and that also turns to his honour and glory. There is an hell which</hi> G<hi>od hath prepared for the exalting of the glory of his revenging Justice in; and there are the monuments on whom this glory is exalted, and in whom it is manifested eternally: now such as being fruitless in the vineyard, provoke God to cut them down, are thus disposed of by him, and he is so glorified in them for ever:</hi> he is known in his Judgments which he execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; <hi>thus are the tares and the chaff, which grow together with the good grain in the field, disposed of, Mat.</hi> 13 30. 3. 12. <hi>thus,</hi> the tree that brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire, <hi>verse</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why it must come to this when Gods patience is wearied?</p>
               <p>A. This will be evident by the consideration of these things?</p>
               <p n="1">1. These were all of them heirs of destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion before in their natural state. All those that are planted in Gods Vineyard, were at the first transplanted out of the Wilderness; there was no difference in them from others, but what God was pleased to make by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under the <hi>G</hi>ospel, so the Apostle tells his Ephesians, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12: yea he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures them that, <hi>They were by nature Children

of wrath even as others, verse.</hi> 3. All mankind were fallen under condemnation by sin; God in his mercy picks up whom he pleaseth among these, and puts them under the means of Salvation, where he makes the offers, and proposeth the terms of it unto them; but still this is their natural estate, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore puts his people in mind of what they were, when he first looked upon them, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 16. 3: God for this end appointed a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to be solemnly observed by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel, and to be after at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time openly acknowledged, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er patience which reprieved them from that destruction all this while. There was nothing in them to lay him under the obligation to do it. Men are not in themselves any things the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Morally for being in the visible Church; they have the same nature in them, the same evil heart cleaving to them. It alters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their outward estate, but that in it self doth not change their hearts; nor are they at all changed, as long as they remain bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, that very thing is an evidence that they are the same men still: It therefore can be
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:000581_0178_0FA70FB86F050C60"/>
nothing but patience that keeps ruine from them. It cannot be thought rationally, that God is the less provoked by them, because they are within the pale, whilst they abide unfruitful, than he is with others, or that their sin is less, because they are there, no, but a great deal more: they are a trial to his patience, they live upon it, it is that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keeps them from perishing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The end of patience being thus alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether frustrate, there now remains nothing else but destruction for them. Why did God bear and wait? it was not for nothing; no, it was to see if they would comply with him, and do him services; if they would repent of their sins, and believe in Christ, and do good works, but they do no such thing, but continue to be obstinate, they out-stand all the essays that are used with them, and dishonour God by so doing, and now they are fit for nothing else the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was our before, it was only stopt upon this trial; and after all it avails not; what else is there to be done, but to give i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

4. And this abuse of his patience must needs heighten the provocation, for now it is reduced to this exigence, that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther course remains to be taken. When up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trial made, men prove hopeless; things are brought to that pass, that there is nothing else not be done; and not only so, but all that hath bin thus done for them, would else be wholly lost, and God should have no Glory at all by it there is so much more guilt added as there have been means used, and neglected offers of Grace made and despised: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sinners in the World must perish, for their falling short of the <hi>G</hi>lory of God; sinners in the visible Church much more for offering abuse and contempt to these essays that have been used with them, to bring them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is certain that such though they have outward priviledges above them, yet in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they are to God esteemed no better than Heanthen, <hi>Amos.</hi> 9: 7: <hi>Are ye not as Children of the Ethiopians to me?

               <p n="1">1. That God hath threatned these with more intolerable punishments: and he stands concerned for it in point of honour, that so he may be no loser in the end by any of his Creatures, which he should be, if he should not make such to be more eminent and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable instances of his displeasure.

               <p n="1">1: A barren fruit-tree in a vineyard is a very great disgrace to it. The credit of a vineyard, is that it yields much fruit: this
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:000581_0189_0FA70FC866814108"/>
is it which gains it esteem, and makes it to he preferred before the wilderness. Every tree then that bears proportionably, confers its share to this credit, and consequently, any one that bears nothing diminisheth from it, and is oftentimes more taken notice of than the others that do bear; &amp; it is certain, that there is a great deal of reproach that accrues to the Church of Christ, by the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of those in it that do not bring forth the fruits which God requires of them. As God expects more, so men look for more of such than of others: and as it is a shame for such who make an eminent profession, and have so many advantages for it, to do nothing for the glory of God, so the reflexion is wont to be made upon the whole, and the Church of Christ which they appertein unto must have dirt cast upon them for it; and they shall suffer more reproach for one such, than get commendation from an hundred exemplary Christians, from the world, who envy the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> have owned the Covenant, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed their subjection thereunto, and yet such they are, and so they live; and what shall
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:000581_0190_0FA70FC901B3A370"/>
judge of the rest of them? Thus Christ's Vineyard gets a bad name by such as these.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A barren tree in the vineyard, takes up the room which might be better employed. There is a considerable quantity of ground allowed for a tree to stand and grow in: he who plants an Orchard, allows convenient dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for the trees to spread themselves in, &amp; to have the advantage of the Sun-beams, that so they may have the help afforded them that is requisite for their flourishing, and bearing of fruit: now if the tree be unfruitful, all this ground is lost, and left, idle, as to any profit, it is as good to have nothing at all upon it, as that which yields nothings; and that must needs be a cumber: and in the mean while it occupies the place in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that would bear, might stand: The same ground would do for a fruitful tree, that is lost upon a barren one; and if there were such as one there, the same ground and the same tillage would be serviceable for something; whereas this turns to no account at all. Unregenerate Sinners, that do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things for God, take up as much room in the visible Church as others, they have a like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward priviledges with them; but the room they occupy is lost as to them: if in their stead there were such as love God, as fear and serve him, such means and advantages
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:000581_0191_0FA70FCA02103E78"/>
would forward them abundantly, and what a cumber must God needs account this to be?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence, a barren tree in a vineyard draws away the sap and strength of the ground to no purpose. The ground spends, and its vertue is as much exhausted by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a barren tree, as one that bears ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much fruit: it sucks away its vertue, and makes it require as much mending, and all for nothing: and this is really mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to it. It is the same Soil to appearance, the same fruitful hill in which Hypocrites and formal Professors are planted, that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christians grow in, for G<hi>ods vineyard is upon a fruitful hill, Isa.</hi> 5. 1. and the same means are used with them, the same cost is laid out upon the one and the other, so far as concerns means, for God demands <hi>what he could do more, verse</hi> 3. and it is by a formal improvement of these, that an Hypocrite maintains his profession, and makes such a flourish in those leaves which he bears. It is from the vineyards fatne's that he sucks up his formality, makes his brags and boasts, and by which he upholds himself, or else he would wither away quickly; and by this means it comes to be spent unprofitably, and to damage.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hence, all that is done to the barren tree, is thrown away upon it. All the digging and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:000581_0192_0FA70FCA91050E40"/>
mending, all the showers and dews which fall upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, all the warm sun, beams that influence it turn to no account, because it is barren still: for if it bears no fruit it doth nothing to answer the end for which it was there planted. And thus it is in respect of such as bring forth no spiritual fruit in the Church of God: not only do they themselves miss of their end and Gods just expectation, but all that is done for them doth, for the present, prove frustrate also: That God will be no loser in the and by them, is no thank to them, they do all that in them lies to defeat him; and did not his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom know how to make his penniworths out of them, he should never get any thing by them. But however, the direct and next end of all means being their serving</hi> G<hi>od, and doing good works, this is altogether frustrated by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the Sabbaths they enjoy, and Ordinances they partake in are lost, all the</hi> dews of Heaven <hi>that fall upon them are dried up, and no good comes of them; all the mercies &amp; afflictions that are expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them make them worse. the</hi> Stone wall, <hi>&amp;</hi> Wine-press <hi>and</hi> Tower <hi>are kept up and repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vain as to them: and, in as much as they belong to the Vineyard, that is also damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A Barren tree in a vineyard doth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to all the plants that grow near it. It is not only useless in it self, but others that are planted within it's verge and shadow are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And truly empty and barren professours in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, do a great deal of harm to others in the society which they belong unto, and especially to such as they have the most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate converse withal: and there are several ways in which they are harmful to others and hinder bearing: especially;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as these encourage one another by evil counsels, and society, in their unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and pernicious courses: and by this means they wonderfully hinder the efficacy of the means of grace upon them, how many good motions of the Spirit upon their Souls are by these ways quenched; the word of God takes hold of this or that barren soul in an ordinance, and leaves awaknings upon him, and this is one step to fertility, if it were followed; but he gets among his vain lewd companions, and they draw him away again to his former courses, and make him to lose all those impressions which he had upon his mind: and if they observe any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietment to be upon his spirit, they either,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:000581_0194_0FA70FCFE48628A0"/>
mock or collouge him out of it. How do vain young men strengthen each other in wickedness, and harden one anothers hearts against the fear of God! how often have there been good hopes that these and those might have been perswaded to return to God, and lay hold on <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> if they had not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in such houses, or associated themselves with such persons, where they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging one another in wickedness, and been learning each of the other to laugh at the counsels and warnings of God, and to <hi>make a mock of sin,</hi> and flout at <hi>G</hi>odliness, thus are we told, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 18. <hi>one sinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth much good.</hi>

so doth; nay that he doth nothing but what is proper and requisite: let it therefore tell all such, what reason you have to expect it; If a tree doth no good, and a great deal of hurt, what shall be done with it else? and that you may see and be convinced of this, let me offer these things:</p>

               <p n="1">1. There is no loss to the Owner in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such a tree down. It never did any good by standing there; it brought in no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the husbandman; his revenue will be never the less when that is gone: and what glory will God lose by you, when you are destroyed? you never did him any service since you were born; he hath been at a great deal of cost upon you, but there hath no good at all come of it; you have stood in the vineyard, but all that you have done hath bin to make a shew, to take up a room there; but if none in his Church should do him more service than you have done, he might even throw it up to the waste Wilderness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for any revenue that is paid him; and is it not wisdom to remove an unprofitable Creature from the earth, and lay out no more upon it to no purpose?</p>

That he should wait so long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from one year to another, and see how they neglect his grace, and dishonour his name, and yet still he holds his hand back, and not fall upon them in his sury, pluck them up and cast them out of his vineyard: are they such a cumber, do they do no good and withall do such a world of harm to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? It must needs be a matter of asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to think that God should not long ago have bin weary with waiting upon them, that he hath not rid himself of Creatures so burdensom to him: Nay it should commend the grace of <hi>G</hi>od to his own Children, who

               <p n="2">2. Here see a reason why <hi>G</hi>od sometimes takes away his Gospel, and the means of grace from a people. There is a parity of reason between a tree in the vineyard, and the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard it self; especially if we consider that it consists of individual trees: If then a fig-tree waited upon to no purpose, abiding barren after all, must come to <hi>cutting down</hi> at last, what may be expected concerning an Orchard of trees, when they come to be all, or most part so? The whole ground that they grow in is lost, and <hi>cumbred</hi> by them. Well then may it be expected, that God will not long keep up the <hi>fence</hi> about such a piece of ground, so unprofitable to him. It may therefore put a people upon serious enquiry, when God begins to lay them waste by desolating Judgments, whether it be not so with them: and it is an awful truth, that though God sometimes keeps up the pale, continues the Gospel, for the sake of a few that are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him, and do honour him by their ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; yet when degeneracy overspreads, and those few can do no good, he <hi>plucks up the ledges, and lays open the vineyard;</hi> and if it be a thing so pernicious for a vineyard to be

                  <hi>This may serve to humble and abase us for all our barrenness.

               <p n="1">1. Whence it is that this disposition comes to be so active in Godly Ministers?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherein it appears acceptable to God, and advantageous unto Barren Souls?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whence is it that this disposition comes to be so active in Godly Ministers?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We may come at this in a few steps;</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is Planted in Man by Nature a
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:000581_0210_0FA714C6F6E6B7D0"/>
Love to Mankind. Meerly sensible creatures have such an instinct of Nature in them, that they stand affected to their own kind. Ravening Wolves, and Cruel Tygers do participate in this: And this had a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar impression upon reasonable creatures, whose understanding hath a capacity of reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it self into, and stirring up of these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And although it be one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fruits of mans Apostacy, that it hath wofully depraved this principle, and made men <hi>without natural affection</hi> having at least destroyed the gracious impression which was upon this principle, yet there is the root of such an inclination abiding in the hearts of men, and a disposition in them to exert it in a natural, though not in a gracious way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Grace of <hi>G</hi>od, where it comes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores this principle again to its regular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. It is the work of Sanctifying grace to restore the lapsed nature of man to a capacity of acting according to the Image of <hi>G</hi>od which once it had upon it. It Sanctifies the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by discovering to it what is the love which we ow one to another, and wherein it ought more peculiarly to exert it self, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the state and condition of the object of it, and shews them that their souls are more deeply concerned in this than their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that their eternal well-being is more to be sought than their temporal solicity. And
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:000581_0211_0FA714C7A6AEEC70"/>
it Sanctifies the Will by enabling it to elect accordingly: and this influenceth the Affections making them to desire, long after, and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citously pursue this designe: it turns that love which before was carnal into an holy love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This love makes them exceeding loth that any should perish; and consequently grieved at the apprehension of the danger of it. It is an Affection full of compassion; and therefore misery and danger of the Object greatly moves it. How much of this was exemplarily found in the man <hi>Christ,</hi> who <hi>wept over Jerusalem?</hi> Luk. 19. 41. and made that bitter moan over it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. and this made <hi>Paul</hi> to speak with tears in his eyes to his <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 3. 18, 19. <hi>G</hi>odly Men cannot but be deeply concerned to see Sinners running to ruine, and ready to drop into destruction; to think that such as are capable of glory, should fall into endless mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; to see the hand of God up, and ready to strike that blow which will cut them off for ever from all hope; fills their souls with deepest commiseration of them, and makes them wish it might be prevented.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This lothness and grief of theirs puts them upon studying and endeavouring all they may to prevent it. For that is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature and use of this affection; and it is very prevalent in the souls of Gods people.
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:000581_0212_0FA714C92A3F3750"/>
Such an one will now entertain himself with these thoughts: Is there nothing that I may do to save this soul? may I be no ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental of good to him, that so he may not go down to the pit? are there no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that may be used with or for him, that may, by the blessing of God, prove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to him? he is willing and desirous to do his utmost, and omit nothing that comes within his reach, that may be serviceable to this purpose. This made <hi>Paul</hi> to be so la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, <hi>if by any means he might save men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This makes them to go to God and plead with him, that he would spare them a little longer. They are not without hope that if they might have a little more time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, they might at length be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>to mind the things of their peace?</hi> to be sure they know, that if they are once cut down by the hand of Gods vengeance, there will then be no more opportunity for them for ever, that all hopes are then gone, that then the day of grace is done: but whilst there is life and means, there is hope: and this makes them to pray hard for them, and follow the Throne of Grace in their behalf: and the more their danger is, the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity it urgeth them unto: This made <hi>Samuel</hi> so restlesly importunate for <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Gods faithful Ministers are usually more deeply sensible of the miserable condition
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:000581_0213_0FA714CA22155780"/>
that such are in, than others are. Every true believer hath more or less of this sense? it flows from the Grace that is in them: but those <hi>G</hi>racious souls whose peculiar business lies in the contemplation of the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;</hi> acquainting of themselves, that so they may acquaint others with the great and awful truths therein contained, must needs have some special impressions of these things made upon their hearts, and this must needs work answerably on their affections. That was it which so engaged <hi>Paul</hi> he <hi>knew the terrors of the Lord,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. Yea, and God often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gives them more experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of themselves and that adds unto the Affection matter of incitement.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The special relation which these bear to such, makes them peculiarly sollicitious for them. They are not only related to them as their fellow reasonable Creatures, but also as God hath Commissionated them to bring the Gospel of peace unto them, and labour with them for their saving good: they are therefore tende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

And who is so much grieved at the childrens disafter as the mother, and therefore none will beg harder for them then shew.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:000581_0214_0FA714CAACD7EF48"/>
8. They must needs be exceeding loth that all the labour which they have laid out upon these should thus be lost. Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>that have obtained the grace to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> have been spending themselves in solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous endeavours after the salvation of all those that are under their watch; they have laboured with God and with them; and the joy they have looked for, hath been to see them saved: In hope of this they have been chearful under all; and must they perish at last, and so all be thrown away? this, in this life, is exceeding bitter to them; <hi>Paul</hi> speaks it with grief, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 11. and such a thought puts a peculiar impression upon this affection, and raiseth them to the more earnestness in their pleadings with <hi>G</hi>od.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And they truly design the glory of God in all this. All believers are set for <hi>G</hi>od's glory; his Ministers are specially advantaged for the promoving of it: now it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods grace which they are nextly and directly to aim at the furtherance of; for they are a Gospel Ministry; and that is then most gloriously advanced, when men are made the monuments of this Attribute. When therefore they see such to whom this grace hath been offered, now ready to be made a Sacrifice unto Justice for their contempt of it, they, not being hopeless but that Grace may still be advanced by them, put in for a
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:000581_0215_0FA714CB685C9C70"/>
little respite to be afforded them: and tho' love to man excite pity in them, yet love to <hi>G</hi>od, and the honour of his Name regulates them, as will be afterwards made evident.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherein it appears acceptable to God, and advantageous to barren souls, that these are thus earnest with <hi>G</hi>od for them?</p>
               <p>A. <hi>This will be evident by the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these things;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath by his Holy Spirit put such desires into his Servants. They are the product of his Grace in them; and therefore we shall find that such as have been most eminent for Holiness, and most acquainted with <hi>G</hi>od, have been most fervently engaged thus: <hi>Abraham</hi> Gods <hi>friend, Moses,</hi> who was in the <hi>Mount</hi> with God, <hi>Paul,</hi> that had been in the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> and seen glorious things there: and that which is the fruit of Gods grace in us must needs be acceptable to him; whether be intends to do the thing or no, yet it pleaseth him that his Servants should request it of him; for that may be our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ask, which it is not Gods Soveraign Pleasure to grant; for the command, which is revealed, and not the decree, which is secret, is the rule in prayer. The Prophets therefore interposed most earnestly when God threatned most sharply.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath therefore in the Scripture made i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their duty thus to put in and plead, when they
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:000581_0216_0FA714CD10223FC0"/>
see his Judgments coming upon his people. When they apprehend that</hi> G<hi>od is angry, and discover him as if he were coming to cut Sinners down in his wrath, now God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>uld have these step in: for this reason; when God had threatned a terrible Calamity upon his people</hi> Israel, <hi>we find this to be urged as a precept at such a time,</hi> Joel. 2. 17. <hi>and</hi> Moses <hi>by Gods Appointment, sends</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron <hi>with his</hi> Censer, <hi>when the</hi> plague is begun. <hi>These are some of those that are appointed to</hi> stand in the gap, <hi>and if when God comes in Displeasure, and finds them not there, it fares ill with his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>God hath oftentimes a purpose to delay the execution of the sentence; and he honours these his Servants to be the instruments in it. God sometimes intends to give peculiar instances of his long-sufferance; and therefore when Sinners may be thought ripe for ruine, ready for cutting down, and the sentence is past in the threatning; he will yet give them a farther trial; now when it is so, he is wont to stir up the hearts of his servants to put in, and beg with greatest and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable importunity for it, whereupon he grants it to their requests; and it is for their sakes that he doth it. Thus we find, that</hi> G<hi>od had certainly destroyed Israel, but that</hi> Moses <hi>interposed, and stood between him and them, and</hi> turned his wrath away, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 23. <hi>and this shews his approbation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence it follows, that they do many
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:000581_0217_0FA714CE19E21558"/>
times prevail with God. Though sometimes it is come to that, that though <hi>Noah, Job, Daniel</hi> should pray for them, <hi>they should only deliver their own souls;</hi> yet it is not always so; if it be possible, such prayers shall prevail, and <hi>G</hi>od not seldom doth thus answer them. There is many a Sinners life is saved by the earnest importunity of Gods Servants with him, they had died else: God gives their lives to these prayers, to testifie what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest they have in him, and convince sinners themselves o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> their gracious acceptance with him. The very scope of this part of the Parable, is to let us know, that God spares many after they have provoked him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce some severe threatnings against them, and to tell us how it comes about that he so doth: it is not for any worthiness or merit of theirs, but because they have a deep share in his favour, and he will thus signalize it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By this means the Judgment that was ready to cut them down, is deferred. When the Ax of Divine Vengeance was lifted up, and just falling down upon them to give them a deadly blow, these hold Gods hands, and keep them from doing execution: and now the Sinner is suffered to live a while longer; the mischief which he was falling into is diverted from him; and this is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; every day and hour in which the condemned Creature is saved out of the <hi>p</hi>it,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:000581_0218_0FA714CE77AE9BB0"/>
is a rich favour to him, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>It is the Lords mercy that we are not consumed;</hi> and the rather because,</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thus they have a farther opportunity given them to seek an escape from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, if they have but an heart to make use of it. How many wretched sinners have great reason to say; if I had died at such a time, when I was just at brink of the pit, and had a Sentence of Death upon me in my own apprehension, I had then certainly perished; I had gone to everlasting burnings; but God hath spared me, and given me a longer day of grace. Till the tree is cut down, all hopes concerning it are not utterly lost; but when it is destroyed, and the root is dead, then all hope is gone: and needs must it be a very great priviledge for a sinner to have farther day given him, and <hi>a price</hi> continued in his <hi>Hand to get Wisdom;</hi> if he <hi>Wants an Heart</hi> to it, it is his own wickedness; that he hath the opportunity, is <hi>G</hi>ods indulgence.</p>

               <p>Learn hence how much Sinners are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to Gods faithful Ministers. As little as they love them, yea as much as they despise and possibly hate them, yet they little know how much they do for them: many a time
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:000581_0219_0FA714D028429848"/>
when Judgment was ready to have broken in, and <hi>G</hi>ods anger was kindled, and began to burn, these have stept in, and given a stop to it. It is true, they dealt plainly and openly with such as live and lie in sin, and despise the offers of grace made in the Gospel; and this is their faithfulness: they have discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Gods anger, and cannot but <hi>cry aloud,</hi> and call earnestly unto men; they cannot let them alone; they speak home, and this many times vexeth sinners; they love not to be disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this makes such to cry out of them, as if they were the only <hi>Troublers of Israel.</hi> Yea they are often put upon it to denounce the threatnings of the Word of God against men that will not repent; and foolish crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ready to say, we see what they would be at, they desire and long for our mischief: but little do they think the mean while, what deep resentments they entertain upon their hearts of these things; how the danger they are in affects them. As they cannot let sinners alone, so neither can they let God alone: they are as earnest in their supplications to him for them, as they are in their warnings of them: did you know what pleadings, what entreaties, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, they are using in their behalf; how loth they are that you should perish, how earnest they are with God that he should save you, that he would turn you, and have

               <p n="1">1. Believe that they, know what is your concern. That they see your danger, and understand how the case stands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and you; else they would not be so importunate with <hi>G</hi>od, if they did not see evil to be threatning of you; and if they discover the tokens of <hi>G</hi>ods indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is not to be slighted.

It is hard to perswade sinners who love their sin, to think that any can love their persons that set themselves against their corruptions: <hi>Ahab hates Micaiah, because he never speaks good of him;</hi> and therefore thinks that he hates him: ask yourselves; if they did not love you, would they be so foolish as to expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

to your anger, that they may do you good? did they not love you, would they set themselves so earnestly to implore God for you, and seek your preservation? They hate your sins indeed, because they know that they will undo you, if not forsaken: but they love your Souls, and therefore seek their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If they did not love you, they would not willingly stand between an angry God, and angry sinners.

They often ponder on that as spoken to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17, 18. <hi>Son of man, I have set thee a watchman to the House of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, &amp;c.</hi> and think with themselves, I must appear ere long before the dreadful Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the great Judge, and then Jesus Christ will ask of me, what is become of those souls whom I so solemnly enjoyned thee to look after? where are those <hi>Sheep</hi>

               <p n="4">4. This fear puts them upon the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be more intensly engaged in this, if God shall give them a farther opportunity.

               <p n="2">2. They also know that <hi>G</hi>od is wont to give a blessing to his Servants industry in the use of means. Though all success depends absolutely upon God, and we cannot by all our care and endeavours bring home one soul to Jesus Christ; yet because <hi>G</hi>od hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Gospel to be the instrument of Conversion and salvation; and hath required his Servants to use diligence and constancy in the dispensation of it unto men, he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wont to encourage their industry, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good success unto it; not but that he useth his Soveraignty here, but he frequently doth so: <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>laboured more than all the Apostles,</hi> won more Souls unto Christ than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them: Diligence must needs be nearest to success.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Hence they are not willing to despair but hope still concerning them. Despair of doing good, is that which e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. This therefore makes them beg time for farther trial. They do it not with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to aggravate the sinners guilt, though it unhappily proves so too often in the event; they would not make any mans miseries more and greater, if they could help it, but all they do in this regard, is in hope that it may be their Salvation; it is because they are not willing that these should perish: and because all their hope is in a farther probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which only will allow unto them the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of using means for their good, or unto sinners the opportunity for repentance: They do therefore seek unto God that he would grant this their request, and for that reason the vinedresser asks but one year more because it is meerly for probation that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Upon what account this argument and plea of theirs prevails with <hi>G</hi>od to let sinners alone a little longer?</p>
               <p>A. We are not to suppose that mens plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, can alter Divine Purposes. Or make God to take up other resolutions concerning any than he hath from eternity determined in himself. But this is to be well remarked that God puts this into the hearts of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:000581_0236_0FA714E478674138"/>
and he puts these arguments into their mouths, and suffers these pleadings to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to answer their requests; and he hath holy designs in all this. Now the reasons why God is willing to forbear, that he may so give his servants farther opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to take pains with sinners, after they have continued barren under so many means, and so much patience as hath been already af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them, are such as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He doth it to give his Ministers the opportunity to discharge their Consciences, towards such Sinners: that so, <hi>whether these will hear or forbear</hi> they may <hi>save their own souls;</hi> and may have peace in themselves, in that they have done their duty to the utmost of their power. By this means their <hi>savour</hi> comes to be more <hi>sweet unto God,</hi> whether these be <hi>saved</hi> or <hi>perish.</hi> It is true, Gods Ministers need pardon of all their defects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day; and if <hi>God should be strict,</hi> they could <hi>not stand:</hi> But as it cannot but be their great grief to think, these and those sinners are gone, and we have not discharged our duty to them: so, on the other hand, it will afford them great inward peace, though they cannot infallibly determine, what effect it hath wrought on them for their eternal good, yet that they have been faithful, and done their utmost as instruments in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. We see how chearfully <hi>Paul</hi> can take
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:000581_0237_0FA714E5C195BF18"/>
his last leave of his <hi>Ephesians</hi> on this account; when he can say, <hi>Act.</hi> 20 26, 27. <hi>I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God;</hi> and God would have the souls of his faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants comforted in their work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God sometimes intends that some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall be new-born out of time. There are some of Gods Elect, that are by his holy pleasure suffered to stand for a long while in his vineyard, and to grow worse and worse under and by all the pains and cost that have been expended upon them: yea to run up to such an height of wickedness, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to break in upon them with his Judgments, and to threaten them with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and when he hath laid them up in the irons of affliction, he then <hi>bores their ears to instruction;</hi> and so he brings them in at the last to be made the eternal monuments of his glorious <hi>G</hi>race, and to shew his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, by making them astonishing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his praise.

               <p n="1">1. That God knows who are appointed to obtain grace and salvation. We are not therefore to charge this uncertainty upon him, though men be at a loss, yet he is at

               <p n="2">2. That the means of grace are nextly and directly appointed for the benefit of these. It was for the Redemption and Salvation of Sinners, that Jesus Christ came into the World; but for which he had never engaged in the work which he undertook: and to that end that his redeemed may be brought to participate in the good which he hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for them, the Gospel is promulgated, and the offers and invitations to accept of peace are made to sinners: and this is the reason why the Gospel is sent to this place, and not to that, because God hath some of his chosen ones here, whom he <hi>hath loved with an everlasting love,</hi> and whom he designs
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:000581_0249_0FA714F1E5110768"/>
to <hi>call</hi> by these means, into the grace where by they may be saved: nor can it be said that ever the <hi>G</hi>ospel was sent unto such a place, where there were none of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber dwelling; though possibly there have bin more of them in some places than in others: it is therefore called <hi>the Gospel of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence all these wheresoever they are, shall sooner or later be brought in by the means of Grace. There is no uncertainty in the thing it self as to the futurition of it; that shall be a truth in the winding up, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 43, <hi>As many as were ordained to Eternal Life, believed;</hi> these may possibly lie a great while in their sins, and abide barren under manifold essays used with them, there may be a great deal of time and cost for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent lost upon them; they may out-stand the three years of Patience, and fall into the one year of probation, before they bear an, fruit; but it is certain they shall turn to God before they dy, they shall not be cut down for their barrenness; they shall be born to <hi>G</hi>od, though it be out of time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the Gospel means are sent to more than are chosen. Our Saviour more than once useth that assertion, <hi>many are called, but few are chosen,</hi> by which he doth not intend effectual vocation, for that belongs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For men to take any discouragement in a known duty, is to hearken to Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to provoke God to anger against them. Though success be a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in duty, yet that which firstly ought to engage the conscience of one that fears <hi>G</hi>od, is that it is his will. Duty is our part, success is his, we may desire it, and ought to pray for it; but when we have

As we do not know that we shall prevail with them, when we have done all; but that they may continue in their impenitency; so on the other hand, we do not know but that we may be instrumental of doing them good, that which carnal reason takes discouragement from, that grace encourageth it self by. I am sure it is an argument which the spirit of God makes use of to animate us to this constancy,</hi> Eccl. 11. 6. <hi>If we did certainly know that such an one would grow worse by all, and at last perish after he had used utmost endeavours with him for his salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this would make us to despair, and that would quite dishearten us from doing our duty; but as long as we know not what the event shall be, we now fetch our encouragement to obey Gods Precept from the precept it self under which we are, and so commit it to the Providence of</hi> G<hi>od with humble submission: as becomes us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a great deal of Hope notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this uncertainty. Hope is the spring of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; it is that which thrusts men forward into all their business. Thus it is done in the world, and in the management of all the affairs of this life, men go upon it.</hi> The Husbandman sows in hope; <hi>the Merchant adventures his Estate to manifold perils in hope; there is no assurance in these things; all that they can say, is,</hi> if God

wills it shall prosper; <hi>and they withal observe that this is the way in which the Providence of</hi> G<hi>od is to be served, and unto which he is wont ordinarily to give his blessing. Now there is as good hope here:</hi> G<hi>od is pleased to convert sinners by the use of means; it is the way that he hath appointed for it, it is not therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but that he may give his blessing to our endeavours, and make them to succed; nay, it is very probable, that if he makes us diligent and earnest, he doth intend to give us the desired suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: the</hi> W<hi>ord of</hi> G<hi>od gives us as much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to this, as to any thing else, and more too.</hi>

               <p>This may serve to caution us against carnal confidence on the one hand, and despair on the other.

               <p n="1">1. Beware of carnbal confidence. Let us not make too large and positive promises to ourselves with respect of our labour: let us not say and conclude, that because we find our hearts to be mightily carried out for the good of them whom we have to do withal, so as to make us unweariedly industrious with them, and to use all manner of endeavours that we are capable of; that therefore they must needs be converted, as if by our own grace or industry we were able to do it in and for them; or as if by our care we had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God to a necessity of doing it for us, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our laying ourselves out; this is a carnal conclusion, and it flows from ignorance, and pride, and presumption, and it thereupon offers unto God no little provocation, to withdraw his blessing, and so to disappoint our expectation lest otherwise we should be lifted up with self-applause, and <hi>burn inodnse to our own not,</hi> and so rob him of the honour of his work.</p>

though we have tried all the ways that we can think of with them, and all seems to do them no good, but rather hurt; yet let not this make us to cast off our endeavours, to despond and to say it is in vain for us to do any thing more, but let us say as <hi>Peter</hi> did to Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>we have toiled all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But if we have no certainty here, then it calls upon us to do these two things in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p n="2">2. To commend our labours unto God, and that, not only by a submitting of them to his Providence, without taking of his work out of his hands, which is one part of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but also by earnest prayer to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that all our endeavours without him will do nothing; call upon him, and beg hard of him, that he will <hi>confirm our work,</hi> and make <hi>our way prosperous.</hi> If we are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and all depends upon him; it saith that we should pray over all that we do: pray before, that God would direct and assist us; pray after, that <hi>G</hi>od would bless this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:000581_0265_0FA71506DB124470"/>
that counsel, the other reproof for their good: we may else <hi>spend and be spent,</hi> and all we can do, turn to no account; but if we can prevail with God in their behalf, and he be pleased to send forth his spirit, and give a blessing to our endeavours, then shall they be fruitful, and we shall quickly see them, of unprofitable to become profitable.</p>

            <p>IT follows that we consider the <hi>Hypotheses</hi> severally, together with the inferences which the Vine-dresser draws from them. The first thing that he supposeth is, That this fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, after he hath digged about it and dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, may possibly bear, though it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore barren; and truly, if he had not had some hope of this, he would not have askt liberty to make any farther trial upon it: The inference which he draws from hence is not exprest in the Text, but intended: It is and <hi>Ellyptick</hi> kind of expression, and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture Dialect; in which there is something left to be supplied: what that is here, is to be gathered from that which is concluded upon the latter <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary suppositions, infer contrary conclusions. Our Translation suitably supplies it with the word, <hi>[well] q. d.</hi> all shall be well; there will then be no occasion to cut it down,
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:000581_0267_0FA7150897B872E0"/>
but it will be profitable for it to stand; it will be both honourable and serviceable in the Vineyard; it will not repent thee of this for bearance; nor shall I be sorry for the pains that I shall have taken with it; and it shall be well with that too; the reproach of its barrenness shall cease, and it shall be out of the danger of the threatning.</p>

               <p>There are three respects in which the Truth of the Doctrine doth discover it self;
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:000581_0268_0FA715092A4D25B8"/>
the proposing and clearing of which will suffice for the Explication and Confirmation of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It shall be well with the sinner himself, Though he hath done so much to undo himself, and hath brought himself so near to the brink of Eternal Ruine, and had almost sinned himself beyond hope, yet this shall turn the scale, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit him again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are three things in which this may be discovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His former barrenness shall not be charged upon him. All the guilt of it shall be removed: it was a great height that he was arrived unto; he had been all this while heaping up provocation, and filling a terrible account: but upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to</hi> G<hi>od, all these scores are c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ost, and his person is justified; his</hi> sins are blotted out as a cloud, <hi>an act of oblivion it past, and his iniquities</hi> shall be remembred no more <hi>against him, Ezek.</hi> 18 21, 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>G</hi>od will repent him of the evil which he had threatned him withal. It is true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance cannot properly be in God, because it argues something rash, imprudent, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate in him that acts it, of which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wise God is incapable: but it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him on the account of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. God sometimes threatens sinners, and in those threatnings, there is a reserve, in case of their repentance: and then, when
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:000581_0269_0FA71509CD3F5B80"/>
the sinner repents, God is said to repent, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> when he revokes the threatning, and doth not put it in execution, hence that <hi>Jer</hi> 18. 8. the meaning of such language is, the sinner is now out of the danger of those judgments; he shall not dy, hence that advice <hi>Zeph,</hi> 2. <hi>begin.</hi> which intends not the eternal purpose of God, but the threatning of the law which was denounced against them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence his estate is now safe. He is put into a state of life and salvation; <hi>he is past from death to life; G</hi>od is atoned to him, and loves him, and accepts of him: he shall abide in the vineyard as long as God sees meet to use him for his service there, and then he shall be transplanted into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory: he is numbred among the Children and entituled to the inheritance, he may now say as the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>I will praise thee for thou wast angry with me, but thine anger is turned away.</hi> Now the evidence of this comfortable truth will appear in these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The design of the whole day of grace, is to give sinners an opportunity to repent that they may be saved. That is it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that makes it a day of grace, because in it men have not only a space, but with it a call to return to God that they may live: it is to invite them to, and afford them the means for it, as long therefore as this day
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:000581_0270_0FA7150A91CE9418"/>
lasts, God signifies hereby that he is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to sinners, that he <hi>delights not in their death, but had rather that they should turn and live:</hi> for which reason he calls upon them so to do: it is the <hi>day of their visitation,</hi> in which he holds our before them, <hi>the things of their peace,</hi> and therefore gives them offers that if they do accept of them, they shall have peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence the lengthening out of this day is on purpose to continue this opportunity to them: when sinners under the</hi> G<hi>ospel, though they neglect it, and hearken not to the voice of</hi> G<hi>od in it, are yet spared, and the wrath of</hi> G<hi>od doth not fall upon them in its weight, it is to afford them a farther trial; it is to see if it will at last repent them of their sins, and they will be perswaded to return unto God with all their hearts. Thus</hi> G<hi>od interprets his patience exercised towards</hi> Jezebel <hi>her self, and chargeth it upon her as an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her guilt, that she did not so improve it,</hi> Rev. 2 22. <hi>when the sinner is cut off there is no more room for this, but whilst he is spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there is a</hi> price <hi>continued</hi> in his hands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence all the Evangelical Calls that are Ministerially given to the sinner, carry the encouraging promise in them. God stirs up the hearts of his Servants to offer mercy to sinners that have been careless, to invite and excite them to Repentance, and they are to make conditional promises to them, that if
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:000581_0271_0FA7150C47D73B90"/>
they do still repent and return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is willing to receive them into his favour. They do not publish these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>earms of their own heads, but they do it by Commission; they are <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,</hi> and they have it in their <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ctions</hi> thus to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 12, 13. and the Word of God hath a great many of these, which look this way, and have not other limitations but to the present call, let it be when it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o remove all doubts out of the minds of such as are ready to be discouraged.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The sinner is now brought under the promises which a faithful God cannot sail of performing. The Gospel promises are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded unto men upon condition, if that be fulfilled in and by the man. <hi>G</hi>od is under the obligation, his word is past for it; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and peace, and glory are now the mans by Covenant: and whensoever any are made fruitful Christians, when they bring forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God according to his will, the condition is fulfilled in them; they are the men of and to whom <hi>G</hi>od hath said that he will do them good. There must be faith and holiness put into the man, before he can bear spiritual fruits, and to them the blessing is assured; and <hi>G</hi>od is as good as his word; it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for him to ly: such a soul therefore must needs be in a safe state, if all the blessings
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:000581_0272_0FA7150CF70DEAF8"/>
that are laid up in the promise, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Blood of Christ can make him so.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nay this fruitfulness is a declaration of Gos everlasting love to him. It is an evidence that <hi>G</hi>od hath chosen him in Christ before the foundation of the world.

               <p n="2">2. It shall be well also in respect of Gods glory. It shall be no grief to him, he shall never repent that he did spare the sinner, and
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:000581_0273_0FA7150DD20F36F8"/>
give him a farther time of trial, but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly satisfied in it; we read <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>There is joy in heaven: &amp;c.</hi> and there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God should take content in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will bring him honour; the thing will be to him <hi>for a name, and a praise;</hi> this will appear if we consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which God peculiarly designs by the Gospel, is the glory of his Grace. It is true, his justice is also greatly illustrated by it, in as much as sinners under it do aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their guilt, and bring the more fearful Judgments upon themselves: But the <hi>G</hi>ospel is properly a discovery of Christ in his great work of Redemption, and all this is <hi>for the riches of the glory of his grace, Eph.</hi> 1. 6. and where his grace is exalted, there God is greatly glorified, for he shall be <hi>praised in all his Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts,</hi> and his other perfections are magnified in and with this: his Justice in that way wherein he revealed his grace by Christ, and upon his satisfaction; his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in that he gets him an everlasting name and renown in this way, his power in that he is able to bring about this great salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his Wisdom in the contrivance of the way to accomplish it; hence therefore the whole treaty of the Gospel, that is held with Sinners, carries in it a demonstration of this Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a more special and eminent
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:000581_0274_0FA7150E342E69E8"/>
degree of glory that redounds to God by this. When a sinner who hath so obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withstood all endeavours that have been used with him; hath been for so many years growing harder and harder, and by all this laying in so much provocation, through the multiplied affronts that he hath offered to God, shall at last be brought over to him, and become <hi>a plant of renown</hi> in his vineyard; here are more illustrious discoveries of his grace in this one: he is a most admirable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of mercy. As the mighty power of God is manifested, in the turning of an heart that hath been so long <hi>glewed to his Idols,</hi> so his unchangeable love is here commended: If any thing could have made him to alter his design, so much, and so long continued provocation would have done it; <hi>Paul</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speaking of himself, who was brought in after he had so long set himself against Christ, speaks of it with admiration, I <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence all the dishonour that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done unto <hi>G</hi>od, giveth lustre unto this grace. Grace is properly a free favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon another, which he had not merit of, nor could have challenged to himself of him that bestowed it, had he not done it of his own bounty, it had never been conferred; and there are two special enhaunements of it, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> the greatness of the favour bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:000581_0275_0FA7150EE90C5CA0"/>
and the great unworthiness of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that participates in it: The more there may be said way he should not, the more there must needs appear of the condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of him that doth it. Now as it is sin that most of all speaks the unworthiness of men, so the more aggravations there are in it, the farther doth it set the man off from this, and renders him the more unworthy; and there can be nothing that more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates sin, than that a man should, under all the offers of mercy, and means of repentance, go on in a course of sin, notwithstanding all the strivings of the Spirit of <hi>G</hi>od with him: this therefore is grace indeed: when <hi>Paul</hi> would evalt it, he tells us what he was before it came, I <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>A Blasphemer, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuter, and injurious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And the sinner is now made, not only a monument, but also an instrument of Gods <hi>G</hi>lory. As he before dishonoured him, so now he serves him; he bears fruit, and it is for God, and <hi>he is glorified by it, John</hi> 15. 8. and usually it comes to pass, that though he is born so much out of time, and so hath but a short opportunity allowed him wherein to glorify God in this life, as having spent the greatest part of his time in vanity; yet he is more deeply engaged than ordinary in <hi>G</hi>ods Service, and more strenuously endeavours to make up his lost way, and redeem the little
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:000581_0276_0FA7150FAC02B170"/>
spot of time that is allowed him, being quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kned thereunto by the thought of his former unprofitableness. What ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The desires of their hearts are thus accomplished, and so their <hi>Joy is fulfilled.</hi> The great thing which they longed for, and which carried them forth in all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, for which they chearfully attended all the duty lying on them, was the conversion of sinners; this was it that they waited to see, and cast many an earnest look for the discovery of it: and therefore when they do come to fee it, they cannot but rejoyce, as a mother doth in a child, or a Conqueror that takes great Spoils, it makes them to forget all the labour and toil which they have bin at, and their hearts are comforted in it: all the grief which they were sinking under be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for fear of the issue, is now turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to joy, to see them brought home to Christ; <hi>their mourning over</hi> those perishing Souls <hi>is turned into a dance.</hi> They are glad on Gods account, that he shall have honour now by such an one, who before did nothing but dishonour him; they rejoyce on the Sinners account, that he shall now obtain salvation, and be happy for ever in the favour of God; and they rejoyce on their own account, to think what comfort they shall have in these in the day of Christ.</p>

               <p>For Caution. Let none from hence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to delay their returning unto God. There is an evil spirit in men naturally, that leads them to abuse the most precious Truths of the Word of God, and to turn the richest cordials into the most deadly poyson. It may be there are some who hearing this Truth, do thereupon say in their hearts, if it be so, we will then allow our selves a while longer in our sinful courses, we will take a little more pleasure in the <hi>ways of our hearts,</hi> there is no such danger: if at last we bear fruit, we shall do well enough. If there be any that do nourish such an evil <hi>root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness</hi> in them. I warn you in the name of God to beware to your selves, left it prove your utter destruction. I am sure such infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences lead to desperate conclusions; and if men once come to settle upon them, their condition is next to hopeless; let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore urge these two considerations upon such.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though if you do bear fruit there is no danger of your final miscarrying, yet there is great danger whether you shall bear or no; if you were as sure of true Repentance at last, as you may be that <hi>G</hi>od will certainly accept of you, if you do indeed turn to him,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:000581_0279_0FA71515E900DB50"/>
the hazzard would be taken off: but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil cheats you, by perswading you to draw unwarrantable conclusions from uncertain premises: be then advised to ballance this consideration with these two on the other hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The God only can work this change in you. If it were in your power there were the more to be pleaded: If the sinner could turn himself when he pleased, he might be the more bold, but converting grace is the <hi>gift of God,</hi> if he doth not work it in you, you can never do it for your selves: you can as easily create a world, as put grace into your own hearts, whereby you may live to Gods glory. Now <hi>G</hi>od offers this grace to you, ne now pleads with you about it, he saith, <hi>to day, if you will hear his voice;</hi> but he hath given you no assurances that he will take your time, or wait your leisure to do this work in and for you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Gods day of grace is limited. It is true, he hath not told us how long he will lengthen it out to this or that sinner; but in general we are assured that it hath its fixed bounds beyond which it shall not pass, and that it is to some longer, to others shorter, as it pleaseth him: he hath said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>My Spirit shall not always strive;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath given that advice to men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found; call
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:000581_0280_0FA715176EDB3958"/>
upon him while he is near;</hi> and this is a solemn consideration; which every unprofitable soul under the Ordinances ought often to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his thoughts withal: and particularly in the end of every Sabbath; here is one day more of my season past and gone, I am one Sabbath nearer to the end of my day of grace, which if once it comes to be past, and <hi>G</hi>ods time be over, I am then beyond all hopes of recovery, and there will be no more possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ever of my returning to <hi>G</hi>od: and now say, what comfort can you gather from your presumed supposition, when the Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption must be, but I am not like to return for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If ever this work do truly pass upon you, it will then bitterly repent you of your delays; however you indulge a carnal mind, and corrupt heart with such presumptions for the present; if once the grace of God comes to be put into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you, and you be indeed made fruitful, this will embitter the reflection to your thoughts: Then will you wish that you had come in to God before, complain of your selves, lament all the lost time that cannot be recovered, cry out of your selves for fools and madmen that had such <hi>a price in your hands,</hi> and had so wofully neglected it: then will you see that all your former time was lost time, and say, Oh that I had been wise; how much might I have done for <hi>G</hi>od? what

               <p>Let this serve to encourage such as have long lived barren in Gods vineyard. It is no new device or stratagem of Satan, that great enemy of Souls, when he can no longer nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish security in mens hearts, and thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate them in their delaying to entertain the calls of the Gospel; but they begin to have touches upon their hearts and their consciences reflect on them conviction of their sin and danger, and rouse them up to return and fleck after God in earnest, now to lay matter of discouragement before them, and drive them off from repentance, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading them that there is now no hope for them, it is too late, they have sinned beyond a pardon, such sinners as they have nothing now to expect but ruine, there is no mercy to be expected from <hi>G</hi>od by them: and
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:000581_0282_0FA71518AF39533"/>
thus from presumption he would precipitate them into desperation. This doctrine in hand, will speak a word of hope to any such, and help their sinking Souls with some thing to catch hold upon to support them, and to answer all their doubts and fears, which Satan and a misgiving heart are ready to oppress them withal; and there are these considerations which will stop the mouth of them all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if God were not willing to accept of you returning to him, he would not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to call you. You say, I am afraid that if I should seek unto God he will not accept of me; but every new call that is offered to you is a contradiction, to such a suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: What Gods servants speak to you in his name, and according to his word, that he saith, now they say to you in his name, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all you will hearken to his invitation, and yield yourselves up to him <hi>you shall live, and not dye.</hi> And they have his warrant so to say; they recieved a command to make such a Proclamation unto you. God doth not dissemble with you if he saith <hi>return and</hi> they that do so shall live: if he incites you to come and you do come <hi>he will in no wise cast you out.</hi> He is in earnest; <hi>be never said to the house of Jacob, seek me in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That if your hearts do eneline to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his call, it is his spirit that hath done
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:000581_0283_0FA715196BDF6648"/>
this in and for you. It therefore is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that his day is not done; for as long as <hi>G</hi>od strives with sinners, their day is not over. Your natural inclination was to have withstood all calls and counsels for ever: it is a great work that is wrought by God in the Soul, when it is turned so as to be willing that he should do the work for it, and to desire that he would do it. If your barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be your burden, and you are made to groan under it, and long to be delivered from it, it takes off all reason of doubting whether God be willing or no: for it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally saith in you, that he doth desire it, and gives you reason to believe that he is doing it for you, how else came you by this?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is merit enough in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Christ to answer for all your sins and provocations. Though you have heightned them by your contumacy and long resistance of God; yet Justice is fully atoned, there is a compleat payment made to it by the blood of Christ, and therefore read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31. yea and by the accepting and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of such an one as you are, there will be abundant evidence of the great extent of the vertue of these merits of his: it will appear to the glory of Christ, how wonderous a Saviour he is, what a treasure there is laid up in his satisfaction; and therein will God also be glorified.</p>

                  <pb n="279" facs="unknown:000581_0284_0FA7151A43656E38"/>
4. That God, Angels, and good men, will greatly rejoyce at this: How glad was the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> that his son was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned</hi> after his profuseness? W<hi>hat joy is there in Heaven at the conversion of a lost Sinner?</hi> and how much are the hearts of Gods People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, when they see one that hath been a long time dishonouring of God, by bringing forth the <hi>works of darkness,</hi> now to honour him, by bearing the fruits of Repentance? and the way for you to farther this joy is to make haste, and use no more delays; now to come over to Christ, and seek his grace. There are none that will be grieved at it; but Devils and Ungodly Men, and the more they are enraged the better. Be not then discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, <hi>though you have done all this wickedness,</hi> yet at the last give your selves up in an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, to God, and bring forth the holy fruits of true Obedience unto him; and so shall your Repentance be unrepentable.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Though if they bear fruit at the last, they shall be spared, yet if finally they will not be brought unto it, but remain in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural barrenness, they must perish in the end: though God hath spared them once and again as being loth that they should dy, yet he will then spare them no more.</p>
               <p>There are three things intimated, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="282" facs="unknown:000581_0287_0FA7152030D83A08"/>
1. That <hi>G</hi>od will certainly bring destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon them in the end. There shall be no escaping for them: all the patience with which he hath waited upon them, and good will which he hath shewn unto them, loving and kind entreaties which he hath urged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, will not secure them from his wrath, or be any evidence to them that he will save and not destroy them: sinners are ready to say so; but God would have them to know and be assured of the contrary, <hi>Psal</hi> 50. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That their Church-priviledges will not save them. Many are ready to think that the</hi> Sanctuary <hi>shall shelter them, whatever they be, how obstinately soever they refuse to hearken to the voice of</hi> G<hi>od, yet the Temple shall save them; they are in the vineyard, and no evil can come at them; this was the carnal confidence of these Jews, which our Saviour Christ would put them from entertaining, and bring them to see that impenitence would break an hole in the wall, and open a way for wrath to come upon them, and all they could challenge could not secure them, and see</hi> Jer. 9. 25, 26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when it comes to this, they shall then have none to plead for them. That a sinner under the <hi>G</hi>ospel may sin himself our of all pity, and beyond the prayers of the Godly: they may go on so far in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, that even they who have been most
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:000581_0288_0FA71521283B6870"/>
sollicitous for them, and have many a time with tears begged of God, to spare and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear them, shall have done on this account, leave off praying for them, and stand in the gap between an angry God and them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and now the way to Gods wrath stands open, and there will be none to obstruct it; none to stay his hand or keep him back from vengeance; the hearts that before melted for them, shall now be hardned against them, and they shall readily comply with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Judgments of God that shall fall upon them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is a solemn Truth, and many sinners are hard of believing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having taken up strong perswasions about the mercy of God, as if it were inconsistent with that thus to do by them: But the Word of God is full of conviction on this account, enough to take off such vain opinions from mens minds if they will believe that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Doctrine may be cleared and confirmed in these conclusions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That God can be highly provoked with sinners in the visible Church. Indeed he is no where so incensed against any sinners as those that sin there: all that belong thither are not such as he hath set his heart upon: he hates sin wherever he sees it; his pure eyes cannot behold it without detestation, and it is most grievous to him where he hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the most of means to draw men from it,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:000581_0289_0FA71521ADB08880"/>
and where he expects holiness. The Church is a company of holy ones, by seperation for God, by profession, and by external denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; Holiness is that which God calls for, and they are devoted unto: if therefore they be otherwise, he must needs take it in ill part, and it must stir up his jualousy against them. The Scripture affords us many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Gods anger that hath been stirred against such as have been taken near unto him, and born the name of his people upon them, how often was God angry with Israel in the Wilderness, and in the land of Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? how many ways did he take to testify his displeasure against them? hence that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 15. W<hi>hat hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many,</hi> if men in covenant with God, will live in sin, he will not bear it, nay the very Covenant threatning is out against them? and that is a witness of his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That nothing is more provoking to God than for these to persist in wickedness; notwithstanding all means possible used to reclaim them. Although all sin be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him, yet obstinacy and unreclaimable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in it renders them that commit it most of all displeasing in his sight: and this is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated proportionally to the means that have been used with them; and that is accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:000581_0290_0FA7152269FFF7E8"/>
when these have been carried on after signal tokens of his anger and eminent deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances out of his hand, and renewed endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with fresh and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That there are fearful threatnings out against the finally impenitent. The truth is, all the terrible menaces of the Word of <hi>G</hi>od are most properly belonging to such as these. It is not this or that sin in it self, that holds the sinner bound under the curse; for, let it have been what it will, of what sort or degree soever, yet if men do truly repent of it, that will turn away the wrath of God, and take off the threatning from

                  </gap> the most fearful denunciations of wrath, they were still to add invitations to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and make encouraging promises of mercy in case they did prevail: but they were withal to assure them, that if they did not return those Judgments should take place upon them without avoidance; <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 19, 29. <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 10, 11. This is it which makes <hi>inquity to be their ruine.</hi> If they had <hi>hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the voice of God, believed his word,</hi> and obeyed his counsels, <hi>he would have turned his hand upon their enemies,</hi> and faved them; but because they would not so do, therefore did his wrath fall upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That God hath sixt a time how long he will wait for the sinners conversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he puts these threatnings of his in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. God is pleased first to threaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he strikes the blow: and because this is one of the courses which he useth with men to perswade them to return, he gives them time afterwards, and calls aloud to them to consider and amend: Now this is Gods long sufferance; and the duration of it depends upon his meer pleasure. But though we cannot tell how long it shall be, yet he knows for he hath appointed it in his holy purpose;
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:000581_0292_0FA715258C72FB30"/>
he tells how long the old world shall be wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. thus long he will tarry no longer: he hath set every sinner a day, and his call is limited unto it: it saith, <hi>to day, while it is called to day: i. e.</hi> whilst it is a day of grace and patience; and because it is a day, it therefore hath its bounds, and will have an end; it will not continue always: God can bear a great while, but he will not do so for ever: he can, as patient as he is, <hi>be weary with forbearing,</hi> and he will so be when that day is run out.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That if the sinner withstands Gods time, he will unavoidably bring these threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings upon his own head.

Holiness, is God bound for his own Glory, so as not to bear any thing that stands in the way of it; now as it is Gods glory to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the penitent, so it would be a wrong to it to spare the obstinate; he would lose the glory of his Truth in his threatnings, yea the glory of his having honour by the creature that will pay him none. Justice also stands in the way; for every sinner is

devoted to destruction by the Law-threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to which the Justice of God stands ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged; there is but one way to salve this Justice in the justifying of a sinner, and that is by the imputation of the Righteousness of Christ to him, which must be according to the condition of the New-Covenant, which the sinner by his obstinacy keeps himself from, and therefore hath no claim to the priviledges of it; and so he must needs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>

These desires are therefore limited, as to the way for the accomplishment of them, he would have the sinner to be saved, but he would not have him to be faved in his sins, for that would bring dishonour to God, but he would have him to be converted and changed, sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made fruitful, and so to be saved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is the only way in which God brings men to salvation, so as to be glorified in it: and for this end it is that he doth so much labour for his conversion, and pray so earnestly unto God,
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:000581_0295_0FA71529F2321130"/>
that he would change his heart: how often is</hi> Paul <hi>begging for grace in behalf of those whom he writes unto?</hi>

               <p n="1">1. This Doctrine certifies us that gracious souls will be satisfied in the Judgments which God will execute upon impenitent sinners: There will be so much of equity in Gods proceedings against them, so much inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness in them, who have had so great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and so many endeavours afforded unto them, that they will have nothing at all to object against it: and indeed though it cannot but grieve the souls of Gods children at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to see how wilfully unreclaimable sinners dy, yet they cannot but justifie God in his righteous Judgments upon them. The vine-dresser cannot but say, his Lord may well cut down such a fig-tree, as no means will make
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:000581_0297_0FA7152B6DA35D68"/>
to bear fruit. How much more then shall they for ever acquiesce in the final doom that shall be past in the great day, when their grace shall be perfect, and Gods Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall be openly declared? and it ought to be an awful consideration for sinners to think of, that if you now <hi>will dy,</hi> you shall have no pity then, but all the Redeemed of Christ will, in that day, <hi>Rejoyce in the Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>G</hi>od will be no loser by all the long-suffering which he extends unto men, though they are not made better by it. This is the force of this plea: It can be but cut down at last, and that will be a sufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of righteous revenge; and this tells us, that <hi>G</hi>od both can and will proportion the miseries of ungodly men, to the cost that hath been laid out upon, and despised by them; which may convince all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate sinners under the Gospel, upon what an awful account they stand, and are spared from time to time, if they shall at the last miss of eternal life.</p>
