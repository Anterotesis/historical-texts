            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>Jeſus anſwered, my Kingdom is not of this World.—</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is a principle, in which Chriſtians are generally agreed, "that the declarations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which we have in the New-Teſtament, are of divine authority;" tho' they are not ſo fully agreed that theſe are the only things, reſpecting chriſtianity, which are ſo.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome have added hereto many of their own traditions, together with many decrees of Popes and Councils, as infallible interpreters of the word and will of God, to which they aſcribe an equal degree of divinity.</p>
            <p>Proteſtants profeſs, indeed, to reject theſe, in the general, as groundleſs and unwarrantable additions to the chriſtian ſyſtem; yet Proteſtants are not wholly without diſſentions among themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016096_0005_0F9B759C8E800940"/>
Whether it be that ſome, who have rejected the groſſer corruptions of the Romiſh Church, are ſtill fond of retaining ſome of a ſmaller ſize, as leſs hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or more to their taſte; or that length of time, and the mutable nature of language, have led them to affix different ideas to the ſame things—from whatever cauſe it hath proceeded, ſo it is, that their conceptions of the Chriſtian Church, and particularly of the officers Chriſt hath appointed in it, and of the powers with which they are veſted, are, in ſome points, very different.</p>
            <p>But as the Goſpel continues the ſame—as the words of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there recorded, remain unchanged, however mutable men's opinions or practice may be, it muſt be a good rule, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what is of divine authority, and what is not, to recur to this original plan; and, by carefully examining things by it, to form and ſettle our own judgment.</p>
            <p>By thus tracing back, to its firſt principles, any ſyſtem of religion, which pretends to be founded on the Goſpel, or to have Chriſt for its author, we are moſt likely to diſtinguiſh what is true and genuine, from what is ſpurious or apocryphal—what is from heaven, and of divine authority, from what is of this world, or the inventions of men—to ſeparate one from the other, and to receive or reject accordingly.</p>
            <p>It is agreeable to this method that I ſhall attempt, from the paſſage of ſcripture now read, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of my diſcourſe, to conſider the particular ſubject which is, at this time, to engage our attention; I mean "The validity of Preſbyterian Ordination."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:016096_0006_0F9B759D34F80730"/>
But what can be farther ſaid upon a ſubject ſo limited in its nature, and which has now been ſo often handled in the rotation of this Lecture? It has been already ſo throughly and fully examined and diſcuſſed, both with reſpect to ſcripture and antiquity; and particularly by one of our venerable Fathers, whoſe diſcourſe has been made public, that little or nothing new can be added.</p>
            <p>The moſt, it is hoped, that can now be expected, is, that the ſubject may be ſtill held up in ſome new points of view, whereby farther light may poſſibly be caſt upon it, and ſome additional weight given to the arguments already uſed to ſupport and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the practice of theſe churches.</p>
            <p>It will be readily granted, I preſume, that by the kingdom of Chriſt, mentioned in my text, is intended the Church of Chriſt. He is a King, though not like earthly princes. The King of Zion is meek and lowly. He claims no dominion over the ſtates of this world, as ſuch, nor does he aſſume any thing of the outward ſplendor and magnificence of earthly potentates.</p>
            <p>They who believe in him, as the Son of God, and the Saviour of the world—who openly acknowledge him under that important character, and ſincerely ſubmit themſelves to the government of his ſacred laws—All ſuch, whether conſidered at large, as ſcattered through the world, or as united together in diſtinct ſocieties, are his loyal ſubjects. Over theſe he reigns, and theſe are his church or kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016096_0007_0F9B759DF5F6E160"/>
As divinely commiſſioned and appointed to that important buſineſs, he has founded this kingdom. He is the ſupreme head over it, and ſole legiſlator in it. The officers of this kingdom are appointed— their qualifications and powers deſcribed and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the duties of their office pointed out by him: And to him alone the ſubjects of this kingdom are accountable in what relates merely to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiments and eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Theſe are things implied in the text, ſome of which I ſhall particularly notice, and conſider, as
<list>
                  <item>I. The being and conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church are of divine original.</item>
                  <item>II. Jeſus Chriſt, as the founder and ſupreme head of this ſociety, hath the ſole right and authority of making and eſtabliſhing laws, and appointing officers in it. And therefore,</item>
                  <item>III. No laws or officers in the Chriſtian Church are to be eſteemed, as of divine authority, any farther than they are laws made and officers conſtituted and appointed by Chriſt; or than as they are conformable to that original and divine plan he hath left us.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe things may lead to ſome proper view of the particular point before us—may ſet the evidence we have of the validity of preſbyterian ordination in a juſt light, and ſhew the weakneſs of ſome objections uſually brought againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016096_0008_0F9B759ED9908670"/>
I. The being and conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church are of divine original.</p>
            <p>The juſtneſs of this obſervation from the text appears from the manner in which our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf—<hi>My kingdom is not of this world.</hi> It took not its riſe from the craft and ſubtilty, or from the ambition and power of men. It was not founded by human policy and wiſdom, but originated from heaven, and is of a divine and ſpiritual nature.</p>
            <p>That the Chriſtian Church originated from heaven appears from the evidence we have of Chriſt's divine miſſion into the world, who was the founder and framer of it. And of the ſufficiency of this evidence no one can reaſonably doubt, who, with a fair and candid mind, ſhall examine this evidence, as it ariſes from the prophecies that went before concerning Chriſt, compared with the correſponding events which happened, as to the time and place, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his birth, and the manner of his life. As it ariſes likewiſe from the many and inconteſtible miracles which he wrought, healing the ſick by a word, and raiſing the dead to life, &amp;c.—from the more than human wiſdom and knowledge he diſcovered— from the predictions he delivered, and their exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, and particularly as to his own reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and from ſome other things which might be mentioned to the ſame purpoſe.—No one, I imagine, who ſhall conſider theſe things, with a mind free from prejudice, and open to conviction, can retain a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doubt, but that Chriſt was what he pretended to be —the Son of God and Saviour of the world. That he came down from heaven, as he declared, commiſſioned and ſent by the Father; and that God was with him —owned and approved of him in what he did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:016096_0009_0F9B759F8718E118"/>
And this being granted, it follows, that whatever Chriſt did, in proſecution of his important miniſtry, was from divine authority, agreeable to what he ſometimes declared, that <hi>he ſpake the words, and did the works of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As acting by divine authority then we are to conceive of him, when he choſe his Apoſtles—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to their important office, and ſent them forth as his miniſters; therefore could he ſay with propriety—<hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John xx. 21.</note>

            <p>And the divine appointment and miſſion of theſe prime miniſters of the Goſpel was abundantly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated and confirmed by their being endued with the power of working miracles themſelves, to confirm the doctrines they ſhould teach, and the facts they ſhould relate; and particularly by their being, according to Chriſt's prediction and promiſe, filled with the Holy Ghoſt, on the day of Pentecoſt, when they ſpake a variety of languages, to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of thoſe who heard them.</p>
            <p>Thus qualified for ſpreading the Goſpel through the world—for propagating and eſtabliſhing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, they received this commiſſion from their Maſter and Lord, introduced with a declaration of his divine power and authority—<hi>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt. Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi>

Thus commiſſioned, the Apoſtles ſet out on their miniſtry; and the ſurprizing ſucceſs which attended their labors, may be juſtly viewed as an additional evidence of their heavenly miſſion and of the divinity of that religion they taught. For though they appeared as ſheep in the midſt of wolves—Though they had to encounter the ignorance and ſuperſtition —the bigotry and malice of this world, and met with great oppoſition—with hardſhips and ſufferings, yet they triumphed over all, and ſoon ſpread the Goſpel far and wide. Many believed and turned to the Lord, and by baptiſm were gathered into the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This ſociety, ſmall at firſt, and as a grain of muſtard ſeed, preſently enlarged and ſpread itſelf through the nations. Particular ſocieties were formed in different places—united under Jeſus their common head, and furniſhed with proper officers for their religious government, inſtruction and edification.</p>
            <p>Thus was the kingdom of Chriſt firſt ſet up in the world. Not, as I ſaid before, by human policy and power, but in oppoſition to theſe. It had not its firſt riſe from, nor any dependence upon this world. Its being and exiſtence were evidently from heaven. It was the work of God—the effect of divine wiſdom, power and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>And not only the firſt foundation and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Chriſt, but its whole frame and conſtitution, and the great end for which it was erected, exhibit ſtrong and convincing marks of its heavenly original. Of all this we muſt be ſenſible, if we examine the New Teſtament, where the nature and deſign of Chriſt's kingdom are repreſented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016096_0011_0F9B75A12AE8DD00"/>
Let us view there the laws and ordinances of this kingdom—the ſacred rules and maxims by which the ſubjects of it are to be governed. They have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this world in view. They are not calculated to advance men in earthly riches and greatneſs, nor to elevate ſome above others, in worldly pomp and dignity; but they breath a celeſtial ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and are manifeſtly deſigned to rectify the diſorders of our minds—to improve and perfect our nature—to make us like to the bleſſed God, and fit for thoſe high and noble enjoyments which are conſonant to our rational and moral nature.</p>
            <p>Let us view there the ſanctions of theſe laws. They are not taken from this world. The rewards promiſed to the obedient, are not any high and honorable offices in this life, and lucrative poſts and employments; nor the puniſhments threatned, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary mulcts, fines. impriſonment, or death.</p>
            <p>The great motives by which the laws of Chriſt are enforced, lie above, and beyond the preſent ſtate and ſcene of things. They reſpect the favor or diſpleaſure of Almighty God, and everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or woe in a future world.</p>
            <p>Nor are the officers Chriſt hath appointed in his kingdom like the rulers of this world. They have no lordly power and authority over his ſubjects, like what is exerciſed by the princes of the Gentiles. Inſtead of tyrannizing over others, they are to be their ſervants, miniſtering to them in acts of kindneſs and benevolence. It is their duty, indeed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the enlargement of Chriſt's kingdom, and to increaſe the number of his ſubjects, but not by any of the hoſtile meaſures of this world—the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016096_0012_0F9B75A20A69A258"/>weapons of their warfare are not carnal. But they are to endeavour this, by preaching up a crucified Saviour, and publiſhing the truths of his Goſpel, in their purity and ſimplicity;—by enlightening men's minds, and convincing and perſuading their judgments, not by the abſurd method of bodily tortures, or any other motives taken from this world, but by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the ſacred oracles, and ſuited to their intellectual nature.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of Chriſt's miniſters, who are officers in his kingdom, is to ſeek eſpecially the ſpiritual welfare and happineſs of his ſubjects. To elevate their minds above this world—to raiſe their views to heaven, as their proper home, and to endeavour their preparation for that bleſſed abode.</p>
            <p>In a word. The whole frame and conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church, as delineated and ſet before us in the Goſpel, as well as the manner in which it was firſt founded and ſet up, declare its divine original. From heaven it took its riſe, and the great deſign of it is, to bring men to that glorious and happy place.</p>
            <p>From this account of the being and conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church, I proceed to the ſecond thing noticed from the text.</p>
            <p>II. Jeſus Chriſt, as the founder and ſupreme head of this ſociety, hath the ſole right of making and eſtabliſhing laws, and appointing officers in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus anſwered, my kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. He therefore is King of this eccleſiaſtical ſociety, which implies his ſovereign dominion over it. And it ſeems eſſential to his being poſſeſſed of ſuch dominion, that the power of legiſlation and government ſhould be wholly in his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:016096_0013_0F9B75A32C1B4280"/>
This is not the caſe, indeed; I mean, it ought not to be the caſe, in civil ſtates, and cannot be, in free ſtates, where ſubjects have a proper enjoyment of their juſt rights. For as all human power muſt originally reſide in and proceed from the community, rulers, though elevated in office, yet, ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are the creatures and ſervants of the people.</p>
            <p>And as the higheſt earthly rulers are but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men—liable to miſconduct through ignorance, avarice, ambition, &amp;c. it is reaſonable they ſhould never be poſſeſſed of abſolute, uncontroulable autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is juſt, and tends to the good of ſociety, that the ſtate ſhould always have this check upon the legiſlative and governing powers, to reſume that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which they have parted with, only for the common good, whenever ſuch authority is abuſed.</p>
            <p>But in ſuch reſpects as theſe, Chriſt's kingdom is not of this world. None of his ſubjects ever ſtood upon a level with him, nor contributed any thing to that ſupreme power of which he is poſſeſſed. His kingdom is of his own founding and eſtabliſhing— It is his own property.</p>
            <p>And beſides, that on this account, he may appear to have a natural right to ſovereign dominion, he is eminently qualified to exerciſe ſuch dominion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever abuſing it.</p>
            <p>The abſolute rectitude of his nature—the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his wiſdom and knowledge, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate goodneſs, render it impoſſible but that his laws and government ſhould be always juſt and right, and calculated for the good and happineſs of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016096_0014_0F9B75A334601C90"/>
And Chriſt being thus head over all things to the Church, a ſuppoſition that any, beſides him, may have power of legiſlation and government in it, is wholly without foundation. For ſuch muſt act either independently of him, and by an authority of their own; or elſe as his delegates, and by a power derived from him; neither of which can be the caſe.</p>
            <p>For to ſuppoſe they act independently of him, is moſt obviouſly inconſiſtent with his own ſupremacy. This is at once to dethrone him, and take his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom out of his hands. And as to any one's acting by delegation, or as having received power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from him, to make laws, and appoint officers in his kingdom, of this we have not the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the New-Teſtament. Chriſt has conſtituted no ſuch law-makers and vicegerents in his church; and we have abundant reaſon to conclude he never intended there ſhould be any. He has given it in ſolemn charge to all his ſubjects, not to aſſume or pretend to any ſuch authority, nor to ſubmit to it if uſurped, or claimed by others. <hi>Call no man your Father upon earth—neither be ye called Maſters. One is your Father who is in heaven—One is your Maſter even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii, 8, 9, 10.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſupreme dominion and authority of our exalted Redeemer muſt have reſpect, not only to the ſimple acts of making laws and appointing officers in his kingdom, but to whatever will have influence on the nature and operation of laws; as for inſtance— the particular ſenſe in which they are to be underſtood and obeyed.—And to whatever will affect the buſineſs of officers—as their rank and dignity, and the powers committed to them. This will be evident on a moment's reflection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016096_0015_0F9B75A3F31C8C88"/>
For, let it be ſuppoſed that any man, or body of men, have authority to determine the ſenſe of certain doctrines or laws of Chriſt, ſo as to oblige others to receive them in <hi>their</hi> particular ſenſe, it is obvious ſuch men may, by virtue of their own interpretation, alter the nature of theſe doctrines and laws, juſt as they pleaſe; and may abſolutely annihilate them, as to their original intention. And theſe authoritative interpreters would, in effect, be the legiſlators and rulers in Chriſt's kingdom, in contradiction to his own acknowledged ſupremacy and dominion.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, if new officers ſhould be added to thoſe Chriſt hath appointed in his kingdom, or, which amounts to much the ſame, if thoſe he hath conſtituted ſhould be altered, and made different from what they were—if, for inſtance, that equality which, 'tis ſuppoſed, the New-Teſtament clearly points out between biſhops and preſbyters or elders—if this equality ſhould be deſtroyed—it ſome of theſe ſhould be exalted above others in dignity and power—ſhould be raiſed to diſtinguiſhed honors and privileges, and authorized to perform peculiar acts, from which others are excluded, as incapable, it is manifeſt that by ſuch changes and alterations in the Chriſtian Church, it would become quite a different thing from what it was when firſt conſtituted. It could be, <hi>but in part,</hi> the kingdom of Chriſt; in part it muſt be a kingdom of this world; or the kingdom of thoſe men, who made theſe changes and alterations in it.</p>
            <p>But now, Chriſt being the ſupreme and ſovereign Lord over his own Church or kingdom—being the ſole legiſlator and authoritative ruler in it, muſt intirely and forever exclude all others from any ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016096_0016_0F9B75A7728F67B8"/>authority and power—from any authority to make new laws, or appoint new officers in his kingdom— from all authority even to interpret any of his laws or doctrines, ſo as to oblige others to receive and obey them, in their particular ſenſe. And, as intirely muſt this exclude all others from authority to make any diſtinctions among the officers of his kingdom, which he hath not made;—to give powers to ſome which he has not granted, or to deprive others of thoſe with which he has inveſted them.</p>
            <p>And if this reaſoning is juſt, it follows, I conceive, as an undeniable conſequence.</p>
            <p>III. That no laws or officers now in the Chriſtian Church are to be eſteemed as of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, any farther than they are laws made and officers conſtituted and appointed by Chriſt or, than as they are conformable to that original divine plan he has left us.</p>
            <p>This concluſion reſults from its being manifeſtly inconſiſtent with the ſupreme dominion of Chriſt in his own kingdom, that any beſides him, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of him, ſhould have authority to act as le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators and rulers in it. Any laws, therefore, or officers, which have taken place in the Chriſtian Church, and appear not; or, ſo far as they appear not, to have been made and conſtituted by Chriſt, we are not to look upon as properly belonging to his kingdom, nor as of divine authority.</p>
            <p>And this naturally brings us to conſider and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the particular point we have in view, viz. "the article of preſbyterian ordination."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:016096_0017_0F9B75CF75062C48"/>
I cannot perſuade myſelf, indeed, but that, if all controverſy was out of ſight, no one could reaſonably doubt the validity of ordination by Preſbyters or Elders, who, with a fair and honeſt mind, ſhould examine that plan of the Chriſtian Church the Goſpel ſets before us.</p>
            <p>We, as Diſſenters from the Church of England or rather, as forming our ſentiments by the ſacred Scriptures, believe and aſſert this validity. The Churches in this country, in general, with many elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, practiſe upon this principle; and, we doubt not, God approves our practice—has greatly bleſſed, and will continue to bleſs the miniſtrations of his ſervants thus ordained.</p>
            <p>Epiſcopalians, as they are called, zealouſly oppoſe us in this point, and repreſent our ordinations as null and void. And it is oppoſition from this quarter, and not any doubtful circumſtances, attending the ſubject itſelf, upon a ſcripture view of it, which has rendered the defence of this article important, and, 'tis likely, gave riſe to this lecture, in the mind of the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable founder.</p>
            <p>It is an avowed principle of the Church of England, and no immaterial part of the foundation of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent grand hierarchy, that Biſhops and Preſbyters are not the ſame, but two diſtinct officers in the Church of Chriſt;—that Biſhops are an order ſuperior in rank and dignity, and have, in particular, the power of ordaining others, or ſeparating them to the goſpel-miniſtry, which Preſbyters have not.</p>
            <p>In ſupport of theſe ſentiments, ſome writers on that ſide the queſtion have laid great weight on what, they ſay were the opinions and practice of the church in the early ages of it, and even from the Apoſtles days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:016096_0018_0F9B75D045839B18"/>
But any conſiderable acquaintance with the ancient hiſtory of the church muſt ſatisfy the unprejudiced, that no argument of any force can be drawn from thence. For it is manifeſt, and is acknowledged by ſome of the moſt learned and judicious of Epiſcopalians themſelves, that, in the earlieſt ages, the words Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Biſhop were uſed, as they were by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writers, without any diſcrimination; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended perſons of one and the ſame office.</p>
            <p>In times more remote from the apoſtolic age, when, through length of time, and the luſts of men, various corruptions had crept into the church, it is readily acknowledged theſe words were uſed, by ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to point out different officers; and the Biſhop was then exalted above his brother Preſbyter.</p>
            <p>But this was not the only innovation which took place in the church, nor was the exalted Biſhop the only new officer who was conſtituted and ſet up in it.</p>
            <p>There ſoon entered, and by the ſame door, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, Archdencons, Archbiſhops, Patriarchs, &amp;c.</hi> with a long catalogue of religious rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were introduced, not all at once, indeed, but <hi>gradatim et paulatim,</hi> to beautify and adorn the church, and edify its members.</p>
            <p>Theſe all ſtand upon the ſame bottom with Biſhops, as diſtinguiſhed from Preſbyters, and were created by the ſame power, i. e. human power. They all are the inventions and inſtitutions of uninſpired and fallible men.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe might originate, 'tis probable, from pious views and deſigns, in the weak and injudicious —others from the pride and ambition of a corrupt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016096_0019_0F9B75D0F2DAE3F0"/>clergy, who impoſed on the ignorance and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of the vulgar; and others might ſpring from other cauſes.</p>
            <p>But we mean not to ſettle the point before us by human authorities; and it ſeems, indeed, but a uſeleſs kind of parade, to muſter the Fathers, as they are called—to marſhal them on oppoſite ſides, and play them off againſt one another.</p>
            <p>Having the inſpired writings for our inſtructor and guide, it is of but very little conſequence, in this controverſy, what the Fathers, or other fallible men, have wrote or practiſed—what opinions or cuſtoms they have approved or condemned, eſpecially ſince they have ſo often contradicted one another, and themſelves too.</p>
            <p>As to all innovations upon the ſcripture plan, our Saviour's remark, reſpecting divorce, is a ſufficient confutation of them—<hi>But from the beginning it was not ſo</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xix. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Our appeal is to the ſacred books of the New-Teſtament, where we have, from divine inſpiration, the only account we can fully depend on, of the firſt foundation and conſtitution of the Chriſtian Church; —of its laws, ordinances, officers, &amp;c. And there it appears, in a light ſufficiently clear and ſtrong, that Biſhops, and Preſbyters or Elders, were the ſame officers in the Church of Chriſt;—that there was no difference in their qualifications, their powers, or employments.</p>
            <p>It will not be expected I ſhould mention all thoſe paſſages in the ſacred oracles, which might be pertinent on this occaſion. I ſhall take notice only
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016096_0020_0F9B75D22045F680"/>of two or three, which may be ſufficient to the preſent purpoſe. The firſt is in Tit. i. 5, 7. where the Apoſtles Paul tells Titus he <hi>left him in Crete—to ordain Elders in every city.</hi> He then ſhews how theſe Elders were to be qualified. <hi>If any man be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. and immediately adds this reaſon of his advice — <hi>For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs.</hi> The word <hi>for</hi> there is evidently cauſal, and ſhews the identity of office between an Elder or Preſbyter, and a Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Titus was to take care that the perſons he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Elders</hi> were of blameleſs character; and for this reaſon, becauſe a Biſhop muſt be <hi>ſo.</hi> But to what purpoſe could this be ſaid, or with what propriety, unleſs an Elder and a Biſhop were the ſame in office? And from his paſſage it appears, not only that the office of a Biſhop and Elder was the ſame, but that their qualifications were the ſame likewiſe.</p>
            <p>The next place I ſhall mention is in Acts xx. 17. Where we read that Paul being at Miletus, ſent to Epheſus for the Elders of the church, to take his laſt leave of them, and to give them his ſolemn parting charge. To theſe Elders he thus addreſſed himſelf in the 28th verſe. <hi>Take heed unto yourſelves, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> biſhops) <hi>to feed the the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it is manifeſt, not only that Elders were Biſhops, or that their office was one and the ſame, but that the work aſſigned them, in the execution of their office, was the ſame alſo, viz. <hi>to feed the Church of God.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here rendered <hi>to feed,</hi> is of ſomewhat extenſive meaning, and may
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016096_0021_0F9B75D311739720"/>ſignify to preſide over, and govern the church by the laws of Chriſt, as well as to miniſter to it in other reſpects. Elders and Biſhops had therefore the ſame power committed to them in the Church of Chriſt, and were authorized and directed to perform the ſame miniſterial ſervice.</p>
            <p>And this may appear ſtill farther evident from one paſſage more I ſhall mention, which is in I Pet. v 1, 2. <hi>The Elders which are among you I exhort, who am alſo an Elder, &amp;c. feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> performing the office of Biſhops] <hi>not by conſtraint, but willingly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am not inſenſible that ſome objections have been offered againſt the plain and obvious ſenſe of the above paſſages of Scripture: But theſe have been ſo often conſidered, and ſo fully removed, that I ſhall take no notice of them; nor of attempts which have been made to prove a ſuperiority of rank and power in Biſhops above Preſbyters, from the ſuppoſed Epiſcopacy of Timothy and Titus. The ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that theſe two Evangeliſts poſſeſſed epiſcopal powers, which Presbyters did not, is ſo intirely without any ſcripture foundation, that it merits not our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, any more than the doctrine of an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion of Biſhops, in the modern form, even from the time of the Apoſtles; and ſome other things which over-zealous and whimſical men have laid ſtreſs upon.</p>
            <p>Our appeal, as I ſaid before, is to the ſacred books of the New-Teſtament, where we have the words of divine inſpiration to determine our judgment and practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:016096_0022_0F9B75D47100A1C8"/>
And it appears, I conceive, with ſufficient evidence, from the paſſages above quoted, as well as from many others which might be mentioned, that, according to the conſtitution and pattern of the Chriſtian Church, left us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the names Biſhop and Preſbyter or Elder, were uſed indiſcriminately, to ſignify or point out perſons of one and the ſame office:—that their qualifications, their authority, and the work aſſigned to them, were preciſely the ſame.</p>
            <p>They were equally authorized therefore to preach the word, to adminiſter the ordinances of the Goſpel, to ordain, or ſolemnly to ſeparate other meet perſons, to the goſpel miniſtry; and to perform any other ſervice which belonged to their office as miniſters of Chriſt. From all which we may very juſtly and ſafely conclude the validity of ordination by Preſbyters.</p>
            <p>For if the office of theſe and of Biſhops was the ſame, and the work appointed to each of them, as miniſters of Chriſt, was the ſame, it will then follow, as a juſt concluſion, that ordination by Preſbyters is ſcriptural and valid, ſuppoſing that the Act of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining others was a part of the work aſſigned them.</p>
            <p>True, our opponents may ſay, ſuppoſing this— ſuppoſing the act of ordaining others, to be a part of the work aſſigned to Preſbyters, or even to Preſbyters and Biſhops in common, then this concluſion might be juſt; but this is denied.</p>
            <p>We grant that a power of ordination exiſted in the firſt ordinary and ſtanding miniſters of the Goſpel, and hath deſcended down from them to others, by Chriſt's appointment; but then this power was only in Biſhops, as diſtinguiſhed from Preſbyters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:016096_0023_0F9B75D4B46D0928"/>
To this objection, which reſts wholly upon an arbitrary diſtinction between the office and power of Biſhops and Preſbyters, it would be a ſufficient anſwer, to obſerve, that we have inſtances, in the New-Teſtament, of ordination performed by perſons under the name of Preſbyters, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv. 13, 14. Acts xiii. 1, 2, 3.</note> but not a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any performed by perſons under the name of Biſhops; from whence we might fairly conclude, that if there was any diſtinction of office and power between theſe, Preſbyters and not Biſhops had power to ordain.</p>
            <p>But I chuſe to reſt the point, at preſent, upon that identity of office, of power, and of work or ſervice we have fully proved between Preſbyters and Biſhops.</p>
            <p>There is no diſpute between Epiſcopalians and us, as to Biſhops having, in the apoſtolic age, a divine right to ordain others. This we believe and aſſert equally with them. And it being evident, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that at that time, the words Biſhop and Preſbyter were convertible terms, and uſed indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for each other;—that Biſhops were Preſbyters, and Preſbyters Biſhops;—that their qualifications, their office, their power and buſineſs were the ſame, the concluſion is fair and juſt, that ordination by Preſbyters is ſcriptural and valid.</p>
            <p>And it follows likewiſe, from what hath been ſaid above, of the equality and ſameneſs of Biſhop and Preſbyter, that whatever diſtinction between theſe has taken place ſince the apoſtolic age—whatever ſuperiority in rank, and dignity of office, or of power in the Church of Chriſt, a Biſhop is ſuppoſed now to have, above a Preſbyter, is a diſtinction and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016096_0024_0F9B75D8AD49DB58"/>ſuperiority without any foundation. A Biſhop, thus diſtinguiſhed and elevated is no officer in the church or kingdom of Chriſt, but merely of human invention and creation.</p>
            <p>And in the ſame light we juſtly view a large number of others, as <hi>Canons, Deans, Archbiſhops, Chancellors,</hi> &amp;c. Of theſe, and of ſome other officers, tho of high importance in the Church of England, we read nothing in the New-Teſtament. They have neither name, nor place, nor work aſſigned to them, in the divine conſtitution and form of the Church of Chriſt which is there exhibited. They are all officers of men's creating and ſetting up. Their exiſtence and authority are not from Chriſt, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine founder and ſupreme head of the Church, but wholly from this world.</p>
            <p>But from this ſome may be ready to conclude, I am for cutting off the Church of England, from being any part of the Church of Chriſt;—for demoliſhing all her officers, and nullifying all her adminiſtrations. But ſuch concluſions as theſe, from what I have ſaid, would not be ſtrictly juſt. Nor do I mean to retaliate upon our epiſcopal brethren, by any hard and uncharitable reflections.</p>
            <p>I ſincerely wiſh the character of that Church may be ever ſupported, and appear reſpectable in the eyes of all Chriſtians, ſo far as it is built on the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but great and good men—ſincere diſciples of Chriſt, have, and ſtill belong to that eſtabliſhment; and that ſome of its moſt dignified clergy have been eminently ſervicable in promoting
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016096_0025_0F9B75DE20F608B8"/>the true intereſt of the Redeemer's kingdom: Nor do I doubt its being a part of the Church of Chriſt, notwithſtanding the many human additions which ſtill adhere to it.</p>
            <p>But then theſe additions—all its deviations from the ſcripture pattern, cannot be juſtly eſteemed any part of its character, as a Church of Chriſt, but ſo many corruptions it has unhappily received, and ſtill retains; and which, inſtead of adding to its true beauty and glory, really disfigure and deform it. Theſe are not gold, ſilver and precious ſtones, built on Chriſt, the only foundation, but wood, hay and ſtubble, which the power of truth may in time, purge and purify it from.</p>
            <p>And tho' the Church of Chriſt knows no ſuch officers as Biſhops, of ſuperior rank and power to Preſbyters, yet I charitable believe ordination by theſe may be valid. Not indeed, as they are Biſhops, in a prelatical ſenſe, but as they are Scripture Biſhops, and the ſame in rank and office with Preſbyters. For it is only in this view of them, that they can juſtly be conſidered as officers in Chriſt's kingdom, and as having any divine right to ordain: In the other view, all their authority is from this world, and is, therefore, in reality, no authority at all.</p>
            <p>So that if our ordinations by Preſbyters are not more valid than thoſe by Biſhops, they certainly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be leſs ſo, unleſs an authority derived from men— merely from this world, may be ſuppoſed greater and better than an authority derived from heaven.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now beg your farther patience, only 'till I offer a few reflections upon, or inferences from what hath been ſaid. And,</p>
            <p n="1">

1. The Chriſtian Church being of divine original, we ſhould ever look on its conſtitution as ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>Every work of God is perfect in its kind, nor are we able to improve upon, and mend, what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and executed by infinite wiſdom. The moſt pious views and motives will not juſtify us in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, as we have neither authority nor capacity for ſuch buſineſs. Corruptions in the Church, 'tis highly probable, were early introduced, by a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to mend it, or make alterations to its advantage. Good men, but weak and injudicious, imagined that an officer of higher rank and greater power, than a common Preſbyter, would have more influence in correcting abuſes in the Church, keeping out hereſies, &amp;c. Hence, 'tis likely, the office of a Biſhop, as diſtinguiſhed from, and ſuperior to Preſbyter, firſt took its riſe. Other alterations might proceed from the ſame cauſe, and many from other cauſes much leſs juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>Corruptions once begun, were carried from one degree to another, 'till, in ſome places, what was called the Church of Chriſt, had very little of its original form left, and became almoſt intirely a kingdom of this world.</p>
            <p>Biſhops, in particular, were not only raiſed above Preſbyters, but their elevation gradually increaſed. They were made Archbiſhops, Patriarchs, &amp;c. And, in ſome places, in addition to their epiſcopal dignities, they were created <hi>Counts, Marquiſſes, Dukes;</hi> and have ſometimes claimed and poſſeſſed all the <hi>Regalia</hi> of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Princes. They have given laws to nations, and battle to their enemies, at the head of numerous armies of their own raiſing. This was making the Church of Chriſt a church militant indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:016096_0027_0F9B75E001889BD0"/>
But how unlike to the meek and benevolent Son of God, who came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them, muſt theſe military heroes appear, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his diſciples, and officers in his kingdom?</p>
            <p>Now, as ſuch groſs corruptions proceeded from ſmall alterations, at firſt, in the ſcripture plan, how cautious ſhould we be of ever attempting any thing of this nature! How inviolable ſhould we hold the inſtitutions of heaven!</p>
            <p>And it is by a cloſe and ſteadfaſt adherence to that divine pattern left us by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that we may hope the truth, as it in Jeſus, will, in time, prevail over error and ſuperſtition, and, by its power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy, remove, by degrees, all thoſe human alterations, which have ſo greatly mutilated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the church;—will reſtore it to its original purity and glory, when it will appear again, to its friends, fair as the moon, and clear as the ſun; and to its enemies, terrible as an army with banners.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſupremacy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, over his own church or kingdom;—his being the ſole legiſlator and authoritative ruler in it, as this ſhould caution us againſt aſpiring at any lordly dominion over others. ſo it ſhould guard us againſt ſubmitting to the authority of any, who would uſurp and exerciſe ſuch dominion over us.</p>
            <p>In all things which reſpect our religious faith and practice, we are to recur to the ſacred ſtandard Chriſt hath left us. We are to compare all things with this, and to judge of all things by this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:016096_0028_0F9B75E0D2A24768"/>
It is of but little importance to us, what are the opinions or practice of this or that fallible man, unleſs we can find them agreeable to the doctrines and laws of Chriſt. He only is our Maſter in what relates to conſcience, and our eternal ſalvation. To him we ſtand or fall. And if we approve ourſelves to him, we need not be greatly anxious as to what men may judge or ſay of us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon the principles which have been now laid down and eſtabliſhed, our diſſent from the Church of England—our rejection of her form of government—of her rites and ceremonies, muſt be forever juſtified.</p>
            <p>We diſſent from her in no article, but where we are well perſuaded ſhe herſelf has diſſented from the Scripture Plan. We reject nothing, but what we are well perſuaded had its riſe and eſtabliſhment from the inventions and power of men. We ſeparate from her, only ſo far as we believe ſhe has deviated from the form and conſtitution of Chriſt's kingdom, and is become a kingdom of this world. And thus far, even our allegiance to Jeſus Chriſt, as our only ſupreme head, our lawgiver, our ruler and judge, obliges us to diſſent.</p>
            <p>Inſtead therefore of imagining our fore-fathers were guilty of ſchiſm, of which they and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers have been often accuſed, in ſeparating from the Church of England, and caſting off the yoke under which they had groaned, we ought to venerate and honor their memories, for that pious zeal and fortitude they diſcovered, in aſſerting the liberty wherewith Chriſt had made them free: And that from a regard to their own conſciences, and the honor
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016096_0029_0F9B75E176E18F80"/>of their divine Lord, they ſubmitted to hardſhips and ſufferings, in planting churches in this land, more conformable to the goſpel pattern.</p>
            <p>And it certainly becomes us their deſcendents, who reap the happy fruits of their trials, not to become again entangled with the yoke of bondage; but to ſtand faſt in that liberty they have tranſmitted to us.</p>
            <p>And from the ſame principles which juſtify our diſſent, in general, from the epiſcopal form and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church, we conclude, and with the greateſt reaſon, the validity of ordination by Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or Scripture-Biſhops.</p>
            <p>For, by examining the conſtitution of the church, or kingdom of Chriſt—its doctrines and laws—the officers he hath appointed in it—their qualifications and powers, and the work he has aſſigned to them, as theſe things are placed before us in the New-Teſtament— upon ſuch examination, we find it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, beyond all reaſonable doubt, that Biſhops and Preſbyters had one and the ſame office, and equal authority to perform all miniſterial ſervices, and therefore ordination among the reſt. And the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to this, from our opponents, being grounded, mainly, on a ſuppoſed ſuperiority of Biſhops to Preſbyters, and reſting on unwarrantable alterations in the Church of Chriſt, and receiving therefore all their force from human authority, ought not, in the deciſion of the preſent point, to have the weight of a feather.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but recommend it to all—to the young gentlemen of this Society in particular, and eſpecially to ſuch of them as are deſigned for the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016096_0030_0F9B75E233F0A950"/>goſpel miniſtry, to give cloſe attention to the ſacred Scriptures in their examination of this ſubject. Your looking back into antiquity, will, indeed be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to you, nor to the practice or cauſe of theſe Churches, if you can take a proper extenſive view of what has been wrote relative to this controverſy.</p>
            <p>But then remember that after all your reſearches, the ſacred Scriptures ought to be your guide. The words of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, are not only more ancient than thoſe of the Fathers, as they are called, and of later writers, but they alone are of divine authority, and ought to determine and ſettle our judgment, in all things of a religious nature.</p>
            <p>And I am perſuaded that the more the preſent point is viewed and examined by the light of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the evidence for the validity of preſbyterian ordination will appear brighter and ſtronger, and triumph over all objection.</p>
            <p>To conclude,</p>
            <p>Let it be the concern of all, that they are the true and real ſubjects of the kingdom of Chriſt. A reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſo evidently divine as that which the Goſpel teaches, and the great deſign of which is ſo infinitely gracious, muſt, in the higheſt degree, deſerve our attention; and greatly ſolicitous ſhould we all be, that we experience its ſanctifying and ſaving influence.</p>
            <p>But our beloved ſons, the ſtudents in this place, for whoſe welfare we feel a parental tenderneſs, will ſuffer me, in a particular manner, to recommend this to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:016096_0031_0F9B75E2F8A59E10"/>
Amidſt all your ſtudies of the liberal arts and ſciences, and to acquire thoſe literary accompliſhments, which may juſtly adorn your character, and render you uſeful members of ſociety, let me requeſt it of you, not to neglect the ſtudy of yourſelves, and a proper cultivation of your own minds, in a moral view.</p>
            <p>Converſe much with the ſacred claſſics. Make the doctrines and laws of Chriſt familiar to you. Often compare yourſelves with, and examine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by them; and be concerned that every thing yet amiſs in your tempers or lives, be rectified by the grace of the Goſpel;—that you are daily improving in the true and ſolid virtues of Chriſtianity, and ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that ſtate of endleſs glory and felicity, which ſhall be the portion of the righteous.</p>
            <p>Believe me, my young friends, all the glittering charms of this preſent world, ſo apt to engage and captivate the mind in early life, are but gilded dancing bubbles, which vaniſh in a moment, compared with this.</p>
            <p>And may we all ſo conduct through the preſent ſtate, as to be accepted of our great lawgiver, ruler and judge, and find our lot among his faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, at that important time, when having put down all rule, and all authority and power, and ſubdued all his and his church's enemies, he ſhall deliver up the kingdom to the Father, and God ſhall be all and in all.</p>
