            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the ſermons remark'd upon in the following ſheets, were publiſhed in Boſton in the year 1761, it may be a queſtion, Why no reply has been made to them long before this time; ſeeing the doctor has therein attempted to eſtabliſh a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſo directly contrary to the ſentiments and preaching of many divines in New-England? To this, the author of what follows has only to ſay, That the ſermons had been long publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got ſight of them: After this, he waited, hoping and expecting, that ſome able hand would undertake an anſwer. But when he deſpaired of this, he turned his thoughts this way, and has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his firſt leiſure hours, in attending to the ſubject. The reſult of which, imperfect as it is, is now offered to the public. And none, it is hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will think it is ever too late to defend the truth.</p>
            <p>BUT what need, may it be ſaid, of entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this controverſy at all? If the author had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to publiſh his thoughts upon this ſubject, he had an undoubted right to do it: but what call was there to engage in a formal controverſy with Dr. Mayhew? If the truth is vindicated by ſolid arguments, what has been ſaid againſt it will fall of courſe. There was no occaſion therefore of making a formal attack upon the doctor's perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: this muſt proceed from too great a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to run into controverſy, of which little good comes, and often much hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:010007_0006_0F7B996F34F2EA98"/>ANS. As this objection is againſt the common practice of chriſtian writers, from the early days, of chriſtianity to this time, and the men moſt not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for wiſdom and piety, yea, Dr. Mayhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the reſt, the author thinks himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently kept in countenance by their example.</p>
            <p>Beſides, does not this appear to be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and effectual way, in many caſes at leaſt, to detect error, and vindicate the truth? If errors are broached, and contended for by plauſible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how can they be detected, and the truth ſet in an advantageous light, but by particularly ſhowing the fallacy of the pretended argument? If error is openly plead for, it tends to hurt the public, and lead many aſtray. And what likelier method can there be taken to prevent the miſchief, than by particularly ſhewing, how ill grounded and abſurd the arguments are, with which it is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pointing out the book in which they are found? If poiſon is publicly ſold, and ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, under pretence of its being a wholeſome food, a true friend to mankind, would not content himſelf with pointing out the real qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of good food; but would diſcover the poiſon of that which pretended to be ſuch, and tell them where it was, that they might be under advantage to ſee for themſelves, and avoid the danger.</p>
            <p>Controverſy, it muſt be acknowledged, is too often managed, in an unfair manner, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian heat and bitterneſs; and many times is diverted from fair reaſoning on the point to be diſputed, into perſonal quarrel and invectives. This can by no means be juſtified; but it may, and often has been managed, greatly to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:010007_0007_0F7B996FCDE6C6E0"/>
of truth. It were eaſy to ſhew, that this has been one ſpecial and principal means, of the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and increaſe of light and truth in the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church. One great end of God, in ſuffering men of an uncommon genius to run into error, and ſpend their lives in hard ſtudy and labor, in order to maintain and propagate their tenets, and oppoſe the truth, it ſeems has been, to awaken the attention of men hereby, eſpecially of the friends of truth; that, by a cloſe and thorough examination of the matter, the error may appear in all its weakneſs and inconſiſtency, and the oppoſite truth be ſet in a more clear and convincing light, than it could be, had it never been oppoſed. To be ſure, that this has in fact been the event of controverſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, in many inſtances, none can doubt, who have been in any meaſure attentive to the ſtate of the chriſtian church. And the diſpute that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes on ſuch occaſions, is the means of awakening the attention of multitudes; by which they are the more prepared to receive conviction of the truth, when it ſhines forth bright and victorious. When opponents are engaged in a doctrinal controverſy, not only the love of truth, their zeal for God and his cauſe, but their own perſonal intereſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, will be a powerful motive to ſtudy and ſearch oat the matter, and vindicate their cauſe in the beſt manner they can. And by-ſtanders, who are properly attentive, and diſpoſed to embrace the truth wherever it appears, will hereby be under ſpecial advantage to get inſtruction: for it would be a wonder, if ſome new light is not ſtruck up by this means, even though the controverſy ſhould not be managed every way in the beſt manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010007_0008_0F7B997065012118"/>What Dr. Mayhew ſays to this point, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be attended to here. Speaking of thoſe who greatly diſlike controverſy and diſputes on matters of religion, he ſays, <q>A third ſort, are thoſe good men, who ſincerely love and practice religion themſelves, but yet are ſuch great lovers of peace, of ſuch a timid make, and ſo apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the bad effects of contention, that they think it beſt never to enter into debates on reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or any thing relative to it on any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and condemn thoſe who do ſo, as at beſt imprudent and ill adviſed perſons. But ſurely there may be juſt and ſufficient cauſe for diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if religion itſelf is of any great importance. We are enjoined to contend earneſtly for the faith.</q>

                  <hi>Obſervation,</hi> &amp;c. p. 5, 6.</note> It may be added, the more earneſtly we contend, the better, if it be with chriſtian meekneſs and humility. If thoſe good, peaceable gentlemen, who are ſo greatly averſe to, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with all controverſy, were univerſally hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to, moſt of the important doctrines of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, would ſoon be given up, or loſt in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance.</p>
            <p>IF any ſhould be inclined to think, that the point here controverted, is not of importance enough, to require any great ado about it; and is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon againſt entering into a public debate upon it: they are deſired to conſider, that the queſtion in diſpute really is, What is the condition, on which men may obtain ſalvation? or, What muſt men do, in order to be intereſted in God's favor, and have a title to eternal life? This is
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010007_0009_0F7B9970EF3B7228"/>
therefore the moſt intereſting queſtion that can be thought of: and 'tis of the greateſt importance to all, that they make no miſtake here, but have a right underſtanding of the matter. For ſurely nothing in religion is of greater importance, than that which teaches us how we may be ſaved. If ſalvation itſelf is of infinite importance, then 'tis of equal importance that we don't miſtake the terms on which it is to be obtained. What we chiefly want a revelation from God for, is, to teach us the terms of his favor, or the way of ſalvation. And ſince a revelation is given chiefly for this end, ſhall we think it a matter of ſo little importance, as that 'tis not worth while to enquire into it, or contend for what we think to be the truth of the matter?</p>
            <p>Dr. Mayhew thinks what he contends for, to be the ſum of the glad tidings of the goſpel.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 76.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, in his view, they do not preach nor underſtand the goſpel, who oppoſe him in this point. He therefore thinks it of great importance that it ſhould be received.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 30.</note> 'Tis granted to be ſo, if it is the truth. If it is not, it is of the laſt importance to him, and all others, that they ſhould be ſenſible of it, and embrace directly the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as truth: which, doubtleſs appears as greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, to thoſe who are now eſtabliſhed in it. They therefore may be allowed to contend earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it.</p>
            <p>BUT however juſt and important this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy may be, it is ſurely not well timed, ſome will ſay. Dr. Mayhew is now engaged in a good and important cauſe, in his controverſy with the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010007_0010_0F7B9971AEE53020"/>
party in New-England. An appearance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him at this time, may give ſome advantage to his other opponents, and tend to weaken his hands. At leaſt, this attack, at this time, looks unfriendly to the important and noble cauſe he has eſpouſed.</p>
            <p>ANS. That the cauſe the doctor is engaged in, is important and noble, the author readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and is not a little pleaſed, that a gentleman of his abilities and advantages has undertaken it. He certainly deſerves the thanks of his country, for what he has done in this matter. And doubtleſs has the thanks of all the true friends to the intereſt of religion; not excepting even thoſe of the church of England, who have impartiality and candor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to attend to the true ſtate of the caſe. The author is willing the world ſhould know, that he wiſhes and prays, that an end may be put to the erecting of epiſcopal miſſions in New-England, in the manner it has been done for ſo long a time; by which, he has not the leaſt doubt, not the cauſe of chriſtianity, but directly the oppoſite, has been greatly promoted. He ſincerely wiſhes, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may have the honor and happineſs, of being an inſtrument of this; and would therefore be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to do any thing, that ſhould tend to prevent it.</p>
            <p>But if the doctor ſhould appear to be wrong in one inſtance, this is no argument that he is ſo in all others. And an attempt to ſet him right, wherein he is thought to have made a miſtake, is an act of friendſhip to him. It is alſo, perhaps, worthy of remark, that the tenet in which the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is oppoſed in the following enquiry, is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to moſt, if not all of the epiſcopal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in New-England; ſo that he herein falls in
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010007_0011_0F7B997462969D40"/>
with thoſe he oppoſes in the controverſy mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The author, therefore, in oppoſing the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor here, equally oppoſes thoſe whom he appears againſt. How then does he ſtrengthen them, and weaken the doctor's hands? May it not be truly ſaid, that if the doctor ſhould be convinced of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in this inſtance, if it is one, and eſpouſe the contrary doctrine, he would be under better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in this controverſy, than now he is? It is well known, what a noiſe moſt of the doctor's antagoniſts have made about his heterodoxy. If he had been quite orthodox, according to the faith of our pious forefathers in New-England, they would not have had this handle, however ſincerely they now uſe it.</p>
            <p>The author thinks the doctor worthy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and honor, for his many excellent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; his cloſe application and diligence in his ſtudy, his eaſy, happy, maſterly way of expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſentiments, &amp;c. but all this is, in his view, rather a reaſon why the doctor ſhould be corrected, if he errs in any important point. For ſuch an error in <hi>him,</hi> will of courſe be more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fatal to mankind, than in another. If his own conviction of his miſtake would have been a ſufficient remedy of this evil, application would have been made to him only; but as the caſe ſtands, a public confutation ſeems neceſſary.</p>
            <p>THE doctor, without doubt, thought his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concluſive, and that he was doing ſervice to God and his church, in vindicating, in the beſt manner he could, what appeared to him important truth. And he may perhaps think, what is here offered to him and the public, is weak and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:010007_0012_0F7B9975536C0008"/>
If ſo, the author does not expect to be contemned or neglected; but that the doctor will be ſo juſt to himſelf, and good to the public, as fairly, and with chriſtian meekneſs to vindicate his ſcheme, from the exceptions here taken, and ſhew that they are indeed without foundation. If he ſhould be convinced that he has made a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, it is concluded, from his known diſpoſition to be frank and open, that he will freely confeſs it. However that may be, the author, at preſent, reſts in the goodneſs of his cauſe, and chearfully commits it to Him, who is able to plead it moſt effectually, in His own way and time.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>tenth</hi> ſection is more than was at firſt deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but finding that what was ſaid on the ſubject, would naturally lead to the queſtion there conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it being an important one, and one about which there is perhaps more enquiry and diſpute now, than ever there has been before, tho' little or nothing has been publiſhed upon it; it was thought beſt not wholly to paſs it in ſilence. The author is far from thinking the ſubject is exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or that it may not be ſet in a far more clear and convincing light. If any ſerious readers, who have been in any degree of darkneſs and uncertainty with reſpect to this queſtion, ſhall by what is there ſaid get any light: and if theſe hints ſhall be a help and excitement to any, who are making this the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their enquiry, to purſue the matter, ſo as to throw greater light upon it, the utmoſt that is expected will be anſwered. If the author has made any dangerous miſtake on this head, and it ſhall be pointed out by ſome wiſe, judicious pen, he will moſt gladly ſtand corrected before the world.</p>

                  <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 24.</note> This text has been differently underſtood. Some ſuppoſe that by the <hi>ſtrait gate</hi> is meant the entrance upon an holy life, or getting into the narrow way which leads to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life; which is the ſame that is commonly called converſion, or the new birth. And by ſtriving to enter in at this gate, they underſtand the exerciſes and endeavours of the unregenerate, which are antecedent to their converſion. But, few or none who underſtand the text thus, ſuppoſe there is any certain connection between the ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here exhorted to, and ſaving converſion, or that there is any promiſe made to this ſtriving.</p>
            <p>Others ſuppoſe that by the ſtrait gate our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our means, in general, the entrance into heaven or eternal life.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See Dr. Dedd. &amp; Poli Syn. On the text.</hi>
               </note> And then by ſtriving to enter in at this gate, is meant, a keeping the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

of God, or the holy exerciſes of true ſaints, by which they walk in the way to heaven; fight the fight of faith, and ſo lay hold on eternal life. And in ſupport of this laſt interpretation, and as an evidence that <hi>ſtriving</hi> in the text, does not mean the unholy exerciſes and endeavours of thoſe whoſe hearts are wholly under the dominion of ſin; but the holy exerciſes and ſtrivings of the godly, it may be obſerved, that the word in the original, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>ſtrive</hi> when uſed in other places in the new teſtament, as it is often, always denotes the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and labor of true chriſtians in their way to heaven. And no good reaſon perhaps can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why it ſhould not be underſtood in the ſame ſenſe here. When St. Paul ſays to Timothy, "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life," he ſpeaks to an eminently good man; and therefore it muſt be underſtood as an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſolutely to perſevere in a chriſtian courſe. But the word in the original here tranſlated <hi>fight</hi> is the ſame uſed by the evangeliſt in the text un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration.<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

                     </gap> ton kalon agona: Agonize the good agony.</hi> 4 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 12.</note> The ſame words St. Paul uſes concerning himſelf, to denote the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an courſe he had gone through. "I have ſought the good fight." And he makes uſe of the ſame word, in his firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians, with reference to the exerciſes of true chriſtians, by which they go in the way to heaven. "And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that <hi>ſtriveth</hi> for the maſtery, is temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things: Now they do it to obtain a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible crown, but we an incorruptible." And he denotes his own exerciſes as a ſervant of Chriſt
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010007_0015_0F7B9976F3B58898"/>
by the ſame word. "Whereunto I alſo labor, <hi>ſtriving</hi> according to his workings which he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me mightily."</p>
            <p>It may be noted here, that the word in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal in all theſe places, was moſt commonly uſed by the Greeks to denote the exerciſes and labor of thoſe, who were candidates for the prize ſet up in the Olympic games: for inſtance, the vigorous exertion of thoſe who ran a race, in order to obtain the prize ſet up for him who ſhould out-run. And as theſe games in which they ran for the prize, &amp;c. were a fit emblem of the exerciſes of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, it is frequently repreſented by them: and hence the word uſed for thoſe exerciſes, is applied to the chriſtiah, to ſignify the exerciſes and labor by which he ſtrives for eternal life. And the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courſe is called a race or <hi>agony,</hi> in alluſion to the ſame thing.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 1.—<hi>Let us run the</hi> race. <hi>In the original the</hi> agony. <hi>The race itself is callef the agony, the running is agonizing.</hi>
               </note> According to this, to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate of eternal life, or to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonize in order hereunto, is to agonize the good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, ſo as to lay hold on eternal life; to run the chriſtian race, the way of true holineſs, which is ſet before us: And is the ſame which Chriſt exhorts to, when he ſays, "Enter ve in at the ſtrait gate."<note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 14.</note> But let it be obſerved that the queſtion now in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute does not turn upon the interpretation of this text; for let it be underſtood in either of the ſenſes above-mentioned, it makes nothing for the doctor's promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let it be remembered, that if by the ſtrait gate is meant the gate of eternal life, as the doctor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010007_0016_0F7B9977AEDDB9F8"/>
it, ſtriving to enter in, muſt intend, a walking in the narrow way of holineſs; and then it ſtands directly againſt him. This leads me to conſider the doctor's interpretation.</p>
            <p>By the ſtrait gate, the doctor underſtands the gate of heaven, or "the gate of eternal lite and happineſs."<note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6, 7.</note> But contrary to moſt, if not all others, who ſuppoſe this to be the meaning of the ſtrait gate, and in direct contradiction to himſelf, as will be ſeen preſently, he underſtlands <hi>ſtriving</hi> to enter in at this gate, to mean the endeavours and doings of the unregenerate, who are wholly without all true holineſs. To theſe <hi>unholy</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and doings of the unregenerate, he inſiſts, the promiſes of regenerating grace and ſalvation are made; and by theſe, he ſuppoſes, however abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they go in the way to heaven, and enter in thro' the gates into that holy city.</p>
            <p>The doctor indeed ſuppoſes, that the words may be conſidered as a precept given "both to thoſe who are, and who are not already in a regenerate ſtate."<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6.</note> If ſo, then they are a command which enjoins both the unholy endeavours of the wicked, and the godly exerciſes of the true chriſtian. The doctor's argument for this is in the following words. <q>For be they. in that happy eſtate or not, ſtill they ought to uſe their utmoſt diligence to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſalvation revealed in the goſpel; or, which is the ſame thing, to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</q> It is true that all <hi>ought</hi> to enter in at the ſtrait gate (taking the gate in the doctor's ſenſe of it) and in order to this, they <hi>ought</hi> to be real chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010007_0017_0F7B99787047ECA0"/>
and to live an holy life. And in this view, the command to enter in at this gate is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined upon all, whether regenerate or not; as all are under indiſpenſible obligations to ſtrive in this manner, in the exerciſe of true holineſs. If the precept to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, enjoins on chriſtians earneſtly to ſeek eternal life in the way of true holineſs, or in keeping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God; then it enjoins the <hi>ſame</hi> on wicked men, and points out the <hi>very ſame</hi> way for them to obtain eternal life in, as for true ſaints, and not <hi>another</hi> and quite different one; as it muſt do, if it only requires of them thoſe doings which have nothing of the nature of true holineſs, and are therefore different in nature and kind from what the true chriſtian is directed to; they having no more likeneſs, relation and connection, than god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ungodlineſs. If, on the other hand, when wicked men are commanded to enter in at the ſtrait gate of eternal life, no more is intended than what they may do, and yet be unholy in heart and life; then no more is intended by the ſame command to the regenerate; for doubtleſs the command requires the ſame thing of one as of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and if ſo, they may enter into eternal life without any true holineſs; for the command to <hi>enter in,</hi> ſurely requires all that is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to enter in. But none, I truſt, will aſſert that the unholy and unclean can, while ſuch, enter in through the gates into the heavenly city.</p>
            <p>The doctor repeatedly ſays, there is <hi>but one</hi> way of life and ſalvation; and challenges any one, who ſhall ſay there are two, or more, to point them out, and ſhew the difference there is betwixt them;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010007_0018_0F7B997A5ADC7700"/>
and yet that both are true and right, the ways of God's revealing.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 13, 14.</note> It ſeems the doctor himſelf is the man, who has found out <hi>two</hi> ways to life and ſalvation, viz. the way of the unholy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and the way of true virtue and holineſs, in which they go who turn their feet unto God's te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies. But what's moſt remarkable is, that he inſiſts upon it, that theſe two different ways are point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and enjoined by one and the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And now we muſt wait on him to ſhew the difference, and tell what the command enjoins on one, which it does not on the other.</p>
            <p>BUT if We attend to the doctor's deſcription of ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate; we ſhall find that it is not only inconſiſtent with its intending only the endeavours of the unregenerate (which it muſt, if the words were to his purpoſe) but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not conſiſtent with their being at all intended or included in this ſtriving; it being, according to him, only applicable to the exerciſes and doings of real chriſtians. When the doctor was giving this deſcription, he ſeems to have in a meaſure forgot the point he chiefly contends for, and gives ſuch an account of <hi>ſtriving,</hi> &amp;c. as is by no means com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible to the unregenerate; and ſo really inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what he was about to prove. The read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt judge of the juſtice of this remark, when he has attended to what follows.</p>
            <p>To <hi>ſtrive</hi> to enter in at the ſtralt gate, is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the doctor, to go in the narrow way which leadeth to life; and is oppoſed to the broad way leading to deſtruction. For he ſays, <q>If we are not in the narrow way, we are of conſequence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010007_0019_0F7B997AE385B060"/>
travelling towards the wide gate of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               <note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 35.</note> But this <hi>narrow way</hi> is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the way of holineſs, if any ſuch way is ſpoken of in holy ſcripture; the way of God's commands, in diſtinction from all the <hi>crooked</hi> ways of ſinners, the way of the upright, who keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and ſo enter in through the gates into life.</p>
            <p>As all men are in ſcripture comprehended in two oppoſite characters, between which there is no medium, viz. the good and the evil, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the ungodly; the children of God, and the children of the devil, &amp;c. ſo there are but two different and oppoſite ways ſpoken of in which they are going, viz, "the way of the righteous, and the way of the ungodly:"<note n="(k)" place="bottom">

to life, is not the way of true holineſs; but the way in which the unregenerate, the unholy and ungodly walk!</p>

To take Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for our guide, is to ſubmit to him and truſt in him in his character of a teacher or prophet; which ſuppoſes a heart friendly to Chriſt, and is really an hearty embracing the goſpel. For he who heartily ſubmits to, and truſts in, Chriſt, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially acknowledges him in any part of his true character, is really reconciled to the whole of it: And this is the ſame thing with being reconciled to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt, or embracing the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.

            <p>Another paſſage of the doctor's is in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words. <q>Our Saviour, who certainly knew every thing relating to this affair, enjoins us to <hi>ſtrive</hi>; or, if the word may be allowed, <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonize,</hi> that we may enter into life: plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that the buſineſs of religion is at once of ſuch vaſt importance, and attended with ſuch difficulties, as to call for the moſt anxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the moſt fixed reſolutions, and unwearied endeavours. And there are divers metaphors uſed in ſcripture, relative to this matter, which naturally ſuggeſt the ſame thing to us: Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of <hi>wreſtling, running,</hi> and <hi>fighting</hi>; which expreſs efforts of ſtrength and activity, joined with warineſs and circumſpection. <hi>Theſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010007_0023_0F7B998013EC9DD0"/>
are all applied to the exerciſes, duties and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of</hi> THE CHRISTIAN LIFE.</q>

                  </gap>, 33.</note> What could he have ſaid more to the purpoſe, if he had undertaken to prove that ſriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate intends not the doings of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the exerciſes and work of the real chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? He has, at leaſt, ſtrongly aſſerted this here, however inconſiſtent with his main deſign. If the doctor had been as ſenſible of this, as perhaps he ought, he could have proceeded no further; as he muſt have ſeen the impropriety of applying that <hi>ſtriving,</hi> &amp;c. to the doings of the unregenerate, which, according to his own account of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, denotes the character and exerciſes of thoſe only who are born of God.</p>
            <p>He appears indeed not wholly unthoughtful of this matter: for upon a review of his deſcription of ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate, he has theſe words, <q>If it ſhould be aſked, whether any unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſinner can be ſuppoſed to ſtrive <hi>in the manner repreſented above</hi>? I anſwer, YES; at leaſt in general. There is <hi>very little,</hi> if <hi>any thing</hi> in this account of ſtriving, &amp;c. which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſe a perſon to be already born of the Spirit of God.</q>
               <note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P,</hi> 21.</note> And again he ſays, <q>Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>one or two expreſſion</hi> uſed in that deſcription, are in ſtrictneſs applicable to the regenerate only; <hi>tho' I am not at preſent ſenſible of</hi> ANY SUCH</q>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 47, <hi>margin.</hi>
               </note> It ſeems to be a pity, as well as ſomewhat ſtrange, that he was not ſenſible, that not only <hi>one or two expreſſions,</hi> but a conſiderable number, are applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only to the endeavours of the regenerate; and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010007_0024_0F7B9980E1588790"/>
that his <hi>whole deſcription,</hi> taken together, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applicable to none but ſuch: For this would moſt probably have undeceived him with reſpect to this whole affair. For, I truſt, it will appear in the ſequel, that the doctor has thro' his whole performance exalted the unregenerate and their doings too high; and in order to ſupport what he contends for, has repreſented them as having thoſe exerciſes which indeed they never have, but are peculiar to the regenerate: and that moſt of his arguments take all their ſeeming ſtrength and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs from this.</p>
            <p>But what if "<hi>very little,</hi>" and but <q>one or two expreſſions uſed in that deſcription, are in ſtrictneſs applicable to the regenerate only?</q> This is certainly a <hi>little too much</hi>; and renders him ſo far inconſiſtent with himſelf; which no man chooſes to be, if he can help it. For he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that not to ſtrive in the manner he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, is fatal, and connected with a being for ever excluded the kingdom of heaven. By which he has at one ſtroke cut off all connection of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the unregenerate with ſalvation, and landed them in deſpair. Which connection he nevertheleſs thinks he has proved to a demonſtration! His words are theſe. <q>I was in the next place to ſhew you the fatal conſequences of not ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate: Or, in other words, of not uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your endeavours to obtain eternal life, <hi>in the manner repreſented above.</hi>

REPRESENTED ABOVE; and if <hi>any thing</hi> comes into the deſcription of that ſtriving, which no unregenerate perſons attain to, but is peculiar to the regenerate; then the unregenerate do not ſtrive, or uſe their endeavours to obtain eternal life, <hi>in that manner</hi>: and conſequently do nothing which will prevent theſe fatal conſequences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them; and therefore nothing which has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certain connection with eternal life, but rather with everlaſting deſtruction. So that if the doctor has, after all this, proved that, any of the endeavours of the unregenerate are connected with eternal life, he has done it contrary to his own expreſs aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if but <hi>very little</hi> that is peculiar to the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate comes into the manner of the endeavours to obtain ſalvation which he has deſcribed. But if <hi>very much</hi> which comes into his account of ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter in at the ſtrait gate, neceſſarily ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a perſon to be born of the ſpirit of God, which, I truſt, appears beyond contradiction, this makes, his inconſiſtence with himſelf ſtill more glaring.</p>
            <p>However, tho' the doctor's text, as he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it, ſeems to be rather againſt him; and his own deſcription of ſtriving, &amp;c. is inconſiſtent with his whole ſcheme: and is, the whole taken together, in direct contradiction to the point he endeavours by <hi>fourteen</hi> arguments to prove: yet, if he has, after all this, rightly ſtated, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably proved it, we muſt yield it to him, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inconſiſtent he is with himſelf.</p>
            <p>I therefore now proceed to enquire into this matter.</p>

            <head>SECTION II. <hi>THE Dotor's ſtating the queſtion examined.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE doctor ſtates the queſtion in diſpute three different times, in different words: But it may be queried, Whether he has ſtated it properly, or in any degree right, in either of his attempts? He firſt puts it in the following words, <q>Whether there are in the word of God, any gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, invitations, or declarations, reſpecting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from whence it may be clearly inferred, that if they ſtrive IN THE MANNER THEY MAY AND OUGHT TO DO, to attain to holineſs and eternal life, God will certainly afford them all the influences of his ſpirit and grace, which are neceſſary to that end: ſo that their endeavours ſhall not be in vain, but ſucceeded by him, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd effectual to their ſalvation?</q> "This," the doctor ſays, <q>it is humbly conceived, is a fair, juſt and plain ſtate of the important queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</q>
               <note n="(m)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 15.</note> Doubtleſs he thought ſo. But, what does he mean by unregenerate ſinners ſtriving <hi>in the manner they may and ought to do?</hi> They <hi>ought</hi> to ſtrive as true ſaints do; in a holy manner. This the doctor himſelf acknowledges; for he ſays,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010007_0027_0F7B9982F3379668"/>
               <q>That all who hear the goſpel, are <hi>required,</hi> not only to believe it, but to <hi>repent of their ſins,</hi> and to become the <hi>true diſciples</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt</q>
               <note n="(n)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 66.</note> If they are <hi>required</hi> to repent, &amp;c. then they may and ought to repent, and become <hi>true diſciples</hi> of Chriſt; and therefore <hi>may and ought</hi> to ſtrive in the <hi>exerciſe of true repentance,</hi> and as real chriſtians. And if ſo, then the queſtion, as the doctor has put it, comes to this: <hi>Whether, if unregenerate ſinners become true penitents and real chriſtians, and as ſuch, in the exerciſe of true faith and holineſs, ſtrive to obtain the ſalvation of their ſouls, they are hereby intitled to a divine promiſe of ſucceſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The queſtion therefore, as the doctor has ſtated it, is not diſputed by thoſe whom he means to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For they all allow, that if unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſtrive as they may and ought to do, they ſhall <hi>certainly</hi> obtain ſalvation. But at the ſame time they may and ought to ſtrive in a right manner, i. e. as real penitents and true chriſtians: and the doctor is ſo happy as to agree with them in this too. Where is the diſpute then? We can have none with him on this queſtion; for we hold the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative as fully as he can. And now, Whether this is a "fair, juſt and plain ſtate of the important queſtion propoſed," let the impartial judge. The doctor knew, or ought to have known, that they whom he meant to oppoſe, hold that no unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinner ſtrives for ſalvation as he may and ought to do: and if he had believed the contrary, he ought not to take it for granted, in ſtating the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be diſputed: for this, inſtead of putting
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010007_0028_0F7B99840584E338"/>
the queſtion in a <hi>fair, juſt</hi> and <hi>plain light</hi> is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>begging the queſtion.</hi> But as he does not himſelf believe that unregenerate ſinners ever ſtrive thus, but has affirmed they do not, this his ſtate of the queſtion, is not only, not fair, or juſt, but ſome what ſurprizing.</p>
            <p>The queſtion really is, whether unregenerate ſinners while they do nothing but what is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with a ſtate of unregeneracy, <hi>i. e.</hi> reigning wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of heart, do ever ſo ſtrive for ſalvation, as tnat by their <hi>thus ſtriving,</hi> they are intitled to thoſe gracious promiſes, whereby God is engaged to beſtow eternal life upon them?</p>
            <p>BUT let us ſee if the doctor has ſucceeded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his <hi>ſecond attempt.</hi> This is in the following words. <q>Whether the gracious declarations and promiſes of God in his word, are ſuch as will in any meaſure admit of the ſuppoſition, that unregenerate ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preached, may <hi>deſire,</hi> ſtrive, and earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, in the uſe of proper means, to obtain the ſalvation revealed therein, ſeeking to God for his Grace and aſſiſtance; and yet poſſibly fall ſhort of eternal life, and periſh in their ſins, by reaſon that God withholds his ſpirit and grace from them?</q> He thinks, "the queſtion thus ſtated, comes preciſely to the ſame thing as in the former way." Perhaps it does. But if ſo, then the matter is not mended; and the queſtion is ſtill far from being rightly ſtated, as has been ſhewn. All the difficulty in this ſtate of the queſtion lies in the word DESIRE. If he uſes this word in the ſenſe in which it is commonly uſed, we ſhall
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010007_0029_0F7B998487DCCD58"/>
all agree with him and allow, that the gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and promiſes of God in his word, are ſuch as will not admit of the ſuppoſition, that they who <hi>deſire the ſalvation revealed in the goſpel,</hi> can poſſibly fall ſhort of eternal life. This therefore is not the queſtion in diſpute. The promiſes of the goſpel are beyond queſtion made to all who <hi>heartily deſire</hi> the things promiſed. But then we aſſert that no unregenerate perſon does really and heartily deſire theſe things. But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The dodtor goes on to ſay, <q>It may be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another form, and ſtill narrower compaſs thus, viz. Whether unregenerate ſinners, under the diſpenſation of the goſpel, have <hi>any</hi> day of grace and ſalvation afforded them; in ſuch a ſenſe, that they ſhall certainly obtain eternal life, provided <hi>they heartily deſire it,</hi> and ſtrive to that end.</q> Still we are all agreed, none, I truſt will deny this.</p>
            <p>He ſays, <q>He has expreſſed the <hi>true point in queſtion,</hi> in theſe <hi>ſeveral ways,</hi> not meerly for the ſake of having it underſtood; but partly, becauſe he ſuppoſed, that the bare ſtating it <hi>thus,</hi> would go a conſiderable ways towards a proper reſolution of it, with thoſe who are tolerably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the general tenor of the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; unleſs their minds are unhappily prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in favor of ſome unſcriptural ſcheme of ſyſtematical divinity.</q> If he has indeed expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>true point in queſtion,</hi> it appears to be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved, from what has been obſerved: For no body ſeems to have any diſpute with him. But that he ſhould imagine this to be the <hi>true point in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010007_0030_0F7B99854538B350"/>
queſtion</hi>; and that what he here fixes upon as the condition of the promiſes of the goſpel, is ever come up to by unregenerate ſinners, muſt, I think, be owing to his not being tolerably acquainted with the general tenor of holy ſcripture: unleſs perhaps his mind is unhappily prepoſſeſſed in favor of ſome <hi>unſcriptural</hi> ſcheme of <hi>UNſyſtematical</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. But this will be more particularly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by and by.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that the whole matter in diſpute is in the doctor's way of ſtating the queſtion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, or rather taken for granted; for if unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinners ever actually do what he ſuppoſes they muſt do in order to have an intereſt in the promiſes, without queſtion promiſes of ſalvation as made to their doings. But that unregenerate men ever do thus, lies on the doctor to prove, which he has not ſo much as attempted any where; but as he has taken it for granted in ſtating the queſtion, he has done ſo thro' his whole performance, and from beginning to end, intirely miſ-ſtated the matter, and really begged the whole queſtion in diſpute.</p>
            <p>I will now take leave to give what appears to me to be a fair, juſt and plain ſtate of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant queſtion before us.</p>
            <p>QUEST. Are there any gracious promiſes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the exerciſes and doings of unregenerate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who do not ſtrive for ſalvation as they ought to do; who have no true and hearty deſires of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered in the goſpel; but are ſo far from it, that they are under the reigning power of enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and the Saviour, and do with their whole heart oppoſe the way of ſalvation opened in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010007_0031_0F7B9985EFE91F18"/>
goſpel; and continually reject the ſalvation it ſelf, and obſtinately refuſe to have any part therein, notwithſtanding it is freely offered to their choice and acceptance? The bare ſtating the queſtion thus, I ſuppoſe, will go a conſiderable ways to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a proper reſolution of it, even with all. The doctor himſelf, I preſume, will fully and chearfully eſpouſe the negative of this queſtion, thus ſtated. But then he may perhaps complain, that the true point in queſtion is not expreſſed, or at leaſt is not fairly ſtated; becauſe the exerciſes and doings of unregenerate ſinners are not juſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and that is taken for granted in this ſtate of the caſe, which he ſhall diſpute, and really is the only thing in queſtion. But would not ſuch a complaint be really againſt himſelf, while the ſame objection lies againſt his own ſtate of the queſtion? I ſay, the doctor has raiſed the unregenerate man too high, and repreſented him as doing mote than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he does. On the other hand he ſays, I ſink him too low, and repreſent all his exerciſes and doings in much too bad a light. Who does not ſee that I have as good a right to take for granted what I aſſert of the doings of the unregenerate man, as he has, what he has aſſerted? All muſt ſee, I think, by this time, that in order to underſtand and ſettle the queſtion before us, it muſt be firſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, what can be juſtly predicated of the doings of unregenerate ſinners: and that a juſt reſolution of this will put an end to the diſpute. If it can be proved that the doctor's unregenerate ſinner is a creature only of his own fancy; a kind of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; an enemy to God, dreſſed up in the attire of a ſaint, a contradiction almoſt in terms: then all he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010007_0032_0F7B9988571DF030"/>
has ſaid, and attempted to prove of ſuch an one, is really nothing to the purpoſe. Here then we muſt join iſſue, and leave it to the world to judge, who, is on the right ſide of the queſtion.</p>

            <p>THE doctor often ſpeaks of ſinners <hi>deſiring ſalvation.</hi> With relation to this, he uſes the word DESIRE above thirty times in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He calls it a <hi>ſincere</hi> deſire, a <hi>real</hi> and a <hi>hearty</hi> deſire. This is a word of great importance with him. According to him, they who do not heartily and earneſtly <hi>deſire</hi> ſalvation, do not ſtrive for it ſo as to obtain, and ſo are not in the way to it.<note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 12.</note> And on the other hand, he often ſpeaks of this <hi>deſire</hi> of ſalvation, as that which will not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of ſucceſs: as if it was the only neceſſary condition on the ſinner's part, to which all the promiſes in the goſpel are made. And moſt of his arguments derive all their force and ſtrength from this word. 'Tis proper therefore in the firſt place
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010007_0033_0F7B998922F50D08"/>
particularly to attend to this, and enter into the true meaning of it; otherwiſe we may diſpute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in the dark.</p>
            <p>Since the doctor makes ſo much of this word, and ſpeaks ſo often of an <hi>hearty deſire of ſalvation,</hi> and builds ſo much upon it; it might have been expected that he would have given ſuch a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of this phraſe, and ſo explained the matter, that none could be left at a loſs about his meaning. But this he has not done; we muſt therefore find out his meaning as well as we can, by conſidering the various paſſages in which he uſes theſe words, together with what they are connected. It is plain at firſt view, that he means to ſpeak of the <hi>deſires</hi> of unregenerate perſons; but the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he means only thoſe deſires of ſalvation, which are indeed compatible to an unregenerate man; or ſomething which is never found with ſuch, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may ſuppoſe it; but is peculiar to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate?</p>
            <p>By deſiring ſalvation, or eternal life, he evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means the ſame with <hi>chooſing</hi> it, in the ſame ſenſe in which the people of Iſrael were exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>chooſe life.</hi>

Ye <hi>will not</hi> come unto me, that ye might have life. O Jeruſalem—how often would I have gathered thy children—and ye <hi>would</hi> not, &amp;c." And then ſays, <q>Theſe, with innumerable other paſſages of ſcripture, moſt clearly and ſtrongly expreſs this ſentiment; That the true and only reaſon why ſinners periſh, is,—that they <hi>neglect</hi> the great ſalvation offered to them; and <hi>will not</hi> come to Jeſus Chriſt for life. But neither of theſe things can be truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of thoſe perſons, who are awakened to ſuch a ſenſe of their ſins, as <hi>really to deſire</hi> the ſalvation revealed, and to ſtrive in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</q> From theſe, and other paſſages of the ſame import, I think it plainly appears, that by a <hi>real deſire of ſalvation,</hi> he means a hearty choice of life, a true acceptance of ſalvation, and coming to Chriſt for life, or a taking and accepting of the good things freely offered in the goſpel. He has therefore ſet himſelf an eaſy taſk, while he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to prove, that they who thus deſire ſalvation,

But that the unregenerate ever did, or ever will, thus deſire, chooſe, and accept of this ſalvation, and come to Chriſt for it, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by thoſe whom the doctor means to oppoſe: And what is more, is in the ſtrongeſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms denied by our Saviour himſelf. He ſays, "No man <hi>can come unto me, except the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath ſent me, draw him.—Every man, therefore that hath heard, and learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cometh unto me.</hi>"<note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">

            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:010007_0036_0F7B998BD44671E8"/>THE doctor allows that unregenerate perſons are not <hi>true believers</hi> or <hi>real chriſtian</hi>; and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all real holineſs.<note n="(u)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 42, 43.</note> Conſequently they do not love, chooſe or deſire holineſs: but this is the object of their greateſt and peculiar averſion. Therefore the ſalvation offered in the goſpel, which is in a peculiar ſenſe an <hi>holy</hi> ſalvation and conſiſts ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in true holineſs, they are ſo far from <hi>deſiring,</hi> that nothing elſe is hated and rejected by them, with ſuch conſtancy, and ſo much with their whole heart, as this. And this is the only thing that keeps them from an intereſt in this ſalvation; as who ever is willing to take it as 'tis offered, has it: and it is certainly beſtowed <hi>on every one who deſires and</hi> chooſes it, ſo aſks for it; which is the ſame with coming to Chriſt for life.</p>
            <p>UNREGENERATE ſinners may, while they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſuch, in ſome ſenſe deſire ſalvation. They may deſire deliverance from natural evil, between which and ſalvation there is no medium: and they may deſire ſafety and happineſs, under a conviction of conſcience, that it is to be had in no other way but by ſharing in the ſalvation which is by Jeſus Chriſt. Such a deſire as this every perſon under the goſpel has, in ſome degree, who has any belief of the truth of divine revelation: And theſe deſires are ſtrong, and influence the conduct of men, in proportion to their attention to theſe things, and their apprehention and ſenſe of the importance of them to themſelves. But this is conſiſtent with their hating the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the only Saviour, and the ſalvation which
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010007_0037_0F7C229F1A80DDC8"/>
he offers freely for their acceptance; and their continuing to reject it with their whole hearts. It is but to delude ſinners, to repreſent to them, that their concern and deſires of this kind, are the leaſt evidence that their hearts are a whit the nearer a true ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, or a real acceptance of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as offered by him; or that there is the leſs oppoſition to the goſpel in their hearts. If the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by his DESIRES of ſalvation, means ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires as theſe, which moſt men under the goſpel have in a greater or leſs degree, and had explained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, moſt of his arguments would appear in their true weakneſs, to every one at firſt view. But theſe are not truely and properly deſires of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered in the goſpel, according to the moſt common and natural meaning of the word: becauſe that ſalvation is not properly the object of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but ſomething elſe; yea, ſalvation as it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered is not deſired, but rejected. If any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular gift or priviledge is offered to a perſon, and nothing required as the condition of his having it, but his hearty acceptance of it; he cannot be ſaid to deſire it according to the ſenſe in which the word is generally uſed, if the gift offered is in itſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſirable to him, or if, all things conſidered, he is not willing to have it, and refuſes to take it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exerciſed he may be about the matter, and whatever pains he may take with relation to it.</p>
            <p>The ſalvation revealed in the goſpel, is offered freely to the acceptance of all; the proclamation is, "Whoſoever <hi>will,</hi> let him come and take it." And they who diſlike and reject this ſalvation, and the Saviour himſelf by whom it is offered, and are, on the whole, all things conſidered, <hi>unwilling</hi> to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010007_0038_0F7B998C63FCE7E8"/>
be ſaved by him, cannot be properly ſaid to <hi>deſire</hi> this ſalvation; but it may truly be ſaid that they <hi>do not deſire</hi> to be ſaved by Chriſt. The words of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah are very applicable to ſuch; and of ſuch he doubtleſs ſpeaks, when he ſays, "When we ſhall ſee him (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Meſſiah) there is no beauty that we ſhould <hi>deſire</hi> him. He is deſpiſed and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of men.<note n="(x)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> liii. 2, 3.</note> Deſpiſing and rejecting any object, is ſurely inconſiſtent with, and in direct oppoſition to <hi>deſiring</hi> it. Therefore there is not one inſtance in ſcripture of any perſon's being ſpoken of as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring ſalvation,</hi> who was not heartily willing to accept of it as it is offered; but ſuch are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>not deſiring it.</hi> If therefore the doctor uſes this word in a ſenſe directly contrary to that in which it is uſed in holy ſcripture, and in common ſpeech; and ſo in a very ſtrange and improper ſenſe, it might reaſonably have been expected that he would give notice of it, and ſo explain himſelf, as to prevent miſtake and deluſion in this matter, in which miſtakes are ſo eaſily and ſo often made, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by the inattentive and unwary. But as it is evident from what has been taken notice of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that he, at leaſt ſome times, means ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by his deſires of ſalvation, I proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p>Men may moſt properly be ſaid really and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to deſire ſalvation, when the ſalvation itſelf is the object of their deſires, the good things in which it conſiſts being what they are pleaſed with, and chooſe for their own ſake; and this implies an hearty approbation of the character of the Saviour,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010007_0039_0F7B998D2A9CAD18"/>
and the way of ſalvation by him. They who have ſuch a deſire of ſalvation as this do truely chooſe life, and may properly be ſaid to accept of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to <hi>receive</hi> Jeſus Chriſt and come to him for life, or believe on his name. The doctor ſeems to mean ſuch kind of deſires as theſe, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of ſalvation he ſpeaks ſo much of, as has been ſhewn. It is quoted, as has been before obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that to ſuch deſires as theſe the promiſes of the goſpel are made; therefore they who thus deſire ſalvation ſhall not fail of it. But ſuch deſires as theſe are holy deſires; and therefore are found no where but in a regenerate heart. The love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is it ſelf an exerciſe of holineſs: but an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deſire of holineſs for its own ſake, implies and is indeed itſelf, an exerciſe of love to holineſs. Now to deſire ſalvation for its own ſake, becauſe 'tis what it is, is to deſire holineſs for its own ſake: for holineſs comes into the very eſſence of this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And that approbation of the character of the Saviour, which is implied in true deſires of ſalvation by him, alſo implies love to him, and conſequently is an exerciſe of love to holineſs: for holineſs is an eſſential, and the moſt important part of the character of the Saviour, without which he could not be the Saviour of ſinners.</p>
            <p>The ſalvation which the goſpel reveals, the way in which it is beſtowed, and the Saviour himſelf, are if I may ſo ſpeak, ſo cloathed with holineſs, and ſuch a bright expreſſion of it, which is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excellency and glory of the goſpel, that the unholy are ſet at the greateſt diſtance from theſe things; and men never will deſire and chooſe them untill they have a heart friendly to holineſs, which is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010007_0040_0F7B998D6EA10EB8"/>
the <hi>new heart</hi> given in regeneration. If the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate have an heart to deſire and chooſe the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered in the goſpel, in the ſenſe now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, it will be difficult to ſhew what need they ſtand in of regeneration in order to be ſaved, or to tell what regeneration conſiſts in. For if men have an heart to deſire and chooſe holineſs for holineſs ſake, and ſo to delight in it, as they muſt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deſire and chooſe the ſalvation offered in the goſpel, and come to Chriſt, they have no need of a <hi>new heart</hi> in order to be holy, and happy in God and the Saviour: this ſame principle from whence ſuch deſires flow being perfected, they will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly united to the Saviour, and compleatly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſin and miſery, and in full poſſeſſion of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The need men ſtand in therefore of being regenerated, or of having a new heart given them, is a demonſtration that the unregenerate have no ſuch deſires.</p>
            <p>And this is agreeable to the whole current of ſcripture repreſentation, as might be eaſily ſhewn, was there need of it. The ſcripture ranks all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in two claſſes. Thoſe that love God and his ways, who know and chooſe the things that are excellent; and thoſe the language of whoſe hearts to God is, "depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways;" who are enemies to the juſt God and Saviour, and neglect and refuſe the ſalvation offered. Of theſe, ſome may be more concerned about themſelves than others, and ſo have more exerciſes, and take more pains to eſcape eternal miſery; but ſtill their hearts are as oppoſite to reconciliation with God, and to the ſalvation offered as ever; they have ſtill an heart of ſtone,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010007_0041_0F7B9990E8339870"/>
a ſtubborn rebellious heart, and are dead in teſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſins, untill they have a new heart given them, and they are quickened by regeneration.</p>
            <p>If the doctor will ſhew from ſcripture, that there are ſome perſons who are neither dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, nor alive to God; who are neither enemies to God and the Saviour, nor his friends and reconciled to him: or if he will tell what need they ſtand in of regeneration, who have theſe hearty deſires of ſalvation, which are inconſiſtent with a hard heart, a neglecting the great ſalvation offered them, and a refuſing to come to Chriſt for life, and will plainly ſhew what ſuch a regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts in, he will doubtleſs greatly oblige the chriſtian world. But till this is done, we muſt take leave to conclude, that the deſires of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate he ſpeaks of, and the regeneration of thoſe who firſt have theſe deſires, are a figment of his own.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WHAT the doctor, undertakes to ſupport is, that the endeavours and ſtriving of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate</hi> hare a promiſe of ſucceſfs; and ſo are
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010007_0042_0F7B9991B40F6C50"/>
certainly connected with ſalvation. This he attempts to prove by <hi>fourteen</hi> arguments. It appears at firſt view they are not wanting in number: the weight and ſtrength of them is now to be inquired into. At leaſt <hi>nine</hi> of theſe fourteen have all their ſtrength in the words DESIRE of ſalvation, or words to the like purpoſe; in which the unregenerate ſinner is ſuppoſed to have ſuch a <hi>deſire of ſalvation</hi> which implies a real <hi>choice</hi> of it as it is offered; and a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acceptance of it, and coming to Chriſt for it. Now as this ſuppoſition is intirely groundleſs and contrary to the truth, as has been ſhewn in the laſt ſection, all thoſe arguments, which are built wholly upon it, are demoliſhed and fall of courſe. But that this may clearly appear, we will briefly conſider each of them.</p>
            <p>ARG. 1ſt <q>Mankind being conſidered in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as in a ſtate of ſin and death, it is declared that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave them: to <hi>ſave ſinners</hi>; to <hi>ſeck and</hi> to <hi>ſave that which was loſt.</hi>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 47.</note> The doctor, proceeds, to illuſtrate this by ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture, and then adds, <q>Now, from ſuch declarations of holy ſcripture, we may fairly infer that all thoſe to whom the goſpel is preached, have therein an offer of ſalvation made to them. And if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally makes an offer, or points out a method of ſalvation to all; can it be ſuppoſed, that any ſinner WHO IS WILLING AND DESIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS, and ſtrives, to obtain the ſalvation thus revealed, ſhould yet be rejected of God and finally periſh? Certainly it cannot.</q>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010007_0043_0F7B999283CE6938"/>
whole of this is granted. But what does it prove? that ſalvation is offered to the acceptance of all: and therefore whoever is ſo "deſirous" to obtain the ſalvation thus revealed as to "be willing," to have it, and heartily accept of it, ſhall not be rejected. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more certain <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> But what is this to an unregenerate ſinner who <hi>will not</hi> come to Chriſt for life, and continues to make light of, and reject, the ſalvation offered to him?</p>
            <p>ARG. 2d. <q>God hath declared in the moſt ſolemn manner that he hath no pleaſure in the death of ſinners.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ezek</hi> xxxiii 11.</note> Yea, it is declared, that God <hi>will have all men to be ſaved.</hi> Now if what theſe declarations moſt obviouſly and ſtrongly import, be true: ſurely all who REALLY DESIRE and ſtrive to obtain eternal life, will certainly obtain it. For if God himſelf hath no pleaſure in their death, but the contrary; and if they themſelves <hi>deſire life</hi> and endeavour to obtain it, what ſhould hinder their ſalvation?

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:010007_0044_0F7B9992B4718598"/>ARG. 3d. <q>According to the repreſentation of ſcripture, God affords to ſinners a ſpace for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, a day of grace and ſalvation: or a ſeaſon for making their peace with him; during which time, he is <hi>ſaid</hi> to be near, ſo that he <hi>may be found</hi> by them that ſeek him. Yea, God is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as longſuffering towards them, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that they ſhould periſh.</q> Having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a unmber of texts to this purpoſe, he ſays. <q>Now, is it conſiſtent with theſe repeated decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to ſuppoſe that ſinners during the time of their viſitation, may REALLY DESIRE and ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; and yet fall ſhort of ſalvation?</q>
               <note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 50.</note> All true yet, if <hi>really deſiring</hi> and ſtriving imply a hearty acceptance of offered mercy: But nothing to the purpoſe. The unregenerate ſinner, whoſe heart is as hard as a ſtone, who refuſes to repent, and embrace the goſpel, is left out of theſe queſtion, and may periſh notwithſtanding all theſe declarations. The following words, upon this argument are perhaps worthy a tranſcription. <q>If God is longſuffering, <hi>not willing that any</hi> of thoſe ſinners, to whom the goſpel is preached, ſhould periſh, but that <hi>all</hi> ſhould come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; certainly he puts them all into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for attaining ſalvation.</q> If he means, they may be ſaved <hi>if they will</hi>; or that nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſalvation but the want of their good will in the caſe, as 'tis preſumed he does, his argument is acknowledged to be juſt: But he goes en to ſay, <q>To ſuppoſe that any are left in ſuch a ſtate, <hi>that they cannot avoid periſhing, tho' they deſire it</hi>:
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010007_0045_0F7B9993A051D978"/>
or in ſuch a ſtate as renders repentance <hi>impoſſible</hi> for them; manifeſtly ſuppoſes, that God <hi>wills them to periſh,</hi> that he <hi>would not</hi> have them come to repentance; nor really allows them a ſpace for it in any proper ſenſe: and ſo is directly contrary to the doctrine of ſcripture.</q> All may be ſaved who truly deſire it, and repentance is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to none who are willing to repent. But if the unregenerate, do always refuſe to repent, there being no difficulty in the way of their repentance and ſalvation, but the obſtinacy of their own will, what is all this to the doctors purpoſe? In this paſſage the doctor fully ſhews that by deſiring ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he intends the ſinners good will in the caſe; and ſuppoſes that the unregenerate may be ſo well diſpoſed towards repentance and ſalvation as that if they periſh, it muſt be owing, not to any deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their hearts but to ſome fatal difficulty which God has laid in their way which it is impoſſible their good will ſhould remove. He adds,—<q>But let the unbiaſſed judge.</q> And ſo ſay I.—let them judge, whether the doctor had any reaſon to make ſuch a repreſentation as this: or whether it is any thing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>ARG. 4th. <q>It is further to be remarked, that during this ſpace given for repentance, or that day of ſalvation, which the ſcriptures ſo plainly aſſert: ſinners are earneſtly admoniſhed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and commanded, to ſeek God, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him, and to work out their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q>

            <p>ARG. 6th. <q>The ſcripture ſpeaks of ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as wholly left, and forſaken of God, in this world; given up to their own hearts lufts, to incurable blindneſs, to ſtrong deluſion, &amp;c. that they <hi>might be damned.</hi> Now if there is any ſuch thing as ſuch like paſſges of ſcripture ſeem to aſſert; and as they are uſually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; it will even from hence follow, that the perſons thus given up of God, were, antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereto, in a ſalvable ſtate; that they had in ſome meaſure the reſtraints and ſtrivings of God's ſpirit; that they were really put into a capacity for obtaining ſalvation, HAD THEY DESIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EDIT; and that <hi>their not doing ſo,</hi> was the reaſon of their being thus forſaken.</q>

            <p>It is ſufficient to obſerve upon all this, that there is no advance made by this argument, it being the <hi>ſame</hi> with the foregoing, only in a little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent words. All that the doctor attempts to prove here is, that if the ſinner under the goſpel is not ſaved, but is given up to ruin, it is becauſe he does not deſire and chooſe ſalvation when offered to him, but neglects and refuſes it. But how does this help the unregenerate, who always do this?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:010007_0048_0F7B9995B1BC9310"/>ARG. 7th. <q>The ſcriptures ſpeak plainly and directly of ſinners neglecting the opportunity allowed them for obtaining life, as the real cauſe of their death or deſtruction.</q> Hence he inferrs in alluſion to the ſcriptures he here quotes, <q>That the true and only reaſon why ſinners pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, is, that they do not <hi>regard</hi> the hand of God, ſtretched out to ſave them; that they grieve him by their obduracy in ſin; that they <hi>neglect</hi> the great ſalvation offered to them; and <hi>will not come</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt for life.</q> But <q>neither of theſe things can be truely and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of thoſe perſons, who are awakened to ſuch a ſenſe of their ſins, as <hi>really to deſire</hi> the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation revealed; and to ſtrive in order thereto; even tho' they are not (which is very ſuppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) already in a regenerate ſtate.

                  <hi>P.</hi> 55, 56, 57.</note> What has been ſaid upon this paſſage in the laſt ſection, is ſufficient to convince any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive impartial perſon, I truſt, that what the doctor here takes to be "very ſuppoſeable," is plainly contary to ſcripture and all reaſon: and therefore the argument being built upon a moſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010007_0049_0F7B99966FA87C38"/>
evidently falſe hypotheſis, as are all the other, is much too weak to bear its own weight.</p>
            <p>I SHALL at preſent paſs over the next <hi>five</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, leaving them to be more particularly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by and by; and now attend to the <hi>two laſt</hi> as they ſeem to be exactly of the ſame ſtamp with thoſe already mentioned; and therefore moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly put with them.</p>
            <p>ARG. 13th. <q>It is very generally allowed, that all thoſe in general, who hear the goſpel; are invited and required, not only to believe it, but to repent of their ſins, and to become the true diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt. It is moreover univerſally acknowledged, that the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes eternal life to all who do thus, or to all real chriſtians: And it is repreſented as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manifeſtation of the goodneſs of God to men, that he ſhould, in this way, promiſe ſalvation to them. Now, if theſe conceptions and repreſentations are juſt, as they unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably are; it may from hence be clearly inferred, that there is grace accompanying the dipenſation of the goſpel, ſufficient to render it effectual to the ſalvation of thoſe, who hear it, PROVID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED THEY ARE REALLY DESIROUS OF, and endeavour after it.</q> All very true. But what if they are not really deſirous of it; but oppoſe and reject it? And if this is true of all the unregenerate, the argument comes to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>ARG. 14th. <q>It is very generally allowed, that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010007_0050_0F7B9999E1970B78"/>
thoſe who, having had the goſpel preached unto them, do not actually comply with the method of ſalvation revealed therein, and ſo finally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life, will have an aggravated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation at the laſt day. This is agreeable to the repreſentations of ſcripture in many places. But what reaſon? What juſtice, would there be in this, if theſe ſinful and unhappy men were never really put into a capacity for obtaining this ſalvation? or never had it made poſſible to them, <hi>tho' they deſired</hi> and endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partakers of it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, No reaſon, or juſtice at all. But what is this to his purpoſe? All ſinners under the goſpel are "really put into a capacity for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalvation:" and that whether they <hi>deſire</hi> and accept of this ſalvation or not; it being freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to their choice and acceptance. In this ſenſe it is made poſſible to all; and their conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglecting and refuſing to deſire and endeavour to become partakers of it, does not alter the caſe with reſpect to this, If therefore they miſs of this ſalvation, becauſe <hi>they do not deſire it,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and refuſe it, which is true of all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men; then this is very conſiſtent with their falling under "an aggravated condemnation," becauſe they "do not actually comply with the method of ſalvation revealed."</p>
            <p>NINE of the doctors fourteen arguments have now been conſidered. And as they are all built upon one hypotheſis, which has no truth in it, the falſehood of that being detected, they appear to be perfectly weak and inconcluſive.</p>

            <p>The doctor attempts to prove that the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to which theſe promiſes of ſpiritual, ſaving bleſſings are made, intends the exerciſes and doings of the unregenerate. His arguments for this are now carefully to be enquired into.</p>
            <p>He having obſerved, that <q>it will perhaps be ſaid, that none but a regenerate man, can be ſuppoſed to <hi>turn at God's, or wiſdom's reproof,</hi> or to <hi>wait at the poſts of her doors,</hi> in the ſenſe here intended,</q> goes on to ſay, <q>But this were an arbitrary aſſertion: one for which there is not the leaſt colour or foundation. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here addreſſed, are ſpoken to under the character of <hi>ſimple ones, ſcorners,</hi> and <hi>fools</hi>; who certainly need wiſdom the moſt of any. And the promiſe is apparently made for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſuch, to turn at her reproof, and to watch daily at her gates; that they might find her, and thereby <hi>find life.</hi> This was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be done by them, <hi>antecedently</hi> to their obtaining ſpiritual wiſdom; <hi>not in the actual exerciſe of it.</hi>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:010007_0053_0F7B999BC1892870"/>The perſons here addreſſed are indeed "ſimple ones, ſcorners and fools, who certainly need wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the moſt of any." But does it hence follow, that they are not called upon and required to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and be <hi>wiſe</hi>; but to do ſomething while they remain ſcorners and fools, or antecedent to their obtaining wiſdom? I think not: But directly the contrary: <hi>viz.</hi> that they are required to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace wiſdom, or be wiſe; to ceaſe from ſcorning, and become obedient: to forſake the fooliſh, and live. I truſt the doctor will not deny that <hi>turning</hi> at wiſdom's reproof implies thus much. And if ſo, it cannot mean any thing to be done by them while they continue fools and ſcorners, or conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with their continuing ſuch. It appears to me an odd way of arguing, to ſay, that ſeeing they are addreſſed in the character of ſimple ones, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and fools, therefore they are called upon to act according to this character; that is, like ſimple ones, ſcorners, and fools. But thus argues the doctor.</p>
            <p>And this is not the only inſtance of the doctor's arguing at this rate. In order to prove that the <hi>aſking, ſeeking,</hi> and <hi>knocking</hi> our Saviour ſpeaks of, intends the deſires, prayers and endeavours of the unregenerate, he ſays, "The words were ſpoken by him to the promiſcuous multitude of his profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed followers; and there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that all theſe were in a regenerate ſtate."<note n="(r)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 62.</note> This is as if a doctor of divinity ſhould gravely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove that the moral law, contained in the ten commands requires nothing but what unholy,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010007_0054_0F7B999C7B71F8C8"/>
wicked men do, while ſuch; becauſe it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to a promiſcuous multitude, many, if not moſt, of whom were ſuch. The doctor allows, that <q>all thoſe in general who hear the goſpel, are <hi>invited</hi> and <hi>required</hi> to <hi>repent of their ſins,</hi> and to become the <hi>true diſciples</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
               <note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 66.</note> He repreſents thoſe who will not allow this, to be "men of a diſordered mind, hardly fit to be reaſoned with." If the doctor will not rank himſelf among theſe, he muſt allow that our Saviour, when he preached the goſpel on the mount, did invite and require all his hearers to repent and become his <hi>true diſciples,</hi> and as ſuch, with a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, humble, chriſtian temper of mind, to aſk, ſeek and knock; however far he knew moſt of them then to be from ſuch a temper. But this is to give up the argument under conſideration, as fit to be uſed only by "men of a diſordered mind, hardly fit to be reaſoned with." But to return,</p>
            <p>The doctor goes on to argue, that if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of wiſdom in the texts quoted, is not "made to the turning, waiting and watching of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man," then it amounts to no more than this; that upon their <hi>firſt</hi> becoming wiſe, they ſhall <hi>then</hi> have wiſdom given them. But ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he thinks, not "agreeable to the wiſdom of God."<note n="(t)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 62.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This, with his words juſt now quoted relating to theſe ſcriptures, leads to the following remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It does not appear that there is any promiſe of wiſdom in theſe texts, of which they have no degree, who hearken and turn at wiſdom's reproof.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010007_0055_0F7B999D3B7FEF00"/>
The thing required here is wiſdom. They are exhorted to act directly contrary to what ſcorners and fools do, which ſurely is to act wiſely. "Hear inſtruction, and <hi>be wiſe,</hi> and refuſe it not. Bleſſed is the man that <hi>heareth me,</hi> watching daily at my gates, &amp;c." Hearing inſtruction is here ſpoken of as the ſame with being wiſe, or as that in which wiſdom conſiſts; and not as ſomething which a fool muſt do, as ſuch, or while he continues a fool, and antecedent to his exerciſing any wiſdom. Therefore ſuch are pronounced bleſſed who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to wiſdom, watching daily at her gates, &amp;c. which is itſelf an exerciſe of wiſdom, We have the ſame exhortation in a little different words, in the context.<note n="(u)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> viii 5.</note> "O ye ſimple, <hi>underſtand wiſdom</hi>: and, ye fools, <hi>be ye of an underſtanding heart.</hi>" None can ſuppoſe that what is required here, is ſomething to be done by the ſimple and fools, "an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to their obtaining wiſdom;" but they are called upon to be wiſe.</p>
            <p>The ſame is evident with reſpect to the other paſſage referred to by the doctor, "How long, ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity? And the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners delight in their ſcorning, and fools hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Turn you at my reproof." Here 'tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that they muſt ceaſe from loving ſimplicity, and no longer delight in ſcorning, and hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in order to turn at wiſdom's reproof; or rather, that this is implied in the turning required. Therefore turning is an exerciſe of wiſdom and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, in oppoſition to folly and ſtubborneſs. How the doctor could imagine that, here, and in
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010007_0056_0F7B999E091053E8"/>
the words before conſidered, wiſdom is promiſed, upon doing ſomething in which no wiſdom is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I am at a loſs.</p>
            <p>It is indeed here promiſed, that upon their <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> wiſdom will <hi>make known her words unto them.</hi> But this only intends that they ſhall be taken into the ſchool of wiſdom, in conſequence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wiſe as to embrace her; and ſhall be train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by her, as the children of wiſdom, to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degrees of knowledge and underſtanding. For "the Lord layeth up ſound wiſdom for the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>"<note n="(x)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> ii. 7.</note> "To him that <hi>hath</hi> ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance." Give inſtruction to a <hi>wiſe man,</hi> and he will be yet wiſer: teach a juſt man, and he will increaſe in learning."<note n="(y)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> ix. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This leads to another remark,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is contrary to reaſon and common ſenſe; Yea, a plain contradiction, to ſuppoſe that any perſon does hearken to the reproofs and inſtruction of wiſdom, and obey her dictates, while a fool, and antecedent to his having and exerciſing any wiſdom. To hearken to wiſdom, and turn at her reproof, is ſurely itſelf <hi>wiſe,</hi> or an inſtance and exerciſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If the dictates of wiſdom itſelf are wiſe; then it is not folly, but wiſdom, to hearken to them. If this is not wiſdom, it will be difficult to ſhew what is wiſdom, or that there is any ſuch thing in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>The doctor concludes this argument by ſaying, <q>I may venture to appeal to any wiſe man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a promiſe would be agreeable to the wiſdom of God.</q>
               <note n="(z)" place="bottom">

for wiſdom, with the public, and with the doctor himſelf, ſo far as to ſay, that whatever promiſe is made to hearkening to wiſdom, and turning at her repoof, is a promiſe made to a <hi>wiſe act</hi> or the exerciſe of wiſdom; and that ſuch a promiſe may be agreeable to the wiſdom of God. And I hope the doctor will, for time to come, be ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> and ſo much of a divine and philoſopher, as not to aſſert, or even think the contrary.</p>
            <p>I COME now to conſider the doctors arguments to prove that <hi>hungering and thirſting after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> intends the exerciſes of the unregenerate. He ſays, <q>

            <p>I anſwer, Hungering and thirſting ſuppoſes and implies, yea conſiſts in a reliſh of, and appetite to, the things hungered and thirſted after. So far therefore as ſinners are without any real, true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to holineſs or righteouſneſs, and have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and love for it, But an averſion to it; juſt ſo far there is <hi>ground to doubt,</hi> whether they hunger and thirſt after it: Yea, there is ground of <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> that they do not. But the unregenerate have no ſuch appetite; for their unregeneracy conſiſts in the want of it, and the perfect prevalence and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of and inclination and appetite directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereto.

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:010007_0058_0F7B999F9399DA50"/>Beſides, if theſe words of our Saviour are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their connection, it will appear unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to apply them to the unregencrate. Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting after righteouſneſs, is ſpoken of as an abiding, conſtant exerciſe, and points out a character, as much as any of the reſt of theſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes; ſuch as the <hi>poor in ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>merciful,</hi> the <hi>pure in heart,</hi> &amp;c. The doctor I conclude, will not ſuppoſe that the other exerciſes or characters mentioned here, intend the tranſient acts of the unregenerate; but the abiding exerciſes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of true chriſtians, which are peculiar and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to them as ſuch. And there is no reaſon why this <hi>one</hi> expreſſion ſhould be ſingled out, as belonging to the unregencrate only; and not to thoſe, whoſe temper and exerciſes Chriſt is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizing thro' this whole paſſage.</p>
            <p>But againſt this the doctor argues in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <q>If any ſhould ſay that the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate only, or ſuch as have already attained unto righteouſneſs, can be ſuppoſed to hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; this were altogether as contrary to reaſon and good ſenſe, as to ſay, that a man muſt eat a good meal, in order to be hungry in a literal ſenſe; and that he muſt drink an hearty draught, in order to be a-thirſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The miſ-repreſentation and abſurdity contained in theſe words muſt appear, I think, to all who I will calmly attend to the matter. Regeneration; does not conſiſt in any exerciſe of the mind, or any enjoyment: but by being regenerated a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is laid in the mind for holy exerciſes, for hungering and thirſting after rightcouneſs, and eating and drinkirg in a ſpiritual ſenſe, In rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010007_0059_0F7B99A0444C1CE8"/>
is given what may be called an appetite to holineſs or a right taſte and diſpoſition. And the exerciſes of this new taſte or appetite, in which the mind hungers and thirſts, eats and drinks, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys ſpiritual objects, follow regeneration, and are the effect of it. The regenerate therefore have not "attained unto righteouſneſs," or active holineſs, neither have they eat and drank ſo as to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, until the appetite given in regeneration is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in hungering and thirſting after holineſs: which appetite, thus exerciſed, is always gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the enjoyment of the object towards which is exerciſed. And thus the promiſe of Chriſt is always fulfilled: For men never are filled or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but in the exerciſe of holineſs; that is, in loving and delighting in divine things, or in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and thirſting after righteouſneſs. But in this way, they never fail of being ſatisfied or filled. The doctor therefore wholly miſ-repreſents the matter. If he had put the caſe properly, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, it would ſtand thus. "If any ſhould ſay, that the regenerate only can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; this were altogether as contrary to reaſon and good ſenſe, as to ſay, that a man muſt" <hi>have a ſtomach prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or an appetite to reliſh food and drink, in order to his hungering after, or deſiring, them.</hi> But that this is <hi>perfectly agreeable</hi> to reaſon and good ſenſe, I truſt, will not be diſputed by any one, who has the leaſt degree of either. And it may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added, that to ſuppoſe that the unregenerate do ever hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, as the hungry man deſires food, or the thirſty, drink, is altogether as contrary to all reaſon and good ſenſe,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010007_0060_0F7B99A0F4D81380"/>
as to ſay, that a man wholly deſtitute of any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to food and drink, or with a perfect antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy againſt them, is hungery and thirſty in a literal ſenſe, and earneſtly longs for them.</p>
            <p>The doctor goes on to ſay, <q>This benediction and promiſe, more eſpecially reſpect unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, heavy laden ſinners: as do alſo ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious invitations and promiſes as theſe—<hi>Ho, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters—Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good.</hi>—<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

            <p>Concerning theſe paſſages of ſcripture it may be obſerved, 1. That if the invitations and promiſes contained in them are made to unregenerate ſinners, and wholly reſpect their exerciſes and doings while ſuch; then the unregenerate, while ſuch, come to the waters of life, and do actually drink of this water: yea, they come to Chriſt and believe on him. For the invitation is to this, and to this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the promiſe is made. Of this any one may be certain, by carefully reading the quoted paſſages o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. It ſeems the doctor ſuppoſes the unregenerate do all this, by his thus quoting theſe words, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they are not to his purpoſe. When he
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010007_0061_0F7B99A1AF165DF8"/>
ſhall <hi>prove</hi> this, we will acknowledge he has gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his point: but till then, we muſt be confident that none come to Chriſt, unleſs they are drawn by the regenerating influences of God's ſpirit; and that they who believe on him are born of God: and that men's unwillingneſs, or oppoſition of heart to coming to Chriſt, to coming and taking the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, is the only ground of the neceſſity of their being born again, in order to ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. If therefore theſe paſſages are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to that under conſideration, which I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to allow, then hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs is the ſame with coming to Chriſt, and believing on him; therefore is peculiar to the regenerate. This leads me to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, That the <hi>hungering</hi> and <hi>thirſting</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in theſe paſſages, does not intend, at leaſt in all of them, a hungering and thirſting <hi>after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>: but ſomething elſe. When Chriſt ſays, "He that cometh unto me ſhall <hi>never hunger,</hi> and he that believeth on me ſhall <hi>never thirſt</hi>;" he does not mean a hungering and thirſting <hi>after righteouſneſs.</hi> He makes no promiſe here to this hungering and thirſting, which he does to hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting <hi>after righteouſneſs</hi>; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is made to <hi>coming to him,</hi> and <hi>believing on him</hi>; and he expreſſly diſtinguiſhes the hungering and thirſting he here ſpeaks of from believeing, &amp;c. and repreſents it as inconſiſtent with it. He that believeth on him <hi>ſhall not</hi> hunger and thirſt: the one is not, cannot be, where the other is. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, our Saviour here aſſerts that they who come to him, &amp;c. ſhall <hi>never</hi> have any more of that hunger and thirſt he here ſpeaks of. But will any
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010007_0062_0F7B99A39F2B8DA0"/>
chriſtian believe, that no real ſaint ever hungers and thirſts after righteouſneſs? Have they not a reliſh and thirſt for the waters of life? Surely, they have ſtrong deſires after, and their ſouls thirſt for, God, even the living God: And as new born babes they <hi>deſire</hi> the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby. By hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting then, Chriſt here means, a being in a miſerable, deſtitute ſtate; or unſatisfied deſires, uneaſineſs and want, without any thing to afford relief; which is ſometimes, if not often, meant by hungering and thirſting in ſcripture. He here promiſes that they who come to him and drink the water of life, ſhall never hunger and thirſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in this ſenſe: ſhall no more be in that deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, miſerable ſtate, in which they were before; which may well be repreſented by a perſon famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with hunger and thirſt, without any thing to relieve and ſatisfy him.</p>
            <p>Let us now hear the doctor's argument from theſe words. <q>How unreaſonable? how unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſays he, were it to ſuppoſe, that by thoſe who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, our Lord intends only the regenerate: or ſuch as have already eaten and drank of that ſpiritual bread and water, which he giveth? <hi>Eſpecially,</hi> when he declareth above, that ſuch perſons ſhall <hi>neither</hi> hunger nor thirſt again!</q>
            </p>
            <p>As all the ſtrength of the argument in theſe words lies in the ſuppoſition, that when our Lord ſays, he that cometh to him, &amp;c. ſhall neither hunger nor thirſt again, he means hungering and thirſting <hi>after righteouſneſs,</hi> what has been juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſerves to ſhew how groundleſs and abſurd
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010007_0063_0F7B99A42B49E0F0"/>
it is. If the doctor's argument is good, it proves that by thoſe who hunger and thirſt after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, our Lord intends <hi>only</hi> the unregenerate; and that the regenerate <hi>never do</hi> thus hunger and thirſt; ſo have no true deſires after God and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Yea, it proves, according to the doctor's ſenſe of the words, that the regenerate do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſalvation. By hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs, is meant, "Strong and ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to attain the righteouſneſs, and ſo the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion revealed in the goſpel," as the doctor explains it. Therefore, according to him, the regenerate never hunger nor thirſt after righteouſneſs, nor ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire ſalvation; this being peculiar to the unregenerate. According to this, neither David, nor Paul, nor any of the worthies we have on ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred record, were regenerate; for they hungered and thirſted after righteouſneſs; they had ſtrong and ardent deſires after righteouſneſs and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>If theſe things are duely conſidered, it will, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, appear, that this argument of the doctor's, takes all its ſeeming ſtrength only from a gingle of words, by jumbling ſeveral texts together, which have not the ſame meaning; and which, if they were taken in the doctor's ſenſe of them, would be inconſiſtent with each other; with the reſt of the bible; with common ſenſe, and even with the doctor himſelf.</p>
            <p>And now the reader is to judge, whether in this view of the caſe, the doctor had any real ground for the following words. "Can any man read this, and yet ſuppoſe, that hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs, in the ſenſe of our Saviour, is <hi>always</hi> ſubſequent, <hi>never</hi> prior, to coming to him,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:010007_0064_0F7B99A4B5380600"/>
or to regeneration? If he can, however good his heart may be, no one has much reaſon to envy him his head."</p>
            <p>Why does the doctor expreſs himſelf ſo guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly? "ALWAYS ſubſequent, NEVER prior to regeneration. If his argument above is good, and the ſcriptures referred to any thing to the purpoſe; it follows, as has been ſhewn, that hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs, or a deſire of ſalvation is <hi>never</hi> ſubſequent, but <hi>always</hi> prior to regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And if this is not true, the argument comes to nothing. If any man may think hungering and thirſting is <hi>ever</hi> conſequent, and not <hi>always</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to regeneration; he may, as conſiſtently with all the doctor has ſaid, think this is <hi>always</hi> ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, never prior to regeneration. But if the doctor had truely and fully expreſſed the genuine conſequence of his premiſes, he would have quite ſpoiled his argument; and it would have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at firſt view, that he had proved too much for himſelf, or any body elſe.</p>
            <p>It appears by the laſt ſentence quoted, that I have ſufficiently <hi>endangered my head</hi> to the doctor—However good the doctor's may be in the main, moſt readers, I imagine, will take leave to think it was not perfectly right in this inſtance, at leaſt. And I will perſume to ſay in my turn: Can any man read this, and yet think the doctor's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtrong and conſiſtent? If he can, no one, I am ſure, has <hi>any</hi> reaſon to envy him his head.</p>
            <p>THE doctors argument, to prove that when our Saviour promiſes good things, to them that <hi>aſk</hi> for them, he means the aſking of the unregenerate, ſhall be next conſidered. He having obſerved,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010007_0065_0F7B99A56D0A0F50"/>
that, "the good things promiſed, are ſuch as are comprehended in the gift of the Spirit," goes on to ſay, <q>The promiſe of which, in conſequence of aſking, ſeeking and knocking, is ſo far from ſuppoſing that the perſons who do ſo, are already regenerate, or that the Spirit is given them prior to their aſking; that it rather, implies the direct contrary: <hi>viz.</hi> that they had not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the ſenſe here intended. For if they are ſuppoſed, at the time of their aſking, to have the Spirit of God dwelling in them, to <hi>abide with them for ever,</hi> as all the ſons of God by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration have, what becomes of the promiſe? What are they to have in conſequence of aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Is it only the continuance of the Spirit, or larger meaſures of it? But theſe are, I think, never called, <hi>giving the ſpirit,</hi> in the language of ſcripture: which means the <hi>original</hi> beſtowment of it [or him] on ſuch as were deſtitute of it; in conſequence of which, they are ſaid to be born of the Spirit, or of God.</q> As a man is but <hi>once</hi> born of God, or of the ſpirit, ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is, properly ſpeaking, "never <hi>given more</hi> than <hi>once</hi>: For being once given, he is to <hi>be in, and abide with believers for ever.</hi>"<note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 64.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If the following things are attended to, it will be eaſily ſeen how little weight there is in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The regeneration is produced by the Spirit of God: yet in affecting this change, he is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, properly ſpeaking, to abide in them for ever, as a promiſed, abiding principle of holineſs: but
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010007_0066_0F7B99A85DBF3048"/>
the holy ſpirit is thus given, after regeneration, in conſequence of faith in Jeſus Chriſt, to which the gift of the Spirit is often and always promiſed. The ſpirit of God in regenerating men, operates not as a promiſed gift or agent; but regeneration is effected as an <hi>unpromiſed</hi> favor. There are no promiſes to any particular perſons, of the gift of the Spirit, in this ſenſe, to produce this change in them, in which they are wholly paſſive: nor are there any promiſes in the bible to regeneration it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to the regenerate, antecedent to any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of holineſs, but only to thoſe exerciſes, which are the fruit and conſequence of regeneration. This remark is ſufficient to ſhew the doctor's miſtake, in ſuppoſing that the ſpirit of God is given in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the ſpirit of promiſe, to abide with them for ever; on which miſtake the whole force of his argument reſts. But this will be more fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by what follows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho' the ſpirit of God is in a ſenſe given in regeneration, as it is an effect produced by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; yet he is not herein given as he is to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, as a promiſed, abiding principle of holineſs. In this latter ſenſe, in which ſenſe alone he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he is given to thoſe who believe, or thoſe who aſk him, which are really one and the ſame thing, as will be more fully conſidered by and by. Chriſt promiſes the ſpirit to thoſe who come to him, or believe on him. "Jeſus ſtood and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of living water. This ſpoke he of the Spirit,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010007_0067_0F7B99A8E695D2A8"/>
which they that <hi>believe on him</hi> ſhould receive."<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> vii. 37, 38, 39.</note> Now I truſt the doctor will not deny that men muſt be regenerated, or born of God, antecedent to their believing on Chriſt, or in order to this: If he ſhould, the apoſtle John will confute him; for he ſays, "Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God."<note n="(h)" place="bottom">1. <hi>John</hi> v. 1.</note> If they who believe on Chriſt are already born of God; then when Chriſt promiſes the Spirit to them who believe on him, he means ſomething by the gift of the Spirit which is not given in regeneration, and ſomething more, even that he ſhould be in them for ever as an abiding principle of ſpiritual life or holineſs. Exactly parallel to this, are the words ſpoken by the ſame perſon, long before, "Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my ſpirit unto you."<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 23.</note> To turn at wiſdom's reproof, is the ſame with coming to Chriſt, or believing on him; and in conſequence of this, the ſpirit is promiſed to be poured out upon them, as our Saviour promiſes the Spirit to thoſe who come to him, by the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, <hi>water.</hi> We may not hence infer that perſons are to turn to Chriſt without the Spirit, or antecedent to regeneration; but that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by the unpromiſed influence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit, they turn at wiſdom's reproof, come to Chriſt, and believe on him, and ſo aſk him for all good things; to which the Spirit is promſed, to be in them for ever. We hence ſee how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken the doctor was in ſuppoſing in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage above quoted, that when the ſcripture ſpeaks of giving the Spirit, it always means, "the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010007_0068_0F7B99AA1979E578"/>
beſtowment of him, in conſequence of which men are ſaid to be born of the Spirit of God." For our Saviour ſpeaks of giving the Spirit to them who believe on him; but believing on him is in conſequence of the original beſtowment of the Spirit in regeneration: for ſuch, St. John ſays, are already born of God. Therefore, after men have received the Spirit, ſo far as is neceſſary in order to their being born of God, they muſt believe on Chriſt, or come to him, and aſk him, in order to receive the Spirit in the ſenſe in which he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Exactly agreeable to this are the words of St. Paul. "That we might <hi>receive</hi> the promiſe of the Spirit through faith<note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 14.</note>" "In whom alſo <hi>after that ye believed,</hi> ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe."<note n="(l)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rph.</hi> i. 13.</note> Here he ſpeaks of the gift of the Spirit as promiſed to men, in which he doubtleſs has reference to the promiſe of Chriſt now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, among others. And this, he ſays, they received <hi>through faith,</hi> and <hi>after they bad believed</hi>: therefore <hi>after</hi> they were regenerate. Faith then is the condition of this promiſe, and not any doings of the unregenerate. Again he ſays, "And <hi>becauſe ye are ſons,</hi> God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts."<note n="(m)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 6.</note> He here ſpeaks of the gift or beſtowment of the Spirit in conſequence of their being the ſons of God: and he had juſt told how they became the ſons or children of God: <hi>viz.</hi> that they were "all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus"<note n="(n)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> iii. 26.</note> And it is worthy of remark here, that the promiſe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010007_0069_0F7B99AAAE810B68"/>
which Chriſt makes of the ſpirit to his diſciples, to abide with them forever, to which the doctor alludes, is made to thoſe who were already regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and he expreſſly ſays, the world, that is, the unregenerate, cannot receive the Spirit in the ſenſe in which he is here promiſed.<note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See John</hi> xiv. 16, 17.</note> He therefore does not mean what the doctor calls "the original beſtowment" of the Spirit. If the doctor had well attended to all this, the paragraph of his, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, would moſt probably never have ſeen the light.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho' the ſpirit operates in a ſenſe and degree in regeneration; yet as he does not regenerate men as being given as an abiding principle of life, but this change is produced as an <hi>unpromiſed</hi> favor, which neither unites them to Chriſt, nor gives them an intereſt to any promiſe in the bible, there appears great propriety in promiſing the Spirit as an abiding principle of eternal life, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all good things, to thoſe exerciſes or acts by which the regenerate actively unite themſelves to Chriſt, and come to him, truſt in him, and <hi>aſk</hi> in his name for this great benefit. And our being directed to believe on Chriſt in order to this, and aſk for the Spirit in this ſenſe, with a promiſe that he ſhall be given, is no argument, that in order to thus believing and aſking, we muſt not firſt be born of God, therefore the doctor's argument is, wholly without foundation. The doctor himſelf allows that perſons muſt have the influences of the Spirit of God in order to ſtrive, or aſk for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo as to be intitled to the promiſe.<note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See P.</hi> 21, 40, 73.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010007_0070_0F7B99AB73B86AE0"/>
they have the Spirit in ſome ſenſe when they aſk, and in order to their aſking: and therefore, according to him, the promiſe of the Spirit to them who aſk does not imply that perſons muſt not have the Spirit in order to aſk. If therefore there is any reaſon in what he ſays, which indeed there is not, it is as much againſt himſelf, as any body elſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is acknowledged that the Spirit is given <hi>but once</hi> as he is promiſed by our Saviour. He is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to believers never to be taken away: but this gift of the Spirit men never receive in regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as has been ſhewn; but in conſequence of that faith, that coming to Chriſt, and aſking him, for which regeneration lays the only foundation. And as this gift is promiſed to believing and aſking; ſo it can be received in no other way. And never is given but in conſequence of aſking.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As this gift is firſt received in a way of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſking, ſo it is continued, and the Spirit abides in believers by the exerciſe of faith, or their continuing to aſk for the Spirit in a perſevering way. Therefore men are not only to aſk for the Spirit in order to their firſt receiving this gift; but are to continue to aſk, in order to the Spirit's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in them, and perfecting the work he has begun. This direction and promiſe of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is therefore applicable to true chriſtians at all times.</p>
            <p>The doctor does not expreſſly deny this; but the whole of what he ſays is inconſiſtent with it. If believers having the Spirit dwelling in them, with a promiſe that he ſhall abide with them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, renders it abſurd for them any more to aſk
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010007_0071_0F7B99AC30B75FE0"/>
for this favor, which compriſes all good things: then certainly they muſt aſk <hi>no more,</hi> where once they are born of God, and have received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And if, true chriſtians are never to aſk for the Spirit, becauſe he is in them, and they have the promiſe that he ſhall abide with them for ever; then they are never more to aſk for any good thing, as all theſe are comprized in the gift of the Spirit. Does the doctor mean to repreſent prayer as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and abſurd in the true chriſtian, who is born of the Spirit of God? It certainly is ſo, if there is any reaſon or propriety in what he ſays.</p>
            <p>If, as the Doctor juſtly obſerves, all ſpiritual bleſſings and good things are comprehended in the gift of the Spirit: and therefore aſking for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the ſame with aſking for ſpiritual bleſſings, or good things in general. And if when the Spirit is once given, as he is to all the regenerate, there is no reaſon or propriety in aſking for the Spirit; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which poſition the doctor's argument is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded: then they who are regenerate have no ſpiritual good thing to aſk for; conſequently prayer is no part of their duty: This belongs only to the unregenerate. How contrary to this is the ſcripture account of the matter! This teaches true chriſtians to pray without ceaſing: to pray <hi>always</hi> with all prayer. And this, although they already have the Spirit, and pray by the Spirit. There we find ſuch words as theſe. "Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings that cannot be uttered."<note n="(q)" place="bottom">

On the whole, it appears, that turning at wiſdom's reproof, coming to Chriſt, or believing on him, a willingneſs to take of the water of life, and aſking good things of God, are all one and the ſame thing, or at leaſt imply each other; and therefore the promiſe of the Spirit, which is the ſum of all good, is made to this. But in order to men's coming up to this condition of the promiſe, they muſt, according to ſcripture, firſt be born of the Spirit of God. In order really and heartily to aſk for good things there muſt be a real and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty willingneſs to have them, or a deſire of them conſidered as what they are; and indeed, <hi>aſking</hi> is nothing but a proper exerciſe and expreſſion of ſuch willingneſs and deſire. But this is the ſame with coming to Chriſt, receiving him, or believing on him: In order to which men muſt be regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as has been before ſhewn.

            <head>SECTION VI. <hi>THE Doctor's</hi> ninth <hi>and</hi> twelfth <hi>arguments exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE now come to the <hi>ninth</hi> argument which the doctor has produced in favor of his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis. This is in the following words. <q>In Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel [chap. 36.] God declares his purpoſe to do many things for the people of Iſrael: and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, to give them a <hi>new heart,</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit.</hi> But he adds afterwards. <hi>I will be enquired of by the</hi> houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them. Which unqueſtionably relates in part to the new heart and new ſpirit, ſpoken of before. Upon which we may briefly remark, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, or ſalvation, is connected in ſcripture with the having a new heart: That ſuch an heart is the gift of God: That he gives ſuch an heart, not prior to, but in conſequence of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enquired of, or ſought to, for it. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that the enquiring of God, here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is the act, not of the regenerate, but the unregenerate; who are awakened to <hi>deſire,</hi> and ſeck after it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If this paſſage of ſcripture is duely attended to, it will appear, I doubt not, that it affords no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for what the doctor attempts to argue from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:010007_0074_0F7B99B22B7F44E8"/>There are two things promiſed by God in this chapter, which he would do in behalf of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael, now under his correction for their ſins; both of which depended, not on them, but on God's ſovereign determination to do it, not for their ſakes, but for his own holy name's ſake. This is repeatedly declared in this very paſſage.<note n="(t)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. 22, 23.</note> God is thro' this whole paſſage repreſented, not as wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them to do ſomething, in order to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing good things promiſed to them on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but declares what ſhall be, in which he himſelf is the <hi>firſt mover,</hi> and which he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh in and for them, independent of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One thing promiſed is, that he would bring them from the ſtate of captivity and affliction in which they now were in Babylon, and re-ſettle them in the land of Canaan, in a ſtate of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and there greatly increaſe and multiply them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other thing which God here promiſes is, that in order to prepare them for this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and proſperity, that it might be for their good, and the glory of his name, he would take away the hard, obſtinate, impenitent, prayerleſs heart which they now appeared to have, and give them a new, penitent, obedient, praying heart. They had now no heart to repent and humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſeek the Lord; but were ſtiff-necked, hard-hearted and moſt rebellious.<note n="(u)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See Chap</hi> ii. iii.</note> Inſtead of humbling themſelves under God's corrections, they were diſpoſed to juſtify themſelves; and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were injured: and that God's ways towards them were not juſt and equal.<note n="(x)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chap</hi> xviii. 33.</note> God
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010007_0075_0F7B99B2B822E538"/>
here promiſes that he will take away this hard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious heart, and give them "an heart of fleſh;" a penitent heart; a heart to humble themſelves, to loath and abhor themſelves for their iniquities and abominations:<note n="(y)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ezek</hi> xviii. 31.</note> a heart to know their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on him, and ſeek him for that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he had promiſed to grant. When God ſays, "I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them." the meaning is, that they ſhould be brought to ſeek him in a ſenſe of their dependence upon him for that deliverance and enlargement which he had promiſed, which is mentioned in the words immediately preceding and following theſe. And this ſeeking God is ſo far from being the condition of their obtaining a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, penitent, obedient heart, that ſuch an heart is neceſſary in order to this, and is implied in it. A heart to ſeek God was a new heart, an heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different from, and oppoſite to, the temper and diſpoſition they then had; and therefore is the very thing promiſed, when God ſays, "I will give them an heart of fleſh."</p>
            <p>This reſtoration of the people of Iſrael and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own land, after they had been long captivated and oppreſſed by their enemies, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſpoken of; and the temper and exerciſes of mind which they ſhould be brought to in order to this, is often mentioned in ſcripture, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the following expreſſions. "If they ſhall <hi>confeſs their iniquity,</hi> and the iniquity of their fathers, with their treſpaſs which they have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt me, and that alſo they have walked

            <p n="1">1. That to have their <hi>uncircumciſed heart humbled,</hi> and <hi>circumciſed to love the Lord,</hi> a <hi>heart to know the Lord,</hi> and a <hi>new heart,</hi> is the ſame thing: and that this implies, or is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of, <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>turning to the Lord, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his voice, doing his commandments, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his ſtatutes with their whole heart:</hi> Which alſo implies, and is really the ſame with <hi>confeſſing their iniquity, loathing themſelves for their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and abominations; ſeeking the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for him with all the heart and with all the ſoul; praying and making ſupplications to him,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of him</hi> to do theſe things for them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to deliver and ſave them. The temper and exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of heart denoted in theſe ſeveral paſſages and by theſe different expreſſions, are, as to ſubſtance, one and the ſame: at leaſt any one of theſe things here mentioned does imply all the reſt; ſo that where that is found, there the other are as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with, and implied in it. Theſe ſcriptures cannot be reconciled, or even underſtood, on any other ſuppoſition. The heart with which they were to make ſupplication to God, enquire of him and ſeek him for what they wanted, was not an uncircumciſed, ſtupid, ignorant, hard, impenitent, rebellious, proud heart; but an heart of fleſh, a penitent, humble, obedient heart; a heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and forſake their ſins, and loath themſelves for them.</p>

They had a <hi>new heart</hi>; a heart directly oppoſite to the prevailing temper and diſpoſition of their fathers, who went into captivity. They enquired of God, ſought him with their whole heart, for the ſalvation they needed; and returned with weeping and ſupplications, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and confeſſion of their ſins, and the ſins of their fathers.<note n="(m)" place="bottom">

It is alſo evident, that this condition of their deliverance and ſalvation, the whole of it taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, is itſelf promiſed by God, as what he would work in them. God himſelf promiſes not only to deliver them out of captivity; but to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe their hearts, to give them an heart of fleſh, by which they ſhould become a humble penitent people, and turn to him, and ſeek him with all their heart, as a proper preparative for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deliverance he had promiſed. When God ſays, in the text under conſideration, "I will yet
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010007_0081_0F7B99B76DE469C0"/>
for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them," it is to be conſidered as a promiſe that he will bring them to this, by giving them a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, praying heart, which they were far from then; which therefore muſt be a <hi>new heart.</hi> God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that he will bring them to ſeek him with their whole hearts, which is expreſſed thus in words before cited, "they ſhall come with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>with ſupplications</hi> will I lead them." But they could not be brought to this, while their hearts were uncircumciſed, and hearts of ſtone; but in order to this, God muſt circumciſe their hearts to love him, and give them an heart of fleſh; and it was impoſſible to accomplſh it any other. way. So far is this <hi>ſeeking God</hi> from being ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to a new heart, and required, as what muſt take place in order to it.</p>
            <p>What do they mean who flatter ſinners that they may ſincerely and heartily, or with their whole hearts ſeek a <hi>new heart,</hi> as the condition of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, and that to which a new heart is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed?

Does not the fleſh luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit? and are not theſe contrary the one to the other? What ſinceriry and heartineſs then is there in aſking for a new heart with a heart ſo perfectly oppoſite to the thing aſked for?

For this is as abſurd as to ſuppoſe that ſin and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy itſelf is reconciled to holineſs, and ſubjection to God's law. There is no ſuch thing ſuppoſed in the bible; nor will common ſenſe admit of it, however commonly it has been ſuppoſed; and tho' the doctor has done it, not only in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under conſideration, but through all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
            <p>On the whole, does it not appear beyond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, from this view of the caſe, that <hi>enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God,</hi> in the text under conſideration, is the ſame with what is called by Jeremiah, when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame thing, <hi>ſeeking God,</hi> and <hi>ſearching for him with their</hi> WHOLE HEARTS; and that this is ſeeking God with a new heart. If ſo, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor has wholly perverted this paſſage.—I have been the more particular on this text, becauſe it is ſo ſtrangely miſ-underſtood, not only by the doctor, but by many others.</p>
            <p>THE doctor takes his <hi>twelfth</hi> argument from the following words of the apoſtle Peter. "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe you might be made partakers of the divine nature, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſcaped the corruption that is in the world through luſt."<note n="(a)" place="bottom">2 <hi>Peter</hi> i. 3, 4.</note>

               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:010007_0083_0F7B99BC53CE4448"/>By the "things pertaining to life and godlineſs," the doctor underſtands, the external priviledges of the goſpel, among which he reckons "the great and precious promiſes." The end of which, he ſays, is, our being made "partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture," which is the ſame with a new heart. And "eſcaping the corruptions that are in the world thro' luſts." he takes to be the ſame with ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait gate. And he finally obſerves," that this divine nature or new heart, is given in a way of promiſe, or in the fulfilment of the promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es." Hence he infers that there are promiſes of a new heart to the unregenerate, who ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</p>
            <p>If by "all things partaining to life and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" are meant the gifts, qualifications and peculiar advantages beſtowed by the divine power, even that mighty power, which is exerciſed towards them who believe,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>Very parallel to theſe words are thoſe of St. Paul. "Having therefore theſe promiſes, dearly belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God."<note n="(h)" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 1.</note> And ſeveral other paſſages, which might be mentioned.</p>
            <p>The moſt natural and eaſy ſenſe of theſe words, and the moſt agreeable to parallel paſſages of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, being given, there appears to be no foundation in them for the argument the doctor attempts to find in them: It is therefore needleſs particularly to ſhew how groundleſs and forced is the meaning which he puts upon them.</p>
            <p>THE doctor's arguments have been now, I truſt, fairly and fully conſidered. And it muſt be left to thoſe who intereſt themſelves in this queſtion to judge, whether he has in any meaſure proved, that there are any promiſes in the bible of regenerating grace or ſalvation, to the doings of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

            <head>SECTION VII. <hi>A ſhort and plain ſtate of the caſe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHILE we have been attending to the doctor's ſtate of the queſtion, and his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſupport the tenet he eſpouſes, ſome things have been ſaid which, it is hoped, will help to ſet this matter in a true light. However, it may not be improper here to collect the whole of this kind, ſo as to give a plain ſhort view of the caſe.</p>
            <p>Man is not only by ſin plunged into a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite guilt; from which he cannot be delivered, conſiſtent with the law and moral government he is under, unleſs he is intereſted in, or united to, the Mediator: but he has alſo by his apoſtacy loſt the moral image of God, or all true holineſs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is wholly corrupt, and under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of appetites and inclinations directly contrary to God and his law.<note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <p>Dr. Mayhew allows that men are deſtitute of all true holineſs untill they are born again, or have a new heart given them in regeneration. [P. 42.] Yet, [P. 73] he repreſents the exerciſes and doings of the unregenerate, as having ſomething of the nature of obedience to God in them; and therefore <hi>GOOD</hi>; and conſequently not <hi>wholly</hi> unpleaſing to God. I ſhould be glad to know of the doctor what that obedience is, which falls wholly ſhort of true holineſs. If it is obeaience to God's law, it is true holineſs, if there is any ſuch thing in nature; if it is not obedience to God's law, How, and in what ſenſe is it any obedience at al.? He will be pleaſed alſo to tell us, what that is in the exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and doings of the unregenerate, which is of the nature of <hi>GOOD,</hi> and yet has nothing of the nature of true holineſs. The world has yet found out but two ſorts of good, viz natural and moral, holineſs and happineſs. But as the doctor means neither of theſe by the <hi>GOOD</hi> that is found with unregenerate men; he would oblige the world, if he would tell what this new diſcovered <hi>GOOD</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>The doctor's repreſenting the doings of wicked men as good, and ſense degree pleaſing to God, brings to my mind the words of Malathy. [chap. Ii. 17.] "Ye have wearied the Lord with your words: yet you ſay. Wherein have we wearied him? When ye ſay, Every one that doth evil, <hi>is good in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>he delighteth in them.</hi>" Our Saviour ſays, "A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit." Very agreeable to this, a noted author well obſerves," It is the <hi>good tree ONLY,</hi> that bringeth forth <hi>good fruit</hi>; and it is <hi>ONLY</hi> a <hi>good men,</hi> out of the <hi>good treaſure of his heart,</hi> that bringeth forth <hi>good things.</hi> An <hi>HOLY PRINCIPLE</hi> within, is conſidered in ſcripture as <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to good works,</hi> the latter being the exertions and operations of the former." <hi>Dr. Mayhew's ſermons on various ſubjects. p. 191..</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> This is the carnal mind
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010007_0087_0F7B99BEF60EFD40"/>
which the ſcripture ſays, "is enmity againſt God; For it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."<note n="(l)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> viii.</note> This corruption or viciouſneſs of heart being ſo great and univerſal, the ſinner will not repent, or have any right exerciſes towards God and his law, untill his heart is in ſome degree renewed and <hi>ſet right.</hi> In this ſtate the goſpel finds man; in which pardon and ſalvation, through a mediator are freely offered to his acceptance; and all are invited to come to Chriſt, believe on him and truſt in him, for al! they want; being aſſured, that on this condition, Chriſt, with all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, ſhall be theirs.</p>
            <p>But as the way in which this ſalvation is given, is in a peculiar manner adapted to do honor to the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010007_0088_0F7B99BFAD18E430"/>
law which the ſinner has broken, and vindicate the divine character, to which he is a perfect enemy: and as the Saviour himſelf, in all he has done in the character of a Mediator, has above all others condemned ſin, and manifeſted his love of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and hatred of iniquity: and as the ſalvation itſelf which he gives, conſiſts ſummarily in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from ſin, and the exerciſe and enjoyment of true holineſs, the ſinner is in a peculiar manner an enemy to the goſpel; to the Mediator, viewed in his true character; to the way in which he ſaves ſinners; and to the ſalvation itſelf. And he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continues ſo while an enemy to holineſs, and an impenitent: or until his heart is changed, and he comes to a new temper and diſpoſition. This change of the corrupt heart is in ſcripture ſpoken of as the work of the Spirit of God, in which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſaid to be born of the Spirit, to have the ſtony heart taken away and an heart of fleſh, or a new heart given; to be quickened, or made alive from the dead; created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, &amp;c. It is alſo called the waſhing; of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and the renewing of the the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>As men do in their natural ſtate with their whole hearts reject the good things offered in the goſpel: and their doing ſo, is wholly owing to an inexcutable wickedneſs of heart, God is not obliged, in reaſon or juſtice, to remove this voluntary wicked inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable oppoſition and bring them to a willing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his propoſals: Neither has he oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to do this for any, by promiſes to any thing which they ſhall do, as the condition of it. Therefore whenever, and in whatever inſtance, God takes away the heart of ſtone, and gives a
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010007_0089_0F7B99C0EBE7BF00"/>
new heart, he acts as being unobliged, or ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignly, and beſtows an <hi>unpromiſed</hi> favor; and ſo "has mercy on whom he will have mercy; and whom he will be hardeneth" <hi>i. e.</hi> leaves under the dominion of a hard, ſtony heart. But when God gives a new heart in regeneration, a foundation is laid in the mind for a diſcerning of the truths, of the goſpel in their real beauty and excellency, (to which the unregenerate heart, or the mind under the dominion of luſt is wholly blind) and for thoſe right exerciſes, in which faith or chriſtian holineſs conſiſts. And all the promiſes of the goſpel are made to theſe <hi>exerciſes</hi> of the mind, in which the mind diſcerns divine truth in ſome meaſure as it is, and heartily embraces the goſpel, &amp;c. And the firſt exerciſe of this kind, intitles the perſon to all divine promiſes; to pardon of ſin, and eternal life, and to all thoſe divine influences, by which he ſhall perſevere in faith and holineſs, untill he ſhall be perfectly delivered from all ſin, and awake com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>in God's likeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There muſt therefore be a diſtinction kept up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween regeneration, which is the work of God in giving a new heart, and in which men are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive; and <hi>active</hi> converſion in which men, being regenerated, turn from ſin to God, in the exerciſe of repentance towards God, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and in conſequence of which they are pardoned and received to favor, and a title to eternal life; and have the gift of the Spirit to dwell with them for ever, as an abiding principle of life and holineſs. All this, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry benefit which men receive by Chriſt, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe who believe, or heartily embrace
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010007_0090_0F7B99C163222400"/>
goſpel, and not to regeneration: for to this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as antecedent to all <hi>action,</hi> and only as tho foundation of right exerciſe, no promiſe is made. Neither are thoſe influences by which men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated in this ſenſe, meant by giving, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Spirit, as the Spirit of promiſe, by which believers, and they only, are ſealed to the day of redemption: but men receive the Spirit, in this ſenſe, as a ſpirit of adaption, by which all God's children are led, by faith, or a hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt with all his benefits.<note n="(m)" place="bottom">

            <p>This change therefore, called regeneration, by which a new heart is given; as the foundation of all true diſcerning of the things of God's moral kingdom, and of all right exerciſes of heart; this change, I ſay, "wrought by the Spirit of God immediately and inſtantaneouſly, and altogether imperceptibly to the perſon who is the ſubject of it; it being impoſſible that he ſhould know what God has done for him, but by a conciouſneſs of his own views and exerciſes, which are the fruit and conſequence of the divine operation. Theſe views and exerciſes of the regenerate, in which they turn from ſin to God, or embrace the goſpel, are often in ſcripture ſpoken of as included in that change which is called a being born again, &amp;c. as all the change which is perceptible, and in which man is active conſiſts in this. And this is ſometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by divines <hi>active converſion,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010007_0091_0F7B99C286F599D8"/>
from regeneration, or that change in which men are paſſive.</p>
            <p>Men being waſhed by regeneration, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Ghoſt; the hard rebellious heart being ſubdued in a degree, and a new and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite biaſs, which is by our Saviour called an <hi>honeſt and good heart,</hi> being given, the light and truth of God's word, enters into the mind, and it diſcerns the things of the Spirit of God in their reality, beauty, wiſdom, glory: and in this view and ſenſe of divine truths, the heart approves of the divine character, comes to Chriſt for life, or believes on him, and ſincerely and heartily aſks for the Spirit, or that living water which Chriſt gives, and which comprehends all good things. And to this huger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thirſting after righteouſneſs, coming to Chriſt, believing on him and traſting in him; to <hi>this</hi> aſking, knocking, ſeeking, divine promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are made, even to the firſt and loweſt degree of this kind of exerciſe. To ſuch the Spirit is given as a fountain; "a well of living water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life."<note n="(n)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> iv. 14.</note> And by this actively cleaving to Jeſus Chriſt, in a view of his true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as Mediator and Saviour, and uniting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, a proper foundation is laid for their being looked upon and treated, as being in him, and in a ſenſe one with him; ſo that on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, out of reſpect to his merit and worthineſs, they are pardoned and received to favor; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, and heirs of eternal life. And as they have thus received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo they walk in
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010007_0092_0F7B99C2AD34F3C8"/>
him; the life they live is <hi>by faith</hi> on the Son of God; and conſiſts in cleaving to Chriſt in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ways; in coming to him, living upon him, aſking and receiving all good things from him, as a free gift to the infinitely unworthy.</p>
            <p>THE unregenerate Sinner may be in a ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in his judgment and conſcience that he has by his ſin expoſed himſelf to eternal deſtruction; that he can be delivered from this evil, and obtain ſalvation only by Jeſus Chriſt, by coming to him and believing on him; and that in order to this he muſt have a new heart given him by God, &amp;c. And he may have ſuch a ſenſe of his danger and miſery, and of the awful conſequence of ſin, as to fill his mind with great uneaſineſs and diſtreſs. This may, while it continues, deaden him-to all carnal gratifications, and make him afraid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf to any overt acts of known ſin; and lead him to make deliverance from future miſery his great concern, and earneſtly to ſeek this in the uſe of all means; being all attention to the great concerns of his ſoul, and a future world. But all this does not alter the reigning temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart. There may be yet no more true hatred of ſin than before, and a reigning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt the divine character, and law, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the goſpel; and the heart may therefore be as far from repentance, and acceptance of offered ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt as ever, and really reject and abhor the good things offered in the goſpel: and ſo be far from truly deſiring and aſking for them, And this is certainly the caſe with every unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon, whatever concern and exerciſes he may
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010007_0093_0F7B99C5C7F12C30"/>
have about the ſalvation of his ſoul; and whatever he may pretend and think of himſelf. If he thinks better of himſelf, as thouſands do, it is all deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And they who go about to ſtrengthen and confirm men in ſuch deluſion, are ſtrengthening the cauſe of the prince of darkneſs, inſtead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the intereſt of Chriſt, and the ſalvation of ſinners.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore think myſelf doing God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and that which tends to promote the good of mankind, while I attempt to prove, that there are no promiſes of regenerating grace or ſalvation, made to theſe exerciſes and doings of the unregenerate in the holy ſcripture.

            <p>All unregenerate peſons then are, according to this, in a ſtate of condemnation and death, and are in the way to eternal deſtruction. But this cannot be true if any, while in an unregenerate ſtate, have a title to life, or are intereſted in the promiſes of ſalvation. For he who has a title to life, or is doing that to which the promiſes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are made, is not in the way to death; but in that which leadeth to life; neither is there any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to him. They who aſſert that there are promiſes of God's favor and eternal life, to the exerciſes and doings of unregenerate men, point out a way for them to walk in, while they are in the fleſh, and walk after the fleſh, which,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010007_0097_0F7B99C8AF51A5C0"/>
they ſay, is the way to life; and by walking in which, they ſhall not die, but live: But St. Paul ſays, it is the way to death, and by walking in it, they ſhall die: none being free from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the way to life, but they who have the Spirit of God dwelling in them; do live after the the Spirit, do through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body; are in the ſpirit, and led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and ſo are the ſons of God. Therefore theſe men do not agree with, but directly contradict, St. Paul, or rather the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by him.</p>
            <p>St. Paul here divides men into two claſſes and no more: one are the ſons of God, who have the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in them, who walk after the Spirit and are led by the Spirit, and through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body. Theſe are free from condemnation and death, and in the ſure way to life. In the oppoſite claſs are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all others: who being in the fleſh, and walking after the fleſh, are in a ſtate of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and in the way which leadeth to eternal deſtruction.

               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:010007_0098_0F7B991037B1EB58"/>MOREOVER, it is obſervable, that when the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles went forth to preach the goſpel, they never directed men, who applied to them to know what they ſhould do to be ſaved, to any endeavours and doings ſhort of true repentance, and faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as what would ſave them: but expreſſly told them that they muſt repent and believe on Chriſt in order to this.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 37, 38. <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi. 30, 31.</note> And St. Paul ſpeaks of his preaching as conſiſting ſummarily in inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt."<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>Now, we cannot account for this, on ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the endeavours and doings of men, which are ſhort of repentance and faith, are the condition of ſalvation, having the promiſe of it made to them. For were this the caſe, they muſt have directed them to theſe endeavours and doings, as what they muſt do in order to be ſaved, and by doing which they ſhould certainly obtain the ſalvation they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after. And this muſt have been the drift and ſum of their preaching, and not repentance and faith: ſuch as indeed has been the preaching of many ſince that time. We may therefore be ſure the apoſtles did not believe there were any promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es made to doings ſhort of repentance and faith in Chriſt, but that theſe were the loweſt condition of ſalvation. This leads me to the</p>
            <p>II. ARG. TO ſuppoſe that there are promiſes of ſalvation made to the doings of unregenerate perſons, is to make theſe doings <hi>the condition of ſalvation</hi>; and not faith or repentance; or indeed
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010007_0099_0F7B9910F68277C0"/>
any thing elſe which the ſcripture repreſents as ſuch.</p>
            <p>That to which the promiſes of life and ſalvation are made, ſo that he who has it, or attains to it, has a ſure title to ſalvation, is certainly the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſalvation; but the exerciſes and doings of the unregenerate, are this condition, if promiſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are made to them. Yea, according to this, the doings of the unregenerate are the condition, and <hi>only</hi> condition of juſtification. For they who have a title to God's favor and eternal life, are no longer in a ſtate of condemnation, as has been ſhown; to have a title to God's ſpecial, eternal love and favor, and be heir of eternal life, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies every thing that is contained in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If then men are not forgiven till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſins; are juſtified by faith; and therefore not untill they believe, and heartily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the goſpel: In ſhort, if one tittle of the new Teſtament is true, there are no promiſes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to the doings of the unregenerate.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">

            <p>III. ARG. THAT there are no promiſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation made to the exerciſes and doings of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, will be evident if it be conſidered, that ſuch do with their whole hearts oppoſe the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, and reject the ſalvation offered

by him. That this is true of all the unregenerate has been ſhewn;<note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Sec. III.</hi>
               </note> ſo that there is no need of dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long upon it here. It has been obſerved that in <hi>this</hi> men's unregeneracy conſiſts ſo that to ſuppoſe them to be in any degree friendly to the goſpel at heart, is to ſuppoſe them to be regenerate: or at leaſt that they ſtand in no need of regeneration, in order to ſalvation. To ſuppoſe the unregenerate are not at heart enemies to the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, and that any of the exerciſes of their hearts about this ſalvation, are not conſiſtent with enmity againſt, and oppoſition to it, is to take away all diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the regenerate and the unregenerate: To be ſure, it takes away that by which alone they are diſtinguiſhed in ſcripture. If any are at a loſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this, let them read their bibles over, with a ſpecial view to this point: and then let them tell, what is meant by the unregenerate; what unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy conſiſts in; and what regeneration is, on ſuppoſition the unregenerate do not with their whole hearts reject Jeſus Chriſt and oppoſe the way of ſalvation by him, as being enemies to God and the Saviour. If they are not willing to be at this pains, let them turn to the viii. chap, to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the paſſage juſt now under conſideration. There it is ſaid "the carnal mind is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God;—is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." That by the carnal mind is meant the unregenerate heart, in diſtinction from thoſe who are ſpiritually minded, have the Spirit of Chriſt, and walk after the ſpirit; who love God, and are his children, has been juſt now proved.
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010007_0101_0F7B9912748ABAB8"/>
And I know not how any one can doubt of this, who will carefully read that chapter. But if the carnal, unregenerate heart, is full of enmity againſt God and his law, it is equally an enemy to Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel: For the divine character and the holy law of God, are more fully vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and honored, and are ſet in a clearer view, by Jeſus Chriſt in the goſpel, than otherwiſe they could be; and are ſo interwoven through the whole goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſcheme, that it cannot be underſtood and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, any further than God's law, and his character therein expreſſed, are ſeen and loved: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every degree of enmity againſt God and his law, is, to the ſame degree, and in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, enmity againſt Chriſt and the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now that exerciſes of enmity againſt Chriſt, and oppoſition to the goſpel, and the ſalvation therein revealed and offered; or thoſe which are conſiſtent with this, are made the condition of a title to and intereſt in this ſalvation; ſo as that all the promiſes of the goſpel are made to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and acts, I preſume none will believe. This ſeems to be ſo ſelf-evident, that it is needleſs to go about to prove it. Nothing therefore ſeems neceſſary to decide the point we are upon, but to keep in view the true ſtate of the caſe, and attend to the real character of the unregenerate, and the nature and quality of all their actions.</p>
            <p>It is therefore obſervable, that men, in arguing that there are promiſes to the doings of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, do always overlook the true character of ſuch, and of their exerciſes; yea ſuppoſe them to be in a degree friendly to Chriſt, and the ſalvation by him. In order to prove that there are promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:010007_0102_0F7B991334F81EA0"/>
to the unregenerate, they dreſs them up in the character which belongs, only to the regenerate; ſo that by ſtripping them of this diſguiſe, the boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arguments vaniſh into nothing but weakneſs and abſurdity; and the truth ariſes into view, and becomes clear beyond diſpute.<note n="(f)" place="bottom">How <hi>far this is true of Dr. Mayhew's performance, which has been under conſideration, they who have read the foregoing ſection muſt judge.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IV. ARG. If ſalvation is offered to all who heartily deſire it, really chooſe and accept of it, and ſo truely aſk for it: it is offered on terms low enough: as low as any can reaſonably deſire; yea, on the loweſt conceivable or even poſſible terms. But no unregenerate perſon comes up to theſe terms. Therefore ſalvation is not offered or promiſed to any doings of the unregenerate.</p>
            <p>If a free gift is offered and promiſed to any one that deſires it, and is willing to take it, it cannot be offered on lower or eaſier terms. If any ſhould ſay, 'Yes, it may be offered or promiſed to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whether he will have it or no: ſo that he ſhall have it, even contrary to his will and choice.' I anſwer, this is not to offer it on lower and eaſier terms. It is not to offer it on any terms; neither is it properly any offer or promiſe at all: it is only a declaration of what ſhall be; which is, all things conſidered, contrary to the will and inclination of the perſon. But indeed there can be no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration properly and truly made. A perſon while unwilling to accept of, and have any gift and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment 9 and while he rejects it with his whole heart, is not capable of receiving it, or of cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertaining the offer of it; and therefore is not a ſubject capable of ſuch an offer, with a promiſe
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010007_0103_0F7B9913F405B020"/>
that it ſhall be his, even while he undervalues, deſpiſes, and refuſes to receive it. If it is offered with a promiſe that it ſhall be his, as ſoon as he is heartily willing to accept of it, and upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only; it is offered on the loweſt terms that ever any offer was, or can be made. Now, it is granted that the goſpel offers ſalvation to all who will accept of it, or are truely willing to have it. But as no unregenerate perſon is thus willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſalvation, no ſuch one ever did, or ever will come up to theſe loweſt poſſible terms, on which ſalvation is offered and promiſed.<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>This laſt propoſition has been proved in the third ſection, end under the laſt argument.</hi>
               </note> It would be highly abſurd and ridiculous to offer that to any one, which is the object of his peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar averſion and hatred, under the notion of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his by ſomething he is to do as the condition of it, while he continues thus averſe to it: And therefore no ſuch offer was ever ſeriouſly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made. We may therefore be certain God has never done this: but that the loweſt terms on which ſalvation is offered and promiſed, imply a real choice of this ſalvation, or a hearty acceptance of it.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dr. Mayhew has ſuppoſed and allowed this, thro' the whole courſe of his arguments, and in all he ſays upon this ſubject, as the attentive reader has obſerved. The only thing he can diſpute, is, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate do not come up to theſe terms. When he will prove they do, he will gain his point. For this therefore the public muſt wait on him.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>IF it ſhould here be ſaid, that tho' unregenerate ſinners are not willing to accept of ſalvation which is freely offered; and that this is both their ſin and calamity: yet God may offer them <hi>regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace</hi>; and promiſe to bring them to a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:010007_0104_0F7B99152A29DA90"/>
to accept of ſalvation, by giving them a new heart, upon terms which they, while unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, may come up to; and ſo regeneration, and conſequently the whole of ſalvation, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with this condition, which really is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of a hearty acceptance of ſalvation: for this is one thing promiſed to be given, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in regeneration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer.</hi> If we ſuppoſe the grace of regeneration or a new heart, which implies a heart to accept of and truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, to be offered and promiſed to the unregenerate, on ſome condition which they are to come up to and perform, while unregenerate; yet ſtill this is an offer of that to which their hearts are as much averſe, as to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf: they are as far from accepting of ſuch an offer, as they are from accepting of ſalvation, and reject and deſpiſe it as much. The grace of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or a new heart, is as contrary to the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate heart, as ſalvation or holineſs itſelf: the unregenerate do oppoſe and reject this with their whole hearts; for 'tis ſuppoſed their hearts are <hi>now</hi> in direct oppoſition to the new heart offered; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would ſtand in no need of a <hi>new heart.</hi> If therefore God offers and promiſes to give them a new heart, on any condition, which conſiſts in their exerciſe and doings, he makes this offer and promiſe to exerciſes and doings which imply, or are conſiſtent with, a real op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to, and rejection of, the thing offered and promiſed. The unregenerate heart hates and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a <hi>new heart,</hi> juſt as much as it does the di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vine character and law, or Jeſus Chriſt and the goſpel; and therefore is no more willing to receive
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:010007_0105_0F7B99159F942AE0"/>
the former than the latter, but rejects it with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abhorence. Therefore there is nothing which the unregenerate may be ſuppoſed to do, in order to obtain a new heart, which is not itſelf an act of oppoſition, or conſiſtent with the moſt perfect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that which he is ſuppoſed to be ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For inſtance: If we ſhould ſuppoſe that God offers and promiſes to give the unregenerate, a new heart, on condition they will <hi>aſk</hi> him for ſuch a favour: this muſt mean an aſking without any true deſire of the thing aſked for; yea an aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is conſiſtent with an oppoſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the favor offered; and therefore really no aſking at all for a new heart, but for ſomething elſe. For ſo far as the new heart is oppoſite to the heart of the unregenerate, juſt ſo far does the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart oppoſe and hate the new heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the offer of it; and that conſtantly, and in all its exerciſes which have any relation to, and reſpect the new heart, which is the thing offered.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that there is the ſame difficulty and abſurdity in ſuppoſing, that a new heart is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and promiſed to the doings of the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, by which they would become willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt and ſalvation; as there is in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that eternal life is offered on ſome condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lower than a real willingneſs to accept of it.</p>
            <p>In a word, if we will not go beyond reaſon and plain common ſenſe in this matter, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that whatever offer of any favor or free gift God makes to men, he offers it to their free acceptance, and promiſes that on this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſhall be their's: and conſequently that they can have no title to it, on any condition ſhort of a
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010007_0106_0F7B99162FCE01B0"/>
hearty acceptance of it: And that an offer made to a lower or eaſier condition, cannot be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſired, or even ſuppoſed. Therefore God in the goſpel makes no offers and promiſes of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of any thing connected with it, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and doings of the unregenerate.</p>
            <p>V. ARG. FOR God to offer and promiſe ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who with their whole hearts hate and reject Jeſus Chriſt in his character of Mediator, would be altogether unbecoming: and really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the goſpel, and overthrow it. The goſpel opens a way of ſalvation for ſinners <hi>through a Mediator</hi>; in which they are pardoned, and received to favor, and a title to everlaſting life, purely out of reſpect to his merits and worthineſs; ſo on his account and in his name. And in this way alone can God pardon the ſinner, receive him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and beſtow eternal life on him, conſiſtent with his honor and in a way becoming his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as ſupreme lawgiver and judge. But to pardon the ſinner and receive him to favor, and promiſie eternal life to him, while he remains an enemy to this Mediator, and oppoſes and rejects him in this charcter, would be to act directly contrary to this plan; and really to diſhonor the mediator, and ſet him aſide.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the goſpel ſinners are repreſented as being ſaved (<hi>i. e.</hi> brought into a ſtate of pardon and acceptance with God, and to a title to eternal life) <hi>by the blood of Chriſt</hi>; or by his merit and worthineſs being imputed to them, or reckoned to their account. Accordingly it is by virtue of their union to him, or being <hi>in him,</hi> that they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:010007_0107_0F7B9919504B3420"/>

                  <p>Dr. Mayhew ſpends ſome time to anſwer an objection againſt their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate viz that this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes God to make promiſes to theſe actions, which are not truly holy. [P. 72, &amp;c] If truly holy actions might be done by men, and yet they continue out of Chriſt, and in oppoſition to him, as the unregenerate do; it muſt be confeſſed, there would be no more reaſon why divine promiſes ſhould be made to them, than to actions which are not holy: for all ſinners, conſidered as out of Chriſt, or not united to him, ſo as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in his merits, are on a level in this reſpect, whether holy or unholy; they are infinitely unworthy and ill deſerving, and cannot be received to favor with God, and a little to life, untill they are united to the Mediator, ſo as to be intereſted in this merit and worthineſs. If the doctor therefore repreſents this objection in its full ſtrength and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, it muſt be owned 'tis as <hi>feeble</hi> as he ſuppoſes it to be. But if the objectors mean, that the unregenerate do nothing in that holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is neceſſary in order to their hearts being united to Chriſt the Mediator, ſo as to be a proper ground of their being accepted <hi>to him,</hi> the doctor has not in the leaſt degree anſwered the objection. There may be a ſufficient reaſon why no promiſes ſhould be made to the exerciſes of ſinners, which have no degree of holineſs in them; viz becauſe ſuch exerciſes do not unite to Chriſt, or imply any union of heart to him, but the contrary. It has been obſerved, that the goſpel, or Chriſt and the way of ſalvation by him, are ſo holy, that the unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart cannot be pleaſed with, but muſt hate and oppoſe them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that exerciſe of heart by which ſinners embrace the goſpels or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, by an acceptance of him, muſt be an <hi>holy</hi> exerciſe. In this view, 'tis unreaſonable and abſurd to ſuppoſe, that there are any promiſes of ſalvation, made to the unholy doings of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and therefore the objection ſtands good. But there may be good reaſon why ſalvation ſhould be promiſed to the holy exerciſes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; becauſe, however imperfect they are, they are really an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of Chriſt, and unite them to him; ſo that they lay a proper foundation for their being accepted <hi>in him,</hi> and receiving a title to the heavenly inheritance for his ſake: For, as the doctor well expreſſes it. "It is <hi>for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> that theſe promiſes are made to them." [P. 74.] But it has been ſhewn, that ſuch promiſes cannot be made <hi>for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> so theſe who hate end reject Jeſus Chriſt: But if promiſes are made to ſuch, heaven and Chriſt himſelf are promiſed to them, for their own ſakes, or rather, for the ſake of their own unholy, wicked exerciſes and doings.</p>
                  <p>The doctor indeed endeavours to palliate this matter a little [P. 73] What he ſays it to this effect, the temper and actions of his ſtrivers, are really different from thoſe who are proceeding headlong in their criminal courſes and to ſay the leaſt, are not ſo diſpleaſing to God. And their doings may properly be called <hi>obedience</hi> to God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have ſomething of the nature of GOOD; and ſo cannot be <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> unpleaſing to God. It muſt therefore render them <hi>more ſuitable</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his favor and mercy than theſe are, who do not ſtrive; but commit iniquity with greedineſs." The doctor ſeems to be conſcious that there muſt be ſome GOOD qualification in the ſinner in order to render him a ſuitable object of God's favor and mercy; otherwiſe he would not take ſo much pains to find ſomething of this kind in thoſe whom be ſuppoſs the objects of this favor. But what does he mean by their being <hi>ſuitable,</hi> or <hi>more ſuitable objects of God's favor and mercy,</hi> antecedent to their union to Chriſt, and intereſt in his worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and conſidered as in themſelves? Does he mean, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi> moral ſuitableneſs</hi> or fitneſs; ſome moral excellency which recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to God's favor, as a reaſon why they ſhould have mercy rather than others? If this is the caſe, then they need not the merit of Chriſt to recommend them to God's favor; for they have upon this ſuppoſition, merit enough of their own to anſwer this end. The doctor repeatedly diſclaims the notion of merit; but if this is what he means, he holds to the doctrine of merit to all intents. If any ſinner has any moral good or worth, which recommends him to the divine favor, on the account of its acceptableneſs in God's ſight, and on this account is a reaſon why God ſhews favor to him rather than to another; he has as <hi>real</hi> merit, as 'tis poſſible any creature ſhould have, tho' it may not be to ſo great a <hi>degree.</hi> But if by being a <hi>ſuitsble, or fit object</hi> of God's favor he means any other kind of fitneſs, he would oblige us by ſhewing what it is.</p>

            <p>ANS. This objection ſeems to have its foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a ſuppoſition for which there is no ground, and is indeed directly contrary to the truth of the caſe; <hi>viz.</hi> that if ſalvation is not offered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the exerciſes and endeavours of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, then it is offered to them on terms impracticable, though they are never ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and have a good will in the caſe; and ſo are not, at all to blame for not coming up to the terms propoſed; there being ſome difficulty in the caſe which is inſurmountable, however good and great their inclination and deſire may be to do it. As the objectors ſeem to view the caſe, it may be repreſented by the following compariſon. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lord, as he was viſiting one of his plantations, ſaw a large building on fire: and when he came to it, he. found a number of his ſervants confined in it. He knowing their ſituation, calls to them, tells them the dreadful caſe they are in, and earneſtly calls upon them to ariſe and come to the door with a promiſe that upon their ſo doing, he will unlock it, and deliver them. At the ſame time, both he and they know, that they are faſtned down with chains which they have been trying with all Itheir might to deliver themſelves from; but find it impoſſible. They cry to him for help,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:010007_0111_0F7B991C2E7130D0"/>
and do their utmoſt, but all in vain: he ſtands by, and ſees them periſh in the devouring flames! Dr. Mayhew, repreſents the ſtate much in this light in many paſſages in his ſermons, as well as in the following words. "Is there any real kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mercy or goodneſs, in offering ſalvation to guilty creatures, and inviting them to accept it, on ſuch terms as are to them <hi>impracticable, tho' they deſire it and ſtrive to this end?</hi>—Impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I mean, with all the helps and advantages that God affords, or will afford to them, though they ſeek them <hi>in the beſt manner their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit of?</hi> I muſt confeſs, I cannot ſee any goodneſs herein."<note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 67.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I am as ready to confeſs, as the doctor that were the caſe as is here ſuppoſed, there would be no goodneſs, or propriety in the offers of the goſpel. But in truth it is, as it were, infinitely otherwiſe. There is no difficulty in the ſinner's complying with the offers of the goſpel, but what lies in his want of an inclination and true deſire to accept the ſalvation offered; and a ſtrong and obſtinate incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the contrary. The caſe really is, as if the above mentioned lord ſhould find his ſervants in the houſe conſuming by fire, confined by nothing but their own inclination and luſt, all engaged in gaming and drinking. He opens the door and calls upon them to eſcape for their lives, and promiſes them that if they are willing to come to him, and engage in his ſervice, they ſhall be ſafe and happy. But they have ſuch a diſlike to his perſon and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and are to attached to their gaming, &amp;c. that
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:010007_0112_0F7B991CEFFAF580"/>
they abſolutely refuſe to comply with the propoſal. They had rather run the venture of periſhing in the flames: and continue there under the repeated admonitions and calls of their kind lord, untill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable deſtruction comes upon them.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, 'That tho' this ſimilitude may fitly repreſent the caſe of ſinners, who pay no regard to the goſpel, but run with greedineſs in a courſe of ſin; yet the caſe of convinced ſinners, who are concerned about themſelves, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeking deliverance, is different.' It may be obſerved, that there is no material difference, ſo as any way to affect the caſe under conſideration. The ſinner, however exerciſed and concerned he is about himſelf, and whatever pains he takes to better his caſe, and obtain deliverance; if ſtill he does not actually accept of ſalvation; does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe ſo to do from the fixed oppoſition of his heart, to the ſalvation offered: which oppoſition of heart is of the ſame nature and kind, with that of the ſecure ſinner, and is really as voluntary, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way as inexcuſable; and indeed is more appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and exerciſes itſelf in a ſtronger manner, than that of the ſecure ſinner; as the former actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more light, and conviction of conſcience than the latter.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe two criminals, under confinement and ſentence of death, for ſome treaſonable practices againſt their prince. The prince offers to pardon and reſtore them to his favor, if they will heartily repent, aſk his pardon, and ſubmit to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and laws, as excellent and good. One of them pays no regard to the propoſal; but, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about what he has done, and what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:010007_0113_0F7B991E18575A90"/>
upon him, follows his cups, and does not ſo much as ſeriouſly attend to the ſad caſe he is in. The other thinks of the death that is before him with horror, and can neither eat nor ſleep in peace: but, on the whole, cannot find in his heart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the offer. The more he thinks of it, the more his heart riſes againſt his prince. He cannot be willing to aſk his pardon, nor does he deſire to live under his government and laws. He tries e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way he can think of to eſcape death, ſhort of complying with theſe terms. He ſends petitions every day and hour to his prince: hoping to gain his favor upon ſome other conditions. But the longer he tries, the more he is convinced that he muſt periſh, unleſs he heartily complies with the propoſals made him, and the more clearly he ſees and feels the oppoſition of his heart thereto. Now which of theſe traitors is, on the whole, the greateſt criminal in the ſight of the prince? Does the latter do any thing that tends to recommend him to the prince? And if after all he dies, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his refuſing to accept of the offered pardon and deliverance, is it any imputation on the goodneſs of the prince? or does it appear to be the leſs goodneſs in him, becauſe the traitor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the advantage of it? Let common ſenſe decide the queſtion. And by this, the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before us will be decided.</p>
            <p>The terms on which God offers pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to, ſinners, are not "to them impracticable tho' they deſire it." They are no more imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, and in no other ſenſe, than are the terms on which pardon and ſafety are offered by the prince to the traitor, in the inſtance mentioned.
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010007_0114_0F7B991E88AC2B48"/>
If ſinners periſh under the goſpel, 'tis thro' their own obſtinate, continued, voluntary refuſal to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, or truly <hi>deſire</hi> and aſk for offered ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſhall this refuſal of offered mercy; this direct and continued abuſe of God's goodneſs, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it no goodneſs, and ſo change the nature of it, as to turn it into cruelty?

            <p>THE doctor ſeems to think he has done much to ſet the wonderful goodneſs and mercy of God in a clear and ſtricking light, by proving that there are promiſes to the unregenerate. He therefore makes the following, which he calls an <hi>important</hi> inference. <q>We ſee from hence the wonderful goodneſs and mercy of God; in as much as he has given us the ſtrongeſt aſſurance of pardon and eternal life, on ſuch terms as, by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered grace we may all comply with, <hi>if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do it.</hi>

               <note n="(q)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 77.</note> With the doctor's good leave I will ſay, that the goodneſs and mercy of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears equally wonderful, on ſuppoſition there are no promiſes made to the doings of the uneregenerate. For even on this ſuppoſition, "he has given us the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of pardon and eternal life, on ſuch terms as we may comply with if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deſire it. I have therefore as good a right to this inference from my doctrine, as the doctor has from his. Yea I preſume to ſay, <hi>a much better.</hi> In this ſentence the doctor ſuppoſes that the terms on which pardon and ſalvation are offered are ſo difficult, that a real deſire to comply with them, does not get over the difficulty: but there is yet need of God's "offered grace," to aſſiſt and help over that which is otherways inſuperable, by the beſt deſire, and the utmoſt good will in the matter. Whereas, according to the doctrine he oppoſes, <hi>a real deſire to comply,</hi> is the compliance
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010007_0116_0F7B99234D7BC070"/>
itſelf; and is the condition on which pardon and ſalvation are offered; there being no difficulty in coming up to the terms, but what there is in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a real deſire and hearty good will, or a being truely willing to accept of pardon and ſalvation. He who comes to this, has no need of any "of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered grace" to help him to comply with the terms of ſalvation, as the doctor ſuppoſes; but has <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> complied, and has pardon and ſalvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to him. If the doctor's ſcheme then, ſhews the "wonderful goodneſs and mercy of God," that which he oppoſes does ſo, much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
            <p>But what does the doctor mean by his "offered grace," to help thoſe to comply with the terms of ſalvation, who "really deſire to do it?" If there is <hi>a real deſire to comply,</hi> the heart is <hi>really</hi> gained, and there is a real compliance of heart or will, and what more there is required as the condition of pardon and ſalvation, in which the heart or will has no concern; and ſo is not the compliance of the heart, but of ſomething elſe; in order to which compliance we ſtand in need of God's "offered grace," even when the heart has really complied; I ſay, what this is; and how God's "offered grace" helps to it, the doctor has not told, and I am not able to conceive. Untill the doctor ſhall explain this matter, I ſhall conclude, that there is no "offered grace" to enable men to comply with the terms of ſalvation, whoſe hearts do already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comply, and yet can't comply, untill by this "offered grace" they come up to a compliance in which the heart is not concerned, it being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than, and different from a hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010007_0117_0F7B992411065278"/>
I believe, that no compliance with the terms of ſalvation is required but an <hi>hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance</hi>; and if men are by God's grace aſſiſted to ſuch a compliance, they have all the aſſiſtance they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the caſe, in order to obtain pardon; and therefore that God does not offer any other aſſſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in order to a compliance.</p>
            <p>But let us attend a minute longer to this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary paſſage of the doctor's. He ſays, The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful goodneſs and mercy of God appears, "in as much as he has given us the ſtrongeſt aſſurances of pardon and eternal life, on ſuch terms as, by his offered grace, we may all comply with, IF WE REALLY DESIRE TO DO IT." But what if we don't really deſire to do it? Will this in the leaſt fully the goodneſs of God in making the offer on ſuch low terms? The doctor ſuppoſes, in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry putting the caſe, it will not. What then if none of mankind will <hi>really deſire</hi> to comply; or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, really and heartily comply with the terms on which pardon and ſalvation are offered, untill they are regenerated, and have a new heart given them?—Is not the goodneſs of God to be vindicated, and does it not appear to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in offering pardon and eternal life to every one who is heartily willing and deſirous to have them, however far mankind may be from a heart to comply with this condition?</p>
            <p>Dr. Mayhew himſelf, is as clear and full in this, as any one can be: as appears not only from paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages already quoted,<note n="(r)" place="bottom">

It is objected, that if there are no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſucceſs to the endeavours and doings of the unregenerate, in ſeeking the ſalvation of their ſouls;<note n="(t)" place="bottom">THE <hi>reader is deſired to obſerve, and bear in mind, that when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate ſinner is ſpoken of as</hi> ſeeking ſalvation, uſing means and endeavours in order thereto, <hi>or even</hi> hoping for it <hi>expreſſions of their kind are to be underſtood in a ſenſe conſiſtent with his really at heart oppoſing, hating and rejecting the ſalvation which the goſpel offers. This is not properly the object of his deſires and hopes; and therefore not what be ſeeks after, and endeavours to obtain. He does not heartily aſk for, or deſire, the pardon which the goſpel offers; nor that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſin, and that holineſs and happineſs, in which the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation revealed in the goſpel conſiſts: ſo cannot be truly ſaid to endeavour after or hope for this. But the object of his deſires, hopes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, is ſomething elſe; even that deliverance from miſery or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural evil, and that happineſs or natural good, which are naturally and even neceſſarily the objects, of men's deſires from an averſion to miſery, and love of happineſs, which is eſſential to a moral agent; and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the greateſt love to ſin, and moſt perfect oppoſition of heart to that holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.—Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſions are uſed in compliance with the common way of ſpeaking in this matter, and not becauſe it is the language of ſcripture.</hi>
               </note> then there is little or no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſinners to take pains in this matter; in attending on the means of grace: but it tends greatly to diſcourage, and lead them to neglect all means and endeavours for their own ſalvation, if not to indulge themſelves in all manner of licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and known ſin.</p>
            <p>Dr. Mayhew indeed allows, that upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is no certain connection between the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and ſtrivings of the unregenerate, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; yet they are obliged in all reaſon to ſtrive, and do their beſt. He obſerves that men will think it worth while to take the utmoſt pains in the concerns of a worldly nature, when there is an uncertainty with reſpect to the ſucceſs of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: but that, the reaſon and motive to ſtrive

            <p>ANS. WHETHER there is any juſt ground for this objection, the reader muſt judge, when he has attended to the following particulars.</p>
            <p>I. IT does not appear from fact and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that what is ſuppoſed and aſſerted in the objection, is true; but the contrary. There can be no inſtances produced of perſons who have been engaged in a diligent attendance on the means of grace and ſalvation; and have been diſcouraged and left off from this conſideration, that there was no certain connection between what they did, and their ſalvation. Perſons who appear to be in any good degree in earneſt in this matter, are not wont to be diſcouraged in the leaſt by this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. They who profeſs to neglect the concerns of their ſouls becauſe there is no promiſe to the pains they ſhould take, would not be perſuaded to be in earneſt, by all the promiſes that can be imagined; and this appears not to be the true reaſon of their ſitting ſtill, or going on in a way of allowed ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:010007_0121_0F7B9926B67B0580"/>And if it be inquired, Who are generally the moſt in earneſt in the uſe of means? It will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be found, that they are thoſe who believe there are no promiſes made to the doings of the unregenerate: while they who imbrace the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notion, are generally in a great degree care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and negligent; either wholly putting off the concerns of their eternal intereſt for the preſent, or contenting themſelves with that which is very conſiſtent with great ſlothfulneſs in religion, the prevalence of a worldly ſpirit, and a greedy purſuit of the things of time and ſenſe. To be ſure, it does not appear that a belief that the endeavours of the unregenerate are connected with ſalvation has any ſuch influence on perſons to excite and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them earneſtly to attend on the means of grace and ſalvation, as that they who believe this to be true, evidently diſtinguiſh themſelves from others in their endeavours. And where this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is preached up moſt ſtrenuouſly and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it does not appear to have any ſenſible effect, to rouſe and engage ſinners to zeal and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it this matter. Such congregations don't ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be more engaged and painful in the things of religion than others, where the contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is preached. But if there is any viſible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in this reſpect, it is directly the reverſe of this. And wherever there have been the moſt remarkable viſible inſtances of ſinners being awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to a ſuitable concern about their ſouls, and a great and conſtant engagedneſs in attending on means, it has been under the preaching, which is in the whole tenor of it inconſiſtent with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of there being promiſes made to the doings of
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010007_0122_0F7B9928CFED5CB0"/>
unregenerate ſinners: and all their concern and earneſt endeavours have taken place, and continue, under a firm belief of the contrary doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now, if it appears from fact and experience, that the doctrine which aſſerts that there are no promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate, is not matter of diſcouragement to any in conſtantly and earneſtly attending on means; and that the oppoſite doctrine does not influence, to ſtir men up and put them forward in taking pains in this matter; but rather has a contrary influence: have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude, that the objection is groundleſs, however well ſupported by good reaſon, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector may think it to be?</p>
            <p>It appears from fact, that ſinners under the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel more commonly neglect the proper means of grace and ſalvation, live in ſecuriy and ſloth, and ſo finally miſcary, from preſumption, than from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; or for want of greater encouragement and hope. And when they do deſpair, ſo as in any degree to diſcourage them, and prevent their engaged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, painful endeavours, this is never grounded on their ſuppoſing that there are no promiſes to their doings; but upon ſome deluſion. What ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners under the goſpel who are neglecting the means of ſalvation, want, in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in this matter, is to have their <hi>fears</hi> excited, and not their hope. Their hope is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally high enough, and too high in all reaſon; and is therefore preſumption. They ſtand in need of having their fears excited, by a ſight of the dangerous and awful ſtate they are in. And when they have any degree of a juſt ſenſe of this, they will ſtill have all the hope that is conſiſtent with
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010007_0123_0F7B992943B1F028"/>
a juſt fear and concern about themſelves; even on ſuppoſition there are no promiſes made to their endeavours. They therefore who make this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſeem not only to have overlooked matter of fact, but not to attend to human nature, in its natural operations in a ſtate of unregeneracy: and therefore attempt to argue, not only againſt all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: but in in direct oppoſition to reaſon and the nature of things.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. THE doctrine that the doings of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate are connected with ſalvation, as it is preached up by thoſe who hold it, is ſo far from containing in it more encouragement to them than the oppoſite doctrine, that it tends greatly to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> ſinners, who are in any good meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with themſelves, and even to throw them into deſpair.</p>
            <p>According to this doctrine, a ſinner muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh himſelf from others by his doings, as the proper and only ground of his obtaining mercy. And in order to this, his exerciſes and endeavonrs muſt be in ſome ſenſe obedience to God, ſo in ſome degree <hi>good</hi> and acceptable, or at leaſt not wholly unpleaſing to God: ſo that by this he ſhall become a more ſuitable object of mercy, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelf to God's favor. And in order to this, the ſinner muſt really, heartily and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire ſalvation, even the ſalvation which the goſpel offers; and muſt ſtrive for it with the utmoſt earneſtneſs, without intermiſſion; muſt

                  <p>
                     <hi>ACCORDING</hi> to Dr. Mayhew, no ſtriving is ſucceſsful, or connected with ſalvation, but that in which men perſevere in to the end of life. [P. 20.] He ſays, <q>The ſtriving here enjoined, muſt be ſuppoſed to intend ſtriving with <hi>perſeverace</hi>; not for a month a year, or any definite given time; <hi>but as long as it ſhall pleaſe God to conclude us in the world.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this it may be obſerved, That if any are regenerated before they die, or in this life, God does not grant them this favor, and give them a new heart, in fulfilment of any promiſe to their doing; or ſtrivings, or becauſe there is any connection between their ſtrivings, and this gift of a new heart. For if no ſtriving entitles to any promiſe, but that which continues to the end of life, even to the laſt breath, then if a new heart and an intereſt in Chriſt is given <hi>before the end of life,</hi> it is given not as a promiſed mercy; and therefore not out of reſpect to any endeavours of the ſinner, or becauſe they have any connection with it. Therefore they who are regenerated, and became true chriſtians in this life, do not obtain it by their ſtriving, as having any connection with it; but they become ſo by the unpromiſed ſovereign mercy of God. If therefore all who are ſaved are regenerated, or obtain a new heart, and become real, true Chriſtians in this life, then they are all brought into a ſtate of ſalvation, have a ſure title to life, and are intereſted in all the promiſes of the goſpel, not by virtue of their unregenerate ſtrivings, <hi>but before</hi> they obtain any title to God's favor by theſe; becauſe 'tis <hi>before</hi> they have perſevered therein to the end of life.</p>
                  <p>The doctor's promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate, and their certain connection with ſalvation, do at length then turn out to be promiſes that are never fulfilled or rather no promiſes at all; and a connection which is of no avail; but is conſiſtent with their being eternally loſt. For notwithſtanding thoſe promiſes and this connection, they muſt go out of the world unregenerate, or in their ſins; becauſe they are not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to the promiſes, and the connection does not take place, while they are in this life; as the condition is not fulfilled till the laſt breath. And <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> they go out of the world unregenerate, they muſt be damned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are regenerated, and became true chriſtian in the other world, or after death</p>
                  <p>Therefore if any hope to obtain a new heart, and become real chriſtians in this life, they can according to the doctor's plan have no encouragement to ſtrive under the notion of doing that with which ſuch a ſavor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, but muſt ſeek it as an unpromiſed, ſovereign mercy. And they only can be encouraged by the doctor's promiſes, who are willing to wait for a new heart till After they are dead; that is, till it is eternally too late to obtain it, according to the divine conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>The doctor having obſerved that all perſons tho' unregenerate, who deſre ſalvation and ſtrive in order thereto, ſhall be ſaved, unleſs they ceaſe thus to deſire and ſtrive, adds the following words [P. 56, 57] <q>Not to be ſure, without being born of God; but they ſhall be <hi>renewed in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> of their minds,</hi> and conſequently enter into life.</q> If they are born of God in this life, or while "It ſhall pleaſe God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in this world," they receive this favor <hi>before</hi> they have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed the condition of it, and therefore not as what they have a title to by promiſe, for they have not yet fulfilled the condition, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverence in ſtriving <hi>to the end of life.</hi> If they ſhall be born of God, and renewed in the ſpirit of their minds after they are gone out of this world, and ſo out of the body, this is a new doctrine which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been thoug of contrary to ſcripiture. In one word,</p>
                  <p>The doctor ſuppoſes that all who have a new heart given them, receive it as a favor, promiſed to their ſeeking and ſtriving. But in order to their being entitle to this promiſe, they muſt ſeek and ſtrive as long as they are in the world. Therefore, according to him, none are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and made new creatures in this world; but this work is in all caſes put off till after men are dead: So there never was a regenerate perſon or real chriſtian in this life.</p>
               </note> And he who does not do all this, is ſo far from being in the way to ſalvation, that he will certainly be loſt: and therefore can have no reaſonable hope of mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:010007_0125_0F7B992A6E5A7868"/>Now, it is eaſy to ſhew, that ſuch a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the caſe, tends to diſcourage the ſinner who has any degree of juſt views of himſelf, and to land him in deſpair. The ſinner who is brought to any true ſight of himſelf, and belief and ſenſe of eternal things, finds he has an exceeding hard heart, a ſtony heart; as this is never removed till men are regenerated. He finds that he is in no meaſure affected with the things, of God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:010007_0126_0F7B992D14BC5980"/>
as it is reaſonable he ſhould be: and takes pains and ſtrives in no degree anſwerable to the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the matter. He will therefore naturally look upon himſelf, not to be an earneſt ſtriver for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but rather a ſtupid, hardened creature, who though he finds himſelf more concerned about his ſoul than ſome others appear to be; and conſtantly attends on the means of grace, yet cannot view him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as having begun to ſtrive in earneſt; and will therefore naturally be afraid, it is too late for him. And in this caſe, calling upon him earneſtly and perſeveringly to ſtrive for ſalvation as the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which he may hope to be ſaved, will tend to drive him to deſpair; for the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned he is, the more deficiencies he ſees in his endeavours, and the <hi>leſs</hi> they appear to him; ſo that he will naturally conclude, he never ſhall be One of thoſe <hi>ſtrivers.</hi> He alſo finds that he has no real true deſires of the ſalvation which is offered in the goſpel; but is wholly without all good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and inclinations, or any thing which ſhould be acceptable or pleaſing to God; and that there is no foundation in him for this, until his heart is changed. He will therefore deſpair of ever attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this in an unregenerate ſtate: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if he is made to believe that none can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a new heart but thoſe who have theſe good deſires &amp;c. he will of courſe deſpair of ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. In a word, he ſees that he never has, and never ſhall do any good thing, by which he ſhould diſtinguiſh himſelf from others, but natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looks upon himſelf one of the greateſt ſinners; as his own ſins are more in his view, and more attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by him than thoſe of others. He therefore
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:010007_0127_0F7B992DDC4021C8"/>
deſpairs of thus diſtinguiſhing himſelf from others; of doing or obtaining any thing which ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to God's favour, by becoming bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or leſs ſinful than others. So the doctrine that teaches him, he muſt thus diſtinguiſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or periſh, will be ſo far from comforting and encouraging him, that it tends only to diſcourage him: it will be like ſinging ſongs to a heavy heart; and if believed, will certainly deprive him of all hope. The only doctrine that can give ſupport and hope to ſuch a ſinner, and encourage him to attend on means is, <hi>that God has mercy on whom he will have mercy</hi>; and therefore waits not to have ſinners diſtinguiſh, and recommend themſelves to him as more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects of his mercy than others, before he will grant them mercy: but in ſhewing mercy acts as being infinitely above all obligations to any, and as having no regard to worthineſs, or leſs unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as what recommends one to his favor, rather then another. This being the caſe, the greateſt ſinner; he who looks on himſelf the fartheſt from righteouſneſs of any, and himſelf to be the moſt guilty and unworthy, may hope in the uſe of means: and this is his only ſupport.</p>
            <p>If a perſon is but in a ſmall degree concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own ſalvation, and is in no meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced how ſinful and depraved his heart is; and how entirely deſtitute of all good; he may be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and encouraged, under the notion of doing ſomething by which he ſhall diſtinguiſh himſelf, ſo as to become a <hi>more ſuitable</hi> object of mercy than others, and which ſhall intitle him to God's favor. But to what is he encouaged?—Why, to think more highly of himſelf and his doings than
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010007_0128_0F7B992E319B62F8"/>
there is any reaſon for; and to go on in a dull lazy way; while he flatters himſelf he is ſufficiently in earneſt, and is doing ſomething very great and good. This is to flatter him to his own ruin; to keep him eaſy and ſecure in a great degree, or to quaſh any beginning of genuine conviction <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and promote that pride and ſelf confidence which is inconſiſtent with the ſinners attending on means with any good degree of ſolicitude and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs; and muſt be ſlain, in order to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to good.</p>
            <p>IF theſe things are ſo; I think, it will follow.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. THAT though there are no promiſes made to the endeavours and doings of the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate; yet ſinners have all proper encouragement to a diligent uſe of means. Yea all that the nature of the caſe will admit of.</p>
            <p>If the doctrine, that there are promiſes to the doings of the unregenerate, does not in fact, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reaſon of things, tend to encourage and excite ſinners to a proper and diligent uſe of means; but really has directly the contrary ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: then the oppoſite doctrine affords all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and poſſible encouragement thereto, and is the only plan on which ſinners may be addreſſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their ſtate and diſpoſition, ſo as to excite them earneſtlly to uſe means with all proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of encouragement and hope: and ſo as ſhall tend to anſwer the proper end of means.</p>

            <p>ANS. THE means of grace and ſalvation may be conſidered as including every thing which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted and tends to communicate light and truth, reſpecting the things of a moral nature, to the mind of man; or to lead his mind to attend to truth, and to excite thoſe ideas which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or proper, in order to right exerciſes.</p>

It is in the view of this that the mind exerciſes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf properly, and has true enjoyment. This is the food and life of the mind: Was there no truth, there could be no virtue, or real happineſs. As ſin and miſery conſiſt ſummarily in the darkneſs of the mind, and its alienation from, and oppoſition to light and truth; ſo all true holineſs, and proper mental enjoyment, conſiſts in thoſe exerciſes which are implied and involved in a proper view and ſenſe of truth; the truth, I mean, which relates to God's moral government and kingdom.</p>
            <p>But then, all thoſe things, thoſe inſtitutions and exerciſes, which tend to inſtruct mankind in the knowledge of truth; to excite the attention; to convey truth to the mind, and hold it up in its view: all theſe, I ſay, are in a more remote ſenſe the means of grace and ſalvation. Such are all thoſe things, thoſe circumſtances and events in the natural and moral world, which are adapted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct mankind. Such, in a ſpecial manner is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation; and all thoſe inſtitutions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments therein, to be attended on by men.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:010007_0131_0F7B993117525258"/>
Such are reading the bible, public and private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, religious converſation, ſerious medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on divine things, &amp;c. and particularly PRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, which is the moſt ſolemn way of meditating on divine truth, as it is done as in the preſence of of God, and in a ſolemn addreſs to him, and has a ſpecial and peculiar tendency to awaken, inſtruct and affect the mind.</p>
            <p>USING theſe means intends two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Taking methods with men to ſet truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them and inſtruct them, and awaken their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Thus God is uſing means with men in his providence, which is every way calculated to give inſtruction to a ſinful world. But more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially by giving the revelation which is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bible; and ordering it to be publiſhed and preached to the world. And according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, men are uſing means with others for their ſalvation, by public and private inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Perſons themſelves attending on theſe means. This is ſuppoſed in the uſe of means, juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: for if there were none to attend on means, there would be no ſuch thing as uſing means with any, for their inſtruction. For the end of instruction cannot be anſwered, where there is no attention to the inſtruction given: ſo no pains tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to get inſtruction. He who cannot have the attention of thoſe, with whom he attemps to uſe means, fails of anſwering the proper end of means entirely: and what he does is as much in vain, as to any benefit to the perſons with whom he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as if they were ſtocks or ſtones. So that
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:010007_0132_0F7B993189389498"/>
God's uſing means with men for their inſtruction and ſalvation, and directing men to uſe means with others, ſuppoſes the propriety and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of attending on theſe means. There would have been no wiſdom or propriety in making a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, if there were none to attend to it, and uſe all proper means to underſtand it, and get the inſtruction there given. To what purpoſe would it be to preach a ſermon, or write a book in order to inſtruct men, if none were to hear or read? And what reaſon and propriety would there be in it? The propriety and reaſonableneſs of taking any pains or method to inſtruct men, or uſing any means with them to this end, ſuppoſes it proper and reaſonable, that they ſhould give all that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and take all thoſe pains, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in order to be under the beſt advance to get the inſtruction given. Now this is the ſum of what is meant by being in the uſe of means.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">THEY who inſiſt upon it that there is no reaſon why, men ſhould be in the uſe of any means for their inſtruction and ſalvation, and yet are uſing means with others for their inſtruction by converſation preaching or writing, ſeem to be guilty of an inconſiſtence. For if it is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to uſe any means for inſtruction 'tis unreaſonable to attend to what they write or ſpeak in order to this; conſequently it is unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for them to write or ſpeak. If the inſtruction they give is worthy to be attended to; then the bible is worthy to be attended to, and it is reaſonable and proper to take all poſſible pains to underſtand it And this implies the conſtant and diligent uſe of all means of grace and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> To uſe or attend the means of grace, is to make uſe of all the means of inſtruction in the things that relate to God's moral kingdom; to go into that conduct and practice, and do all thoſe things, which tend to lead us into the knowledge of the truths, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, and to keep up the attention of
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:010007_0133_0F7B9932C2428590"/>
the mind to them: and carefully to avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever has a contrary tendency.</p>
            <p>QUEST. II. WHY are means to be uſed, and what end does this anſwer? Or of what advantage is it to uſe means? What motive and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there to this?</p>
            <p>It has has been obſerved that the end of uſing or attending on the means of grace is inſtructuſing or ther to lead the mind to the knowledge of that truth which it was before ignorant of, or to renew the attention to truth already known, and fix the mind upon it. The queſtion now is, What end this inſtruction anſwers; Of what advantage is it to have the truth ſet before the mind; and to have the attention of the mind fixed upon it?</p>
            <p>ANS. THE benefit, advantage and importance of this to men, is juſt as great as that of an external, divine revalation. For divine revelation is of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to men no further than it is attended to and underſtood. The world is as well without it, as with it, if no inſtruction is given; but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction comes only by attending to the things revealed, in the uſe of means. If therefore the revelation which God has made in the bible, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to be of any benefit to mankind, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their eternal ſalvation; it is of equal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to mankind to attend to this revelation, in the diligent uſe of all proper means; that hereby they may get and retain the inſtruction given therein: for without this it will certainly be in vain to them. A revelation not underſtood, is of no more advantage than no-revelation at all. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010007_0134_0F7B99336DDC18D8"/>
means are to be uſed in order to obtain the knowledge of the truths contained in the bible, and to fix and impreſs them on the mind.</p>
            <p>In order to the ſalvation of men, it is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary that they ſhould have the ideas and knowledge of thoſe things which relate to this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and in which it conſiſts. He who has no idea in his mind of any thing, is not capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exerciſe of heart, or of any mental enjoyment. No man is capable of any exerciſe about that of which he has no idea or knowledge. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a man ſhould repent, and believe the goſpel, ſo long as he has no knowledge of thoſe truths, in the view of which, repentance and faith are exerciſed. Therefore if repentance and faith in Chriſt are neceſſary in order to ſalvation, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe things contained in divine revelation, without which there can be no ſuch exerciſe, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually neceſſary. But this knowledge can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only in the uſe of means.</p>
            <p>There are but two poſſible ways in which the knowledge of the truths, which are neceſſary to be known in order to ſalvation, can be obtained, viz. by <hi>immediate</hi> revelation, or inſpiration; or by an external mediate one, or by means The latter is the way which God has taken to ſet theſe truths before the mind. Therefore the knowledge of them is not to be obtained in any way but in the uſe of means.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">If the thief on the croſs, and Soul the perſecutor ſhould be thought by any to be converted and ſaved without attending on means; they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to conſider, that the former was ſurrounded with means of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and it is apparent that he was all attention.

God may order things ſo that a perſon may get that inſtruction in a few hours, or minutes which it takes another years to obtain. Yet the inſtruction which the former obtains, is no more without attention and the uſe of means, than that of the latter: and therefore is no arguments againſt the neceſſary of the uſe of means, in oder to get inſtruction.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:010007_0135_0F7B99365C675108"/>In proportion therefore as men feel the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and worth of ſalvation, will they be engaged in the diligent attendance on the means of grace, as neceſſary in order thereto, and ſo the only way in which they may hope to obtain it.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that I am now ſpeaking of that knowledge which the mind is capable of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of any degree of right taſte or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, or which the mind may have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcerning and reliſhing the beauty of divine things: And is what is commonly meant by <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> or doctrinal knowledge. This knowledge is to be obtained only in the uſe of means, and is neceſſary in order to repentance, or any right ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe or heart: tho' no degree of it does imply, or is certainly connected with, any truely virtuous or holy exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The unregenerate are certainly capable of great degrees of this knowledge, which may much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and affect their minds.<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

of their own ſtate as ſinners. They are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of every thing of this kind, but what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon, conſiſts in, or reſults from a ſight and diſcerning of the true beauty or moral excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of divine things. This is indeed a kind of knowledge which is peculiar to the regenerate; the foundation of which is laid in their having a, <hi>new heart.</hi> The former is neceſſary in order to the latter, as it is ſuppoſed and implied in it: For there can be no diſcerning of the beauty of thoſe objects, of which the mind has no ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive idea.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be aſked, What good all this inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and knowledge will do the unregenerate, who are under the dominion of a hard and impenitent heart, and will continue ſo untill a new heart is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in regeneration? If this knowledge will be of no ſervice to them, and really do them no good, and they are yet as far from ſalvation as ever; then there is no encouragement for them to attend on the means of grace, in order to obtain it, and keep up a view and ſenſe of the truths of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in their minds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer,</hi> it is certain the unregenerate do not exerciſe any true virtue in their attendance on the means of grace, however engaged and diligent they are, and whatever pains they, take in this matter. And there is no connection between the inſtruction or knowledge they obtain hereby, and holineſs. Yea, the impenitent ſinner, who continues obſtinately to reject and oppoſe the ſalvation offered in the goſpel, does in ſome reſpects, yea, on the whole, become, not leſs, but more vicious and guilty in God's ſight,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:010007_0137_0F7B9938150F8A60"/>
the more inſtruction and knowledge he gets in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the means of grace. The more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſees his own wretched caſe as a ſinner, and the dreadful conſequence of dying in his ſins; and the clearer conviction he has of his need of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and of the truths of the goſpel in general; the greater is the crime of his impenitence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to reject the ſalvation offered in the goſpel. The awakened, convinced ſinner, who has taken a great deal of pains in the uſe of means, and has hereby got a great degree of inſtruction and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and yet continues impenitent, is in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect much more guilty and vile, and a greater cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in God's ſight, than if he had never attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this conviction and knowledge: For now he is guilty of the abuſe of, and oppoſition to, all this light and knowledge, which he could not be, while he had it not. Yea, his impenitence, and and all his ſins are ſo aggravated by the light and conviction he obtains, that whatever particular ways of known ſin he has forſaken, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoever external duties he attends upon; yet, on the whole, he is undoubtedly a greater ſinner, than he was when he lived in ſecurity and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the means of grace. So that the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, unregenerate ſinner does not grow better, but rather grows worſe, by all the inſtruction and knowledge he gets in the uſe of means. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, convinced ſinners, with whom moſt means are uſed, and who are moſt attentive to the concerns of their ſouls, and moſt in earneſt in the uſe of means, are commonly, if not always, really more guilty and odious in God's ſight than they who are ſecure and at eaſe in their ſins.</p>

Chriſt. The goſpel proves to them a "ſavor of death unto death." Conſequently the more light and conviction men have, the more their attention is awakened to the things of the goſpel, and the more means they attend upon, and are uſed with them, while they continue obſtinately to oppoſe light and truth, and reject the offers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the more guilty and vile, and the greater cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals are they in God's ſight.</p>

And if they live and die impenitent, their condemnation will be more intolerable, than if they had never had that conviction and knowledge which by their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the goſpel they have obtained. So that the good the ſinner gets, by a conſtant attendance on the means of grace, while he continues im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, is not a becoming in any degree virtuous or holy hereby; or on the whole, leſs vicious and criminal in God's ſight.</p>
            <p>However, there is yet a reaſon why the ſinner ſhould diligently attend all means of inſtruction and knowledge, and ſufficient encouragement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For,</p>
            <p>I. WITHOUT this inſtruction and knowledge, which is to be obtained by thoſe only who are
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:010007_0140_0F7B993ADFF9F578"/>
uſing the proper means of it, the ſinner cannot be ſaved, as has been ſhewn. This knowledge being abſolutely neceſſary in order to ſalvation, he who is without it, has a fatal barr in the way of his ſalvation: And ſo far as this is obtained; this barr or impediment is removed out of the way; and ſo he is in a more likely way to be ſaved than thoſe who are in ſecurity and ignorance. For ſurely he who has obtained one thing which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to ſalvation, is in a more likely way to be ſaved than he who has not obtained it, nor is in the way of it, all other circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal, however uncertain it may be that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be ſaved. In order to ſalvation ſeveral things are neceſſary. He cannot be ſaved who does not believe; and he cannot believe who has not heard, and attended to the report of the goſpel; ſo has no right ſpeculative notions about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of faith; and he cannot hear and underſtand, who has not the advantage of divine revelation<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See Rom</hi> x. 14, 17.</note> Now he who enjoys divine revelation, and attends to it with the utmoſt concern and diligence; ſo is in the way to get right ſpeculative notions of the objects of faiths and obtain all that is implied in hearing, is more likely to be ſaved, than he who either does not live under the goſpel, or if he does, never attends to it, and uſes no proper means to underſtand it. I ſay, the former is more likely to be ſaved, than the latter, becauſe he has more of thoſe things which are neceſſary in order to this, than the latter. If <hi>hearing,</hi> which is the ſame with a diligent attendance on the means of grace,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:010007_0141_0F7B993B596B2BF0"/>
is neceſſary in order to faith and ſalvation; then they who are concerned about the ſalvation of their ſouls, will be proportionably concerned and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to <hi>hear,</hi> and get inſtruction, as the only way in which they may hope to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>It may be alſo farther obſerved,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, As that inſtruction and knowledge which is to be had only by hearing, in a diligent and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt attendance on the means of grace, is neceſſary in order to the exerciſe of repentance and faith, and ſo in order to ſalvation; ſo the way in which this knowledge is to be obtained, is the only way in which ſinners may hope for a new heart, or to obtain regenerating grace.</p>
            <p>As he who has no doctrinal acquaintance with the truths contained in God's word, is not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to exerciſe any chriſtian grace or virtue, whatever foundation there might be for this in the renovation of his mind by regeneration, no one has reaſon to expect that his heart will be thus renewed by the ſpirit of God, while he is in this caſe. God can doubtleſs as eaſily change the heart of the moſt ignorant, deluded, Mahometan, or heathen, yea the moſt blind, ſtupid Hottentot in the world, as that of the moſt awakened, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſinner under the goſpel. But if he ſhould do ſo by the regenerating influences of his Spirit, there could be no right and proper exerciſes of <hi>chriſtian</hi> virtue and holineſs; becauſe ſuch an one is without any right ſpeculative knowledge of thoſe truths, in the view of which alone chriſtian holineſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed. And giving a new heart, or a right taſte and temper of mind, would not remove this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:010007_0142_0F7B993BE36B4E78"/>
This only prepares the mind to diſcern and reliſh the beauty and ſweetneſs of divine things, when ſet before it in the uſe of means; but does not give any new ſpeculative ideas or knowledge. Therefore we have no reaſon to think God ever does ſo.</p>
            <p>And as the caſe is in a great degree the ſame with thoſe under the goſpel, who have never attended, to it in earneſt, they have no reaſon to expect to become new creatures by God's regenerating in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, ſo long as they are in this ſituation. But in order to this, they muſt firſt be made to attend to the goſpel with that concern and earneſtneſs which is neceſſary in order to their learning the character of the juſt God and Saviour, and underſtand their own ſtate and circumſtances as ſinners, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which no careleſs neglecters of the means of grace ever do: for untill they come to this, grace or the new creature could have no opportunity to exert itſelf properly, or according to its nature; but muſt lie dormant and inactive, ſo anſwer no good end: therefore not to be expected before, or in any other way. For God does not give life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is any proviſion for the ſupport of it, or any materials by which it may ſubſiſt, and exert itſelf according to its own proper nature. Truth may be ſaid to be the food on which the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lives, and is abſolutely neceſſary to the leaſt motion of life, or exerciſe of holineſs in the heart. Therefore the mind that has no ſpeculative view and conviction of thoſe truths, in the ſight and ſenſe of which eſpecially chriſtian holineſs is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; but embraces the contrary errors <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

for the exerciſe and ſupport of the divine life: And none have any reaſon to expect it will be implanted, or a new heart given, while the man is in ſuch a ſtate.</p>
            <p>When God created man, he did not firſt form him while the earth was in its chaotic ſtate, when it was without form, and void and darkneſs was upon the face of the deep: he did not create him with all his bodily ſenſes and appetites, before there were any objects towards wnich they might exerciſe themſelves in a manner proper to man's nature, and ſo as to ſupport and promote ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal life, and afford proper enjoyment and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He did not form an eye before there was any light, or objects to be beheld: He did not produce animal life, dependant on food for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupport and exerciſe, and an appetite for that food, before any materials were made, to become proper food, ſuited to the appetite, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and nouriſh life. He did not form man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had provided any place for his ſubſiſting and exerciſing himſelf in a manner proper and ſuited to his nature. No: He <hi>firſt</hi> ceated an external world, a proper dwelling place for man, furniſhed with materials ſuited to the ſenſes; appetites and life of ſuch a creature; that there might be a foundation and opportunity for proper exerciſes and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſoon as he ſhould be created. And we he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate not to ſay, that this was agreeable to wiſdom; and that the contrary would not be ſo.</p>
            <p>So in the new creation, God will not form the new creature where there is no proper proviſion, where there are no materials for the life and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the new man, ſo no opportunity to act,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:010007_0144_0F7B993ED8C0C2F0"/>
and to act in a manner proper and ſuitable to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But proper materials for this new life muſt firſt be provided. The mind muſt be properly ſtored with ſpeculative ideas of divine things, and the judgment convinced of the truth; in order to which the man muſt be all attention to theſe things in a ſenſe of their high importance to him, as his whole, his eternal intereſt turns upon them. When things are thus prepared a new heart may be given with propriety and wiſdom, as the new creature will now nave opportunity to act in a way anſwerable to its nature, and ſo to the glory of God.</p>
            <p>Chriſt would not raiſe Lazarus to lite ſo long as the ſtone lay on the cave. It was proper the ſtone which would hinder his coming forth, were he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, ſhould be firſt taken a way. In this caſe to neglect to take away the ſftone would have been an effectual bar in the way of his reſurrection; and the moſt likely method that could be taken to have him raiſed from the dead was to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Ignorance of, and inattention to the truths of divine revealation, may be compared to this ſtone. The only likely way for the ſinner to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſubject of a ſpiritual reſurrection, is to have this taken away, by becoming all attention to the things contained in God's word. And the more inſtruction the ſinner has, the more fully and clearly he is convinced of thoſe truths which do moſt nearly concern him; and the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and earneſtly he attends to divine truth by hearing, reading, meditation, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the more his mind is impreſſed and affected with it, as the minds of the unregenerate may be; the more hope there is in his caſe; the more likely it
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:010007_0145_0F7B99403319D150"/>
is that he ſhall become a new creature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the ſaving of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>This view of the matter ſerves to ſhew what is the advantage of knowledge to the unregenerate ſinner, even the knowledge which no openly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or careleſs ſinner ever obtains; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnableneſs and importance of uſing means with ſuch by conſtant public and private inſtruction, &amp;c. and of their earneſtly attending on all proper means of inſtruction; and conſequently the motive and encouragement there is to this. Moreover,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, FACT and experince ſerve to ſtrengthen the foregoing obſervations and reaſoning, and ſhew the advantage there is in attending on the means of grace, and hold forth the proper encouragement thereto. For it appears from experience that this is the moſt, the only likely way to obtain regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace and ſalvation. None, I ſuppoſe, will diſpute whether more have been converted and ſaved of thoſe who have attended on the means of grace, than of thoſe who have not, in proportion to their numbers. All will grant that many were ſaved who attended on the preaching of John the Baptiſt, Chriſt, and his apoſtles; many more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of thoſe who attended, than of thoſe who did not enjoy or attend theſe means. Our Saviour indeed ſays that publican's and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots went into the kingdom of God before, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the chief prieſts and elders of the Jews. But this is ſo far from being an objection againſt what has been juſt obſerved, that it ſerves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. For publicans and harlots attended much more on Chriſt's preaching, and much better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:010007_0146_0F7B994105DA4A80"/>
the things relating to the kingdom of God than they. The former attended ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and were ſo much in his company, that it was made an objection againſt him, and he was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed often to vindicate his conduct with reſpect to them.</p>
            <p>It therefore appears from fact and experience that they are in the moſt likely way to be ſaved, who attend on the means of grace And when the matter is attended to, the reaſon of this may eaſily be ſeen, as has been ſhewn above. We therefore now ſee what advantage there is in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on means, and what is the proper motive aid encouragement thereto. When any one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to his eternal intereſt, and feels the infinite importance of it to him, and at the ſame time ſees the undone, wretched ſtate he is in as a ſinner, he will with all his might purſue that method which appears moſt likely to obtain deliverance from the evil he fears, and promote this intereſt. Let the only way be pointed out to him in which he may have hope, and he will want no farther motive and encouragement to attend to it with reſolution and earneſtneſs. This will prove, in all ſuch caſes, a ſufficient motive and encouragement, and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail effectually to influence the perſon who is ſenſible his <hi>all</hi> lies at ſtake, and enters into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite importance of the matter to him. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any ſit ſtill in the neglect of the means of grace, it is not owing to any deficiency in the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attend upon them; but to ſtupidity with regard to their own caſe, and their eternal intereſt. And if this encouragement is not effectual, no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, or even poſſible, encouragement would be ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:010007_0147_0F7B9941B466AC40"/>IF any ſhould ſay, that promiſes to the ſinner's endeavours and perſevering attendance on means, would raiſe the encouragement much higher: for then there would be no diſcouragement, but an abſfolute certainty of ſucceeding in ihis way; the following particulars may perhaps ſerve to diſcover their miſtake.</p>
            <p>I. If there were ſuch promiſes made, the ſfin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner would be ſo far from being abſolutely certain of ſalvation in a way of attendance on means, that the probability, in his view, and his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not be at all increaſed hereby. And that for two reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſinner could never come to any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that he had fulfiled the condition to which the promiſe is made, or that he is in a likely way to fulfil it. 1. Becauſe he could never be certain that he had come up to that <hi>preciſe</hi> degree of earneſt ſtriving and diligent attendance on means, to which the promiſe is made.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Indeed he may be <hi>certain,</hi> as long as he lives, that he has not yet fulfilled the condition; becauſe he has not attained to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> ſo long as he has one breath more ſo draw, however great the degree of his endeavours now are. The ſinner therefore can be very <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> regements from ſuch a promiſe of being delivered from the miſerable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of unregenerates, and becoming a true chriſtian, in this life as has been before obſerved. And this is the ſame with no encouragement at all.</note> If there are any promiſes made to the doings of the unregenerate, they are made not to any <hi>certain kind</hi> of exerciſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, ſo that the loweſt degree of this kind of ſeeking intitles to the promiſe, but to a <hi>certain degree</hi> of this kind, which is not, neither can be preciſely pointed out, and diſtinguiſhed from ſome lower degree, to which the promiſe is not made, ſo that the ſinner can ever be certain that he has attained
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:010007_0148_0F7B994270BC6120"/>
to that degree. And however near he comes to it, if he, after all, finally falls ſhort in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he is as far from ſalvation, in this way, as if he had done nothing. This therefore would tend to perplex, rather than incourage the ſinner. Yea, the ſinner who has the cleareſt view of the viciouſneſs of his own heart, and the greateſt ſenſe of the reallity and importance of eternal things, will be fartheſt from imagining that he has attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that degree of earneſtneſs of endeavour to which the promiſe is made: and will be moſt ready to conclude againſt himſelf, as being a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, indolent, ſottiſh wretch, and deſpair of ever obtaining ſalvation in this way. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If the ſinner could be certain that he has attained to that degree of earneſtneſs of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which will intitle him to the promiſe, if he <hi>perſeveres</hi> in it: yet he can have no certainty of perſevering, ſo no certainty of ſalvation. As his perſeverance depends wholly on himſelf, his own will and reſolution, and ſo he has nothing to rely upon but himſelf for it, 'tis the moſt uncertain thing in the world that he ſhall perſevere. He can have confidence in nothing, in this caſe, but his own deceitful heart which is indeed only the confidence and preſumption of a <hi>fool</hi>: for "he that truſteth in his own heart is a tool."<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> xxviii. 26.</note> If he is ſufficiently in earneſt and painful in his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for ſome time; yet if after all that, he is in any degree remiſs and negligent one day, or but one hour, all is loſt, and he has got all to begin again; for he has failed of perſeverance. And
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:010007_0149_0F7B99432F6C4DF8"/>
how does he know that it is not now eternally too late! So that his ſalvation, on this footing, is the moſt uncertain, precarious thing in the world: or rather may moſt reaſonably be deſpaired of. He who knows his own heart, ſo far as he who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proper, geneuine convictions does, can take no encouragement from this quarter. This is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to flatter and bolſter up the unreaſonably ſelf confident and fool-hardy. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such promiſes, were there any, would only tend to encourage men in a ſelf confidence, which is as oppoſite to the whole tenor of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the peculiar genius and glory of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as darkneſs is to light; ſo that the more the ſinner has of it, the farther he is from Chriſt, and the more blind to the way of ſalvation by him. The preaching up ſuch promiſes therefore, will tend to fix perſons in their ſelf confidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, who have no good degree of genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their ſinful, miſerable ſtate, and to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them down in eaſe and ſecurity; ſo to pervert the benefit of the means of grace and fruſtrate the great end and deſign of them, which is to give light and inſtruction to the ſinner. But to thoſe who are in any meaſure convinced of their true ſtate; ſo know how little depandence there is on themſelves, how vile and fottiſh their hearts are, this doctrine will give no encouragement: but will have directly the contrary influence on them, if they can be made to believe it, as has been before ſhewn.</p>
            <p>QUEST. III. WHAT obligations are men under to uſe means?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="unknown:010007_0150_0F7B994453B4D0A8"/>ANS. THEY ſeem to be under the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this, as they are to repent and believe the goſpel. If God commands all men every where to repent, then he requires of them all that is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, or is neceſſary in order to, repentance. He therefore requires of them to underſtand thoſe truths which are neceſſary to be known in order to repentance: conſequently requires all that attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the things contained in divine revelation, which is neceſſary in order to underſtand thoſe truths, a right ſpeculative knowledge of which is implied in repentance. But this implies a diligent uſe of the means of grace, as has been ſhewn. A neglect of any of thoſe things, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in, or neceſſary in order to repentance, is a neglect of, and oppoſition to, the command to repent; ſo a counteracting and violating our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to repent. But he is guilty of this, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects the means of grace. It has been ſhewn that there is a certain degree of ſpeculative knowledge neceſſary in order to exerciſe repentance, which they never have who live in the neglect of all means of grace. Therefore the command to repent, is a command to attend all thoſe means neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attain that knowledge. If men are under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obligation to attend to the command to repent and be converted, or to obey this command, they are under obligation to all that, which is implied in this, or neceſſary on their parts in order to it: therefore are under obligation to hear and attend to the truths contained in God's word, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt concern and diligence.</p>
            <p>The preaching the goſpel therefore, which is the ſame with a testifying to all men repentance
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:010007_0151_0F7B9944C13C8358"/>
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; is a call unto all to hearken and attend, as this is implied in repentance and faith. But to hearken and attend, implies the whole that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the uſe of means. Therefore if any preacher of the goſpel doubts whether he has any warrant to call upon and exhort ſinners to attend the means of grace; he appears not well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he is about: for he is really doing this, while he is calling upon and exhorting them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?<note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>THEY</hi> are indeed <hi>already</hi> attending on means, while he is preaching the goſpel to them. This is ſuppoſed; for if they give no attention to what he ſays, why does he ſpeaks? Every word he ſays, is in effect a call attend And his manifeſting his intention to preach in any future time, is a call upon them to attend. For if their attending is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and important, there is no reaſon in his.preaching; ſo his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to do it is fooliſh and abſurd: conſequently his doing it <hi>now</hi> is ſo In this view then he tho undertakes to preach the goſpel; and yet holds that ſinners are not to he called up a to attend means, is guilty of a glaring abſurdity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And it may be here obſerved, that this is the ſcriptural way of calling upon men to attend means, viz. to call on them to repent and believe the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And they who ſo far attend to this call as to feel the infinite importance to themſelves that they ſhould comply with it, will of courſe, and of their own accord go into a diligent uſe of means. Many public teachers therefore ſeem to make a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take here. Inſtead of calling upon all to repent and believe the goſpel, as the only condition of God's favor and eternal life, the moſt they do, with relation to unregenerate ſinners, is to exhort and urge them to theſe doings which are ſhort of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:010007_0152_0F7B99456DFBE960"/>
repentance. They teach them to uſe means in ſuch a manner, as rather tends to defeat the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of means, and ſo as that they become a means of blinding their eyes, rather then of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction; it tends to lead them to reſt in means, and make a Saviour of them; to quiet and heal them ſhort of repentance, and a ſaving application to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>OBJ. Whatever obligations ſinners are under to attend the means of grace: yet if they attend, they ſtill ſin in all they do, while they continne impenitent, yea they are conſtantly growing worſe and more guilty, the more pains they take, and as light and conviction increaſe. What obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do they then fulfil? And is not this ſufficient matter of diſcouragement?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I. They do not properly fulfil their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, if they ſtop ſhort of true repentance, or real holineſs; for nothing ſhort of this is true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's law. Nevertheleſs, a neglect of the means is an inſtance of the violation of the obligation they are under, which they are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of who do attend with concern and engaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however guilty and vile they may be in other reſpects; which guilt and vileneſs may be greatly aggravated by their attendance on means. If a man forbear to kill his neighbour, certainly he does not violate the obligations he is under not to kill, as he does who takes away his neighbour's life, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever far he may be from any true love to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or obedience to any of God's commands; and though he may, on the whole, be more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the murtherer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:010007_0153_0F7B9949C93D6EC8"/>If a father calls after, and commands his two ſons, who are running from him, with a deſign to quit his family and government, as what they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly hate, immediately to return back, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to his authority: If they ought to obey their father's command, then they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obligation to ſtop and attend to what he has to ſay; for this is implied in what he requires, and nceſſary in order to it. Therefore if one turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and attend to what his father has to ſay to him, while the other ſtops his ears, and runs on till he is out of hearing, the former does not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the obligation to ſtop and hearken, which the latter does, though if he continues to hate his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and refuſes to return and ſubmit to his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he cannot be ſaid to obey his father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and may, by the light and conviction laid before him by his father, in conſequence of his flopping and attending, be more guilty in refuſing to ſubmit <hi>to him than</hi> the other who has been out of hearing.</p>
            <p>And if any by-ſtander, who ſees them running; oft, ſhould tell them to ſtop and hear what their father ſays, he would herein act a friendly part both to them and their father, and perfectly coincide with his command to them to return and ſubmit themſelves to him. Indeed, if he ſhould inculcate this upon them ſo as to leave their father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to return, &amp;c. out of view, dwelling on this as if it was the only thing that they had to do: Or as what would on the whole recommend them to their father, and intereſt them in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; or render them leſs diſpleaſing to him, tho', after all, they perſiſted in their refuſal to return
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:010007_0154_0F7B994A52020028"/>
and ſubmit to him. I ſay, if he ſhould treat the matter ſo, it would be ſo far from vindicating the father's authority, and coinciding with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that he might juſtly look upon it at taking part with his rebellious ſons, ſetting up againſt him, and flattering them to their own ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> II. However ſinful and abominable in God's fight the impenitent are in all they do, even in attendance on the means of grace, their ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does not conſiſt meerly in this; it does not conſiſt in their concern about their eternal intereſt: in their dread of miſery, and deſire to eſcape it, and obtain happineſs, nor in their uſing means in order to this, in reading, hearing praying, &amp;c. but in their impenitency, in the oppoſition of their hearts to holineſs, and the only way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in thoſe things which are the attendants and conſequence of this, or in the want of their oppoſites, with which all their exerciſes are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore very criminal. But this can be no reaſon why they ſhould neglect the proper means of ſalvation. If "the plowing of the wicked is ſin," ſhall they therefore not-plow? Shall they not deſire food for themſelves and their families, and take the moſt likely method to obtain it?—Their ſin does not conſiſt meerly in their plowing, ſo that it would be a leſs ſin not to plow, than to do it; but in the wrong views and exerciſes of mind with which they plow, and in the want of right ones.</p>
            <p>And if by attending, praying, reading, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. the impenitent ſinner grows more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and vile, as his light and conviction increaſes this is not properly owing to uſe of means; but to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:010007_0155_0F7B994B385CF480"/>
to the rooted viciouſneſs of the heart. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on means is indeed the occaſion of it, as by this, greater light and conviction takes place in the mind: and the wickedneſs of the heart takes occaſion by this light to exert itſelf with a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand, and more obſtinately.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> III. The ſinner's growing no better, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worſe, more guilty and vile, the more light he has and the greater advantages he enjoys, while he continues impenitent, is really no matter of diſcouragement from attending means in order to get light and inſtruction, &amp;c. For in the goſpel there is no more encouragement given to a leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than to a greater; that he ſhall find mercy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the other, while both continue impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and oppoſers of the way of ſalvation therein revealed. No one ſinner has any reaſon to hope that he ſhall be ſaved rather than an other, becauſe he has not been, or is not now, ſo great a ſinner as others, while he is impenitent, and at heart an enemy to the goſpel. Never did a ſinner find acceptance with God, on account of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſmallneſs of his ſins, or his reformations, which were ſhort of an hearty compliance with the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. We indeed read of one who took his encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement that God would accept and favor him, from his imagining himſelf not ſo criminal and vile as others. But what was the conſeqnence? He was rejected: While one who took his encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hope for God's mercy quite from another quarter, and which was conſiſtent with his view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf as the chief of ſinners, found favor.<note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See Luke</hi> xviii. 9-14.</note>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:010007_0156_0F7B994B8642DC08"/>
The goſpel offers ſalvation to the greateſt ſinners: they are as welcome as any other; they are as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and he is as ready to beſtow ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon them, as if their ſins were not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great, if they will heartily embrace offered mercy, ſubmit to, and truſt in a Mediator. In this reſpect there is as much encouragement to the moſt guilty and vile, as to any whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And as to obtaining a new heart by regenerating grace, they who are the chief of ſinners, have as much encouragement to hope for this, in the uſe of means, as they whoſe ſins are leſs aggravated, and not ſo many or great. It does not appear from ſcripture, that God chooſes out the leaſt ſinners to be the objects of this mercy; or that he withholds it from any meerly becauſe they are ſo guilty and hateful in his ſight: or that he waits till men who have been great ſinners are ſo reformed as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, all things conſidered, leſs vile and guilty. And there is not any thing in the bible that ſhould lead us to think, that God beſtows his regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace on the leaſt ſinners more commonly than on thoſe who are greater: But we find much there to teach us, that if he ever does this, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>cauſe</hi> they are leſs ſinners than others; but for ſome other reaſon.</p>
            <p>If ſinners were to take their only encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hope for ſalvation in the uſe of means, from their being leſs ſinners than others, or not ſo bad as they once were, this would tend to take all encouragement from thoſe who are under genuine convictions, and have any true view of their own ſinfulneſs, and leave them in abſolute deſpair. For all ſuch, as they have a more clear and full ſight
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:010007_0157_0F7B994C31B41348"/>
of their own ſins than they can have of others, ara naturally led to view themſelves as the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And as by attendance on means, they get more and more acquainted with their own hearts, their own ſinfulneſs increaſes in their view, they are ſo far from looking on themſelves as leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners than they were, that they naturally view themſelves in a contrary light</p>

He will then know that the great wickedneſs of his heart, exerciſed in all he does, and his appearing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to grow worſe rather than better, which is commonly the chief ground of diſcouragement to ſuch, is really no reaſon why he ſhould neglect means; but rather an encouragement conſtantly to attend. For this ſight and conviction of his own ſinfulneſs, which is neceſſary in order to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is kept up in his mind and encreaſed, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by attending on means. In this view his own experience ſerves to ſhew the advantage of uſing means, and is matter of encouragement and hope.</p>
