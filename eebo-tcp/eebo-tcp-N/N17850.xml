            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the following oration was written for <hi>YOUR</hi> amusement, it is entitled to <hi>YOUR</hi> candour. To you it is humbly inscribed. That it is the production of haste, and was composed amidst some avocations, is a true, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different apology, for the state of imperfection in which it is now handed to the press; I feel most sensibly, how inadequate it is, to the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the great event by which it was occasioned: an event, that forms a distinguished period in the annals of mankind, and which will be remembered with reverential awe, and gratitude, by every <hi>true American,</hi> while genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine sensibility, patriotism, and liberality of sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, shall find a place in the human heart.</p>

            <p>TO commemorate the great events of their own times;—to celebrate the illustrious exploits, and achievements, of their statesmen and heroes;—and to trace, the rise, progress, and establishment, of mighty states and empires; have been deemed in all ages, and by all civilized nations, a just tribute of a grateful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and no ignoble employment for the intellect of man.—In this glory, their poets, orators, and historians have emulated each other; and from their public perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, modern times, have derived the choicest infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, of their morals, science and police.</p>
            <p>How interesting then, to the feelings of every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, must be this anniversary!—With what transport will he hail the day, which taught him to realize THE RIGHTS OF MAN!—a day, which burst asunder the shackles of tyranny, proclaimed his country free, and independent; and gave to a new empire, her rank and importance among the nations of the earth!</p>
            <p>I would willingly believe, that in every city, town,

                   facs="unknown:023133_0004_0FBC6A9282F33020"

and hamlet on this extended continent, this day is set apart, as a day of rejoicing, and of public thanksgiving to the supreme DIRECTOR of all events: and my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of so laudable a conduct,—a wish to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute my mite, to the rational amusement of this town, —together with the obliging request, of my too partial friends;—have induced me to address you, from this place, on this great occasion.</p>
            <p>As this subject has been often treated by far abler pens, you will not expect, that I advance upon it, at this late period, any thing novel, or ingenious. Truth, not novelty, will be the object of my pursuit. I shall tell you only those things, which "you yourselves do know"; and, relying on your candour, will concisely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice —A few leading incidents in the american revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—the actual and probable consequences of that event;—our present prospects,—and the line of conduct we ought to pursue, to perpetuate the advantages we have obtained.</p>
            <p>While the rise and origin, of other nations, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in the labyrinths of romance, and the dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of fable it is the happiness of America, that her history is attended with the clearness of day.</p>
            <p>Our fathers, early in the seventeenth century, promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a spirit of discovery, and determined never to wear the yoke of oppression; finding their country at that time sunk in superstition and tyranny, cast themselves
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023133_0005_0FBC6A95B2A45B00"/>
on the bosom of the ocean to seek in a foreign land, an asy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum of liberty. Auspicious heaven approved the glorious attempt, and her favourite bark, was safely wafted to her destined shore. Here they found a country swarming with its tawny sons, the lord proprietors of their native soil; but savages and barbarians, with all their cruelty, appeared less terrible, than the power of a tyrant, though drest in the purple garb of luxury, and refinement.</p>
            <p>True it is, that as this part of America, was discovered by english subjects, the crown of Britain affected to claim a property in the soil. Our ancestors obtained from the king a grant of a part of these lands, merely I presume to silence the cavils of their enemies; for I will not believe, they imagined, his grant could operate, in the least degree, to convey a title.—As well might the king of that island, have made them a grant of the SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAR SYSTEM.</p>
            <p>Having by treaty, or by purchase, placed themselves on terms of amity with the natives, they began dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to apply themselves to the business, to which the country appeared to be peculiarly adapted, I mean, agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture and fishing. They put the steel to the woods, and levelled the large and stately forests. The virgin earth unbosomed all her treasures, and THE WILDERNESS BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GAN TO BLOSSOM LIKE THE ROSE.—They soon acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a mean of comfortable subsistence.</p>
            <p>But alas! this happiness was but of momentary dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023133_0006_0FBC6A970748DE40"/>
They had yet to learn, that an exemption from tyranny, was not to be purchased, at so cheap a rate. The Indians, with a grudging eye, beheld them reaping the fruits, of their honest industry; they were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exposed, to their outrages, hostilities, and rapine: and from that period (with a few, short, transient inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals) for a century onward, there is scarcely a page of history, which is not crimsoned with YOUR fathers' blood.</p>
            <p>During these struggles, Britain looked on with great indifference, for we were as yet too poor to excite her jealousy, or to stimulate her rapaciousness.</p>
            <p>To paint in detail the whole system of oppression, in the attempts of the english to subjugate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enslave this country, is the province of history; she, inexorably se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere towards those who have been superlatively guilty, will delineate their characters with the point of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; and, BLAZON'D IN THE FACE OF DAY, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, and detestation of mankind will DAMN them to everlasting same.</p>
            <p>At the close of a war, carried on under the auspices of the ablest War-minister, that nation, or perhaps any other, ever beheld; and in which (by the bye) she had derived no small aid from her colonies; seeing her fleets triumphant on the ocean, and intoxicated, and grown wanton with her victories, she abandoned herself to the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023133_0007_0FBC6A9885C78DA0"/>
directions of a ministry, with whom ancient english worth and honesty, disdained to dwell. They undertook, without any consent on our part, to impose on us taxes, for the first time since we set our feet on american ground.—They went further.—The omnipotence of parliament, for so it was profanely called in the lute-string phraseology of that day, assumed a right to tax and bind us in all cases whatever. A standing army in the time of peace, that disgraceful badge, that last, and almost irresistible resort of detested tyrants, was stationed in a neighbouring town.—Its port was blocked up.— And under the pretence of punishing a breach of the peace, committed by a few individuals, an act was past, involving thousands in promiscuous, unmerited, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled misery, which it was equally out of their power, to stay, or to prevent.—These penalties were to be inflicted on them, not only UNHEARD, but UNCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TED to answer.</p>
            <p>Still the english colonists, replete with duty to their sovereign—the descendants of Britain, glowing with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for their mother country, though agonizing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the scourge of oppression, preserved their moderation, and their temper. Petitions couched in terms of duty, and breathing the spirit of humility, and submission, were presented at the footstool of majesty.—But the GENIUS of Britain had departed—her glory had faded like the western sunbeam.</p>

Behold eight long years have roll'd away, and peace, fair peace, with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her wing returns.—See plenty, with her copious horn, commerce laden with the wealth and treasures of the globe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see all the gentle arts of life, attendant in her train.—Our swords are beat into ploughshares, our spears into pruning hooks, and the trumpet's clangor and the din of arms, is heard no more within our borders.</p>
            <p>To complete, and give permanency to the happiness of America as a nation, a task great, and arduous, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd.—The constitutions of the several states adopted amidst the commotions of war, and (as my Lord BACON expresses it)
"on the spur of occasion,"
were found to be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023133_0011_0FBC6AA1C74EBE28"/>
totally inadequate to the business of cementing the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and opposed interests, of this great people.</p>
            <p>Every one saw the evil, but how to apply a remedy was the problem.</p>
            <p>Fanciful, and ingenious theorists, have represented mankind, in the first dawnings of civil society convened on an extended plain, choosing out their chieftan, and adopting rules of government for civil life. But nothing short of the fact itself, could have given birth to the great idea, of five millions of people, convened by their represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, from every part of a new world, coolly, and dispas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately deliberating on a form of government, which was to last for ages.—The admiring world saw in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust assembly, the ORATORS, SAGES, and PHILOSOPHERS of America, engaged in this all-glorious attempt.</p>
            <p>To avoid the evils of a monarchy where ONE makes the WHOLE, and the WHOLE is nothing.</p>
            <p>Of an aristocracy, where a man's happening to be born of certain parents, is a grant to him of all offices of power and profit in the state, without any regard to merit: as though GOD had formed him of more HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOURABLE DUST than the rest of mankind!</p>
            <p>And the evils of a democracy, that monster in politics which, like mount AETNA and VESUVIUS, carries it own destruction in its bowels.—</p>
            <p>To avoid these, I say, and to form a constitution of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023133_0012_0FBC6AA301B59388"/>
energy, and permanency;—furnished with proper checks, and balances;—with all the powers of government, nicely, and accurately distinguished, and kept as inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of each other as the nature of them will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;—was indeed a work of no small magnitude.—</p>
            <p>What has been the result? A constitution of federal government has been ratified by ALL the states, which will give perpetuity to the union. As the people are the fountain of all POWER, the legislature are chosen by them, and, at appointed periods, they are to return the sacred deposit whence they received it.</p>
            <p>A PRESIDENT has been chosen by the unbought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of millions of freemen!—his NAME is greater than the names of the sovereigns and potentates of the earth,—for his empire is established IN THE HEARTS OF HIS PEOPLE.
"They have arrayed him with honours, they have armed him with power and set him on high:"
yet still it is his chief glory, that he is only
"the right hand of THEIR POWER and the MIRROUR OF THEIR MAJESTY."

            </p>
            <p>I hasten to the last object proposed, to wit, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent prospects, and the means of improving them.</p>
            <p>I felicitate my Countrymen on the establishment of our excellent constitution of national government, where
<pb n="18"
                   facs="unknown:023133_0016_0FBC6AAC29D15668"

taxation and representation are inseparable—where not a spire of grass in all America can be subject to tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but what is represented in the legislature; and where, if our rulers abuse our confidence, provision is made for us at certain periods, to resume the trust and to place it in other hands.</p>
            <p>Our prospects are peculiarly pleasing at this time. Our credit and character as a nation is in a great degree established; commerce revives;—manufactures of various kinds are advancing with rapidity toward european perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—our taxes are comparatively small, and the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expenditures are defrayed with out any aid from direct taxes;—we have nearly a sufficiency of the precious metals, for the purposes of commerce and exchange, a want of which has heretofore been matter of grievous
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023133_0017_0FBC6AAD9CA6BB68"/>
complaint:—we possess a country of a salubrious cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and abounding in the necessaries and conveniences of life. Happy, thrice happy Americans, would ye but realize your own felicity!</p>
            <p>And now to perpetuate these advantages, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
"That a reverence for the constitution, (so the elegant LORD BOLINGBROKE expresses it) and a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious regard to the preservation of it, are in the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, like charity in the religious system, a mantle to cover a multitude of sins; and as the performance of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious duties, will not avail in the sight of GOD, without charity, so neither will a discharge of all other secular duties avail in the sight of men, without a faithful discharge of this principal duty."
A particular attention to the virtues of economy, temperance, and industry, are peculiarly necessary in a country like ours. The far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer who will make three ears of corn grow where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave only one, is more deserving of a statue than the conqueror of a world.—I am sorry to say it, but true it is, that foreigners have been surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the extravagance of Americans both in their dress and at their tables. Luxury maintains her thousands, &amp; vanity her ten thousands. While commerce supplies us with many of the conveniences of life, we ought to be ashamed to be indebted to foreign nations, for almost every article of our apparel. A proper pride and dignity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023133_0018_0FBC6AAF01AD61E0"/>
one would naturally suppose, instead of despising the work of our own hands, would induce us to approve and to commend them. They in general wear better; they are certainly as honourable; and, if a young lady hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pens, (for it is very rare) if she happens I say, to appear in public in apparel of her own making, it is doubly to her honor, as it implies habits of industry, and a want of vanity.</p>
            <p>If we look into antient history, we find that nations were flourishing while they were industrious, temperate, and frugal; but as soon as luxury was admitted, indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and a train of evils soon followed her, sapp'd the foundations and the whole fabric tumbled into ruin.</p>
            <p>Too much cannot be said on the subject of the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the youth of both sexes; the observation is as true as it is trite, that
"just as the twig is bent the tree's inclin'd."
This is the period which generally determines their characters, both with respect to their morals, and the part they will probably act in the great drama of life. The late revolution is much indebted to the rapid advances of science, in enlightening the minds of Americans, and to the liberality of sentiment and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of free inquiry, which hereof late years so greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
            <p>Their morals are of the first importance; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023133_0019_0FBC6AB080F433A0"/>
that virtue makes a nation great. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a solid foundation of honesty and virtue, 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible a youth, whatever accomplishments he may have, can ever discharge the duty he owes to himself, his country,  his GOD.</p>
            <p>Here let my oration pause.—We have taken a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory view of the rise and establishment of a great empire, and of a revolution without example or parallel in the world. And shall we content ourselves, my countrymen, with considering only the SECONDARY causes of these great and glorious events! I am sure your grateful hearts will answer—No. Filled with rapture and astonishment let us exclaim,
"These are THY glorious works, parent of good. Almighty."
—
"Not unto us, O Lord, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, but to thy name be all the praise.—Thou settest up kings and removest kings; thou givest wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them who know understanding. Thine O Lord is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty! for all that is in the heavens, and in the earth is thine. Thine it is to make great, and to give strength; thine is the kingdom, O Lord! and thou art exalted as head over all."</p>
            <p>We should also view GOD, not only as the supreme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, and sovereign disposer of states and kingdoms, but should endeavour to view him in his whole providence, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in what we call the common events, and accidents
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023133_0020_0FBC6AB499044818"/>
of life. He is equally the father and friend of the whole creation and his paternal cares extend to all. Let him not then
"be DIMLY seen in these his lower works; for THESE declare his goodness beyond thought, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er divine."</p>
            <p>Could we bring our will and our wishes to coincide with his, WHOSE WILL IS ALWAYS DONE IN EARTH, AS WELL AS IN HEAVEN, who disposes of all things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their minutest circumstances, and always for the best of purposes, we should attain as far as it respects this life, the summit of felicity. But this is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the present state of things; we can only make it the subject of our occasional study and meditations.</p>
