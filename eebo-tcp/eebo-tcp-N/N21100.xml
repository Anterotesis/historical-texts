            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>OF all kinds of ſatire, there is none ſo entertaining and univerſally improving, as that which is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as it were occaſionally, in the courſe of an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting ſtory, which brings every incident home to life; and, by repreſenting familiar ſcenes in an uncommon and amuſing point of view, inveſts them with all the graces of novelty, while nature is appealed to in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>The reader gratifies his curioſity, in purſuing the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of a perſon in whoſe favour he is prepoſſeſſed; he eſpouſes his cauſe, he ſympathizes with him in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, his indignation is heated againſt the authors of his calamity; the humane paſſions are inflamed; the contraſt between dejected virtue, and inſulting vice, appears with greater aggravation, and every impreſſion having a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force on the imagination, the memory retains the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and the heart improves by the example. The attention is not tired with a bare catalogue of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, but agreeably diverted with all the variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; and the viciſſitudes of life appear in their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar circumſtances, opening an ample field for wit and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>Romance, no doubt, owes its origin to ignorance, vanity, and ſuperſtition. In the dark ages of the world, when a man had rendered himſelf famous for wiſdom or valour, his family and adherents availed themſelves of his ſuperior qualities, magnified his virtues, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his character and perſon as ſacred and ſupernatural. The vulgar eaſily ſwallowed the bait, implored his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and yielded the tribute of homage and praiſe, even to adoration; his exploits were handed down to poſterity with a thouſand exaggerations; they were repeated as incitements to virtue; divine honours were paid, and altars erected to his memory, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of thoſe who attempted to imitate his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:027715_0003_0FD5EB4066529BA0"/>
and hence aroſe the heathen mythology, which is no other than a collection of extravagant romances.—As learning advanced, and genius received cultivation, theſe ſtories were embelliſhed with the graces of poetry; that they might the better recommend themſelves to the attention, they were ſung in public, at feſtivals, for the inſtruction and delight of the audience, and rehearſed before battle, as incentives to deeds of glory. Thus tragedy and the epic muſe were born, and, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of taſte, arrived at perfection.—It is no wonder, that the ancients could not reliſh a ſable in proſe, after they had ſeen ſo many remarkable events celebrated in verſe by their beſt poets; we therefore find no romance among them during the aera of their excellence, unleſs the Cyropoedia of Xenophon may be ſo called: and it was not till arts and ſciences began to revive, after the irruption of the Barbarians into Europe, that any thing of this kind appeared. But when the minds of men were debauched by the impoſition of prieſtcraft to the moſt abſurd pitch of credulity, the authors of romance aroſe, and loſing ſight of probability, filled their performances with the moſt monſtrous hyperboles. If they could not equal the ancient poets in point of genius, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to excel them in fiction, and apply to the wonder rather than to the judgment of their readers. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they brought necromany to their aid, and inſtead of ſupporting the character of their heroes by dignity of ſentiment and practice, diſtinguiſhed them by their bodily ſtrength, activity, and extravagance of behaviour. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though nothing could be more ludicrous and unnatural, than the figures they drew, they did not want patrons and admirers, and the world actually began to be infected with the ſpirit of knight-errantry, when Cervantes, by an inimitable piece of ridicule, reformed the taſte of mankind, repreſenting chivalry in the right point of view, and converting romance to purpoſes far more uſeful and entertaining, by making it aſſume the ſock, and point out the follies of ordinary life.</p>
                  <p>The ſame method has been practiſed by other Spaniſh and French authors, and by none more ſucceſsfully than by Monſ. Le Sage, who, in his Adventures of Gil Blas, has deſcribed the knavery and foibles of life with infinite
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:027715_0004_0FD5EB41DACA5A48"/>
humour and ſagacity. The following ſheets I have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled on his plan, taking the liberty, however, to diſler from him in the execution, where I thought his particular ſituations were uncommon and extravagant, or peculiar to the country in which the ſcene is laid. The diſgraces of Gil Blas are, for the moſt part, ſuch as rather excite mirth than compaſſion; he himſelf laughs at them, and his tranſitions from diſtreſs to happineſs, or at leaſt eaſe, are ſo ſudden, that neither the reader has time to pity him, nor himſelf to be acquainted with affliction. This conduct, in my opinion, not only deviates from proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but prevents that generous indignation, which ought to animate the reader againſt the ſordid and vicious diſpoſition of the world.</p>
                  <p>I have attempted to repreſent modeſt merit ſtruggling with every difficulty, to which a friendleſs orphan is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed from his own want of experience, as well as from the ſelfiſhneſs, envy, malice, and baſe indifference of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. To ſecure a favourable prepoſſeſſion, I have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the advantage of birth and education, which, in the ſeries of his miſfortunes, will, I hope, engage the ingenuous more warmly in his behalf; and though I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that ſome people will be offended at the mean ſcenes in which he is involved, I perſuade myſelf, the judicious will not only perceive the neceſſity of deſcribing thoſe ſituations, to which he muſt of courſe be confined in his low eſtate, but alſo find entertainment in viewing thoſe parts of life, where the humours and paſſions are undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed by affectation, ceremony, or education, and the whimſical peculiarities of diſpoſition appear as nature has implanted them. But I believe I need not trouble myſelf in vindicating a practice authoriſed by the beſt writers in this way, ſome of whom I have already named.</p>
                  <p>Every intelligent reader will at firſt ſight perceive, I have not deviated from nature in the facts, which are all true in the main, although the circumſtances are altered and diſguiſed to avoid perſonal ſatire.</p>
                  <p>It now remains to give my reaſons for making the chief perſonage of this work a North-Briton, which are chiefly theſe: I could at a ſmall expence beſtow on him ſuch education as I thought the dignity of his birth and character required, which could not poſſibly be obtained
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027715_0005_0FD5EB47497D3AD0"/>
in England by ſuch ſlender means as the nature of my plan would afford. In the next place, I could repreſent ſimplicity of manners in a remote part of the kingdom, with more propriety than in any place near the capital; and laſtly, the diſpoſition of the Scots, addicted to travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, juſtifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that country.</p>
                  <p>That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning oaths which proceed from the mouths of ſome perſons in theſe memoirs, I beg leave to premiſe, that I imagined nothing could more effectually expoſe the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of ſuch miſerable expletives, than a natural and verbal repreſentation of the diſcourſe in which they occur.</p>

                  <head>APOLOGUE.</head>
                  <p>A YOUNG painter, indulging a vein of pleaſantry, ſketched a kind of converſation-piece, repreſenting a bear, an owl, a monkey, and an aſs, and to render it more ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, humorous, and moral, diſtinguiſhed every figure by ſome emblem of human life.</p>
                  <p>Bruin was exhibited in the garb and attitude of an old toothleſs. drunken ſoldier; the owl perched upon the Handle of a coffee-pot, with ſpectacles on his noſe, ſeemed to contemplate a newſpaper; and the aſs, ornamented with a huge tie-wig, (which, however, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his long ears,) ſat for his picture to the monkey, who appeared with the implements of painting. This whimſical groupe afforded ſome mirth, and met with general approbation, until ſome miſchievous wag hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the whole was a lampoon upon the friends of the performer; an inſinuation which was no ſooner cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, than thoſe very people who applauded it before began to be alarmed, and even to fancy themſelves ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the ſeveral figures of the piece.</p>
                  <p>Among others a worthy perſonage in years, who had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the army with reputation, being incenſed at the ſuppoſed outrage, repaired to the lodgings of the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and finding him at home, <q>Hark ye, Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</q> ſaid he, <q>I have a good mind to convince you that, though the bear has loſt his teeth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his paws, and that he is not ſo drunk but he can perceive your impertinence—'Sblood! Sir, that toothleſs jaw is a damn'd ſcandalous libel—but don't you imagine me ſo chop-fallen as not to be able to chew the cud of reſentment.</q>—Here he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the arrival of a learned phyſician, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to the culprit with fury in his aſpect, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>Suppoſe the augmentation of the aſs's ears ſhould prove the diminution of the baboon's—nay, ſeek not to prevaricate; for, by the beard of Aeſculapius! there is not one hair in this periwig that will not ſtand up in judgment to convict thee of perſonal

abuſe—Do but obſerve, captain, how this pitiful little fellow has copied the very curls—the colour, indeed, is different; but then the form and foretop are quite ſimilar.</q> While he thus remonſtrated in a ſtrain of vociferation, a venerable ſenator entered, and waddling up to the delinquent, "Jackanapes!" cried he, <q>I will now let thee ſee I can read ſomething elſe than a newſpaper, and that without the help of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles—here is your own note of hand, ſirrah, for money, which, if I had not advanced, you yourſelf would have reſembled an owl, in not daring to ſhew your face by day, you ungrateful, ſlanderous knave!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In vain the aſtoniſhed painter declared, that he had no intention to give offence, or to characteriſe particular perſons; they affirmed the reſemblance was too palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be overlooked; they taxed him with inſolence, malice, and ingratitude; and, their clamours being overheard by the public, the captain was a bear, the doctor an aſs, and the ſenator an owl to his dying day.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtian reader, I beſeech thee in the bowels of the Lord, remember this example while thou art employed in the peruſal of the following ſheets, and ſeek not to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to thyſelf that which equally belongs to five hundred different people. If thou ſhouldſt meet with a character that reflects thee in ſome ungracious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, keep thy own counſel; conſider that one feature makes not a face, and that though thou art per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps diſtinguiſhed by a bottle noſe, twenty of thy neighbours may be in the ſame predicament.</p>

                        <p>Of my birth and parentage.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I WAS born in the northern part of this united kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the houſe of my grandfather, a gentleman of conſiderable fortune and influence, who had on many occaſions ſignalized himſelf in behalf of his country, and was remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exerciſed with great ſucceſs, in the ſtation of a judge, particularly againſt beggars, for whom he had a ſingular averſion.</p>
                     <p>My father (his youngeſt ſon) falling in love with a poor relation, who lived with the old gentleman in quality of houſe-keeper, eſpouſed her privately; and I was the firſt fruit of that marriage. During her pregnancy, a dream diſcompoſed my mother ſo much, that her huſband, tired with her importunity, at laſt conſulted a Highland ſeer, whoſe favourable interpretation he would have ſecured before-hand by a bribe, but found him incorruptible. She dreamed ſhe war delivered of a tennis-ball, which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (who, to her great ſurpriſe, acted the part of a mid-wife) ſtruck ſo forcibly with a racket, that is diſappeared in an inſtant; and ſhe was for ſome time inconſolable for the loſs of her offspring, when all of a ſudden ſhe beheld it return with equal violence, and enter the earth, beneath
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:027715_0009_0FD5EB4F5ABA9EF0"/>
her feet, whence immediately ſprung up a goodly tree, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with bloſſoms, the ſcent of which operated ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on her nerves, that ſhe awoke. The attentive ſage, after ſome deliberation, aſſured my parents, that their firſt born would be a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties, and at laſt return to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive land, where he would flouriſh in happineſs and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. How truly this was foretold, will appear in the ſequel. It was not long before ſome officious perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed my grandfather of certain familiarities that paſſed between his ſon and houſe-keeper, which alarmed him ſo much, that, a few days after, he told my father it was high time for him to think of ſettling, and that he had provided a match for him, to which he could in juſtice have no objections. My father, finding it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceal his ſituation much longer, frankly owned what he had done, and excuſed himſelf for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aſked the conſent of his father, by ſaying, he knew it would have been to no purpoſe, and that, had his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination been known, my grandfather might have taken ſuch meaſures as would have effectually put the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it out of his power: he added, that no exceptions could be taken to his wife's virtue, birth, beauty, and good ſenſe; and, as for fortune, it was beneath his care. The old gentleman, who kept all his paſſions except one, in excellent order, heard him to an end with great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and then calmly aſked, how he propoſed to maintain himſelf and ſpouſe? He replied, he could be in no danger of wanting, while his father's tenderneſs remained, which he and his wife would always cultivate with the utmoſt veneration; that he was perſuaded his allowance would be ſuitable to the dignity and circumſtances of his family, and to the proviſion already made for his brothers and ſiſters, who were happily ſettled under his protection. <q>Your brothers and ſiſters.</q> ſaid my grandfather, <q>did not think it beneath them to conſult me in an affair of ſuch importance as matrimony; neither, I ſuppoſe, would you have omitted that piece of duty, had you not ſome ſecret fund in reſerve; to the comforts of which I leave you, with a deſire that you will this night ſeek out an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other habitation for yourſelf and wife, whither, in a ſhort time, I will ſend you an account of the expence I
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:027715_0010_0FD5EB53EECC3980"/>
have been at in your education, with a view of being reimburſed. Sir, you have made the grand tour—you are a polite gentleman—a very pretty gentleman—I wiſh you a great deal of joy, and am your very humble ſervant.</q> So ſaying, he left my father in a ſituation eaſily imagined. However, he did not long heſitate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his father's diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence to get rid of him; and, his reſolves being invariable as the laws of the Medes and Perſians, he knew it would be to no purpoſe to attempt him by prayers and entreaties; ſo, without any farther application, he betook himſelf, with his diſconſolate bed-fellow, to a farm-houſe, where an old ſervant of his mother dwelt; there they remained ſome time in a ſituation but ill adapted to the elegance of their deſires and tenderneſs of their love; which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, my father choſe to endure, rather than to ſupplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent: but my mother, foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inconveniences to which ſhe muſt have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, had ſhe been delivered in this place, (and her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy was very far advanced,) without communicating her deſign to her huſband, went in diſguiſe to the houſe of my grandfather, hoping that her tears and condition would move him to compaſſion, and reconcile him to an event which was now irrevocably paſt. She found means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſervants, and was introduced as an unfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of ſome matrimonial grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, it being my grandfather's particular province to decide in all caſes of ſcandal. She was accordingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his preſence, where, diſcovering herſelf, ſhe fell at his feet, and, in the moſt affecting manner, implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his forgiveneſs, at the ſame time repreſenting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that threatened not only her life, but that of his own grandchild which was about to ſee the light. He told her, he was ſorry that the indiſcretion of her and his ſon had compelled him to make a vow, which put it out of his power to give them any aſſiſtance; that he had already imparted his thoughts on that ſubject to her huſband, and was ſurpriſed that they ſhould diſturb his peace with any farther importunity. This ſaid, he retired. The violence of my mother's affliction had ſuch an effect on her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that ſhe was immediately ſeized with the pains of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027715_0011_0FD5EB555ED138A0"/>
child-bed; and had not an old maid-ſervant, to whom ſhe was very dear, afforded her pity and aſſiſtance at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of incurring my grandfather's diſpleaſure, ſhe and the innocent fruit of her womb muſt have fallen miſerable vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the friendſhip of this poor woman, ſhe was carried up to a garret, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately delivered of a man-child, the ſtory of whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate birth he himſelf now relates. My father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed of what had happened, flew to the embraces of his darling ſpouſe, and, while he loaded his offspring with paternal careſſes, could not forbear ſhedding a flood of tears, on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for whoſe eaſe he would have ſacrificed the treaſures of the eaſt) ſtretched upon a flock-bed, in a miſerable apartment, unable to protect her from the inclemency of the weather. It is not to be ſuppoſed that the old gentleman was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what paſſed, though he affected to know nothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much ſurpriſed when one of his grandchildren by his eldeſt ſon deceaſed, who lived with him as his heir-apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined therefore to obſerve no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, but immediately (on the third day after her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very) ſent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off the ſervant who had preſerved her life. This behaviour ſo exaſperated my father, that he had recourſe to the moſt dreadful imprecations, and on his bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him, if ever he ſhould forget or forgive the barbarity of his ſire. The injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the want of neceſſaries where ſhe lodged, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her grief and anxiety of mind, ſoon threw her into a languiſhing diſorder, which put an end to her life. My father, who loved her tenderly, was ſo affected with her death, that he remained ſix weeks deprived of his ſenſes; during which time, the people where he lodged carried the infant to the old man, who relented ſo far, on hearing the melancholy ſtory of his daughter-in-law's death, and the deplorable condition of his ſon, as to ſend the child to nurſe; and he ordered my father to be carried home to his houſe, where he ſoon recovered the uſe of his reaſon. Whether this hard-hearted judge felt any remorſe for his cruel treatment of his ſon and daughter, or (which
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027715_0012_0FD5EB577139DE20"/>
is more probable) was afraid his character would ſuffer in the neighbourhood, he profeſſed great ſorrow for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to my father, whoſe delirium was ſucceeded by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found melancholy and reſerve. At length he diſappeared, and, notwithſtanding all imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a circumſtance which confirmed moſt people in the opinion of his having made away with himſelf in a fit of deſpair. How I underſtood the particulars of my birth, will appear in the courſe of theſe memoirs.</p>

                     <p>THERE were not wanting ſome, who ſuſpected my uncles of being concerned in my father's fate, on the ſuppoſition that they would all ſhare in the patrimony deſtined for him; and this conjecture was ſtrengthened by reflecting, that in all his calamities they never diſcovered the leaſt inclination to ſerve him, but on the contrary, by all the artifices in their power, fed his father's reſentment, and ſupported his reſolution of leaving him to miſery and want. But people of judgment treated this inſinuation as an idle chimera, becauſe, had my relations been ſo wicked as to conſult their intereſt by committing ſuch an atrocious crime, the fate of my father would have extended to me too, whoſe life was another obſtacle to their expectation.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027715_0013_0FD5EB5979170D20"/>
of me. I was ſoon after ſent to ſchool at a village hard by, of which he had been dictator time out of mind: but, as he never paid for my board, nor ſupplied me with clothes, books, and other neceſſaries I required, my condition was very ragged and contemptible; and the ſchoolmaſter, who, through fear of my grandfather, taught me <hi>gratis,</hi> gave himſelf no concern about the progreſs I made under his inſtruction. In ſpite of all theſe difficulties and diſgraces, I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue; and, as ſoon as I could write tolerably, peſtered my grandfather with letters to ſuch a degree, that he ſent for my maſter, and chid him ſeverely for beſtowing ſuch pains on my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, telling him, that if ever I ſhould be brought to the gallows for forgery, which he had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head. The pedant, who dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing more than the diſpleaſure of his patron, aſſured his honour, that the boy's ability was more owing to his own genius and application, than to any inſtruction or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement he received; that although he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him of the knowledge he had already imbibed, unleſs he would empower him to diſable his fingers, he ſhould endeavour, with God's help, to prevent his future im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. And indeed he punctually performed what he had undertaken; for, on pretence that I had writ imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent letters to my grandfather, he cauſed a board to be made with five holes in it, through which he thruſt the fingers and thumb of my right-hand, and faſtened it by a whip-cord to my wriſt, in ſuch a manner as effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred me the uſe of my pen. But this reſtraint I was freed from in a few days, by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and another boy, who taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to inſult my poverty, I was ſo incenſed at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous reproach, that, with one ſtroke of my machine, I cut him to the ſkull, to the great terror of myſelf and ſchool-fellows, who left him bleeding on the ground, and ran to inform the maſter of what had happened. I was ſo ſeverely puniſhed for this treſpaſs, that, were I to live to the age of Methuſalem, the impreſſion it made on me would not be effaced, no more than the antipathy and horror I conceived for the mercileſs tyrant who inflicted it. The contempt which my appearance naturally produced in all who ſaw me, the continual wants to which I was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027715_0014_0FD5EB5A9A96EA50"/>
and my own haughty diſpoſition, impatient of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, involved me in a thouſand troubleſome adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by which I was at length inured to adverſity, and emboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly ſcourged for crimes I did not commit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, having the character of a vagabond in the village, every piece of miſchief, whoſe author lay unknown, was charged upon me. I have been found guilty of robbing orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards I never entered, of killing cats I never hurted, of ſtealing gingerbread I never touched, and of abuſing old women I never ſaw. Nay, a ſtammering carpenter had eloquence enough to perſuade my maſter, that I fired a piſtol loaded with ſmall ſhot into his window, though my landlady and the whole family bore witneſs, that I was a-bed faſt aſleep at the time when this outrage was committed. I was once flogged for having narrowly eſcaped drowning, by the ſinking of a ferry-boat in which I was paſſenger; another time for having recovered of a bruiſe occaſioned by a horſe and cart running over me; a third time for being bit by a baker's dog. In ſhort, whether I was guilty or unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, the correction and ſympathy of this arbitrary pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogue were the ſame. Far from being ſubdued by this infernal uſage, my indignation triumphed over that ſlaviſh awe, which had hitherto enforced my obedience, and the more my years and knowledge increaſed, the more I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the injuſtice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon genius, and the advice and direction of our uſher, who had ſerved my father in his travels, I made a ſurpriſing progreſs in the claſſics, writing, and arithmetic; ſo that, before I was twelve years old, I was allowed by every body to be the beſt ſcholar in the ſchool. This qualification, together with a boldneſs of temper, and ſtrength of make, which had ſubjected almoſt all my contemporaries, gave me ſuch influence over them, that I began to form cabals againſt my perſecutor, and was in hopes of being able to bid him defiance in a very ſhort time. Being at the head of a faction conſiſting of thirty boys, moſt of them of my own age, I was determined to put their m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ttle to trial, that I might know how far they were to be depended upon, before I put my grand ſcheme in execution: with this view we attacked a body of ſtout apprentices, who had taken poſſeſſion of a part
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027715_0015_0FD5EB5FEE25ACC8"/>
of the ground allotted to us for the ſcene of our diverſions, and who were then playing at nine-pins on the ſpot: but I had the mortification to ſee my adherents routed in an inſtant, and a leg of one of them broke in his flight by the bowl, which one of our adverſaries had detached in purſuit of us. This diſcomfiture did not hinder us from engaging them afterwards in frequent ſkirmiſhes, which we maintained by throwing ſtones at a diſtance, wherein I received many wounds, the ſcars of which ſtill remain. Our enemies were ſo harraſſed and interrupted by theſe alarms, that they at laſt abandoned their conqueſt, and left us to the peaceable enjoyment of our own territories. It would be endleſs to enumerate the exploits we perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the courſe of this confederacy, which became the terror of the whole village; inſomuch, that when different intereſts divided it, one of the parties commonly courted the aſſiſtance of Roderick Random (by which name I was known) to caſt the balance, and keep the oppoſite, faction in awe. Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play day, to preſent myſelf before my grandfather, to whom I ſeldom found acceſs, by reaſon of his being cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſieged by a numerous family of his female grandchil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among themſelves, never failed to join againſt me, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy of all. His heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but ſox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing elſe, notwithſtanding his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's indulgence, in entertaining a tutor for him at home; who, at the ſame time, performed the office of pariſh clerk. This young Acteon, who inherited his grandfather's antipathy to every thing in diſtreſs, never ſet eyes on me, without uncoupling his beagles, and hunting me into ſome cottage or other, whither I gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fled for ſhelter. In this Chriſtian amuſement he was encouraged by his preceptor, who, no doubt, took ſuch opportunies to ingratiate himſelf with the riſing ſun, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the old gentleman, according to the courſe of nature, had not long to live, for he was already on the verge of fourſcore. The behaviour of this raſcally ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant incenſed me ſo much, that, one day, when I was beleagured by him and his hounds, in a farmer's houſe, where I had found protection, I took aim at him (being
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027715_0016_0FD5EB5FF31ABF98"/>
an excellent markſman) with a large pebble, which ſtruck out four of his fore-teeth, and effectually incapacitated him for doing the office of a clerk.</p>

                        <p>My mother's brother arrives—relieves me—a deſcription of him—he goes along with me to the houſe of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father—is encountered by his dogs—defeats them after a bloody engagement—is admitted to the old gentleman—a dialogue between them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ABOUT this time my mother's only brother, who had been long abroad, lieutenant of a man of war, arrived in his own country; where, being informed of my condition, he came to ſee me, and out of his ſlender fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances not only ſupplied me with what neceſſaries I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the preſent, but reſolved not to leave the country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had prevailed on my grandfather to ſettle ſomething handſome on me for the future. This was a taſk to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant not only of the judge's diſpoſition, but alſo of the ways of men in general, to which his education on board had kept him an utter ſtranger. He was a ſtrong built man, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bandy-legged, with a neck like that of a bull, and a face which (you might eaſily perceive) had withſtood the moſt obſtinate aſſaults of the weather. His dreſs conſiſted of a ſoldier's coat altered by the ſhip's taylor, a ſtriped flannel jacket, a pair of red breeches, japanned with pitch, clean grey worſted ſtockings, large ſilver buckles that covered three fourths of his ſhoes, a ſilver-laced hat whoſe crown overlooked the brims about an inch and a half, a black bob wig in buckle, a check ſhirt, a ſilk handkerchief, and a hanger with a braſs handle, girded to his thigh by a tarniſhed laced belt, and a good oak plant under his arm. This equip'd, he ſet out with me (who, by his bounty made a very decent appearance) for my grandfather's houſe, where we were ſaluted by Jowler and Caeſar, whom my couſin, young maſter, had let looſe at our reproach. Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of theſe curs, I was about to betake myſelf to my heels, when my uncle ſeized me with one hand,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027715_0017_0FD5EB6173634DD0"/>
brandiſhed his cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Caeſar ſprawling on the ground: but, finding himſelf attacked at the ſame time in the rear by Jowler, and fearing Caeſar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheel'd about, and by a lucky ſtroke, ſevered Jowler's head from his body. By this time, the young fox-hunter and three ſervants, armed with pitch-forks, and flails, were come to the aſſiſtance of the dogs, whom they found breathleſs upon the field; and my couſin was ſo provoked at the death of his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance, and take vengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the curſes and reproaches his anger could ſuggeſt. Upon which my uncle ſtept forward, with an undaunted air, at the ſight of whoſe bloody wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his antagoniſts fell back with precipitation, when he accoſted their leader thus:—<q>Lookee, brother, your dogs have boarded me without provocation; what I did was in my own defence. So you had beſt be civil, and let us ſhoot a-head clear of you.</q> Whether the young ſquire miſinterpreted my uncle's deſire of peace, or was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his uſual pitch of reſolution, I know not; but, he ſnatched a flail from one of his followers, and came up with a ſhew of aſſaulting the lieutenant, who putting himſelf in a poſture of defence proceeded thus:—<q>Lookee, you lubberly ſon of a w—e, if you come athwart me, 'ware your gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger-bread-work. I'll be foul of your quarter, d—n me.</q> This declaration, followed by a flouriſh of his hanger, ſeem'd to check the progreſs of the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's choler, who, looking behind him, perceived his attendants had ſlunk into the houſe, ſhut the gate, and left him to decide the contention by himſelf. Here a parley enſued, which was introduced by my couſin's aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Who the d—l are you? What do you want? Some ſcoundrel of a ſeaman (I ſuppoſe) who has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and turned thief. But don't think you ſhall eſcape, ſirrah—I'll have you hang'd, you dog, I will—Your blood ſhall pay for that of my two hounds, you ragamuffin.—I would not have parted with them to ſave your whole generation from the gallows, you ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian you.</q>—<q>None of your jaw, you ſwab—none of your jaw (replied my uncle) elſe I ſhall trim your lac'd

jacket for you.—I ſhall rub you down with an oaken towel, my boy—I ſhall.</q> So ſaying, he ſheathed his hanger and graſped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the houſe being alarm'd, one of my female couſins opened a window, and aſked what was the matter?—<q>The matter? (anſwered the lieutenant;) no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, young woman.—I have buſineſs with the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; and this ſpark, belike, won't allow me to come along ſide of him, that's all.</q>—After a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes pauſe, we were admitted and conducted to my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's chamber, through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very ſignificant looks, as I paſſed along. When we came into the judge's preſence, my uncle, after two or three ſea-bows, expreſſed himſelf in this manner: <q>Your ſervant, your ſervant.—What cheer, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? what cheer? I ſuppoſe you don't know me—may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap you don't—My name is Tom Bowling,—and this here boy, you look as if you did not know him neither,—'tis like you may'nt.—He's new rigged, i'faith; his cloth don't ſhake in the wind ſo much as it was wont to do. 'Tis my nephew, d'ye ſee, Roderick Random, your own fleſh and blood, old gentleman. Don't lag a-ſtern, you dog,</q> (pulling me forward.) My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father (who was laid up with the gout) received this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, after his long abſence, with that coldneſs of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which was peculiar to him; told him he was glad to ſee him, and deſired him to ſit down. <q>Thank ye, thank ye, Sir, I had as lief ſtand, (ſaid my uncle:) for my own part I deſire nothing of you; but if you have any conſcience at all, do ſomething for this poor boy, who has been uſed at a very unchriſtian rate.—Unchriſtian do I call it?—I am ſure the Moors in Barbary have more humanity than to leave their little ones to want. I would fain know why my ſiſter's ſon is more neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than that there fair-weather Jack,</q> (pointing to the young ſquire, who, with the reſt of my couſins, had followed us into the room.) <q>Is not he as near a-kin to you as the other? Is he not much handſomer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter built than that great chucklehead?—Come, come, conſider, old gentleman, you are going in a ſhort time to give an account of your evil actions. Remember the wrongs you did his father; and make all the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

His ſiſter's brat had been too well taken care of.

"None of your tricks upon travellers," (ſaid he;) <q>mayhap old Buff has left my kinſman here his heir; if he has, it will be the better for his miſerable ſoul. Odds-bob! I'd deſire no better news.

In the mean time orders were given to provide mourning for all the relations, in which number I was included; but my uncle would not ſuffer me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, until I ſhould be aſſured whether or no I had reaſon to honour his memory ſo far. During this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the conjectures of people, with regard to the old gentleman's will, were various: as it was well known he had, beſides his landed eſtate, which was worth ſeven hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> ſix or ſeven thouſand pounds at intereſt, ſome imagined that the whole real eſtate (which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man, whom he had always entertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally divided between my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male couſins (five in number) and me. Others were of opinion, that as the reſt of his children had been already provided for, he would only bequeath two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds to each of his grand-daughters, and leave the bulk of the ſum to me, to atone for his unnatural uſage of my father. At length the important hour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and the will was produced in the midſt of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants, whoſe looks and geſtures formed a groupe that would have been very entertaining to an unconcerned ſpectator.

The eldeſt and perteſt of my female competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who had been always very officious about my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's perſon, inquired with a ſaultering accent, and viſage as yellow as an orange, <q>if there were no lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</q> and was anſwered, "none at all."

My conductor, after having kicked with his heel for ſome time againſt the wainſcot, began: <q>So there's no lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, friend, ha! here's an old ſuccubus; but ſomebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's ſoul howls for it, d—n me!</q> The parſon of the pariſh, who was one of the executors, and had acted as ghoſtly director to the old man, no ſooner heard this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, than he cried out, <q>Avaunt, unchriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viler! avaunt! wilt thou not allow the ſoul of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to reſt in peace?</q> But this zealous paſtor did not find himſelf ſo warmly ſeconded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now joined my uncle againſt him, and accuſed him of having acted the part of a buſy body with their grandpapa, whoſe ears he had certainly abuſed by falſe ſtories to their prejudice, or elſe he would not have neglected them in ſuch an unnatural manner.

Upon which this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford it) to give me an univerſity education; and accordingly ſettled my board and other expences, at a town not many miles diſtant, famous for its colleges, whither we repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhort time. But before the day of our departure, the ſchoolmaſter, who no longer had the fear of my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father before his eyes, laid aſide all decency and reſtraint, and not only abuſed me in the groſſeſt language his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour could ſuggeſt, as a wicked, profligate, dull, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly miſcreant, whom he had taught out of charity; but alſo inveighed in the moſt bitter manner againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the judge, (who by the bye had procured that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement for him,) hinting, in pretty plain terms, that the old gentleman's ſoul was damn'd to all eternity for his injuſtice in neglecting to pay for my learning. This bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal behaviour, added to the ſufferings I had formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, made me think it high time to be revenged of this inſolent pedagogue.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027715_0025_0FD5EB7124AF6350"/>
to take the advantage of the uſher's going out to make water, (which he regularly did at four o'clock,) and ſhut the great door, that he might not come to the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his ſuperior. This being done, the aſſault was to be begun, by my advancing to my maſter and ſpitting in his face. I was to be ſeconded by two of the ſtrongeſt boys in the ſchool, who were devoted to me; their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to join me in dragging the tyrant to a bench, over which he was to be laid, and his bare poſteriors heartily flogged with his own birch, which we propoſed to wreſt from him in the ſtruggle; but if we ſhould find him too many for us all three, we were to demand the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our competitors, who ſhould be ready to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force us, or oppoſe any thing that might be undertaken for the maſter's relief. One of my principal aſſiſtants was called Jeremy Gawky, ſon and heir of a wealthy gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the neighbourhood; and the name of the other Hugh Strap, the cadet of a family which had given ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers to the village time out of mind. I had once ſaved Gawky's life by plunging into a river and dragging him on ſhore, when he was on the point of being drowned. I had often reſcued him from the clutches of thoſe whom his inſufferable arrogance had provoked, to a reſentment he was not able to ſuſtain; and many times ſaved his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and poſteriors, by performing his exerciſes at ſchool; ſo that it is not to be wondered at, if he had a particular regard for me and my intereſts. The attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Strap flowed from a voluntary diſintereſted incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which had manifeſted itſelf on many occaſions in my behalf, he having once rendered me the ſame ſervice that I had done to Gawky, by ſaving my life at the riſk of his own; and often fathered offences that I had committed, for which he ſuffered ſeverely, rather than I ſhould feel the weight of the puniſhment I deſerved. Theſe two cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions were the more willing to engage in this enterprize, becauſe they intended to leave the ſchool the next day, as well as I; the firſt being ordered by his father to return into the country, and the other being bound apprentice to a barber, at a market town not far off.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time my uncle, being informed of my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's behaviour to me, was enraged at his inſolence, and vowed revenge ſo heartily, that I could not refrain from

telling him the ſcheme I had concerted, which he heard with great ſatisfaction, at every ſentence ſquirting out a mouthful of ſpittle, tinctured with tobacco, of which he conſtantly chewed a large quid. At laſt, pulling up his breeches, he cried, <q>No, no, Z—ds! that won't do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—how ſomever, 'tis a bold undertaking, my lad—that I muſt ſay, i'faith!—but lookee, lookee, how doſt propoſe to get clear off?—won't the enemy give chace, my boy?—ay, ay, that he will, I warrant—and alarm the whole coaſt—ah! God help thee, more ſail than ballaſt, Rory—Let me alone for that—leave the whole to me—I'll ſhew him the fore-top-ſail, I will.—If ſo be your ſhip-mates are jolly boys, and won't flinch, you ſhall ſee, you ſhall ſee; egad, I'll play him a ſalt-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trick—I'll bring him to the gang-way, and anoint him with a cat and nine tails; he ſhall have a round dozen doubled, my lad, he ſhall—and be left, laſhed, to his meditations.</q> We were very proud of our aſſociate, who immediately went to work, and prepared the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his revenge with great ſkill and expedition; after which he ordered our baggage to be packed up and ſent off a day before our attempt, and got horſes ready to be mounted as ſoon as the affair ſhould be over. At length the hour arrived, when our auxiliary, ſeizing the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the uſher's abſence, bolted in, ſecured the door, and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar, who bawled out, "Murder! Thieves!"—with the voice of Stentor. Though I trembled all over like an aſpen leaf, I knew there was no time to be loſt, and accordingly got up, and ſummoned our aſſociates to my aſſiſtance. Strap without any heſitation obeyed the ſignal, and, ſeeing me leap upon the maſter's back, ran immediately to one of his legs, which pulling with all his force, his dreadful adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary was humbled to the ground: upon which Gawky, who had hitherto remained in his place under the influence of an univerſal trepidation, haſtened to the ſcene of action, and inſulted the fallen tyrant with a loud huzza, in which the whole ſchool joined. This noiſe alarmed the uſher, who, finding himſelf ſhut out, endeavoured, partly by threats, and partly by entreaties, to procure admiſſion. My uncle bade him have a little patience, and he would let him in preſently; but, if he pretended to move from
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027715_0027_0FD5EB748BB99258"/>
that place, it ſhould fare worſe with the ſon of a b—ch his ſuperior, on whom he intended only to beſtow a little wholeſome chaſtiſement for his barbarous uſage to Rory, "to which," ſaid he, "you are no ſtranger." By this time we had dragged the criminal to a poſt, to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, after having ſecured his hands, and ſtripped his back. In this ludicrous poſture he ſtood, (to the no ſmall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the boys, who crowded about him, and ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great exultation at the novelty of the ſight,) vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bitter imprecations againſt the lieutenant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his ſcholars with treachery and rebellion; when the uſher was admitted, whom my uncle accoſted in this manner: <q>Harkee, Mr. Syntax, I believe you are an honeſt man, d'ye ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But Bowling repreſenting, that it was in vain to reſiſt, and that he did not mean to uſe him with violence and indecency, but only to hinder him from raiſing the hue and cry againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be out of their power, he allowed himſelf to be bound to his own deſk, where he ſat a ſpectator of the puniſhment inflicted on his principal. My uncle, having upbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to me, told him, that he propoſed to give him a little diſcipline for the good of his ſoul, which he immediately put in practice with great vigour and dexterity. This ſmart application to the pedant's withered poſteriors gave him ſuch exquiſite pain, that he roared like a mad bull, danced, curſed, and blaſphemed like a frantic bedlamite. When the lieutenant thought himſelf ſufficiently revenged, he took his leave of him in theſe words: <q>Now, friend, you'll remember me the longeſt day you have to live—I have given you a leſſon that will let you know what flogging is, and teach you to have more ſympathy for the future—Shout, boys, ſhout.</q> This ceremony was no ſooner over tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AS I was now capable of reflection, I began to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my precarious ſituation; that I was utterly abandoned by thoſe whoſe duty it was to protect me, and that my ſole dependance was on the generoſity of one man, who was not only expoſed by his profeſſion to continual dangers which might one day deprive me of him for ever, but alſo (no doubt ſubject to thoſe viciſſitudes of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which a change of fortune uſually creates, or which a better acquaintance with the world might produce; for I always aſcribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind. Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe conſiderations, I reſolved to apply myſelf with
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027715_0029_0FD5EB7ACC56A930"/>
great care to my ſtudies, and enjoy the opportunity now in my power: this I did with ſuch ſucceſs, that in the ſpace of three years I underſtood Greek very well, was pretty far advanced in the mathematics, and no ſtranger to moral and natural philoſophy: logic I made no account of; but, above all things, I valued myſelf on my taſte in the <hi>belle lettres,</hi> and a talent for poetry, which had already produced ſome pieces that met with a very favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Theſe qualifications, added to a good face and ſhape, acquired the eſteem and acquaintance of the moſt conſiderable people in town, and I had the ſatisfaction to find myſelf in ſome degree of favour with the ladies; an intoxicating piece of good fortune to one of my amorous complexion! which I obtained, or at leaſt preſerved, by gratifying their propenſity to ſcandal, in lampooning their rivals. Two of my female couſins lived in this place, with their mother, ſince the death of their father, who left his whole fortune equally divided between them; ſo that, if they were not the moſt beautiful, they were at leaſt the richeſt toaſts in town, and received daily the addreſſes of all the beaux and cavaliers of the country. Although I had hitherto been looked upon by them with the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious contempt, my character now attracted their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſo much, that I was given to underſtand I might be honoured with their acquaintance, if I pleaſed. The reader will eaſily perceive, that this condeſcenſion either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to their malice, or at leaſt of ſcreening themſelves from the laſh of my reſentment, which they had effectually provoked. I enjoyed this triumph with great ſatisfaction, and not only rejected their offer with diſdain, but in all my performances, whether ſatire or panegyric, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avoided mentioning their names, even while I cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated thoſe of their intimates. This neglect mortified their pride exceedingly, and incenſed them to ſuch a degree, that they were reſolved to make me repent of my indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The firſt ſtroke of their revenge conſiſted in their hiring a poor collegian to write verſes againſt me, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of which was my own poverty, and the cataſtrophe of my unhappy parents. But beſides the badneſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, (of which they themſelves were aſhamed,) they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027715_0030_0FD5EB7BB52FC4B8"/>
with thoſe misfortunes which they and their relations had brought upon me, and which conſequently reflected much more diſhonour on themſelves than on me, who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice. Finding this plan miſcarry, they found means to irritate a young gentleman againſt me, by telling him I had lampooned his miſtreſs, and ſo effectually ſucceeded in the quality of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries, that this enraged lover determined to ſeize me next night as I returned to my lodgings from a friend's houſe that I frequented; with this view he waited in the ſtreet, attended by two of his companions, to whom he had imparted his deſign of carrying me down to the river, in which he propoſed to have me heartily ducked, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſeverity of the weather, it being then about the middle of December. But this ſtratagem did not ſucceed; for, being apprized of their ambuſh, I got home another way, and, by the help of my landlord's apprentice, diſcharged a volley from the garret-window, which did great execution upon them, and next day oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſo much mirth at their expence, that they ſound themſelves under the neceſſity of leaving the town, until the adventure ſhould be entirely forgotten. My couſins (tho' twice baffled in their expectations) did not, however, deſiſt from perſecuting me, who had now enraged them beyond a poſſibility of forgiveneſs, by detecting their malice, and preventing its effects: neither ſhould I have found them more humane, had I patiently ſubmitted to their rancour, and bore without murmuring the rigour of their unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hate; for I have found by experience, that, though ſmall favours may be acknowledged, and ſlight injuries aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, there is no wretch ſo ungrateful as he whom you have moſt generouſly obliged, and no enemy ſo implacable as thoſe who have done you the greateſt wrong. Theſe good-natured creatures, therefore, had recourſe to a ſcheme which conſpired with a piece of bad news I ſoon after received, to give them all the ſatisfaction they deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confident, who betrayed the truſt I repoſed in him, by imparting to them the particulars of my ſmall amours, which they publiſhed with ſuch exaggerations, that I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very much in the opinion of every body, and was utterly diſcarded by the dear creatures whoſe names had
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027715_0031_0FD5EB7D33956608"/>
been called in queſtion. While I was buſy in tracing out the author of this treachery, that I might not only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on him, but alſo vindicate my character to my friends, I one day perceived the looks of my landlady much altered, when I went home to dinner, and, inquiring into the cauſe, ſhe ſcrewed up her mouth, and, fixing her eyes on the ground, told me her huſband had received a letter from Mr. Bowling, with one incloſed for me—She was very ſorry for what had happened, both for my ſake and his own—People ſhould be more cautious of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct—She was always afraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into ſome misfortune or other. As for her part, ſhe ſhould be very ready to befriend me; but ſhe had a ſmall family of her own to maintain—The world would do nothing for her if ſhe ſhould come to want—charity begins at home: ſhe wiſhed I had been bound to ſome ſubſtantial handicraft, ſuch as a weaver or a ſhoemaker, rather than loiter away my time in learning fooliſh nonſenſe that would never bring me in a penny—but ſome folks are wiſe, and ſome are otherwiſe. I was liſtening to this myſterious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with great amazement, when her huſband entered, and, without ſpeaking a ſyllable, put both the letters into my hand. I received them trembling, and read what follows:</p>

                     <p>This letter (which with the other was dated from Port Louis in Hiſpaniola) I had no ſooner read, than the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, ſhaking his head, began:—<q>I have a very great regard for Mr. Bowling, that's certain—and could be well content—but times are very hard.—There's no ſuch thing as money to be got—I believe 'tis all vaniſhed under ground, for my part.—Beſides, I have been out of pocket already, having entertained you ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this mouth, without receiving a ſixpence—and God knows if ever I ſhall; for I believe it will go hard with your uncle—And more than that, I was thinking to give you warning; for I want your apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a new 'prentice, whom I expect from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try every hour—So, I deſire you will this week pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide yourſelf with another lodging.</q> The indignation which this harangue inſpired, gave me ſpirits to ſupport my reverſe of fortune, and to tell him, I deſpiſed his mean, ſelfiſh diſpoſition ſo much, that I would rather ſtarve than be beholden to him for one ſingle meal. Upon which, out of my pocket-money, I paid him to the laſt farthing of what I owed, and aſſured him I would not ſleep another night under his roof. This ſaid, I ſallied out in a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

of rage and ſorrow, without knowing whither to fly for ſhelter, having not one friend in the world capable of relieving me, and only three ſhillings in my purſe. After giving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage, I went and hired a ſmall bed-room at the rate of one ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſixpence <hi>per</hi> week, which I was obliged to pay <hi>per</hi> advance, before the landlord would receive me: thither I removed my luggage; and next morning got up, with a view of craving the advice and aſſiſtance of a perſon who had on all occaſions loaded me with careſſes, and made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent offers of friendſhip while I was under no neceſſity of accepting them. He received me with his wonted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability, and inſiſted on my breakfaſting with him, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which I did not think ſit to refuſe. But, when I communicated the occaſion of my viſit, he appeared ſo diſconcerted, that I concluded him wonderfully affected with the miſery of my condition, and I looked upon him as a man of the moſt extenſive ſympathy and benevolence. He did not leave me long under this miſtake; for, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering himſelf from his confuſion, he told me he was griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my misfortune, and deſired to know what had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between my landlord Mr. Potion and me: whereupon I recounted the converſation; and, when I repeated the anſwer I made to his ungenerous remonſtrance with regard to my leaving his houſe, this pretended friend affected a ſtare, and exclaimed, <q>Is it poſſible you could behave ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On my return I met my comrade Squire Gawky, whom his father had ſent ſome time ago to town for his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in writing, dancing, fencing, and other modiſh qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.

As I had lived with him, ſince his arrival, on the footing of our old intimacy, I made no ſcruple of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of the lowneſs of my circumſtances, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſmall ſupply of money to anſwer my preſent expence; upon which he pulled out a handful of halfpence, with a ſhilling or two among them, and ſwore that was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter-day, he having loſt the greateſt part of his allowance the night before at billiards. Though his aſſertion might very well be true, I was extremely mortified at his indifference; for he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſed any ſympathy for my miſhap, nor deſire of alleviating my diſtreſs; and accordingly I left him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uttering one word: but when I afterwards underſtood, that he was the perſon who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my couſins, to whom likewiſe he had carried the tidings of my forlorn ſituation, which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation, I determined with myſelf to call him to a ſevere account; for which purpoſe I borrowed a ſword, and wrote a challenge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to meet me at a certain time and place, that I might have an opportunity of puniſhing his perfidy at the expence of his blood. He accepted the invitation, and I betook myſelf to the field, though not without feeling conſiderable repugnance to the combat, which frequently attacked me in cold ſweats by the way; but the deſire of revenge, the ſhame of retracting, and hope of conqueſt, conſpired to repel theſe unmanly ſymptoms of fear, and I appeared on the plain with a good grace: there I waited an hour beyond the time appointed, and was not ill plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to find he had no mind to meet me, becauſe I ſhould have an opportunity of expoſing his cowardice, diſplaying my own courage, and of beating him ſoundly whereſoever I ſhould find him, without any dread of the conſequence. Elevated with theſe ſuggeſtions, which entirely baniſhed all thoughts of my deplorable condition, I went directly to Gawky's lodgings, where I was informed of his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate retreat, he having ſet out for the country in leſs than an hour after he had received my billet: and I was vain enough to have the whole ſtory inſerted in the news, although I was fain to ſell a gold-laced hat to my landlord, for leſs than half-price, to defray the expence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to my ſubſiſtence.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>I am entertained by Mr. Crab—a deſcription of him—I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the art of ſurgery—conſult Crab's diſpoſition—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary to him—an accident happens—he adviſes me to launch into the world—aſſiſts me with money—I ſet out for London.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE fumes of my reſentment being diſſipated as well as the vanity of my ſucceſs, I found myſelf deſerted to all the horrors of extreme want, and avoided by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as a creature of a different ſpecies, or rather as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary being, no ways comprehended within the ſcheme or protection of Providence. My deſpair had rendered me almoſt quite ſtupified, when I was one day told, that a gentleman deſired to ſee me at a certain public-houſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I immediately repaired, and was introduced to one Mr. Lancelot Crab, a ſurgeon in town, who was engaged with two more in drinking a liquor called <hi>pop-in,</hi> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by mixing a quartern of brandy with a quart of ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beer. Before I relate the occaſion of this meſſage, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will not be diſagreeable to the reader, if I deſcribe the gentleman who ſent for me, and mention ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his character and conduct, which may illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate what follows, and account for his behaviour to me.</p>
                     <p>This member of the faculty was aged fifty, about five feet high, and ten round the belly; his face was capacious as a full moon, and much of the complexion of a mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; his noſe, reſembling a powder-horn, was ſwelled to an enormous ſize, and ſtudded all over with carbuncles; and his little grey eyes reflected the rays in ſuch an oblique manner, that, while he looked a perſon full in the face, one would have imagined he was admiring the buckle of his ſhoe. He had long entertained an implacable reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Potion, who, though a young practitioner, was better employed than he, and once had the aſſurance to perform a cure, whereby he diſappointed and diſgraced the prognoſtic of the ſaid Crab. This quarrel, which was at one time upon the point of being made up by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and mediation of friends, had been lately inflamed beyond a poſſibility of reconciliation by the reſpective wives of the opponents, who, chancing to meet at a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027715_0036_0FD5EB8CE255A858"/>
chriſtening, diſagreed about precedence, proceeded from invectives to blows, and were with great difficulty, by the goſſips, prevented from converting the occaſion of joy into a ſcene of lamentation.</p>
                     <p>The difference between theſe rivals was in the height of rancour, when I received the meſſage of Crab, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me as civilly as I could have expected from one of his diſpoſition, and, after deſiring me to ſit, inquired into the particulars of my leaving the houſe of Potion; which when I had related, he ſaid with a malicious grin—<q>There's a ſneaking dog!—I always thought him a fellow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſoul, d—n me!—a canting ſcoundrel, who has crept into buſineſs by his hypocriſy, and kiſſing the a—ſe of every body.</q>—"Ay, ay," ſays another, <q>one might ſee with half an eye, that the raſcal has no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, in him by his going ſo regularly to church.</q> This ſentence was confirmed by a third, who aſſured his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that Potion was never known to be diſguiſed in liquor but once at the meeting of the godly, where he had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by an extempore prayer an hour long. After this preamble Crab addreſſed himſelf to me in theſe words: <q>Well, my lad, I have heard a good character of you, and I'll do for you.—You may ſend your things to my houſe when you pleaſe—I have given orders for your reception.—Z—ds! what does the booby ſtare at? If you have no mind to embrace my courteous offer, you may let it alone, and be d—n'd.</q> I anſwered with a ſubmiſſive bow, that I was far from rejecting his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer, which I would immediately accept, as ſoon as he ſhould inform me on what footing I was to be entertained. "What footing! d—n my blood," cried he, <q>d'ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have a footman and a couple of horſes kept for you?</q> "No, Sir," I replied, <q>my expectations are not quite ſo ſanguine. That I may be as little burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as poſſible, I would willingly ſerve in your ſhop, by which means I may ſave you the expence of a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman, or porter at leaſt; for I underſtand a little pharmacy, having employed ſome of my leiſure hours in the practice of that art, while I lived with Mr. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither am I altogether ignorant of ſurgery, which I have ſtudied with great pleaſure and application.</q> "O ho! you did?" ſays Crab. <q>Gentleman, here is
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027715_0037_0FD5EB8E5C01EFE8"/>
a complete artiſt!—Studied ſurgery! what? in books, I ſuppoſe.—I ſhall have you diſputing with me one of theſe days on points of my profeſſion.—You can alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy account for muſcular motion, (I warrant,) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the myſtery of the brain and nerves—ha!—You are too learned for me, d—n me. But let's hear no more to this ſtuff—Can you bleed, and give a clyſter, ſpread a plaiſter, and prepare a potion?</q>—Upon my anſwering in the affirmative, he ſhook his head, telling me, he believed he ſhould have little good of me for all my promiſes; but, however, he would take me in for the ſake of charity. I was accordingly that very night admitted to his houſe, and had an apartment aſſigned to me in the garret, which I was fain to put up with, notwithſtanding the mortification my pride ſuffered in this change of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. I was ſoon convinced of the real motives which induced Crab to receive me in this manner; for, beſides the gratification of his revenge, by expoſing the ſelfiſhneſs of his antagoniſt in oppoſition to his own gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, which was all affectation, he had occaſion for a young man, who underſtood ſomething of the profeſſion, to fill up the place of his eldeſt apprentice, lately dead, not without violent ſuſpicion of foul play from his maſter's bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. The knowledge of this circumſtance, together with his daily behaviour to his wife and the young apprentice, did not at all contribute to my enjoying my new ſituation with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſe; however, as I did not perceive how I could beſtow myſelf to better advantage, I reſolved to ſtudy Crab's temper with all the application, and manage it with all the addreſs in my power. And it was not long before I ſound out a ſtrange peculiarity of humour, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned his behaviour towards all his dependants;—I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when he was pleaſed, he was ſuch a niggard of his ſatisfaction, that, if his wife or ſervants betrayed the leaſt ſymptom of participation, he was offended to an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable degree of choler and fury, the effects of which they ſeldom failed to feel; and, when his indignation was rouſed, ſubmiſſion and ſoothing always exaſperated it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of reaſon and humanity. I therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a contrary plan; and one day, when he honoured me with the names of ignorant whelp, and lazy ragamuffin, I boldly replied, I was neither ignorant nor lazy, ſince I
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027715_0038_0FD5EB8FE2775188"/>
both underſtood and performed my buſineſs as well as he could do for his ſoul; neither was it juſt to call me a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamuffin; for I had a whole coat on any back, and was deſcended from a better family than any he could boaſt an alliance with. He gave tokens of great amazement at this aſſurance of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Although I was terribly ſtartled at his menacing looks and poſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I yet had reflexion enough left to convince me I had gone too far to retract, and that this was the critical minute, which muſt decide my future lot in his ſervice; I therefore ſnatched up the peſtle of a mortar, and ſwore, if he offered to ſtrike me without a cauſe, I ſhould ſee whether his ſkull or my weapon was hardeſt.—He continued ſilent for ſome time, and at laſt broke forth into theſe ejaculations: <q>This is fine uſage from a ſervant to a maſter,—very fine!—damnation!—but, no matter, you ſhall pay for this, you dog, you ſhall—I'll do your buſineſs—yes, yes, I'll teach you to lift your hand againſt me</q>—So ſaying, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired and left me under dreadful apprehenſions, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed entirely at our next meeting, when he behaved with unuſual complacency, and treated me with a glaſs of punch after dinner.—By this conduct I got the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy over him in a ſhort time, and became ſo neceſſary to him, in managing his buſineſs while he was engaged at the bottle, that fortune began to wear a kinder aſpect; and I conſoled myſelf for the diſregard of my former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, with the knowledge I daily imbibed, by a cloſe application to the duties of my employment, in which I ſucceeded beyond my own expectation. I was on very good terms with my maſter's wife, whoſe eſteem I acquired and cultivated, by repreſenting Mrs. Potion in the moſt ridiculous light my ſatirical talents could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, as well as by rendering her ſome chriſtian offices, when ſhe had been too familiar with the dram bottle, to which ſhe had oftentimes recourſe for conſolation, under the affliction ſhe ſuffered from a barbarous huſband. In this manner I lived, without hearing the leaſt tidings of my uncle, for the ſpace of two years, during which time I kept little or no company, being neither in a humour to reliſh, nor in a capacity to maintain, much acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027715_0039_0FD5EB97D177AA18"/>
for the Nabal my maſter allowed me no wages; and the ſmall perquiſites of my ſtation ſcarce ſupplied me with the common neceſſaries of life—I was no longer a pert, unthinking coxcomb, giddy with popular applauſe, and elevated with the extravagance of hope; my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had taught me how little the careſſes of the world, during a man's proſperity, are to be valued by him; and how ſeriouſly and expeditiouſly he ought to ſet about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf independent of them. My preſent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, therefore, was the leaſt of my care, which was wholly engroſſed in laying up a ſtock of inſtruction that might ſecure me againſt the caprice of fortune for the future. I became ſuch a ſloven, and contracted ſuch an air of auſterity, that every body pronounced me creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen; and Gawky returned to town without running any riſque from my reſentment, which was by this time pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much cooled, and reſtrained by prudential reaſons, ſo effectually, that I never ſo much as thought of obtaining ſatisfaction for the injuries he had done me. When I deemed myſelf ſufficiently maſter of my buſineſs, I began to caſt about for an opportunity of launching into the world, in hope of finding ſome proviſion, that might make amends for the difficulties I had undergone: but, as this could not be effected without a ſmall ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to equip me for the field, I was in the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity how to raiſe it, well knowing, that Crab, for his own ſake, would never put me in a condition to leave him, when his intereſt was ſo much concerned in my ſtay. But a ſmall accident, which happened about this time, determined him in my favour. This was no other than the pregnancy of his maid-ſervant, who declared her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to me, aſſuring me at the ſame time, that I was the occaſion of it. Although I had no reaſon to queſtion the truth of this imputation, I was not ignorant of the familiarities which had paſſed between her maſter and her, taking the advantage of which, I repreſented to her the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

not that he dreaded any domeſtic grumblings and reproaches from his wife, whom he kept in perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; but becauſe he knew it would furniſh his rival Potion with a handle for inſulting and undermining his reputation, there being no ſcandal equal to that of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, in the opinion of thoſe who inhabit the part of the iſland where he lived. He therefore took a reſolution worthy of himſelf, which was to perſuade the girl, that ſhe was not with child, but only afflicted with a diſorder incident to young women, which he could eaſily remove: with this view (as he pretended) he preſcribed for her ſuch medicines as he thought would infallibly procure abortion: but in this ſcheme he was diſappointed; for the maid being advertiſed by me of his deſign, and at the ſame time well acquainted with her own condition, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to follow his directions; and threatened to publiſh her ſituation to the world, if he would not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately take ſome method of providing for the important occaſion, which ſhe expected in a few months. It was not long before I gueſſed the reſult of his deliberation, by his addreſſing himſelf to me (one day) in this manner: <q>I am ſurpriſed, that a young fellow like you, diſcovers no inclination to puſh his fortune in the world. Before I was of your age, I was broiling on the coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.—Damme! what's to hinder you from profiting by the war, which will certainly be declared in a ſhort time againſt Spain?—You may eaſily go on board a king's ſhip in quality of ſurgeon's mate, where you will certainly ſee a great deal of practice, and ſtand a good chance of getting prize-money.</q>—I laid hold of this declaration, which I had long wiſhed for, and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him I would follow his advice with pleaſure, if it was in my power; but that it was impoſſible for me to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace an opportunity of that kind, as I had no friend to advance a little money, to ſupply me with what neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I ſhould want, and defray the expences of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to London. He told me, that few neceſſaries were required; and as for the expence of my journey, he would lend me money, ſufficient not only for that purpoſe, but alſo to maintain me comfortably in London, until I ſhould procure a warrant for my proviſion on board of ſome ſhip. I gave him a thouſand thanks for his obliging of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,

(although I was very well apprized of his motive, which was no other than a deſign to lay the baſtard to my charge, after my departure;) and accordingly ſet out in a few weeks for London; my whole fortune conſiſting of one ſuit of clothes, half a dozen of ruffled ſhirts, as many plain; two pair of worſted, and a like number of thread ſtockings; a caſe of pocket inſtruments, a ſmall edition of Horace, Wiſeman's ſurgery, and ten guineas in caſh; for which Crab took my bond, bearing 5 <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt; at the ſame time giving me a letter to the member of parliament for our town, which he ſaid would do my buſineſs effectually.</p>

                     <p>The hoſtler of the inn at which we put up, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was bound for London, adviſed me to take my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in a collier, which would be both cheap and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and withal much eaſier than to walk upwards of three hundred miles through deep roads, in the winter time; a journey which he believed I had not ſtrength enough to perform. I was almoſt perſuaded to take his advice, when, one day, ſtepping into a barber's ſhop to be ſhaved, the young man, while he lathered my face,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027715_0042_0FD5EB9BE09B1B60"/>
accoſted me thus: <q>Sir, I preſume you are a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</q> I anſwered in the affirmative.—<q>Pray (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he) from what part of Scotland?</q> I no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er told him, than he diſcovered great emotion, and not confining his operation to my chin and upper-lip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared my whole face with great agitation. I was ſo offended at this profuſion, that ſtarting up, I aſked him what the d—l he meant by uſing me ſo? He begged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, telling me his joy at meeting with a countryman had occaſioned ſome confuſion in him: and craved my name.—But when I declared my name was Random, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in a rapture, "How! Rory Random?" The ſame, replied I, looking at him with aſtoniſhment. <q>What cried he, don't you know your old ſchool-fellow, Hugh Strap?</q> At that inſtant recollecting his face, I flew into his arms, and in the tranſport of my joy, gave him back one half of the ſuds he had ſo laviſhly beſtowed on my countenance; ſo that we made a very ludicrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and furniſhed a great deal of mirth for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and ſhop-mates, who were witneſſes of this ſcene.—When our mutual careſſes were over, I ſat down again to be ſhaved, but the poor fellow's nerves were ſo diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by this unexpected meeting, that his hand could ſcarcely hold the razor, with which (nevertheleſs) he found means to cut me in three places, in as many ſtrokes. His maſter, perceiving his diſorder, bade another ſupply his place, and after the operation was performed, gave Strap leave to paſs the reſt of the day with me. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired immediately to my lodgings, where calling for ſome beer, I deſired to be informed of his adventures, which contained nothing more than that his maſter dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time was out, he had come to Newcaſtle about a year ago, in expectation of journey work, along with three young fellows of his acquaintance who worked in the keels; that he had the good fortune of being employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a very civil maſter, with whom he purpoſed to ſtay till the ſpring, at which time he intended to go to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where he did not doubt of finding encouragement. When I communicated to him my ſituation and deſign, he did not approve of my taking a paſſage by ſea, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the danger of a winter voyage, which is very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous along that coaſt, as well as the precariouſneſs of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027715_0043_0FD5EB9DC4CC6C90"/>
the wind, which might poſſibly detain me a great while to the no ſmall detriment of my fortune: whereas, if I would venture by land he would bear me company, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my baggage all the way; and if we ſhould be fatigued before we could perform the journey, it would be no hard matter for us to find on the road, either returning horſes or waggons, of which we might take the advantage for a very trifling expence. I was ſo raviſhed at this propoſal, that I embraced him affectionately, and aſſured him he might command my purſe to the laſt farthing; but he gave me to underſtand, he had ſaved money ſufficient to anſwer his own occaſions; and that he had a friend in London, who would ſoon introduce him into buſineſs, in that capital; and might poſſibly have it in his power to ſerve me alſo.</p>
                     <p>Having concerted the plan and ſettled our affairs that night, we departed next morning by day-break, armed with a good cudgel each, (my companion being charged with the furniture of us both, crammed into one knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack,) and our money ſewed between the lining and waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of our breeches, except ſome looſe ſilver for our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate expence on the road. We travelled all day at a round pace; but being ignorant of the proper ſtages, were benighted at a good diſtance from any inn, ſo that we were compelled to take up our lodgings at a ſmall hedge ale-houſe, that ſtood on a bye-road, about half a mile from the highway; there we found a pedlar of our own country, in whoſe company we regaled ourſelves with bacon and eggs, and a glaſs of good ale, before a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable fire, converſing all the while very ſociably with the landlord and his daughter, an hale buxom laſs, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained us with great good humour, and in whoſe affection I was vain enough to believe I had made ſome progreſs. About eight o'clock, we were all three, at our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, ſhewn into an apartment, furniſhed with two beds, in one of which Strap and I betook ourſelves to reſt, and the pedlar occupied the other, though not before he had prayed a conſiderable time <hi>extempore,</hi> ſearched into every corner of the room, and faſtened the door on the inſide with a ſtrong iron ſcrew, which he carried about with him for that uſe. I ſlept very ſound till midnight, when I was diſturbed by a violent motion of the bed, which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027715_0044_0FD5EB9FA8B98598"/>
ſhook under me with a continual tremor. Alarmed at this phenomenon, I jogged my companion, whom, to my no ſmall amazement, I found drenched in ſweat, and quaking through every limb; he told me with a low ſaultering voice, that we were undone; for there was a bloody highwayman with loaded piſtols in the next room; then bidding me make as little noiſe as poſſible, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me to a ſmall chink in the board partition, through which I could ſee a thickſet brawny fellow, with a fierce countenance, ſitting at a table with our young landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of piſtols before him. I liſtened with great attention, and heard him ſay in a terrible tone: <q>D—n that ſon of a bitch, Smack the coachman!—he has ſerved me a fine trick indeed!—but d—nation ſeize me, if I don't make him repent it! I'll teach the ſcoundrel to give intelligence to others, while he is under articles with me.</q>—Our landlady en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to appeaſe this exaſperated robber, by ſaying he might be miſtaken in Smack, who perhaps kept no correſpondence with the other gentleman that robbed his coach—and that if an accident had diſappointed him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he might ſoon find opportunities enough to atone for his loſt trouble. <q>I'll tell thee what, my dear Bett, (replied he,) I never had, nor ever will, while my name is Rifle, have ſuch a glorious booty as I miſſed to-day. Z—ds! there was four hundred pounds in caſh, to recruit men for the king's ſervice, beſides the jewels, watches, ſwords, and money belonging to the paſſengers; had it been my fortune to have got clear off with ſo much treaſure, I would have purchaſed a commiſſion in the army, and made you an officer's lady, you jade, I would.</q>—<q>Well, well, (cries Betty,) we muſt truſt to providence for that; but did you find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth taking, which eſcaped the other gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the road?</q> 
                        <q>Not much, faith, (ſaid the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;) I gleaned a few things—ſuch as a pair of pops, ſilver mounted, (here they are;) I took them loaded from the captain who had the charge of the money, together with a gold watch which he had concealed in his breeches.—I likewiſe found ten Portugal pieces in the ſhoes of a Quaker, whom the ſpirit moved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile me with great bitterneſs and devotion; but what I

                           </gap>ell in an inſtant.</q> He accordingly ran towards our door; when his ſweatheart interpoſing, aſſured him, there was only a couple of poor young Scotchmen, who were too raw and ignorant to give him the leaſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, and the third was a Preſbyterian pedlar of the ſame nation, who had often lodged in the houſe before.—This declaration ſatisfied the thief, who ſwore he was glad there was a pedlar, for he wanted ſome linen.—Then in a jovial manner he put about the glaſs, mingling his diſcourſe to Betty with careſſes and familiarities, that ſpoke him very happy in his amours. During that part of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which regarded us, Strap had crept under the bed, where he lay in the agonies of fear; ſo that it was with great difficulty I perſuaded him our danger was over, and prevailed on him to wake the pedlar, and inform him of what he had ſeen and heard. The itinerant merchant no ſooner felt ſomebody ſhaking him by the ſhoulder, than he ſtarted up, calling as loud as he could—<q>Thieves, thieves! Lord have mercy on us!</q> And Rifle, alarmed at this exclamation, jumped up, cocked one of his piſtols, and turned towards the door, to kill the firſt man who ſhould enter; for he verily believed himſelf beſet; when his Dulcinea, after an immoderate fit of laughter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him, that the poor pedlar, dreaming of thieves, had only cried out in his ſleep.—Mean while my comrade had undeceived our fellow lodger, and informed him of his reaſon for diſturbing him; upon which getting up ſoftly, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

cuſtomer for the future of the value of a pin's point, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he might be reſcued from the preſent danger. Whether or not the diſburthening his conſcience afforded him any eaſe, I know not; but he ſlipt into bed again, and lay very quiet until the robber and his miſtreſs were aſleep, and ſnored in concert; then riſing ſoftly, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied a rope that was round his pack, which making faſt to one end of it, he opened the window with as little noiſe as poſſible, and lowered his goods into the yard with great dexterity; then he moved gently to our bed-ſide, and bade us farewel, telling us, that as we ran no riſk, we might take our reſt with great confidence, and in the morning aſſure the landlord that we knew nothing of his eſcape: and laſtly, ſhaking us by the hands, and wiſhing us all manner of ſucceſs, he let himſelf drop from the window without any danger, for the ground was not above a yard from his feet as he hung on the outſide. Although I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight, I was not at all free from apprehenſion, when I reflected on what might be the effect of the highwayman's diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; as he certainly intended to make free with the pedlar's ware. Neither was my companion at more eaſe in his mind; but on the contrary ſo poſſeſſed with the dreadful idea of Rifle, that he ſolicited me ſtrongly to follow our countryman's example, and ſo elude the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reſentment of that terrible adventurer, who would certainly wreak his vengeance on us, as accomplices of the pedlar's elopement. But I repreſented to him the danger of giving Rifle cauſe to think we knew his profeſſion, and ſuggeſted, that if ever he ſhould meet us again on the road, he would look upon us as dangerous acquaintance, and find it his intereſt to put us out of the way. I told him withal, my confidence in Betty's good nature; in which he acquieſced, and during the remaining part of the night, we concerted a proper method of behaviour, to render us unſuſpected in the morning.</p>
                     <p>It was no ſooner day, than Betty, entering our cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and perceiving our window open, cried out, <q>Odds bobs! ſure you Scotchmen muſt have hot conſtitutions, to lie all night with the window open, in ſuch cold weather.</q> I feigned to ſtart out of ſleep, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the curtain, called, "What's the matter?"
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027715_0047_0FD5EBA6642C0A50"/>
When ſhe ſhewed me, I affected ſurpriſe, and ſaid, <q>Bleſs me! the window was ſhut when we went to bed.</q> 
                        <q>I'll be hanged, (ſaid ſhe,) if Sawney Waddle, the ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar has not got up in a dream and done it, for I heard him very obſtropulous in his ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Sure I put a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber pot under his bed.</q>—With theſe words ſhe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the bed in which he lay, and finding the ſheets cold, exclaimed, "Good lack a daiſy! the rogue is fled!" <q>—Fled! (cried I, with ſeigned amazement,) God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid! Sure he has not robbed us.</q>—Then ſpringing up, I laid hold of my breeches, and emptied all my looſe money into my hand; which having reckoned, I ſaid, <q>Heaven be praiſed, our money is all ſafe—Strap, look to the knapſack.</q> He did ſo, and found all was right. Upon which we aſked with ſeeming concern, if he had ſtole nothing belonging to the houſe? <q>No, no, (replied ſhe,) he has ſtole nothing but his rockoning;</q> which, it ſeems, this pious pedlar had forgot to diſcharge in the midſt of his devotion.—Betty, after a moment's pauſe, withdrew, and immediately we could hear her waken Rifle, who no ſooner heard of Waddle's flight, than he jumped out of bed and dreſſed, venting a thouſand execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and vowing to murder the pedlar if ever he ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

While we were at breakfaſt, Betty endeavoured by all the cunning ſhe was miſtreſs of, to learn whether or no we ſuſpected our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low lodger, whom we ſaw take horſe; but as we were on our guard, we anſwered her ſly queſtions with a ſimplicity ſhe could not diſtruſt; when all of a ſudden we heard the trampling of a horſe's feet at the door. This noiſe alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Strap ſo much, whoſe imagination was wholly engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the image of Rifle, that with a countenance as pale as milk, he cried, <q>O Lord! there's the highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man returned!</q>—Our landlady ſtaring at theſe words, ſaid, <q>What highwayman, young man?—Do you think any highwaymen harbour here?</q>—Though I was very much diſconcerted at this piece of indiſcretion in Strap, I had preſence of mind enough to tell her, we had

met a horſeman the day before, whom Strap had fooliſhly ſuppoſed to be a highwayman, becauſe he rode with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols; and that he had been terrified at the found of a horſe's feet ever ſince.—She forced a ſmile at the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and timidity of my comrade; but I could perceive (not without great concern) that this account was not at all ſatisfactory to her.</p>

                        <p>We proceed on our journey—are overtaken by a highwayman who fires at Strap—is prevented from ſhooting me by a company of horſemen, who ride in purſuit of him—Strap is put to bed at an inn—Adventures at that inn.</p>

                     <p>AFTER having paid our ſcore, and taken leave of our hoſteſs, who embraced me tenderly at parting, we proceeded on our journey, bleſſing ourſelves that we had come off ſo well. We had not walked above five miles, when we obſerved a man on horſeback galloping after us, who we in a ſhort time recognized to be no other than this formidable hero who had already given us ſo much vexation. He ſtopped hard by me, and aſked if I knew who he was?—My aſtoniſhment had diſconcerted me ſo much, that I did not hear his queſtion, which he repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a volley of oaths and threats; but I remained as mute as before. Strap ſeeing my diſcompoſure, fell upon his knees in the mud, uttering with a lamentable voice, theſe words: <q>For Ch—ſt's ſake, have mercy upon us, Mr. Rifle, we know you very well.</q>—<q>O ho! (cried the thief,) you do!—But you ſhall never be evidence againſt me in this world, you dog!</q>—So ſaying, he drew a piſtol, and fired it at the unfortunate ſhaver, who ſell flat upon the ground without ſpeaking one word.—My comrade's ſate, and my own ſituation, rivetted me to the place where I ſtood, deprived of all ſenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; ſo that I did not make the leaſt attempt either to run away, or deprecate the wrath of this barbarian, who ſnapped a ſecond piſtol at me; but before he had time to prime again, perceiving a company of horſeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027715_0049_0FD5EBAB9D806610"/>
appearance had ſaved my life. This company conſiſted of three men in livery, well armed, with an officer, who (as I afterwards learned) was the perſon from whom Rifle had taken the pocket piſtols the day before; and who making known his misfortune to a nobleman he met on the road, and aſſuring him, his non-reſiſtance was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther owing to his conſideration for the ladies in the coach, procured the aſſiſtance of his Lordſhip's ſervants to go in queſt of the plunderer. This holiday captain ſcampered up to me with great addreſs, and aſked who fired the piſtol which he had heard. As I had not yet recovered my reaſon, he, before I could anſwer, obſerved a body lying upon the ground; at which ſight his colour changed, and he pronounced with a faultering tongue, <q>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, here's murder committed! let us alight.</q> 
                        <q>No, no, (ſaid one of his followers,) let us rather purſue the murderer.—Which way went he, young man?</q> By this time I had recollected myſelf ſo far as to tell them he could not be a quarter of a mile before; and to beg one of them to aſſiſt me in conveying the corpſe of my friend to the next houſe, in order to its being interred.—The captain foreſeeing, that in caſe he ſhould purſue, he muſt ſoon come to action, began to curb his horſe, and gave him the ſpur at the ſame time, which treatment making the creature rear up and ſnort, he called out, his horſe was frightened and would not proceed; at the ſame time wheeling him round and round, ſtroking his neck, whiſtling and wheedling him with <q>Sirrah, ſirrah—gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q>—<q>Zounds! (cried one of the ſervants,) ſure my Lord's Sorrel is not reſty!</q>—With theſe words, he beſtowed a laſh on his buttock, and Sorrel, diſdaining the rein, ſprung forward with the captain at a pace that would have ſoon brought him up with the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, had not the girth (happily for him) given way, by which means he landed in the dirt; and two of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants continued their purſuit, without minding his ſituation. Meanwhile one of the three who remained at my deſire, turning the body of Strap, in order to ſee the wound which had killed him, found him ſtill warm and breathing; upon which I immediately let him blood, and ſaw him with inexpreſſible joy, recover; he having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no other wound than what his fear had inflicted.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027715_0050_0FD5EBABA2A61A18"/>
Having raiſed him upon his legs, we walked together to an inn, about half a mile from the place, where Strap, who was not quite recovered, went to bed; and in a little time the third ſervant returned with the captain's horſe and furniture, leaving him to crawl after as well as he could. This gentleman of the ſword, upon his arrival, complained grievouſly of the bruiſe occaſioned by his fall; and on the recommendation of his ſervant, who warranted my ability, I was employed to bleed him, for which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he rewarded me with half-a-crown.</p>
                     <p>The time between this event and dinner I paſſed in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a game at cards between two farmers, an exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a young fellow in a ruſty gown and caſſock, who, as I afterwards underſtood, was curate of a neighbouring pariſh. It was eaſy to perceive that the match was not equal, and that the two farmers, who were partners, had to do with a couple of ſharpers, who ſtript them of all their caſh in a very ſhort time. But what ſurpriſed me very much was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> this clergyman reply to one of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, who ſeemed to ſuſpect foul play, in thoſe words, "D—n me, friend, d'ye queſtion my honour?" I did not at all wonder to find a cheat in canonicals, this being a character frequent in my own country; but I was ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at the indecency of his behaviour, which appeared in the oaths he ſwore, and the bawdy ſongs which he ſung. At laſt, to make amends in ſome ſort for the damage he had done to the unwary boors, he pulled out a fiddle from the lining of his gown, and, promiſing to treat them at dinner, began to play moſt melodiouſly, ſinging in concert all the while. This good humour of the parſon inſpired the company with ſo much glee, that the farmers ſoon forgot their loſſes, and all preſent went to dancing in the yard. While we were agreeably amuſed in this manner, our muſician, ſpying a horſeman riding towards the inn, ſtopped all of a ſudden, crying out, <q>Gad ſo! gentlemen, I beg your pardon; there's our dog of a doctor coming into the inn.</q> He immediately concealed his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ran towards the gate, where he took hold of the vicar's bridle, and helped him off, inquiring very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially into the ſtate of his health. This roſy ſon of the church (who might be about the age of fifty) having alighted, and intruſted the curate with his horſe, ſtalked
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027715_0051_0FD5EBB022E7D250"/>
with great ſolemnity into the kitchen, where, ſitting down by the fire, he called for a bottle of ale and a pipe, ſcarce deigning an anſwer to the ſubmiſſive queſtions of thoſe who enquired about the welfare of his family. While he indulged himſelf in this ſtate, amidſt a profound ſilence, the curate, approaching him with great reverence, aſked him if he would not be pleaſed to honour us with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at dinner? To which interrogation he anſwered in the negative, ſaying, he had been to viſit Squire Bumpkin, who had drank himſelf into a high fever at the laſt aſſizes, and that he had, on leaving his own houſe, told Betty he ſhould dine at home. Accordingly, when he had made an end of his bottle and pipe, he roſe, and moved with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical dignity to the door, where his journeyman ſtood ready with his nag. He had no ſooner mounted, than the facetious curate, coming into the kitchen, held forth in this manner: <q>There the old raſcal goes, and the D—l go with him.—You ſee how the world wags, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.—By Gad, this rogue of a vicar does not deſerve to live; and yet he has two livings worth 400 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery, and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach—for what? why, truly, for 20 <hi>l.</hi> a-year. I ſcorn to boaſt of my own qualifications; but—compariſons are odious. I ſhould be glad to know how this ſwag-bellied doctor deſerves to be more at eaſe than me. He can loll in his elbow chair at home, indulge himſelf in the beſt of victuals and wine, and enjoy the converſation of Betty his houſekeeper.—You underſtand me, gentlemen.—Betty is the doctor's poor kinſwoman, and a pretty girl ſhe is; but no matter for that: ay, and a dutiful girl to her parents, whom ſhe viſits regularly every year, tho' I muſt own I could never learn in what county they live—My ſervice t'ye, gentlemen.</q> By this time, din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being ready, I waked my companion, and we eat all together with great cheerfulneſs. When our meal was ended, and every man's ſhare of the reckoning adjuſted, the curate went out on pretence of ſome neceſſary occaſion, and, mounting his horſe, left the two farmers to ſatisfy the hoſt in the beſt manner they could. We were no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er informed of this piece of fineſſe than the exciſeman, who had been ſilent hitherto, began to open with a malicious
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027715_0052_0FD5EBB0F6335DC0"/>
grin; <q>Ay, ay, this is an old trick of Shuffle—I could not help ſmiling when he talked of treating. You muſt know this is a very curious fellow—he picked up ſome ſcraps of learning while he ſerved young Lord Trifle at the univerſity. But what he moſt excels in is pimping. No man knows his talents better than I; for I was valet de chambre to Squire Tattle, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate companion of Shuffle's lord. He got himſelf into a ſcrape by pawning ſome of his lordſhip's clothes, on which account he was turned away; but, as he was acquainted with ſome particular circumſtances of my lord's conduct, he did not care to exaſperate him too much, and ſo made intereſt for his receiving orders, and afterwards recommended him to the curacy which he now enjoys. However, the fellow cannot be too much admired for his dexterity in making a comfortable live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood in ſpite of ſuch a ſmall allowance. You hear he plays a good ſtick and is really diverting company—Theſe qualifications make him agreeable wherever he goes—and, as for playing at cards, there is not a man within three counties a match for him—The truth is, he is a damnable cheat, and can ſhift a card with ſuch addreſs, that it is impoſſible to diſcover him.</q> Here he was interrupted by one of the farmers, who aſked why he had not juſtice enough to acquaint them with theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars before they engaged in play? The exciſeman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied without any heſitation, that it was none of his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to intermeddle between man and man; beſides, he did not know they were ignorant of Shuffle's character, which was notorious to the whole country. This did not ſatisfy the other, who taxed him with abetting and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curate's knavery, and inſiſted on having his ſhare of the winnings returned; this demand the exciſeman as poſitively refuſed, affirming, that, whatever ſlights Shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle might practiſe on other occaſions, he was very certain, that he had played on the ſquare with them, and would anſwer it before any bench in Chriſtendom; ſo ſaying, he got up, and, having paid his reckoning, ſneaked off. The landlord, thruſting his neck into the paſſage to ſee if he was gone, ſhook his head, ſaying, <q>Ah! Lord help us! if every ſinner was to have his deſerts—Well, we vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallers muſt not diſoblige the exciſemen.—But I know

what—if parſon Shuffle and he were weighed together, a ſtraw thrown into either ſcale would make the balance kick the beam.—But, maſters, this is under the roſe,</q> continued Boniface with a whiſper.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>STRAP and I were about to depart on our journey, when we perceived a crowd on the road coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us ſhouting and hallooing all the way. As it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, we could diſcern a man on horſeback in the middle, with his hands tied behind him, whom we ſoon knew to be Rifle. This highwayman, not being ſo well mounted as the two ſervants who went in purſuit of him, was ſoon overtaken, and, after having diſcharged his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols, was made priſoner without any farther oppoſition. They were carrying him in triumph, amidſt the acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the country people, to a juſtice of peace in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring village, but ſtopped at our inn to join their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and take refreſhment. When Rifle was diſmounted, and placed in the yard within a circle of peaſants armed with pitchforks, I was amazed to ſee what a pitiful dejected fellow he now appeared, who had but a few hours before filled me with terror and confuſion. My companion was ſo much encouraged by this alteration in his appearance, that, going up to thief, he preſented his clenched fiſts to his noſe, and declared, he would either cudgel or box with the priſoner for a guinea, which he immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and began to ſtrip—but was diſſuaded from his adventure by me, who repreſented to him the folly of the undertaking, as Rifle was now in the hands of juſtice, which would no doubt give us all ſatisfaction enough. But what made me repent of our impertinent curioſity, was our being detained by the captors as evidence againſt him, when we were juſt going to ſet forward. However, there was no remedy; we were obliged to comply, and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027715_0054_0FD5EBB3F3E3EB98"/>
accordingly joined in the cavalcade, which luckily took the ſame road that we had propoſed to follow. About twilight we arrived at the place of our deſtination; but as the juſtice was gone to viſit a gentleman in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with whom (we underſtood) he would probably ſtay all night, the robber was confined in an empty garret three ſtories high, from which it ſeemed impoſſible for him to eſcape; however, next morning, when they went up ſtairs to bring him before the juſtice, the bird was flown, having got out at the window upon the roof, from whence he continued his rout along the tops of the adjoining houſes, and entered another garret-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, where he ſculked until the family were aſleep, at which time he ventured down ſtairs, and let himſelf out by the ſtreet-door, which was found open. This event was a great diſappointment to thoſe that apprehended him, who were fluſhed with the hopes of the reward, but gave me great joy, as I was permitted now to continue my journey without any farther moleſtation. Reſolving to make up for the ſmall progreſs we had hitherto made, we this day travelled with great vigour, and, before night, reached a market-town twenty miles from the place from whence we ſet out in the morning, without meeting any adventure worth notice. Here, having taken up our lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at an inn, I found myſelf ſo fatigued, that I began to deſpair of performing our journey on foot, and deſired Strap to inquire if there were any waggon, return-horſes, or other cheap carriage in this place, to depart for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don next day. He was informed that the waggon from Newcaſtle to London had halted here two nights ago, and that it would be an eaſy matter to overtake it, if not the next day, at fartheſt the day after. This piece of news gave us ſome ſatisfaction; and, after having made a hearty ſupper on haſhed mutton, we were ſhewn to our room, which contained two beds; the one allotted for us, and the other for a very honeſt gentleman, who, we were told, was then drinking below. Though we could have very well diſpenſed with his company, we were glad to ſubmit to this diſpoſition, as there was not another bed empty in the houſe, and accordingly went to reſt, after having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured our baggage under the bolſter. About two or three o'clock in the morning I was waked out of a very profound
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027715_0055_0FD5EBB562587718"/>
ſleep by a dreadful noiſe in the chamber, which did not fail to throw me into an agony of conſternation, when I heard theſe words pronounced with a terrible voice—<q>Blood and wounds! run the halbert into the guts of him that's next you, and I'll blow the other's brains out preſently.</q>—This dreadful ſalutation had no ſooner reached the ears of Strap, than ſtarting out of bed, he ran againſt ſomebody in the dark, and overturned him in an inſtant; at the ſame time bawling out, "Fire! mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! fire!" a cry which in a moment alarmed the whole houſe, and filled our chamber with a crowd of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked people.—When lights were brought, the occaſion of all this diſturbance ſoon appeared; which was no other than our fellow-lodger, whom we found lying on the floor ſcratching his head, with a look teſtifying the utmoſt aſtoniſhment, at the concourſe of apparitions that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him.—This honeſt gentleman was, it ſeems, a recruiting ſerjeant, who having inliſted two country-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows over-night, dreamed that they had mutined, and threatened to murder him and the drummer who was along with him. This made ſuch an impreſſion on his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that he got up in his ſleep, and expreſſed himſelf as above. When our apprehenſion of danger vaniſhed, the company beheld one another with great ſurpriſe and mirth; but what attracted the notice of every one, was our landlady with nothing on her but her ſhift and a large pair of buck-ſkin breeches with the backſide before, which ſhe had ſlipt on in the hurry, and her huſband with her petticoat about his ſhoulders. One had wrapt himſelf in a blanket; another was covered with a ſheet; and the drummer, who had given his only ſhirt to be waſhed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>in cuerpo</hi> with the bolſter rolled about his middle. When this affair was diſcuſſed, every body retired to his own apartment, the ſerjeant ſlipt into bed, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and I ſlept without any farther diſturbance till morning, when we got up, went to breakfaſt, paid our reckoning, and ſet forward in expectation of overtaking the waggon; in which hope, however, we were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that day. As we exerted ourſelves more than uſual, I found myſelf quite ſpent with fatigue, when we entered a ſmall village in the twilight. We inquired for
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027715_0056_0FD5EBB6E1BDD910"/>
a public-houſe, and were directed to one of a very ſorry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. At our entrance the landlord, who ſeemed to be a venerable old man with long grey hair, roſe from a table placed by a large fire in a very neat paved kitchen, and with a chearful countenance accoſted us in theſe words: <hi>"Salvete pueri—ingredimini."</hi> I was not a little pleaſed to hear our hoſt ſpeak Latin, becauſe I was in hope of recommending myſelf to him by my knowledge in that language; I therefore anſwered without heſitation—<hi>
                           <q>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve frigus, ligna ſuper foco—large reponens.</q>
                        </hi> I had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, than the old gentleman, running towards me, ſhook me by the hand, crying, <hi>
                           <q>Fili mi delectiſſime! unde venis!—a ſuperis ni fallor?</q>
                        </hi> In ſhort, finding we were both read in the claſſics, he did not know how to teſtify his regard enough, but ordered his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a jolly-roſy-cheeked damſel, who was his ſole dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic, to bring us a bottle of his <hi>quadrimum</hi>—repeating from Horace at the ſame time, <hi>
                           <q>Deprome quadrimum, Sá<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina, O Thaliarche merum diotâ.</q>
                        </hi> This <hi>quadrimum</hi> was excellent ale of his own brewing, of which he told us he had always an <hi>amphora,</hi> four years old, for the uſe of himſelf and friends. In the courſe of our converſation, which was interlarded with ſcraps of Latin, we underſtood that this facetious perſon was a ſchool-maſter, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come being ſmall, he was fain to keep a glaſs of good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor for the entertainment of paſſengers, by which means he made ſhift to make the two ends of the year meet. <q>I am this day, ſaid he, the happieſt old fellow in his Majeſty's dominions.

                        </q> As he was very inquiſitive about our affairs, we made no ſcruple of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with our ſituation, which, when he had learned, he inriched us with advices how to behave in the world, telling us he was no ſtranger to the deceits of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027715_0057_0FD5EBB85DCE4790"/>
In the mean time he ordered his daughter to lay a fowl to the fire for ſupper; for he was reſolved this night to regale his friends—<hi>permittens divis caetera.</hi> While our entertainment was preparing, our hoſt recounted the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of his own life, which, as they contain nothing remarkable, I forbear to rehearſe. When we had fared ſumptuouſly, and drank ſeveral bottles of his <hi>quadrimum,</hi> I expreſſed a deſire of going to reſt, which was with ſome difficulty complied with, after he had informed us that we ſhould overtake the waggon by noon next day; and that there was room enough in it for half a dozen, for there were only four paſſengers as yet in that conveyance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my comrade and I fell aſleep we had ſome converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the good humour of our landlord, which gave Strap ſuch an idea of his benevolence, that he poſitively believed we ſhould pay nothing for our lodging and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. "Don't you obſerve," ſaid he, <q>that he has conceived a particular affection for us?—nay, even treated us at ſupper with extraordinary fare, which, to be ſure, we ſhould not of ourſelves have called for?</q> I was partly of Strap's opinion; but the experience I had of the world made me ſuſpend my belief till the morning, when, getting up betimes, we breakfaſted with our hoſt and his daughter on haſty-pudding and ale, and deſired to know what we had to pay.—<q>Biddy will let you know, gentlemen,</q> ſaid he; <q>for I never mind theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

                        </q> Meanwhile Biddy, having conſulted a ſlate that hung in a corner, told us our reckoning came to 8<hi>s.</hi> 7<hi>d.</hi>—"Eight ſhillings and ſevenpence!" cried Strap; <q>'tis impoſſible—you muſt be miſtaken, young woman.</q>—"Reckon again, child," ſays her father very deliberately, "perhaps you have miſcounted."—"No indeed, father," ſhe replied, <q>I know my buſineſs better.</q> I could contain my indignation no longer, but ſaid it was an unconſcionable bill, and demanded to know the particulars; upon which the old man got up, muttering, <q>Ay, ay, let us ſee the particulars—that's but reaſonable;</q> and taking pen, ink, and paper, wrote the following <hi>items.</hi>

As he had not the appearance of a common publican, and had raiſed a ſort of veneration in me by his demeanour the preceding night, it was not in my power to upbraid him as he deſerved; therefore I contented myſelf with ſaying, I was ſure he did not learn to be an extortioner from Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race. He anſwered, <q>I was but a young man, and did not know the world, or I would not tax him with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, whoſe only aim was to live <hi>contentus parvo,</hi> and keep off <hi>importuna pauperies.</hi>
                        </q> My fellow-traveller could not ſo eaſily put up with this impoſition, but ſwore he ſhould either take one third of the money, or go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. While we were engaged in this diſpute, I perceived the daughter to go out, and conjecturing the occaſion, immediately paid the exorbitant demand, which was no ſooner done, than Biddy returned with two ſtout fellows, who came in on pretence of taking their morning draught, but in reality to frighten us into compliance. Juſt as we departed, Strap, who was half diſtracted on account of this piece of expence, went up to the ſchool-maſter, and, grinning in his face, pronounced with great emphaſis, <hi>"Semper avarus eget."</hi> To which the pedant replied with a malicious ſmile, <hi>"Animum rege, qui, niſi paret, imperat."</hi>

                        <p>We deſcry the waggon—get into it—arrive at an inn—our fellow-travellers deſcribed—a miſtake is committed by Strap, which produces ſtrange things.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE travelled half a mile without exchanging one word, my thoughts being ingroſſed by the knavery of the world, to which I muſt be daily expoſed, and the contemplation of my finances, which began ſenſibly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027715_0059_0FD5EBBF24701060"/>
At length Strap, who could hold no longer, addreſſed me thus: <q>Well, fools and their money are ſoon parted. If my advice had been taken, that old ſkin-flint ſhould have been d—d before he had got more than the third of his demand.—'Tis a ſure ſign you came eaſily by your money, when you ſquander it away in this manner. Ah! God help you, how many briſly beards muſt I have mowed before I earned four ſhillings and threepence halfpenny, which is all thrown to the dogs? How many days have I ſat weaving hair, till my toes were numbed by the cold, my fingers cramped, and my noſe as blue as the ſign of the periwig that hung over the door? What the devil was you afraid of? I would have engaged to box with any one of thoſe fellows, who came in for a guinea. I'm ſure I have beat ſtouter men than either of them.</q> And indeed, my companion would have ſought any body when his life was in no danger; but he had a mortal averſion to fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms, and all inſtruments of death. In order to appeaſe him, I aſſured him, no part of this extraordinary expence ſhould fall upon his ſhoulders; at which declaration he was affronted, and told me he would have me to know, that, although he was a poor barber's boy, he had a ſoul to ſpend his money with the beſt ſquire of the land.</p>
                     <p>Having walked all day at a great pace, without halting for a refreſhment, we deſcribed towards the evening, to our inexpreſſible joy, the waggon about a quarter of a mile before us, and by that time we reached it, were both ſo weary, that I verily believe it would have been impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for us to have walked one mile farther. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bargained with the driver, whoſe name was Joey, to give us a caſt to the next ſtage for a ſhilling, at which place we ſhould meet the maſter of the waggon, with whom we might agree for the reſt of the journey.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly the convenience ſtopt, and, Joey having placed the ladder, Strap (being loaded with our baggage) mounted firſt; but, juſt as he was getting in, a tremendous voice aſſailed his ears in theſe words: <q>God's ſury! there ſhall no paſſengers come here.</q> The poor ſhaver was ſo diſconcerted at this exclamation, which both he and I imagined proceeded from the mouth of a giant, that he deſcended with great velocity, and a countenance as white
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027715_0060_0FD5EBC0A0525290"/>
as paper. Joey, perceiving our aſtoniſhment, called with an arch ſneer, <q>Waounds, coptain, whay waon't you ſoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the poor waggoneer to meake a penny?—Coom, coom, young man, get oop, get oop, never moind the coptain. I'ſe not afraid of the coptain.</q> This was not encouragement ſufficient to Strap, who could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to venture up again; upon which I attempted, though not without a quaking heart, when I heard the ſame voice muttering like diſtant thunder—<q>Hell and the devil confound me, if I don't make you ſmart for this!</q> However, I crept in, and by accident got an empty place in the ſtraw, which I immediately took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, without being able to diſcern the faces of my fellow-travellers in the dark. Strap, following with the knapſack on his back, chanced to take the other ſide, and, by a jolt of the carriage, pitched directly upon the ſtomach of the captain, who bellowed out in a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner:—"Blood and thunder! where's my ſword?" At theſe words my frighted comrade ſtarted up, and at one ſpring bounced againſt me with ſuch force, that I thought he was the ſuppoſed ſon of Anak, who intended to preſs me to death. In the mean time a female voice cried, "Bleſs me! What is the matter, my dear?"—"The matter," replied the captain; <q>damn my blood! my guts are ſqueezed into a pancake by that Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's hump.</q> Strap trembling all the while at my back, aſked him pardon, and laid all the blame of what had happened upon the jolting of the waggon: and the woman who ſpoke before went on: <q>Ay, ay, my dear, it is our own fault; we may thank ourſelves for all the inconveniences we meet with. I thank God I never tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſo before—I'm ſure if my lady or Sir John was to know where we are, they would not ſleep this night for vexation—I wiſh to God we had writ for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot: I know we ſhall never be forgiven.</q> "Come, come, my dear," replied the captain, <q>it don't ſignify fretting now—we ſhall laugh it over as a frolic—I hope you will not ſuffer in your health. I ſhall make my lord very merry with our adventures in the Diligence.</q> This diſcourſe gave me ſuch a high notion of the captain and his lady, that I durſt not venture to join in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; but, immediately after, another female voice
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027715_0061_0FD5EBC46A794E68"/>
began; <q>Some people give themſelves a great many need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs airs—better folks than any here have travelled in waggons before now. Some of us have rode in coaches and chariots with three footmen behind them, without making ſo much fuſs about it—What then? we are now all upon a footing; therefore let us be ſociable and merry. What do you ſay, Iſaac? Is not this a good motion, you doating rogue?—Speak, you old <hi>cent. per cent.</hi> fornicator. What deſperate debt are you think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of? What mortgage are you planning? Well, Iſaac, poſitively you ſhall never gain my favour till you turn over a new leaf; grow honeſt, and live like a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. In the mean time give me a kiſs, you old fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler.</q> Theſe words accompanied with a hearty ſmack, enlivened the perſon, to whom they were addreſſed, to ſuch a degree, that he cried in a tranſport, though with a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering voice, <q>Ah! you wanton baggage—upon my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit you are a waggiſh girl, he, he, he.</q> This laugh introduced a fit of coughing, which almoſt ſuffocated the poor uſurer, (ſuch we afterwards found was the profeſſion of this our fellow-traveller.) About this time I fell aſleep, and enjoyed a comfortable nap till ſuch time as we arrived at the inn where we put up. Here, having alighted from the waggon, I had an opportunity of viewing the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in order as they entered. The firſt who appeared was a brisk airy girl, about twenty years old, with a ſilver laced hat on her head inſtead of a cap, a blue ſtuff riding ſuit trimmed with ſilver, very much tarniſhed, and a whip in her hand. After her came limping an old man, with a worſted night-cap buttoned under his chin, and a broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brimmed hat ſlouched over it, an old ruſty blue cloak tied about his neck, under which appeared a brown ſurtout that covered a thread-bare coat and waiſt-coat, and, as we afterwards diſcerned, a dirty flannel jacket; his eyes were hollow, bleared and gummy; his face was ſhrivelled into a thouſand wrinkles; his gums were deſtitute of teeth; his noſe ſharp and drooping; his chin peaked and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; ſo that, when he mumped or ſpoke, they approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another like a pair of nut-crackers: he ſupported himſelf on an ivory-beaded cane, and his whole figure was a juſt emblem of winter, famine, and avarice. But how was I ſurprized, when I beheld the formidable captain in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027715_0062_0FD5EBCA49407438"/>
the ſhape of a little thin creature, about the age of forty, with a long withered viſage very much reſembling that of a baboon, through the upper part of which two little grey eyes peeped: he wore his own hair in a queu that reached to his rump, which immoderate length, I ſuppoſe, was the occaſion of a baldneſs that appeared on the crown of his head, when he deigned to take off his hat, which was very much of the ſize and cock of Piſtol's. Having laid aſide his great coat, I could not help admiring the extraordinary make of this man of war: he was about five feet and three inches high, ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches of which went to his face and long ſcraggy neck, his thighs were about ſix inches in length, his legs reſembling ſpindles or drum-ſticks, two feet and a half, and his body, which put me in mind of extenſion without ſubſtance, engroſſed the remainder;—ſo that on the whole he appeared like a ſpider or graſhopper erect—and was almoſt a <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil.</hi> His dreſs conſiſted of a frock of what is called bear ſkin, the ſkirts of which were about half a foot long, an huſſar waiſtcoat, ſcarlet breeches reaching half way down his thigh, worſted ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings rolled up almoſt to his groin, and ſhoes with wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en heels at leaſt two inches high; he carried a ſword very near as long as himſelf in one hand, and with the other conducted his lady, who ſeemed to be a woman of his own age, and ſtill retained ſome remains of an agreeable perſon; but ſo ridiculouſly affected, that had I not been a novice in the world, I might have eaſily perceived in her the deplorable vanity and ſecond hand airs of a lady's woman.—We were all aſſembled in the kitchen, when Captain Weazle (for that was his name) deſired a room with a fire for himſelf and ſpouſe; and told the landlord, they would ſup by themſelves. The inn-keeper replied, that he could not afford them a room by themſelves; and, as for ſupping, he had prepared victuals for the paſſengers in the waggon, without reſpect of perſons; but if he could prevail on the reſt to let him have his choice in a ſeparate manner, he ſhould be very well pleaſed. This was ſooner ſaid, than all of us declared againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and Miſs Jenny (our other female paſſenger) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if Captain Weazle and his lady had a mind to ſup by themſelves, they might wait until we ſhould
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027715_0063_0FD5EBCC4BF83580"/>
have done. At this hint, the captain put on a martial frown, and looked very big, without ſpeaking; while his yoke-fellow with a diſdainful toſs of her noſe, muttered ſomething about "creature;"—which Miſs Jenny over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing, ſtept up to her, ſaying, <q>None of your names, good Mrs. Abigail;—creature, quotha!—I'll aſſure you—no ſuch creature as you neither—no ten pound ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—no quality coupler.</q>—Here the captain interpoſed with a "Damme, madam, what do you mean by that?"—<q>Damn you, Sir, who are you? (replied Miſs Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;) who made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcraping, pimping ſcoundrel?—'Sdeath! the army is come to a fine paſs, when ſuch fellows as you get commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—What, I ſuppoſe you think I don't know you?—Agad, you and your helpmate are well met—a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off miſtreſs and a bald <hi>valet de chambre</hi> are well yoked together.</q> 
                        <q>Blood and wounds! (cried Weazle) d'ye queſtion the honour of my wife, madam?—Hell and damnation! No man in England durſt ſay ſo much—I would flea him, carbonado him! Fury and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction! I would have his liver for my ſupper.</q>—So ſaying, he drew his ſword and flouriſhed with it, to the great terror to Strap; while Miſs Jenny ſnapping her fingers, told him, ſhe did not value his reſentment a louſe.—In the midſt of this quarrel, the maſter of the wagon alighted, who underſtanding the cauſe of the diſturbance, and fearing the captain and his lady would take umbrage, and leave his carriage, was at great pains to have every thing made up, which he at laſt accompliſhed, and we ſat down to ſupper all together. At bed-time we were ſhewed to our apartments: the old uſurer, Strap and I, to one room; the captain, his wife, and Miſs Jenny, to another.—About midnight, my companion's bowels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſordered, he got up, in order to go backward; but, in his return, miſtaking one door for another, entered Weazle's chamber, and without any heſitation went to bed to his wife, who was faſt aſleep; the captain being at another end of the room groping for ſome empty veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, in lieu of his own chamber-pot, which was leaky: as he did not perceive Strap coming in, he went toward his own bed, after having found a convenience; but no ſooner did he feel a rough head covered with a cotton
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027715_0064_0FD5EBCD5C49C688"/>
night-cap, than it came into his mind, that he had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Miſs Jenny's bed inſtead of his own, and that the head he felt was that of ſome gallant, with whom ſhe had made an aſſignation. Full of this conjecture, and ſcandalized at the proſtitution of his apartment, he ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the veſſel he had juſt before filled, and emptied it at once on the aſtoniſhed barber, and his own wife, who, waking at that inſtant, broke forth into lamentable cries, which not only alarmed the huſband beyond meaſure, but frightened poor Strap almoſt out of his ſenſes; for he verily believed himſelf bewitched; eſpecially when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed captain ſeized him by the throat, with a volley of oaths, aſking him how he durſt have the preſumption to attempt the chaſtity of his wife.—Poor Strap was ſo amazed and confounded, that he could ſay nothing, but—"I take God to witneſs ſhe's a virgin for me."—Mrs. Weazle, enraged to find herſelf in ſuch a pickle, through the precipitation of her huſband, aroſe in her ſhift, and with the heel of her ſhoe, which ſhe found by the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, belaboured the captain's bald pate, till he roared "Murder."—<q>I'll teach you to empty your ſtink-pots on me, (cried ſhe,) you pitiful hop-o'-my-thumb cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb. What? I warrant you're jealous, you man of lath.—Was it for this I condeſcended to take you to my bed, you poor, withered ſapleſs twig?</q>—The noiſe occaſioned by this adventure, had brought the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the waggon and me to the door, where we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard all that paſſed, with great ſatisfaction. In the mean time we were alarmed with the cry of "Rape! Murder! Rape!" which Miſs Jenny pronounced with great vociferation. <q>O! you vile, abominable old vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain (ſaid ſhe,) would you rob me of my virtue?—But I'll be reveng'd of you, you old goat! I will!—Help! for heaven's ſake! help!—I ſhall be raviſhed! ruin'd! help!</q>—Some ſervants of the inn, hearing this cry, came running up ſtairs with lights, and ſuch weapons as chance afforded; when we beheld a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ſcene.—In one corner ſtood the poor captain ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his ſhirt, which was all torn to rags; with a woeful viſage, ſcratched all over by his wife, who had by this time wrapt the counterpane about her, and sat ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing on the ſide of her bed. In the other end, lay the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027715_0065_0FD5EBCF1ECCB460"/>
old uſurer ſprawling on Miſs Jenny's bed, with his flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel jacket over his ſhirt, and his tawny meagre limbs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the air; while ſhe held him faſt by the two ears, and loaded him with execrations. When we aſked what was the matter, ſhe affected to weep, told us, ſhe was afraid that wicked rogue had ruined her in her ſleep, and bade us take notice of what we ſaw, for ſhe intended to make uſe of our evidence againſt him. The poor wretch looked like one more dead than alive, and begged to be releaſed; a favour which he had no ſooner obtained, than he proteſted ſhe was no woman, but a devil incarnate—that ſhe had firſt ſeduced his fleſh to rebel, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him. "Yes, cockatrice," (continued he) <q>you know you laid this ſnare for me—but you ſhan't ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed—for I will hang myſelf before you ſhall g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t a farthing of me.</q>—So ſaying, he crawled to his own bed, groaning all the way.—We then advanced to the captain, who told us, <q>Gentlemen, here has been a damn'd miſtake; but, I'll be reveng'd on him who was the occaſion of it.—That Scotchman who carries the knapſack ſhall not breathe this vital air another day, if my name be Weazle.—My dear, I aſk you ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pardons; you are ſenſible I could mean no harm to you.</q>—"I know not what you meant," (replied ſhe, ſighing) <q>but I know I have got enough to ſend me to my grave.</q>—At length they were reconciled.—The wife was complimented with a ſhare of Miſs Jenny's bed, (her own being overflowed,) and the maſter of the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon invited Weazle to ſleep the remaining part of the night with him. I retired to mine, where I found Strap mortally afraid, he having ſtolen away in the dark, while the captain and his lady were at loggerheads.</p>

                        <p>Captain Weazle challenges Strap, who declines the combat—an affair between the captain and me—the uſurer is fain to give Miſs Jenny five guineas for a releaſe—we are in danger of loſing a meal—the behaviour of Weazle, Jenny, and Joey on that occaſion—an account of captain Weazle and his lady—the captain's courage tried—Iſaac's mirth at the captain's expence.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NEXT morning, I agreed to give the maſter of the waggon ten ſhillings for my paſſage to London<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> provided Strap ſhould be allowed to take my place, when I ſhould be diſpoſed to walk. At the ſame time I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to appeaſe the inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſed captain, who had entered the kitchen with a drawn ſword in his hand, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with many oaths to ſacrifice the villain who attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to violate his bed; but it was to no purpoſe for the maſter to explain the miſtake, and aſſure him of the poor lad's innocence, who ſtood trembling behind me all the while: the more ſubmiſſion that appeared in Strap, the more implacable ſeemed the reſentment of Weazle, who ſwore he muſt either fight him or he would inſtantly put him to death. I was extremely provoked at this inſolence, and told him, it could not be ſuppoſed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the ſword at his own weapon; but I was perſuaded he would wreſtle or box with him. To which propoſal Strap immediately gave aſſent, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he would box with him for a guinea.—Weazle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, with a look of diſdain, that it was beneath any gentleman of his character to fight like a porter, or even to put himſelf on a footing, in any reſpect, with ſuch a fellow as Strap.—<q>Ods boddikins! (cries Joey,) ſure cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yaw would not coomit moorder! Here's a poor lad that's willing to make atonement for his offence; and an that woan't ſatisfy yaw, offers to fight yaw fairly.—An yaw woan't box, I dare ſay, he will cood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel with yaw.—Woan't yaw, my lad?</q>—Strap, after ſome heſitation, anſwered, "Ye—yes, I'll cudgel with him."—But this expedient being alſo rejected by the captain, I began to ſmell his character, and tipping Strap

the wink, told the company I had always heard it ſaid, the perſon who receives the challenge ſhould have the choice of the weapons; this therefore being the rule in point of honour, I would venture to promiſe on the head of my companion, that he would even fight Captain Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle at ſharps; but it ſhould be with ſuch ſharps as Strap was beſt acquainted with, namely razors.—At my men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning razors, I could perceive the captain's colour change, while Strap, pulling me by the ſleeve, whiſpered with great eagerneſs;—<q>No, no, not for the love of God don't make any ſuch bargain.</q>—At length Weazle, recovering himſelf, turned towards me, and with a fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious countenance aſked, <q>Who the devi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> are you?—will you fight me?</q> With theſe words, putting himſelf in a poſture, I was grievouſly alarmed at ſeeing the point of a ſword within half a foot of my breaſt; and ſpringing to one ſide, ſnatched up a ſpit that ſtood in the chimney-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with which I kept my formidable adverſary at bay, who made a great many half longes, ſkipping backward at every puſh, till at laſt I pinned him up in a corner, to the no ſmall diverſion of the company. While he was in this ſituation, his wife entered, and ſeeing her huſband in theſe dangerous circumſtances, uttered a dreadful ſcream.—In this emergency, Weazle demanded a ceſſation, which was immediately granted; and at laſt was contented with the ſubmiſſion of Strap, who, falling on his knees before him, proteſted the innocence of his intention, and aſked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the miſtake he had committed. This affair being ended without bloodſhed, we went to breakfaſt, but miſſed two of our company, namely, Miſs Jenny, and the uſurer. As for the firſt, Mrs. Weazle informed us, that ſhe had kept her awake all night with her groans; and that when ſhe roſe in the morning, Miſs Jenny was ſo much indiſpoſed, that ſhe could not proceed on her journey. At that inſtant, a meſſage came from her to the maſter of the waggon, who immediately went into her chamber, followed by us all. She told him, in a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tone, that ſhe was afraid of a miſcarriage, owing to the fright ſhe received laſt night, from the brutality of Iſaac; and as the event was uncertain, deſired the uſurer might be detained to anſwer for the conſequence. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this ancient Tarquin was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

whither he had retired to avoid the ſhame of laſt night's diſgrace, and brought by force into her preſence. He no ſooner appeared, than ſhe began to weep and ſigh moſt piteouſly, and told us, if ſhe died, ſhe would leave her blood upon the head of that raviſher. Poor Iſaac turned up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from the machinations of that Jezabel; and, aſſured us, with tears in his eyes, that his being found in bed with her, was the reſult of her own invitation.—The waggoner, underſtanding the caſe, adviſed Iſaac to make it up, by giving her a ſum of money: to which advice he replied with great vehemence, <q>A ſum of money!—a halter for the cockatrice!</q>—<q>O, 'tis very well (ſaid Miſs Jenny;) I ſee it is in vain to attempt that flinty heart of his, by fair means.—Joey, be ſo good as to go to the juſtice, and tell him there is a ſick perſon here, who wants to ſee him on an affair of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</q>—At the name of juſtice, Iſaac trembled, and bidding Joey ſtay, aſked with a quivering voice, "what ſhe would have?" She told him that as he had not perpetrated his wicked purpoſe, ſhe would be ſatisfied with a ſmall matter. And though the damage ſhe might ſuſtain in her health, might be irreparable, ſhe would give him a releaſe for an hundred guineas.—<q>An hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas! (cried he in an extaſy:) an hundred fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries!—Where ſhould a poor old wretch like me have an hundred guineas? If I had ſo much money, d'ye think I ſhould be found travelling in a waggon, at this ſeaſon of the year?</q>—<q>Come, come, (replied Jenny:) none of your miſerly artifice here. You think I don't know Iſaac Rapine, the money-broker in the Minories.—Ah! you old rogue! many a pawn have you had of me and my acquaintance which were never redeemed.</q>—Iſaac, finding it was in vain to diſguiſe himſelf, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty ſhillings for a diſcharge, which ſhe abſolutely refuſed under fifty pounds: at laſt, however, ſhe was brought down to five, which he paid, with great reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, rather than be proſecuted for a rape. After which accommodation the ſick perſon made ſhift to get into the waggon, and we ſet forwards in great tranquillity, Strap being accommodated with Joey's horſe, the driver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chuſing to walk.—This morning and forenoon we
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027715_0069_0FD5EBD7E6AF4A30"/>
were entertained with an account of the valour of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Weazle, who told us he had once knocked down a ſoldier that made game of him; tweaked a drawer by the noſe, who found fault with his picking his teeth with a fork, at another time; and that he had moreover challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a cheeſe-monger, who had the preſumption to be his rival: for the truth of which exploits he appealed to his wife.—She confirmed whatever he ſaid, and obſerved, <q>the laſt affair happened that very day on which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a love-letter from ſquire Gobble;—and don't you remember, my dear, I was prodigiouſly ſick that very night with eating ortolans, when my Lord Diddle took notice of my complexion's being altered, and my lady was ſo alarmed, that ſhe had well nigh ſainted?</q>—<q>Yes, my dear, (replied the captain,) you know, my lord ſaid to me, with a ſneer,—"Billy, Mrs. Weazle is certainly breeding."—And I anſwered cavalierly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My lord, I wiſh I could return the compliment."—Upon which the company broke out into an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fit of laughter; and my lord, who loves a repartee dearly, came round and buſſed me.</q>—We travelled in this manner five days, without interruption, or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing worth notice: Miſs Jenny (who ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her ſpirits) entertaining us every day with diverting ſongs, of which ſhe could ſing a great number; and ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying her old gallant, who, notwithſtanding, would never be reconciled to her.—On the ſixth day, while we were about to ſit down to dinner, the inn-keeper came and told us, that three gentlemen, juſt arrived, had ordered the victuals to be carried to their apartment, although he had informed them that they were beſpoke by the paſſengers in the waggon. To which information they had replied, <q>The paſſengers in the waggon might be damn'd—their betters m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the captain excuſed himſelf, ſaying, be would not for all the world be known to have travelled in a waggon; ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

at the ſame time, that could he appear with honour, they ſhould eat his ſword ſooner than his proviſion—Upon this declaration, Miſs Jenny ſnatching his weapon, drew it, and ran immediately into the kitchen, where ſhe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to put the cook to death, if he did not ſend the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals into our chamber immediately.—The noiſe ſhe made brought the three ſtrangers down, one of whom no ſooner perceived her, than he cried, <q>Ha! Jenny Ramper! what the devil brought thee hither?</q>—<q>My dear Jack Rattle!</q> replied ſhe, running into his arms, <q>is it you?—Then Weazle may go to hell for a dinner—I ſhall dine with you.</q>—They conſented to this propoſal with a great deal of joy; and we were on the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal, when Joey underſtanding the whole affair entered the kitchen with a pitchfork in his hand, and ſwore he would be the death of any man who ſhould pretend to ſeize the victuals pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the waggon.—This menace had like to have produced fatal conſequences; the three ſtrangers drawing their ſwords, and being joined by their ſervants, and we ranging ourſelves on the ſide of Joey; when the landlord interpoſing, offered to part with his own dinner to keep the peace, which was accepted by the ſtrangers; and we ſat down at table without any further moleſtation. In the afternoon, I choſe to walk along with Joey, and Strap took my place. Having entered into converſation with this driver, I ſoon found him to be a merry, facetious, good-natured fellow, and withal very arch: he informed me that Miſs Jenny was a common girl upon the town, who falling into company with a recruiting officer, he carried her down in the ſtage-coach from London to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, where he had been arreſted for debt, and was now in priſon; upon which ſhe was fain to return to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer way of life, by this conveyance. He told me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that one of the gentlemen's ſervants, whom we left at the inn, having accidentally ſeen Weazle, immediately knew him, and acquainted Joey with ſome particulars of his character. That he had ſerved my Lord Frizzle in quality of <hi>valet de chambre</hi> many years, while he lived ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from his lady: but, upon their reconciliation, ſhe expreſly inſiſted upon Weazle's being turned off, as well as the woman he kept: when his lordſhip, to get rid of
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:027715_0071_0FD5EBDAE8D3F720"/>
both with a good grace, propoſed that he ſhould marry his miſtreſs, and he would procure a commiſſion for him in the army. This expedient was agreed to, and Weazle is now, by his lordſhip's intereſt, enſign in—'s regiment. I found he and I had the ſame ſentiments with regard to Weazle's courage, which we reſolved to put to the trial, by alarming the paſſengers with the cry of "an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayman!" as ſoon as an horſeman ſhould appear. This ſcheme we put in practice toward the duſk, when we deſcried a man on horſeback approaching us. Joey had no ſooner intimated to the people in the waggon, that he was afraid we ſhould all be robbed, than a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſternation aroſe: Strap jumped out of the waggon and hid himſelf behind a hedge. The uſurer put forth ejaculations, and made a ruſtling among the ſtraw, which made us conjecture he had hid ſomething under it. Mrs. Weazle wringing her hands uttered lamentable cries; and the captain, to our great amazement, began to ſnore. But this artifice did not ſucceed; for Miſs Jenny ſhaking him by the ſhoulders, bawl'd out, <q>'Sdeath! Captain, is this a time to ſnore, when we are going to be robbed?—Get up for ſhame, and behave like a ſoldier and a man of honour.</q>—Weazle pretended to be in a great paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for being diſturbed, and ſwore he would have his nap out if all the highwaymen in England ſurrounded him.—"D—n my blood! what are you afraid of?" (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he;) at the ſame time trembling with ſuch agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the whole carriage ſhook.—This ſingular piece of behaviour incenſed Miſs Ramper ſo much, that ſhe cried, <q>D—n your pitiful ſoul, you are as arrant a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troon as ever was drummed out of a regiment.—Stop the waggon, Joey, let me go out, and by G—d if I have rhetoric enough, the thief ſhall not only take your purſe, but your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

By this time the horſeman came up with us, and happened to be a gentleman's ſervant well known to Joey, who communicated the ſcheme, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to carry it on a little further, by going up to the waggon, and queſtioning thoſe within.

miſerable ſinner who has got a ſmall family to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and nothing in the world wherewithal, but theſe fifteen ſhillings, which if you rob me of, we muſt all ſtarve together.—Who's that ſobbing in the other corner? ſaid the ſuppoſed highwayman. A poor unfortunate woman, anſwered Mrs. Weazle, upon whom I beg you for Chriſt's ſake to have compaſſion.—Are you maid or wife? ſaid he. Wife to my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</q> cried ſhe.—"Who, or where is your huſband?" continued he.—"My huſband," replied Mrs. Weazle, <q>is an officer in the army, and was left ſick at the laſt inn where we dined.</q>—"You muſt be miſtaken, Madam," ſaid he, <q>for I myſelf ſaw him get into the waggon this afternoon.—But pray what ſmell is that? Sure your lap-dog has befouled himſelf; let me catch hold of the naſty cur, I'll teach him better manners.</q>—Here he laid hold of one of Weazle's legs, and pulled him from under his wife's petticoats where he had concealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—The poor trembling captain being detected in this inglorious ſituation, rubbed his eyes, and affecting to wake out of ſleep, cried, "What's the matter?—What's the matter?"—"The matter is not much," anſwered the horſeman, "I only called in to enquire after your health, and ſo adieu, moſt noble captain."—So ſaying he clapped ſpurs to his horſe, and was out of ſight in a moment.—It was ſome time before Weazle could recollect himſelf; but at length reaſſuming the big look, he ſaid, <q>Damn the fellow! why did he ride away, before I had time to aſk him how his lord and lady do?—Don't you remember Tom, my dear?</q> addreſſing himſelf to his wife.—"Yes," replied ſhe, <q>I think I do remember ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the fellow,—but you know I ſeldom converſe with people of his ſtation.—"Hey day!" cried Joey, "do yaw knaw the young man, coptain?" Know him, ſaid Weazle, many a time has he filled a glaſs of Burgundy for me, at my Lord Trippit's table.—And what may his neame be, coptain? ſaid Joey. His name!—his name, replied Weazle, is Tom Rinſer.—"Waunds!" cried Joey, a has changed his own neame then! for I'ſe lay any wager he was chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened John Trotter.</q>—This obſervation raiſed a laugh againſt the captain, who ſeemed very much diſconcerted;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027715_0073_0FD5EBE0359EE5F0"/>
when Iſaac broke ſilence, and ſaid, <q>It is no matter who or what he was, ſince he has not proved the robber we ſuſpected—And we ought to bleſs God for our narrow eſcape.</q>—"Bleſs God," ſaid Weazle, <q>bleſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil! for what? Had he been a highwayman I ſhould have eat his blood, body and guts, before he had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me, or any one in this <hi>Diligence.</hi>
                        </q> "Ha, ha, ha!" cried Miſs Jenny, "I believe you will eat all you kill indeed, captain."—The uſurer was ſo well pleaſed at the event of this adventure, that he could not refrain from being ſevere, and took notice that Captain Weazle ſeemed to be a good chriſtian, for he had armed himſelf with patience and reſignation, inſtead of carnal weapons; and worked out his ſalvation with fear and trembling. This peace of ſatire occaſioned a great deal of mirth at Weazle's expence, who muttered a great many oaths, and threatened to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WE arrived at our inn, ſupped, and went to bed but Strap's diſtemper continuing, he was obliged to riſe in the middle of the night, and taking the candle in his hand, which he had left burning for the purpoſe, he went down to the yard, whence in a ſhort time he returned in a great hurry, with his hair ſtanding on end, and a look betokening horror and aſtoniſhment. Without ſpeaking a word, he ſet down the light, and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027715_0074_0FD5EBE1E1A8ED98"/>
jumped into bed behind me, where he lay and trembled with great violence. When I aſked him what was he matter? he replied with a broken accent, <q>God have mercy on us! I have ſeen the devil.</q> Though my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice was not quite ſo ſtrong as his, I was not a little alarmed at this exclamation, and much more ſo, when I heard the ſound of bells approaching our chamber, and felt my bed-fellow cling cloſe to me, uttering theſe words—"Chriſt have mercy upon us! there he comes." At that inſtant a monſtrous overgrown raven entered our chamber, with bells at his feet, and made directly towards our bed. As this creature is reckoned in our country a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in, I verily believed we were haunted, and in a violent fright ſhrunk under the bed-clothes. This terrible apparition leapt upon the bed, and, after giving us ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſevere dabs with its beak through the blankets, hopped away and vaniſhed. Strap and I recommended ourſelves to the protection of Heaven with great devotion, and when we no longer heard the noiſe, ventured to peep up and take breath. But we had not been long freed from this phantom, when another appeared that had well nigh deprived us both of our ſenſes. We perceived an old man enter the room, with a long white beard that reached to his middle; there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes and countenance, that did not favour of this world; and his dreſs conſiſted of a brown ſtuff coat, buttoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind and at the wriſts, with an old-faſhioned cap of the ſame ſtuff upon his head. I was ſo amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from ſuch a ghaſtly object, but lay motionleſs, and ſaw him come ſtraight up to me. When he reached the bed, he wrung his hands, and cried with a voice, that did not ſeem to belong to a human creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Where is Ralph?" I made no reply; upon which he repeated in an accent ſtill more preternatural, "Where is Ralpho?" He had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, than I heard the ſound of the bells at a diſtance, which the apparition having liſtened to, tript away, and left me almoſt petrified with fear. It was a good while before I could recover myſelf ſo far as to ſpeak; and, when at length I turned to Strap, I ſound him in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not laſt long. When he came to himſelf, I aſked
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027715_0075_0FD5EBE3A22038A8"/>
his opinion of what had happened, and he aſſured me that the firſt muſt certainly be the ſoul of ſome perſon damned, which appeared by the chains about its legs; (for his fears had magnified the creature to the bigneſs of a horſe, and the ſound of ſmall morice-bells to the clanking of maſſy chains.) As for the old man, he took it to be the ſpirit of ſomebody murdered long ago in this place, which had power granted it to torment the aſſaſſin in the ſhape of a raven, and that Ralpho was the name of the ſaid murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Although I had not great faith in this interpretation, I was too much troubled to enjoy any ſleep, and in all my future adventures never paſſed a night ſo ill. In the morning Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey, who after an immoderate fit of laughter, explained the matter, by telling him the old man was the landlord's father, who had been an idiot ſome years, and diverted himſelf with a tame raven, which, it ſeems, had hopped away from his apartment in the night, and induced him to follow it to our chamber, where he had inquired after it under the name of Ralpho.</p>
                     <p>Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which continued ſix or ſeven days longer: at length we entered the great city, and lodged all night in the inn where the waggon put up. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the paſſengers parted different ways, while my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and I ſallied out to inquire for the member of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to whom I had a letter of recommendation from Mr. Crab. As we had diſcharged our lodgings at the inn, Strap took up our baggage, and marched behind me on the ſtreet with the knapſack on his back as uſual, ſo that we made a very whimſical appearance. I had dreſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the greateſt advantage; that is, put on a clean ruffled ſhirt and my beſt thread ſtockings; my hair (which was of the deepeſt red) hung down upon my ſhoulders as lank and ſtraight as a pound of candles, and the ſkirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg; my waiſtcoat and breeches were of the ſame piece, and cut in the ſame taſte; and my hat very much reſembled a barber's baſon in the ſhallowneſs of the crown, and narrowneſs of the brim. Strap was habited in a much leſs awkward man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but a ſhort crop-eared wig that very much reſembled Scrub's in the play, and the knapſack on his back, added
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027715_0076_0FD5EBE4DCB28EC0"/>
to what is called a queer phiz, occaſioned by a long chin, and hook noſe, and high cheek bones, rendered him on the whole a very fit ſubject of mirth and pleaſantry. As we walked along, Strap, at my deſire, enquired of a car-man whom we met, whereabouts Mr. Cringer lived—and was anſwered by a ſtare accompanied with the word, "Anan!" Upon which I came up, in order to explain the queſtion, but had the misfortune to be unintelligible likewiſe, the car-man damning us for a louſy Scotch guard, and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up his horſes with a "Gee ho!" which nettled me to the quick, and rouſed the indignation of Strap ſo far, that, after the fellow was gone a good way, he told me he would fight him for a farthing. While we were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berating upon what was to be done, an hackney-coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, driving ſoftly along, and perceiving us ſtanding by the kennel, came up cloſe to us, and calling, "A coach, maſter!" by a dexterous management of the reins made his horſes ſtumble in the wet, and bedaub us all over with mud. After which exploit he drove on, applauding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a hearty laugh, in which ſeveral people joined, to my great mortification; but one more compaſſionate than the reſt, ſeeing us ſtrangers, adviſed me to go into an ale-houſe, and dry myſelf. I thanked him for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which I immediately complied with; and, going into the houſe he pointed out, called for a pot of beer, and ſat down by a fire in the public room, where we cleaned our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as we could. In the mean time a wag, who ſat in a box ſmoking his pipe, underſtanding by our dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that we were from Scotland, came up to me, and, with a grave countenance, aſked how long I had been caught? As I did not know the meaning of his queſtion, I made no anſwer, and he went on, ſaying, it could not be a great while, for my tail was not yet cut, at the ſame time taking hold of my hair, and tipping the wink to the reſt of the company, which ſeemed highly entertained at his wit. I was greatly incenſed at this uſage, but afraid of reſenting it, becauſe I happened to be in a ſtrange place, and perceived the perſon who ſpoke to me was a brawny fellow, for whom I thought myſelf by no means a match. However, Strap, having either more courage or leſs caution, could not put up with the inſults that I ſuffered, but told him in a peremptory tone, <q>He was an
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:027715_0077_0FD5EBE62C3BC6B8"/>
uncivil fellow for making ſo free with his betters.</q> Then the wit, going towards him, aſked what he had got in his knapſack: "Is it out meal or brimſtone, Sawney?" ſaid he, ſeizing him by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Seeing Strap beginning to ſtrip, and my blood being heated with indignation, which baniſhed all other thoughts, I undreſſed myſelf to the ſkin in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and declared, that, as the affront which occaſioned the quarrel was offered to me, I would fight it out myſelf: upon which one or two cried out, <q>That's a brave Scotch boy; you ſhall have fair play by G—d.</q> This aſſurance gave me freſh ſpirits, and going up to my adverſary, who by his pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Then I attempted to keep him down, in order to improve my ſucceſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of my own country, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the ſpectators, one of whom endeavoured to raiſe up my opponent, but in vain; for he proteſted he would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I was very well pleaſed with this excuſe, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dreſſed myſelf, having acquired the good opinion of the company for my bravery, as well as of my comrade Strap, who ſhook me by the hand, and wiſhed me joy of the victory. After having drank our pot, and dried our clothes, we inquired of the landlord if he knew Mr. Crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the member of parliament, and were amazed at his replying in the negative; for we imagined he muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as conſpicuous here as in the borough he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; but he told us we might poſſibly hear of him as we paſſed along. We betook ourſelves therefore to the ſtreet, where, ſeeing a footman ſtanding at a door, we made up to him, and aſked if he knew where out patron lived? This member of the party-coloured fraternity, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying us both very minutely, ſaid he knew Mr. Cringer very well, and bade us turn down the firſt ſtreet on our left, then turn to the right, and then to the left again,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027715_0078_0FD5EBEDACC44BF0"/>
after which perambulation we would obſerve a lane, through which we muſt paſs, and at the other end we ſhould find an alley that led to another ſtreet, where we ſhould ſee the ſign of the Thiſtle and three Pedlars, and there he lodged. We thanked him for his information, and went forwards, Strap telling me, that he knew this perſon to be an honeſt friendly man by his countenance, before he opened his mouth; in which opinion I acdquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, aſcribing his good manners to the company he daily ſaw in the houſe where he ſerved. We followed his direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions punctually, in turning to the left and to the right, and to the left again; but, inſtead of ſeeing a lane before us, found ourſelves at the ſide of the river, a circumſtance that perplexed us not a little; and my fellow-traveller ventured to pronounce, that we had certainly miſſed our way. By this time we were pretty much fatigued with our walk, and not knowing how to proceed, I went into a ſmall ſnuff-ſhop hard by, encouraged by the ſign of the highlander, where I found, to my inexpreſſible ſatisfaction the ſhopkeeper was my countryman. He was no ſooner informed of our peregrination, and the directions we had received from the footman, than he informed us we had been impoſed upon, telling us, Mr. Cringer lived at the other end of the town, and that it would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for us to go thither to-day, for by that time he was gone to the Houſe. I then aſked if he could recommend us to a lodging. He readily gave us a line to one of his acquaintance who kept a chandler's ſhop not far from St. Martin's Lane; there we hired a bed-room up two pair of ſtairs, at the rate of 2 <hi>s. per</hi> week, ſo very ſmall, that, when the bed was let down, we were obliged to carry out every other piece of furniture that belonged to the apartment, and uſe the bed-ſtead inſtead of chairs. About dinner-time our landlord aſked us how we propoſed to live? To which interrogation we anſwered, that we would be directed by him. "Well then," ſays he, <q>there are two ways of eating in this town for people of your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the one more creditable and expenſive than the other; the firſt is to dine at a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eating-houſe frequented by well-dreſſed people only, and the other is called diving, practiſed by thoſe who are either obliged or inclined to live frugally.</q> I gave him to underſtand,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027715_0079_0FD5EBEDB1C8CBF8"/>
that, provided the laſt was not infamous, it would ſuit much better with our circumſtances than the other. "In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous!" cried he; <q>God forbid; there are many creditable people, rich people, ay, and fine people, that dive every day. I have ſeen many a pretty gentleman, with a laced waiſtcoat, dine in that manner very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably for threepence halfpenny, and go afterwards to the coffee-houſe, where he made a figure with the beſt lord in the land—but your own eyes ſhall bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—I will go along with you to-day, and introduce you.</q> He accordingly conducted us to a certain lane, where, ſtopping, he bade us obſerve him, and do as he did; and, walking a few paces, dived into a cellar, and diſappeared in an inſtant. I followed his example, and, deſcending very ſucceſsfully, found myſelf in the middle of a cook's ſhop, almoſt ſuffocated with the ſteams of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beef, and ſurrounded by a company of hackney-coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, chairmen, draymen, and a few footmen out of place or on board-wages, who ſat eating ſhin of beef, tripe, cow-heel, or ſauſages, at ſeparate boards covered with cloths, which turned my ſtomach. While I ſtood in amaze, undetermined whether to ſit down or walk upwards again, Strap in his deſcent, miſſing one of the ſteps, tumbled headlong into this infernal ordinary, and overturned the cook as ſhe carried a porringer of ſoup to one of the gueſts: in her fall ſhe daſhed the whole meſs againſt the legs of a drummer belonging to the foot-guards was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in her way, and ſcalded him ſo miſerably, that he ſtarted up, and danced up and down, uttering a volley of execrations that made my hair ſtand on end. While he entertained the company in this manner with an eloquence peculiar to himſelf, the cook got up, and after a hearty curſe on the poor author o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> this miſchance, who lay under the table ſcratching his rump with a woful countenance, emptied a ſalt-ſeller in her hand, and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping down the patient's ſtocking, which brought the ſkin along with it, applied the contents to the ſore.—This poultice was ſcarce laid on, when the drummer, who began to abate of his exclamation, broke forth into ſuch a hideous yell, as made the whole company tremble; then ſeizing a pewter pint-pot that ſtood by him, ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſides of it together, as if it had been made of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027715_0080_0FD5EBEF58256D50"/>
pliant leather, grinding his teeth at the ſame time with a moſt horrible grin. Gueſſing the cauſe of this violent tranſport, I bade the woman waſh off the ſalt, and bathe the part with oil, which ſhe did, and procured him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate caſe. But here another difficulty occurred, which was no other than the landlady's inſiſting on his paying for the pot he had rendered uſeleſs. He ſwore he would pay for nothing but what he had eaten, and bade her be thankful for his moderation, or elſe he would proſecute her for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. Strap, foreſeeing the whole affair would ly at his door, promiſed to ſatisfy the cook, and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer, which entirely appeaſed him, and compoſed all animoſities. After this accommodation our landlord and we ſat down at a board, and dined upon ſhin of beef moſt deliciouſly, our reckoning amounting to twopence halfpenny each, bread and ſmall beet included.</p>

                        </gap> as to find him at home. This gentleman, who had come from Scotland three or four years before, kept a ſchool in town, where he taught the Latin, French, and Italian languages; but what he chiefly profeſſed, was the pronunciation of the Engliſh tongue, after a method more ſpeedy and uncommon than any practiſed heretofore; and, indeed, if his ſcholars ſpoke like their maſter, the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle; for, although I could eaſily underſtand every word of what I heard hitherto ſince I entered England, three parts in four of his dialect were as unintelligible to me as if he had ſpoke in Arabic or Iriſh. He was a middle-ſized man, and ſtooped very much, though not above the age of forty; his face was frightfully pitted with the ſmall-pox, and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027715_0081_0FD5EBF0B0A18620"/>
his mouth extended from ear to ear. He was dreſſed in a night gown of plaid, faſtened about his middle with a ſerjeant's old ſaſh, and a tie-periwig with a fore-top three inches high, in the faſhion of King Charles the Second's reign. After he had received Strap (who was related to him) very courteouſly, he inquired of him, who I was; and, being informed, took me by the hand, telling me he was at ſchool with my father. When he underſtood my ſituation, he aſſured me that he would do me all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his power, both by his advice and otherwiſe; and, while he ſpoke theſe words, eyed me with great attention, walking round me ſeveral times, and muttering,—<q>O Ch—ſt! O Ch—ſt! fat a ſaight is here?</q> I ſoon gueſſed the reaſon of this ejaculation, and ſaid, <q>I ſuppoſe, Sir, you are not pleaſed with my dreſs.</q> "Dreſs," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, <q>you may caal it fat you pleaſe in your country, but I vaw to Gad, 'tis a maſquerade here. No Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will admit ſuch a figure into his hawſe. Upon my conſcience! I wonder the dogs did not hunt you. Did you paſs through St. James's market?—God bleſs my eye-ſaight! you look like a couſin-german of Ouran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outang.</q> I began to be a little ſerious at this diſcourſe, and aſked him if he thought I ſhould obtain entrance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow at the houſe of Mr. Cringer, on whom I chiefly depended for an introduction into buſineſs? "Mr. Crin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Mr. Cringer," replied he, ſcratching his cheek, <q>may be a very honeſt gentleman—I know nothing to the contrary; but is your ſole dependence upon him? Who recommended you to him?</q> I pulled out Mr. Crab's letter, and told him the foundation of my hopes; at which he ſtared at me, and repeated, "O Ch—ſt!"—I began to conceive bad omens from this behaviour of his, and begged he would aſſiſt me with his advice, which he promiſed to give very frankly; and, as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, directed us to a periwig ware-houſe in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, in order to be accommodated; laying ſtrong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr. Cringer, till I had parted with theſe carroty locks, which, he ſaid, were ſufficient to beget an antipathy againſt me in all mankind: and, as we were going to purſue this advice, he called me back, and bade me be ſure to deliver my letter into Mr. Cringer's own hand. As we walked along,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027715_0082_0FD5EBF24723B688"/>
Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his friend, who (it ſeems) had aſſured him he would in a day or two provide for him ſome good maſter; "and now," ſays he, <q>you ſhall ſee how I will fit you with a wig. There's ne'er a barber in London (and that's a bold word) can palm a rotten cawl, or a penny-weight of dead hair upon me.</q> And indeed this zealous adherent did wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſo long with the merchant, that he was deſired twenty times to leave the ſhop, and ſee if he could get one cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er elſewhere. At length I made choice of a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome bob, for which I paid ten ſhillings, and returned to our lodging, where Strap in a moment rid me of that hair which had given the ſchool-maſter ſo much offence.</p>
                     <p>We got up next day betimes, having been informed that Mr. Cringer gave audience by candle-light to all his dependents, he himſelf being obliged to attend the levé<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of my Lord Terrier at break of day, becauſe his lordſhip made one at the miniſter's between eight and nine o'clock. When we came to Mr. Cringer's door, Strap, to give me an inſtance of his politeneſs, ran to the knocker, which he employed ſo loud and ſo long, that he alarmed the whole ſtreet; and, a window opening in the ſecond ſtory of the next houſe, a chamber-pot was diſcharged upon him ſo ſucceſsfully, that the poor barber was wet to the ſkin, while I, being luckily at ſome diſtance, eſcaped the unſavoury deluge. In the mean time a footman, opening the door, and ſeeing nobody in the ſtreet but us, aſked with a ſtern countenance, if it was I who made ſuch a damned noiſe, and what I wanted? I told him I had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with his maſter, whom I deſired to ſee. Upon which he clapped the door in my face, telling me, I muſt learn better manners before I could have acceſs to his maſter. Vexed at this diſappointment, I turned my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt Strap, whom I ſharply reprimanded for his preſumption: but he, not in the leaſt regarding what I ſaid, wrung the urine out of his periwig, and, lifting up a large ſtone, flung it with ſuch force againſt the ſtreet-door of that houſe from whence he had been bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, the lock giving way, it flew wide open, and he took to his heels, leaving me to follow him as I could. Indeed there was no time for deliberation; I therefore purſued him with all the ſpeed I could exert, until we
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027715_0083_0FD5EBF62F6168E8"/>
found ourſelves, about the dawn, in a ſtreet we did not know. Here as we wandered along, gaping about, a very decent ſort of a man, paſſing by me, ſtopped of a ſudden, and took up ſomething, which having examined, he turned and preſented it to me with theſe words: <q>Sir, you have dropt half a crown.</q> I was not a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this inſtance of honeſty, and told him it did not belong to me; but he bade me recollect, and ſee if all my money was ſafe: upon which I pulled out my purſe, (for I had bought one ſince I came to town,) and reckoning my money in my hand, which was now reduced to five guineas, ſeven ſhillings, and twopence, aſſured him I had loſt nothing. "Well then," ſays he, <q>ſo much the better—This is Godſend—and as you two were preſent when I picked it up, you are entitled to equal ſhares with me.</q> I was aſtoniſhed at theſe words, and looked upon this perſon to be a prodigy of integrity, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to take any part of the ſum. <q>Come, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</q> ſaid he, <q>you are too modeſt—I ſee you are ſtrangers—but you ſhall give me leave to treat you with a wet this cold raw morning.</q> I would have declined this invitation, but Strap whiſpered to me, that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would be affronted; and I complied. <q>Where ſhall we go?</q> ſaid the ſtranger; <q>I am quite ignorant of this part of the town.</q> I informed him that we were in the ſame ſituation; upon which he propoſed to go into the firſt public-houſe we ſhould find open; and, as we walked together, he began in this manner: <q>I find by your tongues you are from Scotland, gentlemen. My grandmother by the father's ſide was of your country, and I am ſo prepoſſeſſed in its favour, that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms. The Scots are a very brave people. There is ſcarce a great family in the kingdom that cannot boaſt of ſome exploits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by its anceſtors many hundred years ago. There's your Douglaſſes, Gordons, Campbells, Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. We have no ſuch ancient families here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Then you are all very well educated. I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew as well as if they had been his mother tongue—And for honeſty—I once had a ſervant, his name was Gregor M'Gregor. I would have truſted him with untold gold.</q> This
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027715_0084_0FD5EBF8E8353E50"/>
eulogium on my native country gained my affection ſo ſtrongly, that I believe I could have gone to death to ſerve the author, and Strap's eyes ſwam in tears. At length, as we paſſed through a dark narrow lane, we perceived a public-houſe, which we entered, and found a man ſitting by the fire, ſmoking a pipe, with a pint of purl before him. Our new acquaintance aſked us if ever we had drank egg-flip? to which queſtion we anſwering in the negative, he aſſured us of a regale, and ordered a quart to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, calling for pipes and tobacco at the ſame time. We found this compoſition very palatable, and drank heartily, the converſation (which was introduced by the gentleman) turning upon the ſnares that young unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced people are expoſed to in this metropolis. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a thouſand cheats that are daily practiſed upon the ignorant and unwary, and warned us of them with ſo much good-nature and concern, that we bleſſed the opportunity which threw us in his way. After we had put the cann about for ſome time, our new friend began to yawn, telling us he had been up all night with a ſick perſon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed we ſhould have recourſe to ſome diverſion to keep him awake. "Suppoſe," ſaid he, <q>we ſhould take a hand at whiſt for paſtime. But let me ſee, that won't do, there's only three of us, and I cannot play at any other game. The truth is, I ſeldom or never play but out of complaiſance, or at ſuch a time as this, when I am in danger of falling aſleep.</q> Although I was not much inclined to gaming, I felt no averſion to paſs an hour or two at cards with a friend, and, knowing that Strap underſtood as much of the matter as I, made no ſcruple of ſaying, "I wiſh we could find a fourth hand." While we were in this perplexity, the perſon whom we ſound in the houſe at our entrance, over-hearing our diſcourſe, took the pipe from his mouth very gravely, and accoſted us thus: "Gentlemen, my pipe is out you ſee," ſhaking the aſhes into the fire, <q>and rather than you ſhould be baulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I don't care if I take a hand with you for a trifle—but remember I won't play for any thing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</q> We accepted his offer with pleaſure; and, having cut for partners, it fell to my lot to play with him, againſt our friend and Strap, for threepence a game. We were ſo ſucceſsful, that in a ſhort time I was half a crown
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:027715_0085_0FD5EBFB0E38F5F0"/>
gainer, when the gentleman whom we had met in the ſtreet, obſerving he had no luck to-day, propoſed to leave off, or change partners. By this time I was inflamed with my good fortune, and the expectation of improving it, as I perceived the two ſtrangers played but indifferently: therefore I voted for giving him his revenge; and, cutting again, Strap and I (to our mutual ſatisfaction) happened to be partners. My good fortune attended me ſtill, and in leſs than an hour we had got thirty ſhillings of their money; for, as they loſt, they grew the keener, and doubled ſtakes every time. At laſt the inconſtant goddeſs began to veer about, and we were very ſoon ſtript of all our gains, and about forty ſhillings of our own money. This loſs mortified me extremely, and had a viſible effect on the muſcles of Strap's face, which lengthened apace; but our antagoniſts, perceiving our condition, kindly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us to retrieve our loſs, and conſole ourſelves with a new acquiſition. Then my companion wiſely ſuggeſted it was time to be gone; upon which the perſon who had joined us in the houſe, began to curſe the cards, and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got, no part of our ſucceſs being owing to our good play. This inſinuation nettled me ſo much, that I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged him to a game of piquet for a crown; and he was with difficulty perſuaded to accept the invitation. This conteſt ended in leſs than an hour, to my inexpreſſible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, who loſt every ſhilling of my own money, Strap abſolutely refuſing to ſupply me with a ſixpence. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, at whoſe requeſt we had come in, perceiving by my diſconſolate looks the ſituation of my heart, which well nigh burſted with grief and reſentment, when the other ſtranger got up, and went away with my money, began in this manner: <q>I am truly afflicted at your bad luck, and would willingly repair it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was it in my power. But what, in the name of goodneſs, could provoke you to tempt your fate ſo long? It is always a maxim with gameſters to purſue ſucceſs as far as it will go, and to ſtop whenever fortune ſhifts about. You are a young man, and your paſſions too impetuous; you muſt learn to govern them better: however, there is no experience like that which is bought; you will be the better for this the longeſt day you have to live. As for the fellow

                     <p>IN our way to our lodging, after a profound ſilence on both ſides, Strap, with a hideous groan, obſerved, that we had brought our pigs to a fine market. To this obſervation I made no reply, and he went on: <q>God ſend us well out of this place, we have not been in London eight and forty hours, and I believe we have met with eight and forty thouſand misfortunes. We have been jeered, reproached, buffetted, piſſed upon, and at laſt ſtript of our money; and I ſuppoſe by and by we ſhall be ſtript of our ſkins. Indeed, as to the money part of it, that was owing to our own folly; Solomon ſays, <hi>Bray a fool in a mortar, and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be wiſe.</hi> Ah!

and inflamed with reſentment againſt him, for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed me a little money to attempt to retrieve it. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turned towards him with a ſtern countenance, and aſked, "Whom he called a fool?" Being altogether unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſuch looks from me, he ſtood ſtill and ſtared in my face for ſome time; then, with ſome confuſion, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, <q>Fool!

There's all I have in the world, take it, and I'll perhaps get more for you before that be done, if not, I'll beg for you, ſteal for you, go through the wide world with you, and ſtarve with you; for though I be a poor cobler's ſon, I am no ſcout.</q> I was ſo touched with the generous paſſion of this poor creature, that I could not refrain from weeping alſo, and we ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our tears together for ſome time. Upon examining the purſe, I found in it two half guineas and half-a-crown, which I would have returned to him, ſaying, he knew better than I how to manage it; but he abſolutely refuſed my propoſal, and told me, it was more reaſonable and decent that he ſhould depend upon me, who was a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than that I ſhould be controuled by him.</p>
                     <p>After this friendly conteſt was over, and our minds more at eaſe, we informed our landlord of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us, taking care to conceal the extremity to which we were reduced. He no ſooner heard the ſtory, than he aſſured us we had been grievouſly impoſed upon by a couple of ſharpers, who were aſſociates; and that this polite, honeſt, friendly, humane perſon, who had treated us ſo civilly, was no other than a raſcally money-dropper, who made it his buſineſs to decoy ſtrangers in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to one of his own haunts, where an accomplice or

two were always waiting to aſſiſt in pillaging the prey he had run down. Here the good man recounted a great many ſtories of people who had been ſeduced, cheated, pilfered, beat,—nay, even murdered by ſuch villains. I was confounded at the artifice and wickedneſs of mankind, and Strap lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed that God would deliver him from ſuch ſcenes of iniquity; for ſurely the devil had ſet up his throne in London.—Our landlord being curious to know what reception we had met with at Mr. Cringer's, we acquainted him with the particulars, at which he ſhook his head, and told us, we had not gone the right way to work; that there was nothing to be done with a m—b—r of p—m—t with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bribe; that the ſervant was commonly infected with the maſter's diſeaſe, and expected to be paid for his work, as well as his betters.—He therefore adviſed me to give the footman a ſhilling the next time I ſhould deſire admittance to my patron, or elſe I ſhould ſcarce find an opportunity to deliver my letter. Accordingly, next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the door was opened, I ſlipt a ſhilling into his hand, and told him I had a letter for his maſter.—I found the good effects of my liberality; for the fellow let me in immediately, and taking the letter out of my hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to wait, in a kind of paſſage, for an anſwer. In this place I continued ſtanding three quarters of an hour, during which time I ſaw a great many young fellows, whom I formerly knew in Scotland, paſs and repaſs, with an air of familiarity, in their way to and from the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence chamber; while I was fain to ſtand ſhivering in the cold, and turn my back to them, that they might not perceive the lowneſs of my condition.—At length, Mr. Cringer came out to ſee a young gentleman to the door, who was no other than Squire Gawky, dreſſed in a very gay ſuit of clothes: at parting Mr. Cringer ſhook him by the hand, and told him he hoped to have the pleaſure of his company at dinner. Then turning about towards me, he aſked what were my commands: when he underſtood I was the perſon who had brought the letter from Mr. Crab, he affected to recollect my name, which, however, he pretended he could not do, till he had conſulted the letter again; to ſave him that trouble, I told him my name was Random.—Upon which he went on, <q>Ay, ay

                     <p>At my return, I was ſurpriſed with the agreeable news of Strap's being employed on the recommendation of his friend the ſchool-maſter, by a periwig-maker in the neighbourhood, who allowed him five ſhillings <hi>per</hi> week, beſides bed and board.—I continued to dance attendance every other morning at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027715_0090_0FD5EC04DE18D968"/>
overheard the word <hi>honour</hi> repeated ſeveral times with great emphaſis, Mr. Cringer introduced me to this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as to a perſon whoſe advice and aſſiſtance I might depend upon, and having given me his direction, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to the door, where he told me, I need not give myſelf the trouble to call at his houſe any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Mr. Staytape would do my buſineſs. At that inſtant my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low dependant coming out after me overheard the diſcourſe of Mr. Cringer, and making up to me in the ſtreet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted me very civilly. This addreſs I looked upon as no ſmall honour, conſidering the figure he made; for he was dreſſed in a blue frock with a gold button, a green ſilk waiſtcoat trimmed with gold, black velvet breeches, white ſilk ſtockings, ſilver buckles, a gold laced hat, a ſpencer wig, and a ſilver-hilted hanger, with a fine clouded cane in his hand.—"I perceive," ſays he, <q>you are but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from Scotland?—pray what may your buſineſs with Mr. Cringer be?—I ſuppoſe it is no ſecret—and I may poſſibly give you ſome advice that will be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable; for I have been ſurgeon's ſecond mate, on board of a ſeventy gun ſhip, and conſequently know a good deal of the world.</q>—I made no ſcruple to diſcloſe my ſituation, which, when he had learned, he ſhook his head, and told me he had been pretty much in the ſame circumſtance about a year ago; that he had relied on Cringer's promiſes, until his money (which was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) as well as his credit, was quite exhauſted; and when he wrote to his relations for a freſh ſupply, inſtead of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he received nothing but reproaches, and the epithets of idle, debauched fellow: that after he had waited at the navy-office many months for a warrant to no purpoſe, he was fain to pawn ſome of his clothes, which raiſed a ſmall ſum, wherewith he bribed the ſ—t—y, who ſoon procured a warrant for him, notwithſtanding he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the ſame day, that there was not one vacancy.—That he had gone on board, where he remained nine months; at the end of which the ſhip was put out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and, he ſaid, the company were to be paid off in Broad-ſtreet the very next day.—That his relations being reconciled to him, had charged him to pay his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs regularly to Mr. Cringer, who had informed them by letter, that his intereſt alone had procured the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027715_0091_0FD5EC0662F86480"/>
in obedience to which command, he came to his levée every morning, as I ſaw, though he looked upon him to be a very pitiful ſcoundrel. In concluſion, he aſked me, if I had yet paſſed at ſurgeon's hall? To which queſtion, I anſwered, I did not ſo much as know it was neceſſary—"Neceſſary," cried he, <q>O Lord! O Lord! I find I muſt inſtruct you—come along with me, and I'll give you ſome information about that matter.</q>—So ſaying, he carried me into an ale houſe, where he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for ſome beer, and bread and cheeſe, on which we breakfaſted. While we ſat in this place, he told me I muſt firſt go to the navy-office, and write to the board, deſiring them to order a letter for me to the ſurgeon's-hall, that I might be examined touching my ſkill in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: That the ſurgeons, after having examined me, would give me my qualification ſealed up in form of a letter, directed to the commiſſioners; which qualification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt deliver to the ſecretary of the board, who would open it in my preſence, and read the contents. After which, I muſt employ my intereſt to be provided for as ſoon as poſſible.—That the expence of his qualification for ſecond mate of a third rate, amounted to thirteen ſhillings, excluſive of the warrant, which coſt him half a guinea and half a crown, beſides the preſent to the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, which conſiſted of a three pound twelve piece.—This calculation was like a thunder-bolt to me, whoſe whole fortune did not amount to twelve ſhillings.—I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made him acquainted with this part of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, after having thanked him for his information and advice.—He condoled me on this occaſion, but bade me be of good cheer, for he had conceived a friendſhip for me, and would make all things eaſy.—He was run out at preſent, but to-morrow or next day he was certain of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a conſiderable ſum; of which he would lend me what would be ſufficient to anſwer my exigencies. This frank declaration pleaſed me ſo much, that I pulled out my purſe and emptied it, before him, begging him to take what he pleaſed for pocket expence until he ſhould receive his own money.—With a good deal of preſſing he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to take five ſhillings, telling me that he might have what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

would defer his going thither till to-morrow, when I ſhould go along with him, and he would put me in a way of acting for myſelf, without a ſervile dependence on that raſcal Cringer, much leſs on the louſy taylor to whom he heard him turn me over.—"How," cried I, <q>is Mr. Staytape a taylor?</q>—"No leſs, I'll aſſure you," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, <q>and, I confeſs, more likely to ſerve you than the member: for provided you can entertain him with politics and conundrums, you may have credit with him for as many and as rich clothes as you pleaſe.</q>—I told him I was utterly ignorant of both, and ſo incens'd at Cringer's uſage, that I would never ſet a foot within his door again.—After a good deal more converſation, my new acquaintance and I parted, having made an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to meet next day at the ſame place, in order to ſet out for the city.—I went immediately to Strap, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated every thing which had happened, but he did not at all approve of my being ſo forward to lend money to a ſtranger, eſpecially as we had been already ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by appearances.

<pb n="86" facs="unknown:027715_0093_0FD5EC0D55D8F4E0"/>
myſelf.—I conſulted the phyſiognomy of each, and at laſt made up to one whoſe countenance I liked; and aſked, if he could inſtruct me in the form of the letter which was to be ſent to the board, to obtain an order for examination: he anſwered me in broad Scotch, that he would ſhew me the copy of what he had written for himſelf, by the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another who knew the form: and accordingly pulled it out of his pocket for my peruſal; and told me, that if I was expeditious, I might ſend it in to the board before dinner, for they did no buſineſs in the afternoon. He then went with me to a coffee-houſe hard by, where I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wrote the letter, which was immediately delivered to the meſſenger; who told me, I might expect an order to-morrow about the ſame time.—Having tranſacted this piece of buſineſs, my mind was a good deal compoſed: and as I had met with ſo much civility from this ſtranger, I deſired further acquaintance with him, fully reſolved, however, not to be deceived by him ſo much to my preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice advice as I had been by the beau—He agreed to dine with me at a cook's ſhop which I frequented; and on our way thither, carried me to 'Change, where I was in ſome hopes of finding Mr. Jackſon, (for that was the name of the perſon who had broke his appointment.) I ſought there for him to no purpoſe, and on our way towards the other end of the town, imparted to my companion his behaviour towards me: upon which, he gave me to underſtand, that he was no ſtranger to the name of beau Jackſon, (ſo he was called at the navy-office,) although he did not know him perſonally; that he had the character of a good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured careleſs fellow, who made no ſcruple of borrowing from any body that would lend; that moſt people who knew him believed he had a good principle at bottom, but his extravagance was ſuch, he would probably never have it in his power to manifeſt the honeſty of his intention. This account made me ſweat for my five ſhillings, which I nevertheleſs did not altogether deſpair of recovering, provided I could find out the debtor. This young man likewiſe added another circumſtance of Squire Jackſon's hiſtory, which was, that, being deſtitute of all means to equip himſelf for ſea when he received his laſt warrant, he had been recommended to a perſon, who lent him a little money, after he had ſigned a will and power, entitling
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027715_0094_0FD5EC0E0E44F828"/>
that perſon to lift his wages when they ſhould become due, as alſo to inherit his effects in caſe of his death—that he was ſtill under the tutorage and directions of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who advanced him ſmall ſums from time to time upon this ſecurity, at the rate of 50 <hi>per cent.</hi> But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his credit was very low, becauſe his funds would do little more than pay what he had already received, this moderate intereſt included. After the ſtranger (whoſe name was Thomſon) had entertained me with this account of Jackſon, he informed me that he himſelf had paſſed for a third mate of a third rate about four months ago, ſince which time he had conſtantly attended at the navy-office in hope of a warrant, having been aſſured from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both by a Scotch member and one of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to whom the member recommended him, that he ſhould be put into the firſt vacancy; notwithſtanding which promiſe, he had the mortification to ſee ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven appointed in the ſame ſtation almoſt every week—that now being utterly impoveriſhed, his ſole hope conſiſted in the promiſe of a friend lately come to town, to lend him a ſmall matter, for a preſent to the ſ—t—y; without which he was perſuaded he might wait a thouſand years to no purpoſe.—I conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow, which, I believe, proceeded from the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of our fortunes. We ſpent the whole day together; and as he lived at Wapping, I deſired him to take a ſhare of my bed.—Next day we returned to the navy-office, where, after being called before the board, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned about the place of my nativity and education, they ordered a letter to be made out for me, which, after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a crown to the clerk, I received, and delivered into the hands of the clerk at ſurgeons-hall, together with a ſhilling for his trouble in regiſtering my name.—By this time my whole ſtock was diminiſhed to two ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and I ſaw not the leaſt proſpect of relief, even for preſent ſubſiſtence, much leſs to enable me to pay the fees at ſurgeons-hall, for my examination, which would come on in a fortnight.—In this ſtate of perplexity, I conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Strap, who aſſured me, he would pawn every thing he had in the world, even to his razors, before I ſhould want: but this expedient I abſolutely rejected, telling him, I would a thouſand times rather liſt for a ſoldier, of

which I had ſome thoughts, than be any longer a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him.—At the word ſoldier, he grew pale as death, and begged on his knees, I would think no more of that ſcheme. "God preſerve us all in our right wits!" cried he, <q>would you turn ſoldier, and perhaps be ſent abroad againſt the Spaniards, where you muſt ſtand and be ſhot at like a woodcock?—Heaven keep cold lead out of my carcaſe! and let me die in a bed like a Chriſtian, as all my forefathers have done? What ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies all the riches and honours of this life, if one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys not content!—And in the next there is no reſpect of perſons: better be a poor honeſt barber with a good conſcience, and time to repent of my ſins upon my death-bed, than be cut off (God bleſs us) by a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ſhot, as it were in the very flower of one's age, in the purſuit of riches and fame.—What ſignify riches, (my dear friend?) do they not make unto themſelves wings, as the wiſe man ſaith? and does not Horace ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>Non domus aut fundus, non oeris acerous aut auri aegroto domino deduxit corpore febrem, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>non animo curas?</hi>—I could moreover mention many other ſayings in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of riches, both from the Bible and other good books; but as I know you are not very fond of thoſe things, I ſhall only aſſure you, that if you take on to be a ſoldier, I will do the ſame; and then, if we ſhould both be ſlain, you will not only have your own blood to anſwer for, but mine alſo: and peradventure the lives of all thoſe whom we ſhall kill in battle.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you, conſider whether you will ſit down contented with ſmall things, and ſhare the fruits of my induſtry in peace, till providence ſhall ſend better tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; or by your deſpair, plunge both our ſouls and bodies into everlaſting perdition, which God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy forbid.</q>—I could not help ſmiling at this harangue, which he delivered with great earneſtneſs, the tears ſtanding in his eyes all the time; and promiſed to do nothing of that ſort without his conſent and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.—He was much comforted with this declaration; and told me, in a few days he ſhould receive a week's wages, which ſhould be at my ſervice, but adviſed me, in the mean time, to go in queſt of Jackſon, and recover, if poſſible, what he had borrowed of me.—I accordingly
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:027715_0096_0FD5EC10E7049238"/>
trudged about from one end of the town to the other, for ſeveral days, without being able to learn any thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning him. However, being one day extremely hungry, and allured by the ſteams that regaled my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils from a boiling cellar, I went down with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to gratify my appetite with two-penny worth of beef; when, to my no ſmall ſurpriſe, I found Mr. Jackſon ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at dinner with a footman. He no ſooner perceived me than he got up, and ſhook me by the hand, ſaying, <q>He was glad to ſee me, for he intended to call at my lodgings in the afternoon.</q>—I was ſo well pleaſed with this rencounter, and the apologies he made for not keeping his appointment, that I forgot my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſat down to dinner, with the happy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of not only recovering my own money before we ſhould part, but alſo of reaping the benefit of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to lend me wherewithal to paſs examination; and this hope my ſanguine complection ſuggeſted, though the account Thomſon gave me of him ought to have mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated my expectation.—When we had feaſted ſumptuouſly, he took his leave of the footman, and adjourned with me to an ale houſe hard by, where, after ſhaking me by the hand again, he began thus: <q>I ſuppoſe you think me a ſad dog, Mr. Random, and I do confeſs that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are againſt me.—But I dare ſay you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me when I tell you, my not coming at the time appointed, was owing to a peremptory meſſage I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from a certain lady, whom—harkee (but this is a great ſecret) I am to marry very ſoon.—You think this ſtrange perhaps, but it is not leſs true for all that—a five thouſand pounder, I'll aſſure you, beſides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.—For my own part, devil take me if I know what any woman can ſee engaging about me—but a whim, you know—and then one would not baulk one's good fortune.—You ſaw that footman who din'd with us—He is one of the honeſteſt fellows that ever wore livery—You muſt know it was by his means I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to her, for he made me firſt acquainted with her woman, who is his miſtreſs—ay, many a crown has he and his ſweetheart had of my money—but what of that! things are now brought to a bearing.—I have—(come a little this way) I have propos'd marriage, and

for half price—eight times eight is ſixty-four, that's three pounds four. Z—ds! that will do—give me your hand.</q> "Softly, ſoftly, Mr. Jackſon," ſaid I, <q>don't diſpoſe of my linen without my conſent: firſt pay me the crown you owe me, and then we ſhall talk of other matters.</q> He proteſted he had not above one ſhilling in his pocket, but that he would pay me out of the firſt of the money raiſed from the ſhirts. This piece of aſſurance incenſed me ſo much, that I ſwore I would not part with him until I had received ſatisfaction for what I had lent him, and as for the ſhirts, I would not pawn one of them to ſave him from the gallows. At this expreſſion he laughed aloud, and then complained it was damned hard, that I ſhould refuſe him a trifle that would infallibly enable him not only to make his own fortune but mine alſo. <q>You talk of pawning my ſhirts,</q> ſaid I; <q>ſuppoſe you ſhould ſell this hanger, Mr. Jackſon? I believe it would fetch a good round ſum.</q> "No, hang it," ſaid he, <q>I can't appear decently without my hanger, or agad it ſhould go.</q> However, ſeeing me inflexible with regard to my linen, he at length unbuckled his hanger, and, ſhewing me the ſign of the three blue balls, deſired me to carry it thither, and pawn it for two guineas. This office I would by no means have performed, had I ſeen any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of recovering my money otherwiſe; but not willing, out of a piece of falſe delicacy, to neglect the only oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity I ſhould perhaps ever have, I ventured into a pawn broker's ſhop, where I demanded two guineas on the pledge, in the name of Thomas Williams. <q>Two gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas!</q> ſaid the pawn-broker, looking at the hanger; <q>this piece of goods has been here ſeveral times before for thirty ſhillings; however, ſince I believe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whom it belongs will redeem it, he ſhall have what he wants;</q> and accordingly he paid me the money, which I carried to the houſe where I had left Jackſon, and, calling for change, counted out to him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and thirty ſhillings, reſerving the other five for myſelf. After looking at the money ſome time, he ſaid, <q>Damn it! it don't ſignify—this won't do my buſineſs; ſo you may as well take half a guinea, or a whole one, as the five ſhillings you have kept.</q> I thanked him kindly, but refuſed to accept of any more than was my due, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

I had no proſpect of repaying it: upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration he ſtared in my face, and told me I was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively raw, or I would not talk in that manner. "Blood!" cried he; <q>I have a very bad opinion of a young fellow who won't borrow of his friend when he is in want—'tis the ſign of a ſneaking ſpirit. Come, come, Random, give me back the five ſhillings, and take this half-gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea; and, if ever you are able to pay me, I believe you will; if not, d—n me if ever I aſk it.</q> When I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on my preſent neceſſity, I ſuffered myſelf to be perſuaded, and after making my acknowledgments to Mr. Jackſon, who offered to treat me with a play, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my lodgings with a much better opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning; and at night im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted my day's adventure to Strap, who rejoiced at my good luck, ſaying, <q>I told you, if he was a Scotchman, you was ſafe enough—and who knows but this marriage may make us all? You have heard, I ſuppoſe, as how a countryman of ours, a journeyman-baker, ran away with a great lady of this town, and now keeps his coach. Ecod! I ſay nothing; but yeſterday morning, as I was ſhaving a gentleman at his own houſe, there was a young lady in the room—a fine buxom wench, i'ſaith! And ſhe threw ſo many ſheep's eyes at a certain perſon whom I ſhall not name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that my heart went knock, knock, knock, like a fulling mill, and my hand ſh—ſh—ſhook ſo much that I ſliced a piece of ſkin off the gentleman's noſe, whereby he ſwore a deadly oath and was going to horſewhip me, when ſhe prevented him, and made my peace.—<hi>Omen haud malum!</hi> Is not a journeyman-barber as good as a journeyman-baker? The only difference is, the baker uſes flower for the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the barber uſes it for the head; and, as the head is a more noble member than the belly, ſo is a barber more noble than a baker; for what's the belly without the head? Beſides, I am told he could neither read nor write; now you know I can do both, and, moreover, ſpeak Latin. But I will ſay no more; for I deſpiſe vanity—nothing is more vain than vanity.</q> With theſe words he pulled out of his pocket a wax-candle's end, which he applied to his forehead; and upon examination I found, he had combed his own hair-over the toupee of

his wig, and was indeed in his whole dreſs become a very ſmart ſhaver. I congratulated him on his proſpect with a ſatirical ſmile, which he underſtood very well; and, ſhaking his head, obſerved I had very little faith, but the truth would come to light in ſpite of my incredulity.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WITH the aſſiſtance of this faithful adherent, who gave me almoſt all the money he earned, I preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my half-guinea entire till the day of examination, when I went with a quaking heart to ſurgeons-hall, in order to undergo that ceremony. Among a crowd of young fellows, who walked in the outward hall, I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Jackſon, to whom I immediately went up, and, inquiring into the ſtate of his amour, underſtood it was ſtill undetermined by reaſon of his friend's abſence, and the delay of the recal at Chatham, which put it out of his power to bring it to a concluſion. I then aſked what his buſineſs was in this place? he replied, he was reſolved to have two ſtrings to his bow, that, in caſe the one failed, he might uſe the other, and, with this view, he was to paſs that night for a higher qualification. At that inſtant a young fellow came out from the place of examination with a pale countenance, his lip quivering, and his looks as wild as if he had ſeen a ghoſt. He no ſooner appeared, than we all flocked about him with the utmoſt eagerneſs to know what reception he had met with, which (after ſome pauſe) he deſcribed, recounting all the queſtions they had aſked, with the anſwers he made. In this manner we obliged no leſs than twelve to recapitulate, which, now the danger was paſt, they did with pleaſure, before it fell to my lot. At length the beadle called my name with a voice that made me tremble as much as if it had been the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:027715_0102_0FD5CDE9EBFD98C0"/>
ſound of the laſt trumpet: however, there was no remedy; I was conducted into a large hall, where I ſaw about a dozen of grim faces ſitting at a long table, one of whom bade me come forward in ſuch an imperious tone, that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my ſenſes. The firſt queſtion he put to me was, "Where was you born?" To which I anſwered, "In Scotland." "In Scotland," ſaid he; <q>I know that very well—we have ſcarce any other countrymen to examine here—you Scotchmen have overſpread us of late as the locuſts did Egypt. I aſk you in what part of Scotland you was born?</q> I named the place of my nativity, which he had never before heard of: he then proceeded to interrogate me about my age, the town where I ſerved my time, with the term of my apprenticeſhip; and, when I informed him that I ſerved three years only, he fell into a violent paſſion; ſwore it was a ſhame and a ſcandal to ſend ſuch raw boys into the world as ſurgeons; that it was great preſumption in me, and an affront upon the Engliſh, to pretend to ſufficient ſkill in my buſineſs, having ſerved ſo ſhort a time, when every apprentice in England was bound ſeven years at leaſt; that my friends would have done better if they had made me a weaver or a ſhoemaker, but their pride would have me a gentleman (he ſuppoſed) at any rate, and their poverty could not afford the neceſſary education. This exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my ſpirits, but, on the contrary, reduced me to ſuch a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I was ſcarce able to ſtand; which being percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a plump gentleman, who ſat oppoſite to me with a ſkull before him, he ſaid, Mr. Snarler was too ſevere upon the young man; and, turning towards me, told me I need not be afraid, for nobody would do me any harm; then, bidding me take time to recollect myſelf, he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me touching the operation of the trepan, and was very well ſatisfied with my anſwers. The next perſon who queſtioned me was a wag, who began by aſking if I had ever ſeen an amputation performed? and, I replying in the affirmative, he ſhook his head, and ſaid, <q>What! upon a dead ſubject, I ſuppoſe? If,</q> continued he, <q>during an engagement at ſea, a man ſhould be brought to you with his head ſhot off, how would you behave?</q> After ſome heſitation I owned, ſuch a caſe had never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

"What," ſaid he, <q>before you had tied up his arm?</q> But, this ſtroke of wit not anſwering his expectation, he deſired me to advance to the gentleman who ſat next him, and who, with a pert air, aſked what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the inteſtines? I repeated the method of cure as it is preſcribed by the beſt chirurgical writers; which he heard to an end, and then ſaid with a ſupercilious ſmile, <q>So you think with ſuch treatment the patient might recover?</q> I told him I ſaw nothing to make me think otherwiſe. <q>That may be,</q> reſumed he; <q>I won't anſwer for your foreſight; but did you ever know a caſe of this kind ſucceed?</q> I acknowledged I did not, and was about to tell him I had never ſeen a wounded inteſtine; but he ſtopped me by ſaying with ſome precipitation, <q>Nor never will.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. I laid down my half-guinea upon the table, and ſtood ſome time, until one of them bade me begone. To this I replied, "I will, when I have got my change;" upon which another threw me five ſhillings and ſixpence, ſaying, I ſhould not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change. I was afterwards obliged to give three ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and ſixpence to the beadles, and a ſhilling to an old woman who ſwept the hall: this diſburſement ſunk my finances to thirteen pence halfpenny, with which I was ſneaking off, when Jackſon, perceiving it, came up to me, and begged I would tarry for him, and he would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to the other end of the town as ſoon as his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was over. I could not refuſe this to a perſon that was ſo much my friend; but I was aſtoniſhed at the change of his dreſs, which was varied in half an hour, from what I have already deſcribed, to a very groteſque faſhion. His head was covered with an old ſmoked tie-wig that did not boaſt one crooked hair, and a ſlouched hat over it, which would have very well became a chimney-ſweeper, or a duſt-man; his neck was adorned with a black crape, the ends of which he had twiſted, and fixed in the button-hole of a ſhabby great coat that wrapped up his whole body; his white ſilk ſtockings were converted into black worſted hoſe; and his countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles, and a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my ſurprize at this metamorphoſis, he laughed, and told me it was done by the advice and aſſiſtance of a friend who lived over the way, and would certainly produce ſomething very much to his advantage: for it gave him the appearance of age, which never fails of attracting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. I applauded his ſagacity, and waited with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for the effects of it. At length he was called in: but whether the oddneſs of his appearance excited a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity more than uſual in the board, or his behaviour was not ſuitable to his figure, I know not; but he was diſcovered to be an impoſtor, and put into the hands of the beadle, in order to be ſent to Bridewell: ſo that inſtead of ſeeing him come out with a cheerful countenance, and a ſurgeon's

It was now ten o'clock at night; and as I had a great way to walk through ſtreets that were utterly unknown to me, I was prevailed upon to be of their party, in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to my lodgings, according to his promiſe. He conducted us to his friend's houſe, who kept a tavern over the way, where we continued drinking punch, until the liquor mounted up to our heads, and made us all extremely fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickſome; I in particular was ſo much elevated, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve me but a wench, at which demand Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon expreſſed much joy, and aſſured me I ſhould have my deſire before we parted. Accordingly, when he had paid the reckoning, we ſallied out roar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In the mean time Mr. Jackſon's dreſs had attracted the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſiduities of two or three nymphs, who loaded him with careſſes in return for the arrack punch with which

he treated them; till, at length, notwithſtanding the ſprightly ſallies of thoſe charmers, ſleep began to exert his power over us all, and our conductor called, "To pay." When the bill was brought, it amounted to twelve ſhillings: he put his hand in his pocket, but might have ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble: for his purſe was gone. This accident diſconcerted him a good deal at firſt; but, after ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, he ſeized the two Dul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The good lady at the bar, ſeeing what paſſed, whiſpered ſomething to the drawer who went out—and then, with great compoſure, aſked, what was the matter? Jackſon told her he was robbed, and ſwore, if ſhe refuſed him ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he would have her and her whores committed to Bridewell. "Robbed," cried ſhe, <q>robbed in my houſe! gentlemen and ladies, I take you all to witneſs, this perſon has ſcandaliſed my reputation.</q> At this inſtant, ſeeing the conſtable and watch enter, ſhe proceeded, <q>What! you muſt not only endeavour by your falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions to ruin my character, but even commit an aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ault upon my family?

"Ay, ay," ſays the bawd, <q>we ſhall ſee whoſe oath will moſt ſignify.</q> In a little time, the conſtable, calling Jackſon into another room, ſpoke to him thus: <q>I perceive that you and your company are ſtrangers, and am very ſorry for your being involved in ſuch an ugly buſineſs.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027715_0107_0FD5EC21D2ABA1F0"/>
I have known this woman a great while; ſhe has kept a notorious houſe in the neighbourhood theſe many years, and, although often complained of as a nuiſance, ſtill eſcapes through her intereſt with the j—t—ces, to whom ſhe and all of her employment pay contribution quarterly for protection. As ſhe charged me with you firſt, her complaint will have the preference, and ſhe can procure evidence to ſwear whatever ſhe ſhall pleaſe to deſire of them; ſo that, unleſs you make it up before morning, you and your companions may think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happily quit for a month's hard labour in Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Nay, if ſhe ſhould ſwear a robbery or aſſault againſt you, you will be committed to Newgate, and tried next ſeſſions at the Old Bailey for your life.</q> This laſt piece of information had ſuch an effect upon Jackſon, that he agreed to make it up, provided his money might he reſtored. The conſtable told him, that inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieving what he had loſt, he was pretty certain it would coſt him ſome more before they would come to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But, however, he had compaſſion on him, and would, if he pleaſed, ſound them about a mutual releaſe. The unfortunate beau thanked him for his friendſhip, and, returning to us, acquainted us with the ſubſtance of this dialogue; while the conſtable, deſiring to ſpeak in private with our adverſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>, carried her into the next room, and pleaded our cauſe ſo effectually, that ſhe condeſcended to make him umpire: he accordingly propoſed an arbitration, to which we gave our aſſent; and he fined each party in three ſhillings, to be laid out in a bowl of punch, wherein we drowned all animoſities, to the inexpreſſible joy of my two late acquaintances and me, who had been in the ſtate of the damned ever ſince Jackſon mentioned Bridewell and Newgate. By this time we had finiſhed our bowl, to which, by the by, I had contributed my laſt ſhilling, it was morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and I propoſed to move homeward, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable gave me to underſtand, he could diſcharge no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners but by order of the juſtice, before whom we muſt appear. This renewed my chagrin, and I curſed the hour in which I had yielded to Jackſon's invitation. About nine o'clock we were eſcorted to the houſe of a certain juſtice not many miles diſtant from Covent-garden, who no ſooner ſaw the conſtable enter with a train of priſoners at his

heels, than he ſaluted him as follows: <q>So, Mr. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, you are a diligent man—what den of rogues have you been ſcouring?</q> Then looking at us, who appeared very much dejected, he continued, <q>Ay, ay, thieves, I ſee—old offenders.—O, your humble ſervant, Mrs. Harridan! I ſuppoſe theſe fellows have been taken robbing your houſe—yes, yes, here's an old acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of mine—you have uſed expedition,</q> ſaid he to me, <q>in returning from tranſportation; but we ſhall ſave you that trouble for the future—the ſurgeons will fetch you from your next tranſportation at their expence.</q> I aſſured his worſhip he was miſtaken in me; for he had never ſeen me in his life before. To this declaration he replied, <q>How! you impudent raſcal, dare you ſay ſo to my face? Do you think I am to be impoſed upon by that northern accent which you have aſſumed? but it ſhan't avail you—you ſhall find me too far north for you.—Here, clerk, write this fellow's <hi>mittimus.</hi>—His name is Patrick Gaghagan.</q> Here Mr. Jackſon inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and told him I was a Scotchman lately come to town, deſcended of a good family, and that my name was Random. The juſtice looked upon this aſſertion as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage upon his memory, on which he valued himſelf much; and, ſtrutting up to Jackſon with a fierce countenance, put his hands on his ſides, and ſaid, <q>Who are you, Sir? Do you give me the lie? Take notice, gentlemen, here's a fellow who affronts me upon the bench: but I'll lay you faſt, ſirrah, I will—for, notwithſtanding your laced jacket, I believe you are a notorious felon.</q> My friend was ſo much abaſhed at this menace, which was thundered out with great vociferation, that he changed colour, and remained ſpeechleſs. This confuſion his worſhip took for a ſymptom of guilt, and, to complete the diſcovery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his threats—<q>Now, I am convinced you are a thief—your face diſcovers it—you tremble all over—your conſcience won't lie ſtill—you'll be hang'd, ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</q> raiſing his voice, <q>you'll be hang'd: and happy had it been for the world as well as your own miſerable ſoul, if you had been detected and cut off in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your career. Come hither, clerk, and take this man's confeſſion.</q> I was in an agony of conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when the conſtable, going into another room with

his worſhip, acquainted him with the truth of the ſtory; which having learned, he returned with a ſmiling counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and, addreſſing himſelf to us all, ſaid, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways his way to terrify young people when they came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that his threats might make a ſtrong impreſſion on their minds, and deter them from engaging in ſcenes of riot and debauchery, which commonly ended before the judge. Thus, having cloaked his own want of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the diſguiſe of paternal care, we were diſmiſſed, and I found myſelf as much lightened as if a mountain had been liſted off my breaſt.</p>

But before I entered upon buſineſs, the ſchool-maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended me to his taylor, who gave me credit for a ſuit of clothes, to be paid out of the firſt moiety of my wages, and they were begun upon that very day; he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards accommodated me with a new hat, on the ſame terms; ſo that in a few days, I hoped to make a very faſhionable appearance.

                     <p>NEXT day, while I was at work in the ſhop, a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing damſel well dreſſed came in on pretence of finding a vial for ſome uſe or other, and taking an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when ſhe thought I did not mind her, of obſerving me narrowly, went away with a ſilent look of diſdain. I eaſily gueſſed her ſentiments, and my pride took the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of entertaining the ſame indifference and neglect towards her. At dinner the maids, with whom I dined in the kitchen, gave me a underſtand, that this was my maſter's only daughter, who would have a very handſome fortune, on account of which, and her beauty, a great many young gentlemen made their addreſſes to her—that ſhe had been twice on the brink of marriage, but diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the ſtingineſs of her father, who refuſed to part with a ſhilling to promote the match; for which reaſon the young lady did not behave to her father with all the filial

veneration that might be expected; in particular, ſhe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the moſt perfect hatred for his countrymen, in which diſpoſition ſhe reſembled her mother, who was an Engliſh woman; and, by theſe hints they dropped, I learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the grey mare was the better horſe—that ſhe was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of a high ſpirit, which was often manifeſted at the expence of her dependants; that ſhe loved diverſions, and looked upon Miſs as her rival in all parties, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true cauſe of her diſappointments; for, had the mother been hearty in her intereſt, the father would not have ventured to refuſe her demands.—Over and above this intelligence, I of myſelf ſoon made more diſcoveries; Mr. Lavement's ſignificant grins at his wife, while ſhe looked another way, convinced me that he was not at all content with his lot; and his behaviour in preſence of the captain, made me believe his chief torment was jealouſy.—As for my own part, I was conſidered in no other light than that of a menial ſervant, and had been already ſix days in the houſe without being honoured with one word from either mother or daughter, the latter, (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from the maids) having at table one day expreſſed ſome ſurprize that her papa ſhould entertain ſuch an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

By that time I had turned about, ſhe had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her miſtake, and changed colour, but did not withdraw. The paſſage being narrow, I could not get away without joſtling her; ſo I was forced to remain where I was, with my eyes fixed on the ground, and my face glowing with bluſhes.—At length her vanity coming to her aſſiſtance, ſhe went away tittering, and I could hear her pronounce the word, "creature." From this day forward, ſhe came into the ſhop fifty times every day, upon various pretences, and put in practice ſo many ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous airs, that I could eaſily perceive her opinion of me

was changed, and that ſhe did not think me altogether an unworthy conqueſt. But my heart was ſo ſteeled againſt her charms, by pride and reſentment, which were two chief ingredients in my diſpoſition, that I remained inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all her arts; and, notwithſtanding ſome advances ſhe made, could not be prevailed upon to yield her the leaſt attention.—This neglect ſoon baniſhed all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable impreſſions ſhe felt for me, and the rage of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thames water into aqua cinnamoni; turpentine into ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pivi; and a hundred moſt coſtly preparations were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in an inſtant, from the cheapeſt and coarſeſt drugs of the <hi>materia medica:</hi> and when any common thing was ordered for a patient, he always took care to diſguiſe it in colour or <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>taſte, or both, in ſuch a manner, as that it could not poſſibly be known.—For which purpoſe, cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal and oil of cloves were of great ſervice. Among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noſtrums which he poſſeſſed, there was one for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal diſeaſe, that brought him a good deal of money; and this he concealed ſo artfully from me, that I could never learn its compoſition: but during the eight months I ſtayed in his ſervice, he was ſo unfortunate in the uſe of it, that three parts in four of thoſe who took it, were fain to confirm the cure by a ſalivation under the direction of another doctor.—This bad ſucceſs, in all appearance, attached him the more to his ſpecific; and before I left him, I may venture to ſay; he would have ſooner renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Trinity (notwithſtanding his being a good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenot) than his confidence in the never-failing power of this remedy.—Mr. Lavement had attempted more than once to introduce a vegetable diet into his family, by launching out into the praiſe of roots and greens, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying the uſe of fleſh, both as a phyſician and a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; but all his rhetoric could not make one proſelyte to his opinion, and even the wife of his boſom declared againſt the propoſal.—Whether it was owing to the little regard ſhe paid to her huſband's admonition in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or to the natural warmth of her conſtitution, I know not; but this lady's paſſions became every day more and more violent, till at laſt ſhe looked upon decency as an unneceſſary reſtraint; and one afternoon, when her huſband was abroad, and her daughter gone to viſit, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me to call a hackney coach, in which ſhe and the captain drove towards Covent-garden.—Miſs came home in the evening, and ſupping at her uſual hour, went to bed.—About eleven o'clock my maſter entered, and aſked if his wife was gone to ſleep: upon which I told him, my miſtreſs went out in the afternoon, and was not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.—This was like a clap of thunder to the poor apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, who, ſtarting back, cried, <q>

in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a patient's ſervant arrived with a preſcription for a draught, which my maſter taking, went into the ſhop to make it up with his own hand.—While he rubbed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients in a glaſs mortar, he enquired of me, whether or no his wife went out alone; and no ſooner heard that ſhe was in company with the captain, than with one blow he ſplit the mortar into a thouſand pieces, and grinning like the head of a baſe viol, exclaimed, "Ah traitreſſe!"—It would have been impoſſible for me to have preſerved my gravity a minute longer, when I was happily relieved by a rap at the door, which I opened, and perceived my miſtreſs coming out of a coach; ſhe flounced immediately into the ſhop, and addreſſed her huſband thus: <q>I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you thought I was loſt, my dear—Captain Odon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell has been ſo good as to treat me with a play.</q>—"Play—play!" replied he, <q>Oho! yes by gar, I believe ver prettie play.</q>—"Bleſs me!" ſaid ſhe, <q>what's the matter?</q>—"Vat de matter?" cried he, forgetting all his former complaiſance, <q>by gar, you be one damn dog's wife—ventre bleu! me vil ſhow you vat it is to put one horn upon my head.

mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify, and ſealed his reconciliation with a kiſs.—This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſoon convinced me of the occaſion of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; but notwithſtanding all my vigilance, I could never diſcover any other commerce between them.—In the mean while, I had reaſon to believe I had inſpired one of the maids with tender ſentiments for me; and one night when I thought every other perſon in the houſe aſleep, I took the opportunity of going to reap the fruits of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; her bedfellow having the day before gone to Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond to viſit her parents. Accordingly I got up, and (naked as I was) explored my way in the dark, to the garret where ſhe lay.—I was raviſhed to find the door open, and moved ſoftly to her bed ſide, tranſported with the hope of completing my wiſhes.—But what horrors of jealouſy and diſappointment did I feel, when I found her aſleep, faſt locked in the arms of a man, whom I eaſily gueſſed to be no other than the captain's ſervant. I was upon the point of doing ſome raſh thing, when the noiſe of a rat ſcratching behind the wainſcot, put me to flight, and I was fain to get back to my own bed in ſafety. Whether this alarm had diſordered my mind, or that I was led aſtray by the power of deſtiny, I know not; but inſtead of turning to the left hand, when I deſcended to the ſecond ſtory, I purſued the contrary courſe, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the young lady's bedchamber for my own. I did not perceive my miſtake before I had run againſt the bed po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This hint was ſufficient to inform me of the nature of the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and as my paſſions, at any time high, were then in a ſtate of exaltation, I was reſolved to profit by my good fortune.—Without any more ceremony, therefore, I made bold to ſlip into bed to this charmer, who gave me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was very ſparing on my part, but ſhe upbraided the perſon whom I repreſented, with his jealouſy of me, whom ſhe handled ſo roughly, that my reſentment had well nigh occaſioned a diſcovery more than once; but I was conſoled for her hatred of me, by the revenge I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in underſtanding from her own mouth, that it was
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:027715_0121_0FD5EC4B8FA36B00"/>
now high time to ſave her reputation by matrimony; for ſhe had reaſon to fear ſhe could not much longer conceal the effects of their mutual intercourſe. While I was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating an anſwer to this propoſal, I heard a noiſe in my room, like ſomething heavy falling down upon the floor: upon which I ſtarted up, and creeping to the door of my chamber, obſerved by moon light, the ſhadow of a man groping his way out; ſo I retired to one ſide to let him paſs, and ſaw him go down ſtairs as expeditiouſly as he could. It was an eaſy matter to divine that this was the captain, who having overſlept himſelf, had got up at laſt to keep his aſſignation; and finding my door open, had entered my apartment inſtead of that of his miſtreſs, where I ſupplied his place. But finding his miſtake, by falling over my chair, he was afraid the noiſe might alarm the family, and for that reaſon made off, delaying the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his deſire till another opportunity.

Their mutual the grin, when they came to the knowledge of what had happened, may be eaſily conjectured, though each had a peculiar grief unfelt by the other, for ſhe was conſcious of not only having betrayed to me the ſecrets of her commerce with him, but alſo of having incenſed me by the freedoms ſhe had taken with my name, beyond a hope of reconciliation.—On the other hand, his jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſuggeſted, that her ſorrow was all artifice; and that I had ſupplied his place with her own privity and conſent.—That ſuch was the ſituation of their thoughts, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the ſequel; for that very day ſhe came into the ſhop, where I was alone, and fixing her eyes, Swimming in tears upon me, ſighed moſt piteouſly; but I was proof againſt her diſtreſs, by recollecting the epithets with which ſhe had honoured me the night before; and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the good reception I enjoyed was deſtined for another, therefore took no notice of her affliction; and

I concluded, therefore, that I muſt either have been miſtaken for another, or obliged to the private

reſentment of ſome ſecret enemy for what had happened—and, as I could remember nobody, who had the leaſt cauſe of complaint againſt me, except Captain Odonnell and my maſter's daughter, my ſuſpicion ſettled upon them, though I took care to conceal it, that I might the ſooner arrive at confirmation. With this view I went home in a chair about ten o'clock in the morning, and, as the chairman ſupported me into the houſe, met the captain in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, who no ſooner ſaw me than he ſtarted back, and gave evident ſigns of guilty confuſion, which he would have accounted for from the ſurpriſe occaſioned by ſeeing me in ſuch a condition. My maſter, having heard my ſtory, condoled me with a good deal of ſympathy, and, when he underſtood my wounds were not dangerous, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to be carried up ſtairs to bed, though not without ſome oppoſition from his wife, who was of opinion it would be better for me to go to an hoſpital, where I ſhould be more carefully attended. My meditation was employed in concerting with myſelf ſome method of revenge againſt Squire Odonnell and his inamorata, whom looked upon as the authors of my misfortune, when Miſs (who was not at home at my arrival) entered my chamber, and, ſaying ſhe was ſorry for the accident that had befallen me, aſked if I ſuſpected any body to be the aſſaſſin? Upon which I fixed my eyes ſtedfaſtly upon her, and anſwered, "Yes." She diſcovered no ſymptom of confuſion, but replied ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, <q>If that be the caſe, why don't you take out a warrant to have him apprehended? it will coſt but a trifle—if you have no money, I'll lend you.</q> This frankneſs not only cured me of my ſuſpicion with reſpect to her, but even ſtaggered my belief with regard to the captain, of whoſe guilt I reſolved to have farther proof, before I ſhould enterprize any thing in the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. I thanked her kindly for her generous offer; which, however, I had no occaſion to accept, being determined to do nothing raſhly; for, though I could plainly perceive the perſon who attacked me to be a ſoldier, whoſe face I thought was familiar to me, I could not ſwear, with a ſafe conſcience, to any particular man, and, granting I could, my proſecution of him would not much avail. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty I pretended, left the captain, hearing from her that I knew the perſon who wounded me, might think

proper to withdraw, before I could be in a condition to requite him. In two days I was up, and able to do a little buſineſs; ſo that Mr. Lavement made ſhift to carry on his practice, without hiring another journeyman in my room. The firſt thing I attempted towards a certain diſcovery of my ſecret enemy, was to get into Odonnell's apartment while he was abroad in an undreſs, and examine his ſword, the point of which being broke off, I applied the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was found ſticking in my body, and found it anſwered the fractured part exactly. There was no room le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t for doubt, and all that remained was to fix upon a ſcheme of revenge, which almoſt ſolely engroſſed my thoughts during the ſpace of eight nights and days. Sometimes I was tempted to fall upon him in the ſame manner as he had practiſed upon me, and kill him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. But this aſſault my honour oppoſed as a piece of barbarous cowardice, in which he was not to be imitated. At other times I entertained thoughts of demanding ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in an honourable way, but was diverted from this undertaking by conſidering the uncertainty of the event, and the nature of the injury he had done me, which did not intitle him to ſuch eaſy terms. At laſt I determined to purſue a middle courſe, and actually put my deſign in execution after this manner—Having ſecured the aſſiſtance of Strap, and two of his acquaintance whom he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon, we provided ourſelves with diſguiſes, and I cauſed the following letter to be delivered to him by one of our aſſociates in livery one Sunday evening:</p>

                     <p>This letter was ſigned with the name of an apothecary's wife who lived in Chelſea, of whom I had heard Odonnell was an admirer. Every thing ſucceeded to our wiſh. The

amorous hero haſtened towards the place of aſſignation, and was encountered by us in the very place where he had aſſaulted me. We ruſhed upon him all at once, ſecured his ſword, ſtripped off his clothes even to his ſkin, which we ſcourged with nettles till he was bliſtered from head to foot, notwithſtanding all the eloquence of his tears and ſupplications. When I was ſatisfied with the ſtripes I had beſtowed, we carried off his clothes which we hid in a hedge near the place, and left him ſtark-naked, to find his way home in the beſt manner he could, while I took care to be there before him. I afterwards underſtood that, in his way to the lodgings of a friend who lived in the ſkirts of the town, he was picked up by the watch, who carried him to the Round-houſe, from whence he ſent for clothes to his lodgings, and next morning arrived at the door in a chair, wrapped up in a blanket he had borrowed; for his body was ſo ſore and ſwelled, that he could not bear to be confined in his wearing apparel. He was treated with the utmoſt tenderneſs by my miſtreſs and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who vied with each other in their care and attendance of him; but Lavement himſelf could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As to myſelf, nobody can doubt my gratification, when I had every day an opportunity of ſeeing my revenge protracted on the body of my adverſary, by the ulcers of which I had been the cauſe; and indeed I not only enjoyed the ſatisfaction of having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

This and the others, which (it ſeems) were all on the ſubject of love, (for this Hibernian hero was one of thoſe people who are called fortune-hunters,) fell into the hands of a certain female author, famous for the ſcandal ſhe has publiſhed, who, after having embelliſhed them with ſome ornaments of her own invention, gave them to the town in print.

family's unhappineſs on account of the letter I had written, but was eaſed of that apprehenſion, when I underſtood, that the Chelſea apothecary had commenced a law-ſuit againſt the printer for defamation, and looked upon the whole as a piece of forgery committed by the author, who had diſappeared. But, whatever might be his opinion of the matter, our two ladies ſeemed to entertain a different idea of it; for, as ſoon as the pamphlet appeared, I could perceive their care of their patient conſiderably diminiſh, until at laſt it ended in total neglect. It was impoſſible for him to be ignorant of this change any more than of the occaſion of it; but, as he was conſcious to himſelf of having deſerved worſe than contempt at their hands, he was glad to come off ſo cheaply, and contented himſelf with muttering curſes and threats againſt the apothecary, who (as he imagined) having got an inkling of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment with his wife, had taken revenge of him in the manner deſcribed. By that time he had got a new ſcarf ſkin, his character was become ſo notorious, that he thought it high time for him to decamp; and his retreat he performed in one night without beat of drum, after having robbed his own ſervant of every thing that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, except the clothes he had on his back. A few days after he diſappeared. Mr. Lavement, for his own ſecurity, took into cuſtody a large old trunk which he had left, and as it was very heavy, made no queſtion that the contents were ſufficient to indemnify him for what Odon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell owed in lodging. But a month being elapſed without hearing any tidings of this adventurer, and my maſter being impatient to know what the trunk contained, he ordered me to break it open in his preſence; which taſk I performed with the peſtle of our great mortar, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, to his inexpreſſible aſtoniſhment and mortification, a heap of ſtones.</p>
                     <p>About this time my friend Strap informed me of an offer he had to go abroad with a gentleman in quality of valet de chambre, and at the ſame time aſſured me, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever advantage he might propoſe to himſelf from this proſpect, he could not bear the thoughts of parting from me, ſo much was he attached to my fortune. In ſpite of all the obligations I owed to this poor honeſt fellow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is ſo natural to the heart of man, that I began
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:027715_0127_0FD5EC5C577BFE50"/>
to be tired of his acquaintance, and, now that I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted other friendſhips which appeared more creditable, was even aſhamed to ſee a journeyman barber inquiring after me with the familiarity of a companion. I therefore, on pretence of conſulting his welfare, inſiſted upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the propoſal, which he at laſt determined to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with great reluctance, and in a few days took his leave of me, ſhedding a flood of tears, which I could not behold without emotion. I now began to look upon my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a gentleman in reality, learned to dance of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom I had cured of a faſhionable diſtemper, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented plays during the holidays, became the oracle of an ale-houſe, where every diſpute was referred to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and at length contracted an acquaintance with a young lady, who found means to make a conqueſt of my heart, and upon whom I prevailed, after much attendance and ſolicitation, to give me a promiſe of marriage. As this beautiful creature paſſed for a rich heireſs, I bleſſed my good fortune, and was actually on the point of crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my wiſhes by matrimony—when one morning I went to her lodgings, and, her maid being abroad, took the privilege of a bridegroom to enter her chamber, where, to my utter confuſion, I found her in bed with a man. Heaven gave me patience and preſence of mind enough to withdraw immediately, and I thanked my ſtars a thouſand times for the happy diſcovery, by which I reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſo much as to abandon all thoughts of marriage for the future.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHILE I enjoyed myſelf at large in this temper of mind, Mr. Lavement let his firſt floor to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman and acquaintance Squire Gawky, who by this time
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:027715_0128_0FD5EC5DDEBFE708"/>
had got a lieutenancy in the army, and ſuch a martial fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity in his appearance, that I was afraid he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what had happened between us in Scotland, and atone for his breach of appointment then, by his punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality now; but whether he had actually forgotten me, or was willing to make me believe ſo, he betrayed not the leaſt ſymptom of recognition at ſight of me, and I remained quite cured of my apprehenſion, though I had occaſion, not long after, to be convinced, that, howſoever his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals might be altered, he was at bottom the ſame indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Gawky whom I have already deſcribed: for, coming home late one night from the houſe of a patient, I heard a noiſe in the ſtreet, and, as I approached, perceived two gentlemen in cuſtody of three watchmen. The priſoners, who were miſerably disfigured with dirt, complained bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of the loſs of their hats and wigs, and one of them, whom by his tongue I knew to be a Scotchman, lamented piteouſly, offering a guinea for his liberty, which the watchman refuſed, alledging that one of his companions was wounded grievouſly, and that he muſt ſtand to the conſequence. My prejudice in favour of my native country was ſo ſtrong, that I could not bear to ſee any body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it in diſtreſs, and therefore, with one blow of my faithful cudgel, knocked down the watchman who had hold of the perſon for whom I was chiefly concerned, He was no ſooner diſengaged than he betook himſelf to his heels, and left me to maintain the diſpute as I ſhould think proper; and indeed I came off but ſcurvily; for, before I could avail myſelf of my ſpeed, I received a blow on the eye, from one of the other two, that had well nigh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of the uſe of that organ; however, I made ſhift to get home, where I was informed of Captain Gawky's being robbed and abuſed by a company of footpads, and was ordered by my maſter to prepare an emollient glyſter and paregoric draught, in order to allay and compoſe the ferment of his ſpirits, occaſioned by the barbarous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had undergone, while he took twelve ounces of blood from him immediately. When I inquired into the particulars of this adventure, and underſtood by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that he came in juſt before me without hat and wig, I made no ſcruple of believing him to be the perſon I had releaſed, and was confirmed in that belief upon hearing his
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:027715_0129_0FD5EC5EF6663178"/>
voice, to which (before that event) I had been ſo long a ſtranger. My eye being conſiderably ſwelled and inflamed, I could not reflect upon my enterpriſe without curſing my own folly, and even reſolving to declare the truth of the whole ſtory, in order to be revenged on the cowardly wretch for whom I had ſuffered. Accordingly, next day, after he had told in preſence of my maſter, his wife, and daughter, who came to viſit him, a thouſand lies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proweſs he had ſhewn in making his eſcape, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to explain the myſtery, and, calling in the evidence of my contuſed eye, upbraided him with cowardice and ingratitude. Gawky was ſo aſtoniſted at this diſcourſe, that he could not ſpeak one word, and the reſt of the company ſtared at one another, till at length my miſtreſs reprimanded me for my inſolent behaviour, and threatened to turn me away for my preſumption: upon which Gawky (having recollected himſelf) obſerved, as the young man might have miſtaken another perſon for him, he could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his inſinuations, more eſpecially as he ſeemed to have ſuffered for his civility, but adviſed me to be more certain in my conjectures for the future, before I ventured to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them to the prejudice of any man. Miſs applauded the captain's generoſity in pardoning one who had ſo villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſperſed him, and I began to imagine her praiſe was not at all diſintereſted. But the apothecary, who perhaps had more penetration or leſs partiality than his wife and daughter, differed from them in his ſentiments of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and expreſſed himſelf to me in the ſhop in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <q>

marriage was conſummated, and in the morning came home, where they aſked her father's and mother's bleſſing. The prudent parents, notwithſtanding the precipitation with which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Nor was I without ſelf-enjoyment at this event, when I reflected upon the revenge I had unwittingly taken upon my enemy in making him a cuckold by anticipation. But I little dreamed what a ſtorm of miſchief was brewing againſt me, whilſt I thus indulged myſelf. Whatever face Gawky put on the matter, my diſcovery of the adventure before related, and the reproaches I vented againſt him, had ſtung him to the ſoul, and cheriſhed the ſeeds of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſo ſtrongly in his breaſt, that he (it ſeems) imparted his indignation to his wife, who, being as deſirous as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to compaſs the ruin of one that had not only ſlighted her careſſes, but was able on any occaſion to diſcover particulars not at all advantageous to her character, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily joined in a conſpiracy againſt me, which (had it taken effect as they expected) would infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death.</p>

The ſervants ſaid they were ſorrow for my misfortune, and went away repeating, "Who would have thought it!" My miſtreſs took occaſion from this detection to rail againſt the practice of employing ſtrangers in general, and Mrs. Gawky, after having obſerved that ſhe never had a good opinion of my fidelity, propoſed to have me carried before the juſtice, and committed to Newgate immediately. Her huſband was actually upon the ſtairs in his way for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, when Mr. Lavement, knowing the coſt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a proſecution to which he muſt bind himſelf, and at the ſame time dreading leſt ſome particulars of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion might affect his practice, called out, <q>

detection of them might blaſt my reputation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my deſtruction. His hatred of me is owing to a conſciouſneſs of his having wronged me in my own country, for which injury he in a cowardly manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed me the ſatisfaction of a gentleman—he knows, moreover, that I am no ſtranger to his daſtardly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this town, which I have recounted before—and he is unwilling that ſuch a teſtimony of his ingratitude and puſillanimity ſhould live upon the earth; for this reaſon he is guilty of the moſt infernal malice to bring about my ruin—And I am afraid, Madam,</q> turning to Mrs. Gawky, <q>you have too eaſily entered into the ſentiments of your huſband—I have often found you my enemy, and am well acquainted with the occaſion of your being ſo, which I don't at preſent think proper to declare; but I would not adviſe you, for your own ſake, to drive me to an extremity.</q> This addreſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged her ſo much, that with a face as red as ſcarlet, and the eyes of a fury, ſhe ſtrutted up to me, and, putting her hands on her ſides, ſpit in my face, ſaying, I was a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous villain, but ſhe defied my malice—and that, unleſs her papa would proſecute me like a thief as I was, ſhe would not ſtay another night under his roof. At the ſame time Gawky, aſſuming his big look, told me he ſcorned what lies I could invent againſt him, but that, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to aſperſe his wife, he would put me to death, by G—d. To this threat I anſwered, <q>I wiſh to God I could meet with thee in a deſert, that I might have an opportunity of puniſhing thee for thy perfidy towards me, and rid the world of ſuch a raſcal—What hinders me this moment,</q> ſaid I, ſeizing an old bottle that ſtood by, "from doing myſelf that juſtice?" I had no ſooner armed myſelf in this manner than Gawky and his father-in-law retired in ſuch a hurry, that the one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the other, and they rolled together down ſtairs, while my miſtreſs ſwooned away with fear, and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſked if I intended to murder her. I gave her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that nothing was farther from my intention; that I would leave her to the ſtings of her own conſcience, but was firmly reſolved to flit her huſband's noſe, whenever fortune ſhould offer a convenient opportunity. Then, going down ſtairs, I met Lavement coming up trembling with the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027715_0133_0FD5EC642F2E6268"/>
peſtle in his hand, and Gawky behind armed with his ſword, puſhing him forward. I demanded a parley; and, having aſſured them of my pacific diſpoſition, Gawky exclaimed, "Ah! villain! you have killed my dear wife;" and the apothecary cried, "<hi>Ah coquin!</hi> vere is my ſhild?" "The lady," ſaid I, <q>is above ſtairs unhurt by me, and will in a few months hence, I believe, reward your concern.</q> Here ſhe called to them, and deſired they would let the wretch go, and trouble themſelves no farther about him: to which requeſt her father conſented, obſerving nevertheleſs, that my converſation was <hi>fort myſterieuſe.</hi> Finding it impoſſible to vindicate my innocence, I left the houſe immediately, and went to the ſchool-maſter, with an intention of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf to him, and aſking his advice with regard to my future conduct; but, to my inexpreſſible vexation, was told he was gone to the country, where he would ſtay two three days. I returned with a deſign of conſulting ſome acquaintance I had acquired in my maſter's neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; but my ſtory had taken air through the officiouſneſs of the ſervants, and not one of my friends would vouchſafe me a hearing. Thus I found myſelf, by the iniquity of mankind, in a much more deplorable condition than ever; for, though I had been formerly as poor, my reputation was without blemiſh, and my health unimpaired till now—but at preſent my good name was loſt, my money gone, my friends were alienated, my body was infected with a diſtemper contracted in the courſe of an amour, and my faithful Strap, who alone could yield me pity and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, abſent I knew not where.</p>
                     <p>The firſt reſolution I could take in this melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, was to remove my clothes to the houſe of the perſon with whom I had formerly lodged, where I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two days, in hope of getting another place by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Mr. Concordance, to whom I made no doubt of being able to vindicate my character: but in this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I reckoned without my hoſt; for Lavement took care to be before-hand with me; and, when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the ſchool-maſter, I found him ſo prepoſſeſſed againſt me, that he would ſcarce hear me to an end; but, when I had finiſhed my juſtification, ſhook his head, and beginning with his uſual exclamation, "O Ch—ſt!" ſaid he, <q>that won't go down with me. I

am very ſorry I ſhould have the misfortune of being concerned in the affair, but, however, I ſhall be more cautious for the future—I will truſt no man from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward—no, not my father who begat me—nor the brother who lay with me in my mother's womb—Should Daniel riſe from the dead, I would think him an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, and, were the genius of truth to appear, would queſtion his veracity.</q> I told him, that one day it was poſſible he might be convinced of the injury I had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and repent of his premature determination: to which remark he anſwered, the proof of my innocence would make his bowels vibrate with joy; <q>but till that ſhall happen,</q> continued he, <q>I muſt beg to have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of connection with you: my reputation is at ſtake—O my good God! I ſhall be looked upon as your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice and abettor—people will ſay, Jonathan Wild was but a type of me—boys will hoot at me as I paſs along, and the cinder-wenches belch forth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with gin: I ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious—the very butt of ſlander, and cloaca of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</q> I was not in an humour to reliſh the climax of expreſſions, upon which this gentleman valued himſelf in all his diſcourſes, but without any ceremony took my leave, curſed with every ſentiment of horror which my ſituation could ſuggeſt. I conſidered, however, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of my deſpondence, that I muſt in ſome ſhape ſuit my expence to my calamitous circumſtances, and with that view hired an apartment in a garret near St. Giles's at the rate of nine pence <hi>per</hi> week. In this place I was reſolved to perform my own cure, having firſt pawned three ſhirts to purchaſe medicines and ſupport for the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>One day when I ſat in this ſolitary retreat, muſing upon the unhappineſs of my fate, I was alarmed by a groan that iſſued from a chamber contiguous to mine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I immediately ran, and found a woman ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a miſerable truckle-bed, without any viſible ſigns of life. Having applied a ſmelling bottle to her noſe, the blood began to reviſit her cheeks, and ſhe opened her eyes; but, good heaven! what were the emotions of my ſoul, when I diſcovered her to be the ſame individual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who had triumphed over my heart, and to whoſe fate I had almoſt been inſeparably joined! Her deplorable
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:027715_0135_0FD5EC6A48FCCFD0"/>
ſituation filled my breaſt with compaſſion, and every tender idea reviving in my imagination, I flew into her embrace. She knew me immediately; an ſtraining me gently in her arms, ſhed a torrent of tears, which I could not help increaſing: at length, caſting a languiſhing look at me, ſhe pronounced with a feeble voice, <q>Dear Mr. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I do not deſerve this concern at your hands—I am a vile creature, who had a baſe deſign upon your perſon—ſuffer me to expiate that and all my other crimes by a miſerable death, which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours.</q> I encouraged her as much as I could, told her I forgave all her intentions with regard to me; and that although my circumſtances were extremely low, I would ſhare my laſt farthing with her. In the mean time begged to know the immediate cauſe of that fit, from which ſhe had juſt recovered, and ſaid I would endeavour by my ſkill to prevent any more ſuch attacks. She ſeemed very much affected with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, took my hand, and preſſed it to her lips, ſaying, <q>You are too generous! I wiſh I could live to expreſs my gratitude—but alas! I periſh for want.</q> Then ſhutting her eyes, ſhe relapſed into another ſwoon. Such extremity of diſtreſs muſt have waked the moſt obdurate heart to ſympathy and compaſſion; what effect then muſt it have had on mine, that was naturally prone to every tender paſſion? I ran down ſtairs, and ſent my landlady to a chymiſt's ſhop for ſome cinnamon-water, while I, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this unfortunate creature's chamber, uſed all the means in my power to bring her to herſelf: this aim, with much difficulty I accompliſhed, and made her drink a glaſs of the cordial to recruit her ſpirits; then I prepared a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mulled red wine and a toaſt, which having taken, ſhe found herſelf thoroughly revived, and informed me, that ſhe had not taſted food for eight and forty hours before. As I was impatient to know the occaſion and nature of her calamity, ſhe gave me to underſtand, that ſhe was a woman of the town by proſeſſion; that, in the courſe of her adventures, ſhe found herſelf dangerouſly infected with a diſtemper to which all of her claſs are particularly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that, her malady gaining ground every day, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came loathſome to herſelf, and offenſive to others, when ſhe reſolved to retire to ſome obſcure corner, where ſhe
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:027715_0136_0FD5EC6C1851FB90"/>
might be cured with as little noiſe and expence as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that ſhe had accordingly choſen this place of retreat, and put herſelf into the hands of an advertiſing doctor, who having fleeced her of all the money ſhe had, or could procure; left her three days ago in a worſe condition than that in which he found her; that except the clothes on her back, ſhe had pawned or ſold every thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to her, to ſatisfy the rapacious quack, and quiet the clamour of her landlady, who ſtill perſiſted in her threats to turn her out into the ſtreet.—After having mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralized upon theſe particulars, I propoſed that ſhe ſhould lodge in the ſame room with me, an expedient that would ſave ſome money; and aſſured her I would undertake her cure as well as my own, during which ſhe ſhould partake of all the conveniences that I could afford to myſelf. She embraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment, and I began to put it in practice immediately.—I found in her, not only an agreeable companion, whoſe converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion greatly alleviated my chagrin but alſo a careful nurſe, who ſerved me with the utmoſt fidelity and affection. One day, while I teſtified my ſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MY father was an eminent merchant in the city, who having, in the courſe of trade, ſuffered very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſſes, retired in his old age with his wife to a ſmall eſtate in the country, which he had purchaſed with the remains of his fortune. At that time I being but eight years of age, was left in town for the convenience of education, boarded with an aunt, who was a rigid Preſbyterian, and who confined me ſo cloſely to what ſhe
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:027715_0137_0FD5EC6EACD1C140"/>
called the duties of religion, that in time I grew weary of her doctrines, and by degrees conceived an averſion for the good books ſhe daily recommended to my peruſal. As I increaſed in age, and appeared with a perſon not diſagreeable, I contracted a good deal of acquaintance among my own ſex; one of whom, after having lamented the reſtraint I was under from the narrowneſs of my aunt's ſentiments, told me, I muſt now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and example, and learn to think for myſelf; for which purpoſe ſhe adviſed me to read Shaftſbury, Tindal, Hobbs, and all the books that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking, and by comparing one with another, I ſhould ſoon be able to form a ſyſtem of my own. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her advice, and whether it was owing to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion againſt what I had formerly read, or the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of argument in theſe my new inſtructors, I know not, but I ſtudied them with pleaſure, and in a ſhort time became a profeſſed free-thinker. Proud of my new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, I argued in all companies, and that with ſuch ſucceſs, that I ſoon acquired the reputation of a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and few people durſt undertake me in a diſpute. I grew vain upon my good fortune, and at length pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make my aunt a proſelyte to my opinion; but ſhe no ſooner perceived my drift, than taking the alarm, ſhe wrote to my father an account of my hereſy, and conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as he tendered the good of my ſoul, to remove me immediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted ſuch ſinful principles; accordingly, my father ordered me into the country, where I arrived in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of my age, and, by his command, gave him a detail of all the articles of my faith, which he did not find ſo unreaſonable as they had been repreſented.—Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf ſuddenly deprived of the company and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the town, I grew melancholy, and it was ſome time before I could reliſh my ſituation.—But ſolitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every day more and more familiar to me, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled myſelf in my retreat with the enjoyment of a good library, at ſuch times as were not employed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the family, (for my mother had been dead three years,) in viſiting, or ſome other party of rural di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.—Having more imagination than judgment, I
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:027715_0138_0FD5EC70459F4138"/>
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted myſelf too much to poetry and romance; and in ſhort was looked upon as a very extraordinary perſon by every body in the country where I reſided.—I had one evening ſtrayed, with a book in my hand, into a wood that bordered on the high road, at a little diſtance from my father's houſe; when a certain drunken ſquire0, riding by, perceived me, and crying, <q>Z—ds! there's charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature!</q> alighted in a moment, caught me in his arms, and treated me ſo rudely, that I ſhrieked as loud as I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could, and in the mean time oppoſed his violence with all the ſtrength that rage and reſentment could inſpire.—During this ſtruggle, another horſeman came up, who, ſeeing a lady ſo unworthily uſed, diſmounted and flew to my aſſiſtance.—My raviſher, mad with diſappointment, or provoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman, quitted me, and running to his horſe, drew a piſtol from the ſaddle, and fired at my protector, who happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no damage, went up, and with the but-end of his whip laid him proſtrate on the ground, before he could uſe the other, which his antagoniſt immediately ſeized, and clapping to the ſquire's breaſt, threatened to put him to death for his cowardice and treachery. In this dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma I interpoſed and begged his life, which was granted to my requeſt, after he had aſked pardon, and ſwore his intention was only to obtain a kiſs.—However, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender thought proper to unload the other piſtol, and throw away the flints, before he gave him his liberty.—This courteous ſtranger conducted me home, where my father, having learned the ſignal ſervice he had done me, loaded him with careſſes, and inſiſted on his lodging that night at our houſe.—If the obligation he had conferred upon me juſtly inſpired me with ſentiments of gratitude, his appearance and converſation ſeemed to intitle him to ſomewhat more.—He was about the age of two and twenty, among the talleſt of the middle ſize; had cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut coloured hair, which he wore tied up in a ribbon; a high poliſhed forehead, a noſe inclining to the aqualine, lively blue eyes, red pouting lips, teeth as white as ſnow, and a certain openneſs of countenance.—But what need I deſcribe any more particulars of his perſon? I hope you will do me the juſtice to believe I do not flatter, when I ſay he was the exact reſemblance of you; and if I had
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:027715_0139_0FD5EC721AA92A30"/>
not been well acquainted with his family and pedigree, I ſhould have made no ſcruple of concluding that you was his brother.—He ſpoke little, and ſeemed to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, for what he ſaid was ingenious, ſenſible, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common.—In ſhort, (ſaid ſhe, burſting into tears,) he was formed for the ruin of our ſex.—His behaviour was modeſt and reſpectful, but his looks were ſo ſignificant that I could eaſily obſerve, he ſecretly bleſſed the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that introduced him to my acquaintance.—We learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his diſcourſe, that he was the eldeſt ſon of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood, to whoſe name we were no ſtrangers; that he had been to viſit an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the country, from whoſe houſe he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, when my ſhrieks brought him to my reſcue. All night long my imagination formed a thouſand ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous expectations: there was ſo much of knight-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantry in this gentleman's coming to the relief of a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of diſtreſs, with whom he immediately became ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to my fancy, and I looked upon myſelf as a princeſs in ſome region of romance, who, being delivered from the power of a brutal giant or ſatyr by a generous Oroondates, was bound in gratitude, as well as led by inclination, to yield up my affections to him without reſerve. In vain did I endeavour to chaſtiſe theſe fooliſh conceits by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections more reaſonable and ſevere: the amuſing images took full poſſeſſion of my mind, and my dreams repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my hero, ſighing at my feet, in the language of a deſpairing lover.—Next morning after breakfaſt he took his leave, when my father begged the favour of further acquaintance with him; to which requeſt he replied by a compliment to him, and a look to me ſo full of eloquence and tenderneſs, that my whole ſoul received the ſoft im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.—In a ſhort time he repeated his viſit; and, as a recital of the particular ſteps he purſued to ruin me, would be too tedious and impertinent; let it ſuffice to ſay, he made it his buſineſs to inſinuate himſelf into my eſteem, by convincing me of his own good ſenſe, and at the ſame time flattering my underſtanding: this taſk he performed in the moſt artful manner, by ſeeming to contradict me often through miſapprehenſion, that I might have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of clearing myſelf, the more to my own
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:027715_0140_0FD5EC775A14D588"/>
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Having thus ſecured my good opinion, he began to give me ſome tokens of a particular paſſion founded on a veneration for the qualities of my mind, and as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ornament, admired the beauties of my perſon; till at length, being fully perſuaded of his conqueſt, he choſe a proper ſeaſon for the theme, and diſcloſed his love in terms ſo ardent and ſincere, that it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> for me to diſguiſe the ſentiments of my heart, and he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my approbation with the moſt lively tranſport. After this mutual declaration, we contrived to meet more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in private interviews, where we enjoyed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of one another, in all the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope, that reciprocal adoration can inſpire. He profeſſed his honourable intentions, of which I made no queſtion, lamented the avaricious diſpoſition of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had deſtined him for the arms of another, and vowed eternal fidelity with ſuch an appearance of candour and devotion, that I became a dupe to his deceit, and in an evil hour crowned his eager deſire with full poſſeſſion. Curſed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace for momentary gratification, which has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon me ſuch miſery and horror! curſed be my beauty that firſt attracted the attention of the ſeducer! curſed be my education, that, by refi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Had I been ugly, no body would have tempted me; had I been ignorant, the charms of my perſon would not have atoned for the coarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my converſation; had I been giddy, my vanity would have divided my inclinations, and my ideas would have been ſo diffuſed, that I ſhould never have liſtened to the enchantments of one alone.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my unfortunate ſtory: we gave a looſe to guilty pleaſure, which for ſome months baniſhed every other concern.—At laſt, by degrees, his viſits became leſs frequent, and his behaviour leſs warm: I perceived his coldneſs, my heart took the alarm, my tears reproached him, and I inſiſted upon the performance of his promiſe to eſpouſe me, that, whatever ſhould happen, my re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

to unite us in the bands of wedlock.—But, alas! the inconſtant had no intention to return: I waited a whole week with the utmoſt impatience; ſometimes doubting his honour, at other times inventing excuſes for him, and condemning myſelf for harbouring the leaſt ſuſpicion of his faith.—At length, I underſtood from a gentleman who dined at our houſe, that this perfidious wretch was on the point of ſetting out for London with his bride, to buy clothes for their approaching nuptials.—This information diſtracted me! the more ſo, as I found myſelf ſome months gone with child, and reflected, that it would be impoſſible to conceal my diſgrace, which would not only ruin the character I had acquired in the country, but alſo bring the grey hairs of an indulgent parent with ſorrow to the grave. Rage took poſſeſſion of my ſoul; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a thouſand imprecations, and formed as many ſchemes of revenge againſt the traitor who had undone me!

The villain left me without remorſe, and in a few days the news of his marriage was ſpread all over the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—My horror was then inconceivable! and had not the deſire of revenge diverted the reſolution, I ſhould infallibly have put an end to my miſerable life.—My father obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſymptoms of my deſpair; and, though I have good reaſon to believe he gueſſed the cauſe, was at a great deal of pains to ſeem ignorant of my affliction, while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with paternal fondneſs to alleviate my diſtreſſes. I ſaw his concern, which increaſed my anguiſh, and raiſed my fury againſt the author of my calamity to an implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree. Having furniſhed myſelf with a little money, I made an elopement from this unhappy parent in the night-time, and, about break of day, arrived at a ſmall town, from whence a ſtage coach ſet out for London, in
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:027715_0142_0FD5EC7A9D94F3C8"/>
which I embarked, and next day alighted in town; the ſpirit of revenge having ſupported me all the way againſt every other reflection.—My firſt care was to hire a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which I kept myſelf very retired, having aſſumed a feigned name, that my character and ſituation might be the better concealed. It was not long before I found out the houſe of my raviſher, whither I immediately repaired in a tranſport of rage, determined to act ſome deſperate deed for the ſatisfaction of my deſpair, though the hurry of my ſpirits would not permit me to concert or reſolve upon a particular plan. When I demanded admiſſion to Lothario, (ſo let me call him,) I was deſired to ſend up my name and buſineſs; but this I refuſed, telling the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had buſineſs for his maſter's private ear: upon which I was conducted into a parlour until he ſhould be informed of my requeſt.—There I remained about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour, when a ſervant entered and told me his maſter was engaged with company, and begged to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed at that time.—My temper could hold out no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: I pulled a poniard from my boſom, where I had concealed it, and ruſhing out, flew up ſtairs like a fury, exclaiming, <q>Where is this perfidious villain! Could I once plunge this dagger into his falſe heart, I ſhould then die ſatisfied.</q> The noiſe I made alarmed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſervants, but the company alſo, who, hearing my threats, came forwards to the ſtair-caſe to ſee what was the matter. I was ſeized, diſarmed, and with-held by two footmen; and in this ſituation felt the moſt exquiſite torture in beholding my undoer approach with his young wife. I could not endure the ſight, was deprived of my ſenſes, and fell into a ſevere fit, during which I know not how I was treated; but when I recovered the uſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, found myſelf on a bed in a paultry apartment, where I was attended by an old woman, who aſked a thouſand impertinent queſtions relating to my condition; and informed me that my behaviour had thrown the whole family into confuſion; that Lothario affirmed that I was mad, and propoſed to have me ſent to Bedlam: but my lady perſuaded herſelf there was more in my conduct than he cared ſhould be known, and had taken to her bed on bare ſuſpicion, having firſt ordered that I ſhould be narrowly looked to.

The agitation of my thoughts produced a fever, which brought on a miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and I believe it is well for my conſcience that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thus diſpoſed of my burden; for, let me own to you with penitence and horror, if I had brought a living child into the world, my frenzy would have prompted me to ſacrifice the little innocent to my reſentment of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's infidelity.</p>
                     <p>After this event my rage abated, and my hate became more deliberate and calm; when one day my landlady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that there was a gentleman below, who deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee me, he having ſomething of conſequence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, which he was ſure would contribute to my peace of mind. I was exceedingly alarmed at this declaration, which I attempted to interpret a thouſand ways; and, before I came to any determination, he entered my room with an apology for intruding upon me againſt my knowledge or conſent. I ſurveyed him ſome time, and, not being able to recollect his face, demanded with a faultering accent, what his buſineſs was with me? upon which he deſired I would give him a particular audience, and he did not doubt of communicating ſomething that would conduce to my ſatisfaction and repoſe. As I thought myſelf ſufficiently guarded againſt any violence, I granted his requeſt, and bade the woman withdraw. The ſtranger, then advancing gave me to underſtand, that he was well acquainted with the particulars of my ſtory, having been informed of them from Lothario's own mouth—that, from the time he knew my misfortunes, he had entertained a deteſtation for the author of them, which had of late been increaſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed to a deſire of revenge by a piece of diſhonourable conduct towards him—that, hearing of my melancholy ſituation he had come with an intention of offering his aſſiſtance and comfort, and was ready to eſpouſe my quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and forthwith take vengeance on my ſeducer, provided I would grant him one conſideration, which he hoped I ſhould ſee no reaſon to refuſe. Had all the artifice of hell been employed in compoſing a perſuaſive, it could not
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:027715_0144_0FD5EC7D9CF1DDC8"/>
have had a more inſtantaneous or favourable effect than this diſcourſe had upon me. I was tranſported with a delirium of gloomy joy; I hugged my companion in my arms, and vowed that, if he would make good his promiſe, my ſoul and body ſhould be at his diſpoſal. The contract was made; he devoted himſelf to my revenge, undertook to murder Lothario that very night, and to bring me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his death before morning. Accordingly, about two of the clock, he was introduced to my chamber, and aſſured me my perfidious lover was no more; that although he was not entitled to ſuch an honourable proceeding, he had fairly challenged him to the field, where he upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with treachery towards me, for whom, he told him, his ſword was drawn, and after a few paſſes left him weltering in his blood.—I was ſo ſavaged by my wrongs, that I delighted in the recital of this adventure, made him repeat the particulars, feaſted my eyes with the blood that remained on his clothes and ſword, and yielded up my body as a recompence for the ſervice he had done me. My imagination was ſo engroſſed by theſe ideas, that in my ſleep I dreamed Lothario appeared before me, pale, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, and bloody, blamed my raſhneſs, proteſted his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and pleaded his own cauſe ſo pathetically, that I was convinced of his fidelity, and awakened in a fit of horror and remorſe. My bed-fellow endeavoured to ſooth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole, and perſuade me that I had but barely done juſtice to myſelf.—I dropt aſleep again, and the ſame apparition recurred to my fancy. In ſhort, I paſſed the night in great miſery, and looked upon my avenger with ſuch ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, that in the morning, perceiving my averſion, he inſinuated there was ſtill a poſſibility of Lothario's recovery; it was true, he left him wounded on the ground, but not quite dead, and perhaps his hurts might not be mortal.—At theſe words I ſtarted up, bade him fly for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and if he could not bring me tidings of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thario's ſafety, at leaſt conſult his own, and never return: for I was reſolved to ſurrender myſelf to juſtice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all that I knew of the affair, that if poſſible I might expiate my own guilt, by incurring the rigours of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere repentance and ignominious death.—He very coolly repreſented the unreaſonableneſs of my prejudice againſt him, who had done nothing but what his love of me
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:027715_0145_0FD5EC8470011BB8"/>
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and honour juſtified; that now he had, at the riſk of his life, been ſubſervient to my revenge, I was about to diſcard him as an infamous agent occaſionally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and that even if he ſhould be ſo lucky as to bring news of Lothario's ſafety, it was probable my former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment might revive, and I would upbraid him with having failed in his undertaking.—I aſſured him that, on the contrary, he ſhould be dearer to me than ever, as I then ſhould be convinced he acted more on the principles of a man of honour, than on thoſe of a mercenary aſſaſſin, and ſcorned to take away the life of an adverſary, (how inveterate ſoever,) which fortune had put in his power.—"Well then, Madam," ſaid he, <q>whatever may have happened, I ſhall find it no difficult matter to acquit myſelf in point of honour.</q> And took his leave in order to inquire into the conſequences of his duel.—I was now more ſenſible than ever of the degrees of guilt and miſery; all the affliction I had ſuffered hitherto was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my own credulity and weakneſs, and my conſcience could only accuſe me of venial crimes: but now that I looked upon myſelf as a murderer, it is impoſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the terrors of my imagination, which was inceſſantly haunted by the image of the deceaſed, and my boſom ſtung with the moſt exquiſite agonies, of which I ſaw no end. At length, Horatio (for ſo I ſhall call my keeper) returned, and telling me I had nothing to fear, delivered into my hands a billet containing theſe words.</p>

                     <p>Being well acquainted with his hand, I had no reaſon to ſuſpect an impoſition in this letter, which I read over and over with a tranſport of joy, and careſſed Horatio ſo much, that he appeared the happieſt man alive. Thus was I won from deſpair by the menaces of a greater misfortune than that which depreſſed me. Griefs are like uſurpers;

the moſt powerful depoſes all the reſt. But my raptures were not laſting; that very letter, which in a manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed my tranquillity, in a little time baniſhed my peace. His unjuſt reproaches, while they waked my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, recalled my former happineſs, and filled my ſoul with rage and ſorrow. Horatio, perceiving the ſituation of my mind, endeavoured to divert my chagrin by treating me with all the amuſements and entertainments of the town. I was gratified with every indulgence I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, introduced into the company of other kept miſtreſſes, by whom an uncommon deference was paid to me, and I began to loſe all remembrance of my former condition, when an accident brought it back to my view with all its intereſting circumſtances. Diverting myſelf one day with ſome newſpapers, which I had not before peruſed, the following advertiſement attracted my attention:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Whereas a young gentlewoman diſappeared from her father's houſe in the county of—, about the end of September, on account (as is ſuppoſed) of ſome unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of mind, and has not been as yet heard of, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will give any information about her to Mr.—, of Gray's-inn, ſhall be handſomely rewarded; or, if ſhe will return to the arms of her diſconſolate parent, ſhe will be received with the utmoſt tenderneſs, whatever reaſon ſhe may have to think otherwiſe, and may be the means of prolonging the life of a father, already weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down almoſt to the grave with age and ſorrow.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This pathetic remonſtrance had ſuch an effect on me, that I was fully reſolved to return like the prodigal ſon, and implore the forgiveneſs of him who gave me life; but alas! upon inquiry, I found he had paid his debt to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a month before, lamenting my abſence to his laſt hour, having left his fortune to a ſtranger as a mark of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of my unkind and undutiful behaviour. Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with remorſe on this occaſion, I ſunk into the moſt profound melancholy, and conſidered myſelf as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of his death. I loſt all reliſh for company, and indeed moſt of my acquaintance no ſooner perceived my change of temper, than they abandoned me. Horatio, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at my inſenſibility, or (which is more probable) cloyed with poſſeſſion, became colder and colder every day, till at laſt he left me altogether, without making any apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:027715_0147_0FD5EC875D050FD8"/>
for his conduct, or ſecuring me againſt the miſeries of want, as a man of honour ought to have done, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſhare he had in my ruin; for I afterwards learned, that the quarrel between Lothario and him was a ſtory trumped up to rid the one of my importunities, and give the other the enjoyment of my perſon, which, it ſeems, he luſted after, upon ſeeing me at the houſe of my ſeducer. Reduced to this extremity, I curſed my own ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, uttered horrid imprecations againſt the treachery of Horatio, and, as I became every day more and more familiariſed to the loſs of innocence, reſolved to be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſex in general by practiſing their own arts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. Nor was an opportunity long wanting: an old gentlewoman, under pretence of ſympathiſing, viſited me, and after having condoled me on my misfortunes, and profeſſed a diſintereſted friendſhip, began to diſplay the art of her occupation, in encomiums on my beauty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt the wretch who had forſaken me, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting withal, that it would be my own fault if I did not ſtill make my fortune by the extraordinary qualifications with which nature had endowed me. I ſoon underſtood her drift, and gave her ſuch encouragement to explain herſelf, that we came to an agreement immediately to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the profits of my proſtitution accruing from ſuch gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants as ſhe ſhould introduce to my acquaintance. The firſt ſtroke of my diſſimulation was practiſed upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain j—ge, to whom I was recommended by this matron as an innocent creature juſt arrived from the country. He was ſo tranſported with my appearance and feigned ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, that he paid a hundred guineas for the poſſeſſion of me for one night only, during which I behaved in ſuch a manner as to make him perfectly well pleaſed with his purchaſe.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HER ſtory was here interrupted by a rap at the door, which was no ſooner opened than three or four ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fellows ruſhed in, one of whom accoſted my fellow-lodger thus: <q>Madam, your ſervant—you muſt do me the favour to come along with me—I have got a writ againſt you.</q> While the bailiff (for ſo he was) ſpoke thus, his followers ſurrounded the priſoner, and began to handle her very roughly. This treatment incenſed me ſo much, that I ſnatched up the poker, and would certainly have uſed it in defence of the lady, without any regard to the ſtrength and number of her adverſaries, had ſhe not begged me with a compoſure of countenance, for which I could not account, to uſe no violence in her behalf, which could be of no ſervice to her, but might be very detrimental to myſelf. Then, turning to the leader of this formidable troop, ſhe deſired to ſee the writ; and, having peruſed it, ſaid with a faultering voice, <q>I am not the perſon whoſe name is here mentioned; arreſt me at your peril.</q> "Ay, ay, Madam," repl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

While they waited for the convenience, ſhe took me aſide, and bade me be under no concern on her account; for ſhe

knew how to extricate herſelf from this difficulty very ſoon, and perhaps gain ſomething by the occaſion. Although her diſcourſe was a myſtery to me, I was very well pleaſed with her aſſurance, and, when the coach came to the door, offered to accompany her to priſon; to which propoſal, after much entreaty, ſhe conſented. When we arrived at the gate of the Marſhalſea, our conducto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I'm glad to ſee thee with all my heart.</q> So ſaying, he opened the coach-door, and helped her to diſmount; but, when he obſerved her face, he ſtarted back, ſaying, "Z—ds! who have we got here?" The bailiff, alarmed at this interrogation, cried with ſome emotion, <q>Who the devil ſhould it be but the priſoner Eliſabeth Cary?</q> The turnkey replied, <q>That Eliſabeth Cary!—I'll be damn'd if that's Eliſabeth Cary more than my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.—D—n my blood, I know Bett Cary as well as if I had made her.</q> Here the lady thought fit to interpoſe, and tell the catchpole, if he had taken her word for it at firſt, he might have ſaved himſelf and her a great deal of trouble.—"It may be ſo," anſwered he; <q>but by G—d, I'll have farther evidence that you are not the perſon before you and I part.</q>—"Yes, yes," ſaid ſhe, "you ſhall have farther evidence to your coſt." Then we adjourned into the lodge and called for a bottle of wine, where my companion wrote a direction to two of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and begged the favour of me to go to their lodgings, and requeſt them to come to her immediately: I found them together at a houſe in Bridges-ſtreet, Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane; and, as they were luckily unengaged, they ſet out with me in a hackney-coach without heſitation, after I had related to them the circumſtances of the affair, which flattered them with hopes of ſeeing a bailiff troun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for there is an antipathy as natural between the whores and bailiffs as that ſubſiſting between mice and cats. Accordingly, when they entered the lodge, they embraced the priſoner very affectionately by the name of Nancy Williams, and aſked how long ſhe had been nabbed, and for what? On hearing the particulars of her adventure repeated, they offered to ſwear before a juſtice of peace,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:027715_0150_0FD5EC914D199B70"/>
that ſhe was not the perſon mentioned in the writ, whom, it ſeems, they all knew; but the bailiff, who by this time was convinced of his miſtake, told them he would not put them to that trouble.—"Ladies," ſaid he, <q>there's no harm done—you ſhall give me leave to treat you with another bottle, and then we'll part friends.</q> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal was not at all reliſhed by the ſiſterhood, and Miſs Williams told him, <q>Sure he did not imagine her ſuch a fool as to be ſatisfied with a paultry glaſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>our wine.</q>—Here the turnkey interrupted her, by affirming with an oat! that the wine was as good as ever was tipped over tongue.—"Well," continued ſhe, <q>that may be—but was it the beſt Champaign, it is no recompenſe for the damage I have ſuffered, both in character and health, by being wrongfully dragged to jail—At this rate no innocent perſon is ſafe, ſince an officer of juſtice, out of malice, private pique, or miſtake, may injure and oppreſs the ſubject with impunity—but, thank Heaven, I live under the protection of laws that will not ſuffer ſuch inſults to paſs unpuniſhed, and I know very well how to procure redreſs.</q> Mr. Vulture (for that was the bailiff's name) finding he had to deal with one who would not be impoſed upon, began to look very ſullen and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and, leaning his forehead on his hand, entered into a deliberation with himſelf, which laſted a few minutes, and then broke out in a volley of dreadful curſes againſt the old b—ch our landlady (as he called her) for having miſinformed him. After much wrangling and ſwearing, the matter was referred to the deciſion of the turnkey, who, calling for the other bottle, mulcted the bailiff in all the liquor that had been drank, coach-hire, and a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of guineas for the uſe of the plaintiff. The money was immediately depoſited; Miſs Williams gratified the two evidences with one half, and, putting the other in her pocket, drove home with me, leaving the catchpole grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling over his loſs, yet pleaſed in the main for having ſo cheaply got clear of a buſineſs that might have coſt him ten times the ſum, and his place to boot. This guinea was a very ſeaſonable relief to us, who were reduced to great neceſſity, ſix of my ſhirts, and almoſt all my clothes except thoſe on my back, having been either pawned or ſold for our maintenance before this happened.

reſented the behaviour of our landlady, our firſt care was to provide ourſelves with another lodging, whither we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved next day, with an intention to keep ourſelves as retired as poſſible until our cure ſhould be completed. When we were fixed in our new habitation, I entreated her to finiſh the ſtory of her life, which ſhe purſued in this manner:</p>
                     <p>The ſucceſs of our experiment on the j—ge encouraged us to practiſe the ſame deceit on others, and my virginity was five times ſold to good purpoſe; but this harveſt laſted not long, my character taking air, and my directreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting me for ſome new game. Then I took lodgings near Charing-croſs at two guineas <hi>per</hi> week, and began to entertain company in a public manner: but, my income being too ſmall to defray my expence, I was obliged to retrench, and enter into articles with the porters of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain taverns, who undertook to find employment enough for me, provided I would ſhare my profits with them.—Accordingly I was almoſt every night engaged with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, among whom I was expoſed to every mortification, danger, and abuſe, that flow from drunkenneſs, brutality, and diſeaſe. How miſerable is the condition of a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, whoſe buſineſs is to ſooth, ſuffer, and obey the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of rage, inſolence, and luſt! As my ſpirit was not ſufficiently humbled to the will, nor my temper calculated for the converſation of my gallants, it was impoſſible for me to overcome an averſion I felt for my profeſſion, which manifeſted itſelf in a ſettled gloom on my countenance, and diſguſted thoſe ſons of mirth and riot ſo much, that I was frequently uſed in a ſhocking man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The meſſengers, ſeeing me diſagreeable to their benefactors and employers, ſeldom troubled me with a call, and I began to find myſelf almoſt totally neglected. To contribute towards my ſupport, I was fain to ſell my watch, rings, trinkets, with the beſt part of my clothes; and I was one evening muſing by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the miſery before me, when I received a meſſage from a bagnio, whither I repaired in a chair, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to a gentleman dreſſed like an officer, with whom I ſupped in a ſumptuous manner, and, after drinking a hearty glaſs of Champaign, went to bed. In the morning, when I awoke, I found my gallant had got up, and, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:027715_0152_0FD5EC942C90CC58"/>
aſide the curtain, could not perceive him in the room. This circumſtance gave me ſome uneaſineſs; but, as he might have retired on ſome neceſſary occaſion, I waited a full hour for his return, and then in the greateſt perplexity roſe up, and rung the bell. When the waiter came to the door, he found it locked, and deſired admittance, which I granted, after obſerving with great ſurpriſe, that the key remained on the inſide, as when we went to bed. I no ſooner inquired for the captain, than the fellow, ſtaring with a diſtracted look, cried, <q>How, Madam! is he not a-bed?</q> and, when he was ſatisfied as to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ran into a cloſet adjoining to the chamber, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of which he found open. Through this the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer had got upon a wall, from whence he had dropped down into a court, and eſcaped, leaving me to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able not only for the reckoning, but alſo for a large ſilver tankard and poſſet-bowl, which he had carried off with him. It is impoſſible to deſcribe the conſternation I was under, when I ſaw myſelf detained as a thief's accomplice; for I was looked upon in that light, and carried before a juſtice, who, miſtaking my confuſion for a ſign of guilt, committed me, after a ſhort examination, to Bridewell, having adviſed me, as the only means to ſave my life, to turn evidence, and impeach my confederate. I now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the vengeance of Heaven had overtaken me, and that I muſt ſoon finiſh my career by an ignominious death. This reflection ſunk ſo deep into my ſoul, that I was for ſome days deprived of my reaſon, and actually believed myſelf in hell tormented by fiends. Indeed, there needs not a very extravagant imagination to form that idea; for, of all the ſcenes on earth, that of Bridewell approaches neareſt the notion I had always entertained of the infernal regions. Here I ſaw nothing but rage, anguiſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and heard nothing but groans, curſes, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. In the midſt of this helliſh crew I was ſubjected to the tyranny of a barbarian, who impoſed upon me taſks that I could not poſſibly perform, and then puniſhed my incapacity with the utmoſt rigour and inhumanity. I was often whipped into a ſwoon, and laſhed out of it, during which miſerable intervals I was robbed by my fellow-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of every thing about me, even to my cap, ſhoes, and ſtockings; I was not only deſtitute of neceſſaries but
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:027715_0153_0FD5EC963B43EBB8"/>
even of food, ſo that my wretchedneſs was extreme. Not one of my acquaintance to whom I imparted my ſituation, would grant me the leaſt ſuccour or regard, on pretence of my being committed for theft, and my landlord refuſed to part with ſome of my own clothes which I had ſent for, becauſe I was indebted to him for a week's lodging.—Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with calamity, I grew deſperate, and reſolved to put an end to my grievances and life together: for this purpoſe I got up in the middle of the night, when I thought every body round me aſleep, and fixing one end of my handkerchief to a large hook in the ceiling, that ſupported the ſcales on which the hemp is weighed, I ſtood upon a chair, and, making a nooſe on the other end, put my neck into it, with an intention to hang myſelf; but, before I could adjuſt the knot, I was ſurpriſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by two women who had been awake all the while, and ſuſpected my deſign. In the morning my attempt was publiſhed among the priſoners, and puniſhed with thirty ſtripes, the pain of which, co-operating with my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and diſgrace, bereft me of my ſenſes, and threw me into an ecſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Whether it was owing to the want of oppoſition, or to the weakneſs of nature, I know not, but on the ſecond day of my faſt I found my reſolution conſiderably impaired, and the calls of hunger almoſt inſupportable. At this critical conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a lady was brought into the priſon, with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio; ſhe was then on the ſame footing as I was, but afterwards quarrelling with her gallant, and not finding another to her mind, altered her ſcheme of life, and ſet up a coffee-houſe among the hundreds of Drury, where ſhe entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the gentlemen with claret, arrack, and the choice of half a dozen damſels, who lived in her houſe. This ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable matron, having neglected to gratify a certain

ju—ce for the connivance ſhe enjoyed, was indicted at the quarter-ſeſſions, in conſequence of which her bevy was diſperſed, and herſelf committed to Bridewell. She had not been long there before ſhe learned by diſaſter, and coming up to me, after a compliment of condolence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the particulars of my fate: while we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in diſcourſe together, the maſter came and told me, that the fellow on whoſe account I had ſuffered was taken; that he had confeſſed the theft, and cleared me of any concern in the affair; for which reaſon he the maſter had orders to diſcharge me, and that I was from that moment free. This piece of news ſoon baniſhed all thoughts of death, and had ſuch an inſtantaneous effect on my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that Mrs. Coupler (the lady then preſent) hoping to find her account in me, very generouſly offered to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me with what neceſſaries I wanted, and take me into her own houſe, as ſoon as ſhe could compromiſe matters with the ju—ce. The conditions of her offer were, that I ſhould pay three guineas weekly for my board, and a reaſonable conſideration beſides for the uſe of ſuch clothes and ornaments as ſhe ſhould ſupply me with, to be deduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the firſt profits of my embraces. Theſe were hard terms, but not to be rejected by one who was turned out helpleſs and naked into the wide world, without a friend to pity or aſſiſt her. I therefore embraced her propoſal, and ſhe being bailed in a few hours, took me home with her in a coach. As I was by this time conſcious of having formerly diſguſted my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Having the advantage of a good voice and education, I exerted my talents to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and ſoon became the favourite with all company. This ſucceſs alarmed the pride and jealouſy of Mrs. Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler, who could not bear the thoughts of being eclipſed: ſhe therefore made a merit of her envy, and whiſpered among her cuſtomers that I was unſound. There needed no more to ruin my reputation, and blaſt my proſperity; every body ſhunned me with marks of averſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and in a very ſhort time I was as ſolitary as ever. Want of gallants was attended with want of money to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy

my malicious landlady, who, having purpoſely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds, took out a writ againſt me, and I was arreſted in her own houſe. Though the room was crowded with people when the bailiff enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not one of them had compaſſion enough to mollify my proſecutrix, far leſs to pay the debt; they even laughed at my tears, and one of them bid me be of good cheer, for I would not want admirers in Newgate. At that inſtant a ſea-lieutenant came in, and, ſeeing my plight, began to inquire into the circumſtances of my misfortune, when this writ adviſed him to keep clear of me, for I was a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.—"A fire-ſhip!" replied the ſailor; <q>more like a poor galley in diſtreſs that has been boarded by ſuch a fire-ſhip as you; if ſo be as that is the caſe, ſhe ſtands in more need of aſſiſtance. Harkee, my girl, how far have you over-run the conſtable?</q> I told him the debt amounted to eleven pounds, beſides the expence of the writ.—"An' that be all," ſaid he, <q>you ſhan't go to the bilboes this bout</q>—and, taking out his purſe, paid the money, diſcharged the bailiff, and, telling me I had got into the wrong port, adviſed me to ſeek out a more convenient harbour where I could be ſafely hove down, for which purpoſe he made me a preſent of five guineas more. I was ſo touched with this ſingular piece of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, that for ſome time I had not power to thank him. However, as ſoon as I had recollected myſelf, I begged the favour of him to go with me to the next tavern, where I explained the nature of my diſaſter, and convinced him of the falſhood of what was reported to my prejudice ſo effectually, that he from that moment attached himſelf to me, and we lived in great harmony together, until he was obliged to go to ſea, where he periſhed in a ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>Having loſt my benefactor, and almoſt conſumed the remains of his bounty, I ſaw myſelf in danger of relapſing into my former neceſſity, and began to be very uneaſy at the proſpect of bailiffs and jails—when one of the ſiſterhood, a little ſtale, adviſed me to take lodgings in a place of the town where I was unknown, and paſs for an heireſs, by which artifice I might intrap ſomebody to be my huſband, who would poſſibly be able to allow me an handſome maintenance, or at worſt ſcreen me from the dread and danger of a priſon by becoming liable for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

I approved of this ſcheme, towards the execution of which my companion clubbed her wardrobe, and undertook to live with me in quality of my maid, with the proviſo, that ſhe ſhould be reimbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and handſomely conſidered out of the profits of my ſucceſs. She was immediately detached to look out for a convenient place, and that very day hired a genteel apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Park-ſtreet, whither I moved in a coach loaded with her baggage and my own.

This report brought a ſwarm of gay young fellows about me; but I ſon found them out to be all indigent adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers like myſelf, who crowded to me like crows to a carrion, with a view of preying upon my fortune. I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, however, the appearance of wealth as long as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in hopes of gaining ſome admirer more for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and at length attracted the regard of one who would have ſatisfied my wiſhes; and managed matters ſo well, that a day was actually fixed for our nuptials: in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim he begged leave to introduce an intimate friend to me; which requeſt as I could not refuſe, I had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme mortification and ſurpriſe to ſee next night, in that friend, my old keeper Horatio, who no ſooner beheld me than he changed colour, but had preſence of mind to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and ſalute me, bidding me(with a low voice) be under no apprehenſion; for he would not expoſe me. In ſpite of this aſſurance I could not recover myſelf ſo far as to entertain them, but withdrew to my chamber on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a ſevere headach, to the no ſmall co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Having imparted my ſituation to my companion, ſhe found it high time for us to decamp, and that without any noiſe, becauſe we were not only indebted to our landlady, but alſo to ſeveral tradeſmen in the neighbourhood. Our retreat, therefore, was concerted and executed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner—Having packed up all our clothes and moveables in ſmall parcels, (ſhe, on pretence of fetching cordials for me,) carried them, at ſeveral times, to the houſe of an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

where ſhe likewiſe procured a lodging, to which we retired in the middle of the night, when every body in the houſe was aſleep. I was now obliged to aim at lower game, and accordingly ſpread my nets among trades-people, but found them all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions, till at laſt I became acquainted with you, on whom I practiſed all my dexterity; not that I believed you had any fortune, or expectation of one, but that I might transfer the burden of ſuch debts as I had incurred or ſhould contract from myſelf to another, and at the ſame time avenge myſelf of your ſex by rendering miſerable one who bore ſuch reſemblance to the wretch who ruined me; but Heaven preſerved you from my ſnares by the diſcovery you made, which was owing to the negligence of my maid in leaving the chamber-door unlocked when ſhe went to buy ſugar for breakfaſt. The perſon in bed with me was a gentleman whom I had allured the night before as he walked homeward pretty much elevated with liquor; for by this time my condition was ſo low, that I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to turn out in the twilight to the ſtreets in hopes of prey. When I found myſelf detected and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

My companion, being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in her expectations, left me to trade upon her own bottom, and I had no other reſource than to venture forth, like the owls in the dark, to pick up a precarious and uncomfortable ſubſiſtence. I have often ſauntered between Ludgate-hill and Charing-croſs, a whole winter-night, expoſed not only to the inclemency of the weather but likewiſe to the rage of hunger and thirſt, without being ſo happy as to meet with one cully; then creep up to my garret in a deplorable, draggled condition, ſneak to bed, and try to bury my appetite and ſorrows in ſleep. When I lighted on ſome rake or tradeſman reeling home drunk, I frequently ſuffered the moſt brutal treatment, in ſpite of which I was obliged to affect gaiety and good humour, though my ſoul was ſtung with reſentment and diſdain, and my heart loaded with grief and affliction. In the courſe of theſe nocturnal adventures, I was infected with the diſeaſe that in a ſhort time rendered me the object of my own abhorrence and drove me to the retreat, where your benevolence reſcued me from the jaws of death.</p>

So much candour and good ſenſe appeared in this lady's narration, that I made no ſcruple of believing every ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of what ſhe ſaid; and expreſſed my aſtoniſhment at the variety of miſeries ſhe had undergone in ſo little time for all her misfortunes had happened within the compaſs of two years. I compared her ſituation with my own, and found it a thouſand times more wretched: I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured hardſhips, 'tis true; my whole life had been a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſuch, and when I looked forward, the proſpect was not much bettered:—but then they were become habitual to me, and conſequently I could bear them with leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.—If one ſcheme of life ſhould not ſucceed, I could have recourſe to another, and ſo to a third, veering about to a thouſand different ſhifts, according to the emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of my fate, without forfeiting the dignity of my character, beyond a power of retrieving it, or ſubjecting myſelf wholly to the caprice and barbarity of the world. On the other hand, ſhe had known and reliſhed the ſweets of proſperity; ſhe had been brought up under the wings of an indulgent parent, in all delicacies to which her ſex and rank entitled her; and without any extravagance of hope, entertained herſelf with the view of uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed happineſs through the whole ſcene of life.—How fatal then, how tormenting, how intolerable muſt her reverſe of fortune be! a reverſe, that not only robs her of theſe external comforts, and plunges her into all the miſeries of want; but alſo murders her peace of mind, and entails upon her the curſe of eternal infamy!—Of all profeſſions I pronounced that of a courtezan the moſt deplorable, and her of all courtezans the moſt unhappy. She allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my obſervation to be juſt in the main, but at the ſame time affirmed, that notwithſtanding the diſgraces that had fallen to her ſhare, ſhe had not been ſo unlucky in the condition of a proſtitute as many others of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity.—"I have often ſeen," ſaid ſhe, <q>while I ſtrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about the ſtreets at midnight, a number of naked wretches reduced to rags and filth, huddled together like ſwine, in the corner of a dark alley; ſome of whom, but eighteen months before, I had known the favourites of the town, rolling in affluence, and glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the pomp of equipage and dreſs.</q>—And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the gradation is eaſily conceived: the moſt faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

woman of the town is as liable to contagion as one in a much humbler ſphere; ſhe infects her admirers, her ſituation is public; ſhe is avoided, neglected, unable to ſupport her uſual appearance, which however ſhe ſtrives to maintain as long as poſſible; her credit fails, ſhe is obliged to retrench and become a night-walker, her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady gains ground, ſhe tampers with her conſtitution, and ruins it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her complexion fades, ſhe grows nauſeous to every body, finds herſelf reduced to a ſtarving condition, is tempted to pick pockets, is detected, committed to Newgate, where ſhe remains in a miſerable condition, till ſhe is diſcharged, becauſe the plaintiff will not appear to proſecute her. Nobody will afford her lodging, the ſymptoms of her diſtemper are grown outrageous, ſhe ſues to be admitted into an hoſpital, where ſhe is cured at the expence of her noſe; ſhe is turned out naked into the ſtreets, depends upon the addreſſes of the loweſt claſs, is fain to allay the rage of hunger and cold with gin, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into a brutal inſenſibility, rots and dies upon a dunghill.—<q>Miſerable wretch that I am! perhaps the ſame horrors are decreed for me;—No, (cried ſhe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome pauſe,) I ſhall never live to ſuch extremity of diſtreſs; my own hand ſhall open a way for my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, before I arrive at that forlorn period!</q> Her condition filled me with ſympathy and compaſſion; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her qualifications, looked upon her as unfortunate, not criminal, and attended her with ſuch care and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that in leſs than two months, her health, as well as my own, was perfectly re-eſtabliſhed. As we often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon our mutual affairs, and interchanged advice, a thouſand different projects were formed, which upon further canvaſſing appeared impracticable.—We would have gladly gone to ſervice; but who would take us in without recommendation? At length an expedient occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her, of which ſhe intended to lay hold; and this was to procure with the firſt money ſhe ſhould earn, the homely garb of a country wench, go to ſome village at a good diſtance from town, and come up in a waggon, as a freſh girl for ſervice; by which means ſhe might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in a manner much more ſuitable to her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than her preſent way of life.</p>

                        <p>I am reduced to great miſery—aſſaulted on Towerhill by a preſs-gang, who put me on board a tender—my uſage there—my arrival on board of the Thunder man of war, where I am put in irons, and afterwards releaſed by the good offices of Mr. Thomſon, who recommends me as aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to the ſurgeon—he relates his own ſtory, and makes me acquainted with the characters of the captain, ſurgeon, and firſt mate.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I APPLAUDED the reſolution of Miſs Williams, who, a few days after, was hired in quality of bar-keeper, by one of the ladies who had witneſſed in her behalf at the Marſhalſea; and who ſince that time had got credit with a wine merchant, whoſe favourite ſhe was, to ſet up a convenient houſe of her own. Thither my fellow-lodger repaired, after having taken leave of me with a torrent of tears, and a thouſand proteſtations of eternal gratitude; aſſuring me ſhe would remain in this ſituation no longer than ſhe could pick up money ſufficient to put her other deſign in execution.</p>

But my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny prevented this abject piece of behaviour; for as I croſſed Tower-wharf, a ſquat tawny fellow with a hanger by his ſide, and a cudgel in his hand, came up to me, calling, <q>Yo, ho! brother, you muſt come along with me.</q>—As I did not like his appearance, inſtead of anſwering his ſalutation, I quickened my pace, in hope of ridding myſelf of his company; upon which he whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled aloud, and immediately another ſailor appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, who laid hold of me by the collar, and began to drag me along.—Not being of a humour to reliſh ſuch treatment, I diſengaged myſelf of the aſſailant, and with

He pulled out my handkerchief, 'tis true, but inſtead of applying it to the uſe for which I deſigned it, went to the grating of the hatchway, and with aſtoniſhing compoſure, ſold it before my face to a bum-boat woman,<note n="*" place="bottom">A bum-boat woman is one who ſells bread, cheeſe, greens, liquor, and freſh proviſion to the ſailors, in a ſmall boat that lyes along-ſide of the ſhip.</note> then on board, for a quart of gin, with which he treated his companions, regardleſs of my circumſtances and intreaties.</p>

Many a taught gale of wind has honeſt Tom Bowling and I weathered together.—Here's his health with all my heart, wherever he is, a-loft or a-low—in heaven or in hell—all's one for that—he needs not be aſhamed to ſhew himſelf.</q>—I was ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this eulogium that I could not refrain from telling him, I was Lieutenant Bowling's kinſman, in conſequence of which connection, he expreſſed an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſerve me, and when he was relieved, brought ſome cold boiled beef in a platter, and biſcuit, on which we ſupped plentifully, and afterwards drank another can of flip together. While we were thus engaged, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great many exploits of my uncle, who (I found) was very much beloved by the ſhip's company, and pitied for the misfortune that happened to him in Hiſpaniola, which I was very glad to be informed was not ſo great as I imagined; for Captain Oakhum had recovered of his wounds, and actually at that time commanded the ſhip. Having by accident in my pocket my uncle's letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from Port Louis, I gave it my benefactor (whoſe name was Jack Rattlin) for his peruſal; but honeſt Jack told me frankly he could not read, and deſired to know the contents, which I immediately communicated: when he heard that part of it, in which, he ſays, he had writ to his landlord, in Deal; he cried, <q>Body o'me! that was old Ben.

But the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant clapt on all the ſail he could bear, and had got far enough a-head before we knew any thing of the matter; ſo that we could never after get ſight of him; for which we were not ſorry, becauſe the captain was mainly wroth, and would certainly have done him a miſchief;—for he afterwards cauſed him to be run on

                     <p>This account of the captain's behaviour gave me no advantageous idea of his character; and I could not help lamenting my own fate, that had ſubjected me to ſuch a commander. However, making a virtue of neceſſity, I put a good face on the matter, and next day was with the other preſſed men put on board of the Thunder lying at the Nore.—When we came along-ſide, the mate who guarded us thither, ordered my hand-cuffs to be taken off, that I might get on board the eaſier; this circumſtance being perceived by ſome of the company who ſtood upon the gang-boards to ſee us enter, one of them called to Jack Rattlin, who was buſied in doing this friendly office for me: <q>Hey Jack, what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along?

And in ſhort, a thouſand witticiſms of the ſame nature were paſſed upon me before I could get up the ſhip's ſide.—After we had been all entered upon the ſhip's books, I inquired of one of my ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates where the ſurgeon was, that I might have my wounds dreſſed, and had actually got as far as the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>deck, (for our ſhip carried eighty guns,) in my way to the cock-pit, when I was met by the ſame midſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had uſed me ſo barbarouſly in the tender: he ſeeing me free from my chains, aſked with an inſolent air, who had releaſed me? To this queſtion I fooliſhly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with a countenance that too plainly declared the ſtate of my thoughts; <q>Whoever did it, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did not conſult you in the affair.</q>—I had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er uttered the words, than he cried, <q>Damn you, you ſaucy ſon of a bitch, I'll teach you to talk ſo to your officer.</q>—So ſaying, he beſtowed on me ſeveral ſtripes, with a ſupple Jack he had in his hand; and going to the commanding officer, made ſuch a report of me, that I
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:027715_0165_0FD5ECB1DDD5F468"/>
was immediately put in irons by the maſter at arms, and a centinel placed over me.—Honeſt Rattlin, as ſoon as he heard of my condition, came to me, and adminiſtered all the conſolation he could, and then went to the ſurgeon in my behalf, who ſent one of his mates to dreſs my wounds. This mate was no other than my old friend Thomſon, with whom I became acquainted at the navy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>office as before-mentioned. If I knew him at firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When he had applied what he thought proper, and was about to leave me, I aſked him if my misfortunes had diſguiſed me ſo much, that he could not recollect my face? Upon this addreſs he obſerved me with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs for ſome time, and at length proteſted he could not recollect one feature of my countenance.—To keep him no longer in ſuſpence, I told him my name; which, when he had heard, he embraced me with affection, and profeſſed his ſorrow in ſeeing me in ſuch a diſagreeable ſituation. I made him acquainted with my ſtory, and when he had heard how inhumanly I had been uſed in the tender, he left me abruptly, aſſuring me, I ſhould ſee him again ſoon. I had ſcarce time to wonder at his ſudden departure, when the maſter at arms came to the place of my confinement, and bade me follow him to the quarter-deck, where I was examined by the firſt lieutenant, who commanded the ſhip in the abſence of the captain, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the midſhipman, who was preſent to confront me.—I recounted the particulars of his behaviour to me, not only in the tender, but ſince my being on board the ſhip, part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlin and others, who had no great devotion for my op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, I was diſcharged from confinement to make way for him, who was delivered to the maſter at arms to take his turn in the bilboes.—And this was not the only ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I enjoyed, for I was, at the requeſt of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, exempted from all other duty, than that of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mates in making and adminiſtering medicines to the ſick.—This good office I owed to the friendſhip of
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:027715_0166_0FD5ECB675025BB8"/>
Mr. Thomſon, who had repreſented me in ſuch a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light to the ſurgeon, that he demanded me of the lieutenant to ſupply the place of his third mate, who was lately dead.—When I had obtained this favour, my friend Thomſon carried me down to the cock-pit, which is the place allotted for the habitation of the ſurgeons mates: and when he had ſhewn me their birth, (as he called it,) I was filled with aſtoniſhment and horror.—We deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by divers ladders to a ſpace as dark as a dungeon, which I underſtood was immerſed ſeveral feet under water, being immediately above the hold: I had no ſooner approached this diſmal gulf, than my noſe was ſaluted with an intolerable ſtench of putrified cheeſe and rancid butter, that iſſued from an apartment at the foot of the ladder, reſembling a chandler's ſhop, where, by the faint glimmering of a candle, I could perceive a man with a pale meagre countenance, ſitting behind a kind of deſk, having ſpectacles on his noſe, and a pen in his hand.—This (I learned of Mr. Thomſon) was the ſhip's ſteward, who ſat there to diſtribute proviſion to the meſſes, and to mark what each received.—He therefore preſented my name to him, and deſired I might be entered in his meſs; then taking a light in his hand, conducted me to the place of his reſidence, which was a ſquare of about ſix feet, ſurrounded with the medicine cheſt, that of the firſt mate, his own, and a board by way of table faſtened to the after-powder-room; it was alſo incloſed with canvas nailed round to the beams of the ſhip, to ſcreen us from the cold, as well as from the view of the midſhipmen and quarter-maſters, who lodged within the cable tiers on each ſide of us: in this gloomy manſion, he entertained me with ſome cold ſalt pork, which he brought from a ſort of locker, fixed above the table; and calling for the boy of the meſs, ſent him for a can of beer, of which he made excellent flip to crown the banquet.—By this time I began to recover my ſpirits, which had been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly depreſſed with the appearance of every thing about me, and could no longer refrain from aſking the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Mr. Thomſon's fortune, ſince I had ſeen him in London.—He told me, that being diſappointed in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of borrowing money to gratify the rapacious ſ—t—y at the navy-office, he found himſelf utterly

un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſubſiſt any longer in town, and had actually of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ſervice in quality of mate, to the ſurgeon of a merchant's ſhip bound to Guinea on the ſlaving trade; when one morning, a young fellow, of whom he had ſome acquaintance, came to his lodgings, and informed him, that he had ſeen a warrant made out in his name at the navy-office, for ſurgeon's ſecond mate of a third rate: this unexpected piece of good news he could ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be true; more eſpecially, as he had been found qualified at ſurgeons-hall for third mate only; but that he might not be wanting to himſelf, he went thither to be aſſured, and actually found it ſo: whereupon, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his warrant, it was delivered to him, and the oaths adminiſtered immediately.—That very afternoon, he went to Graveſend in the tilt-boat, from whence he took a place in the tide-boat for Rocheſter; next morning got on board the Thunder, for which he was appointed, then lying in the harbour at Chatham; and the ſame day was muſtered by the clerk of the checque.—And well it was for him, that ſuch expedition was uſed; for in leſs than twelve hours after his arrival, another William Thomſon came on board, affirming that he was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for whom the warrant was expedited, and that the other was an impoſtor.—My friend was grievouſly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this accident, the more ſo, as his nameſake had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much the advantage over him, both in aſſurance and dreſs.—However, to acquit himſelf of the ſuſpicion of impoſture, he produced ſeveral letters written from Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to him in that name, and recollecting that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures were in a box on board, he brought them up, and convinced all preſent, that he had not aſſumed a name which did not belong to him.—His competitor, enraged that they ſhould heſitate in doing him juſtice, (for, to be ſure, the warrant had been deſigned for him,) behaved with ſo much indecent heat, that the commanding officer, (who was the ſame gentleman I had ſeen,) and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, were offended at his preſumption, and making a point of it with their friends in town, in leſs than a week got the firſt confirmed in his ſtation.—<q>I have been on board,</q> ſaid he, <q>ever ſince, and as this way of life is become familiar to me, have no cauſe to complain of my ſituation.—The ſurgeon is a good natured indolent

                     <p>WHILE he was thus diſcourſing to me, we heard a voice on the cockpit-ladder, pronounce with great vehemence, in a ſtrange dialect, <q>The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Mounchdenny, if I go to him before there is ſomething in my pelly;—let his noſe be as yellow as ſaffron, or as blue as a bell, (look you,) or as green as a leek, 'tis all one.</q>—To this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration ſomebody anſwered, <q>So it ſeems my poor meſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate muſt part his cable for want of a little aſſiſtance.—His fore-top-ſail is looſe already: and beſides, the doctor ordered you to overhaul him;—but I ſee you don't care what your maſter ſays.</q>—Here he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted with <q>Splutter and oons! you louſy tog, who do you call my maſter? get you gone to the doctor, and tell him my birth, and education, and my abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and moreover, my behaviour is as good as his or any ſhentleman's (no diſparagement to him) in the whole world—Got pleſs my ſoul! does he think or conceive, or imagine, that I am a horſe, or an aſs, or a goat, to trudge backwards and forwards, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and downwards, and by ſea, and by land, at his will and pleaſures?—Go your ways you rapſcallion, and tell Doctor Atkins, that I deſire and requeſt, that he will give a look upon the tying man, and order ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him if he be dead or alive, and I will ſee him take it by and by, when my craving ſtomach is ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, look you.</q>—At this the other went away, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if they would ſerve him ſo, when he was dying,

by God, he would be ſoul of them in the other world.—Here Mr. Thomſon let me know that the perſon we heard was Mr. Morgan, the firſt mate, who was juſt come on board from the hoſpital, whither he had attended ſome of the ſick in the morning.—At the ſame time I ſaw him come into the birth.—He was a ſhort thick man with a face garniſhed with pimples, a ſnub noſe turned up at the end, an exceſſive wide mouth, and little fiery eyes, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſkin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles.—My friend immediately made him acquainted with my caſe; when he regarded me with a very lofty look, but without ſpeaking, ſet down a bundle he had in his hand, and approached the cupboard, which when he had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he exclaimed in a great paſſion, <q>Cot is my life! all the pork is gone, as I am a Chriſtian!</q> Thomſon then gave him to underſtand, that as I had been brought on board half-famiſhed be could do no leſs than entertain me with what was in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ocker; and the rather as he had bid the ſteward enter me the meſs.—Whether this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment made Mr. Morgan more peeviſh than uſual, or he really thought himſelf too little regarded by his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-mate, I know not, but after ſome pauſe he went on in this manner.—<q>Mr. Thomſon, perhaps you do not uſe me with all the good manners, and complaiſance, and reſpect (look you) that becomes you, becauſe you have not vouchſafed to adviſe with me in this affair.—I have, in my time, (look you,) been a man of ſome weight and ſubſtance, and conſideration, and have kept houſe and home, and paid ſcot and lot and the king's taxes; ay, and maintained a family to boot.—And moreover, alſo, I am your ſenior, and your elder, and your petter, Mr. Thomsſon.</q>—<q>My elder I'll al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you to be, but not my better,</q> cried Thomſon with ſome heat. "Cot is my ſaviour, and witneſs too," ſaid Morgan, with great vehemence, <q>that I am more elder and therefore more petter by many years than you.</q>—Fearing this diſpute might be attended with ſome bad conſequence, I interpoſed, and told Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, I was very ſorry for having been the occaſion of any difference between him and the ſecond mate; and that, rather than cauſe the leaſt breach in their good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I would eat my allowance by myſelf, or ſeek

admiſſion into ſome other company.—But Thomſon, with more ſpirit than diſcretion, (as I thought,) inſiſted upon my remaining where he had appointed me; and obſerved that no man poſſeſſed of generoſity and compaſſion, would have any objection to it, conſidering my birth and talents, and the misfortunes I had of late ſo unjuſtly undergone.—This was touching Mr. Morgan on the right key, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted with great earneſtneſs, that he had no objection to my being received in the meſs; but only complained, that the ceremony of aſking his conſent was not obſerved. <q>As for a ſhentleman in diſtreſs,</q> ſaid he, ſhaking me by the hand, <q>I lofe him as I lofe my own powels: for Got help me! I have had vexation enough upon my own pack.</q>—And I afterwards learned, in ſo ſaying, he ſpoke no more than what was true; for he had been once ſettled in a very good ſituation in Glamorganſhire, and was ruined by being ſecurity for an acquaintance. All differences being compoſed, he untied his bundle, which conſiſted of three bunches of onions, and a great lump of Cheſhire cheeſe wrapped up in a handkerchief, and, taking ſome biſcuit from the cupboard, fell to with a keen appetite, inviting us to a ſhare of the repaſt. When he had fed heartily on his homely fare, he filled a large cup, made of a cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut ſhell, with brandy, and, drinking it off, told us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Prandy was the peſt menſtruum for onion and ſheeſe." His hunger being appeaſed, he began to be in better hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and, being inquiſitive about my birth, no ſooner underſtood that I was deſcended of a good family than he diſcovered a particular good-will to me on that account, deducing his own pedigree in a direct line from the famous Caractacus king of the Britons, who was firſt the priſoner, and afterwards the friend of Claudius Caeſar. Perceiving how much I was reduced in point of linen, he made me a preſent of two ruffled ſhirts, which, with two more of check which I received from Mr. Thomſon, enabled me to appear with decency. Mean while the ſailor, whom Mr. Morgan had ſent to the doctor, brought a preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his meſs-mate, which, when the Welchman had read, he got up to prepare it, and aſked if the man was <q>dead or alive.</q> "Dead!" replied Jack; <q>if he was dead, he would have no need of doctor's ſtuff—No, thank God, death han't as yet boarded him, but they have

Morgan, hearing this, exclaimed, <q>Mercy upon my ſalvation! why did you not ſtop him till I came?</q>—"Stop him," ſaid the other; <q>I hail'd him ſeveral times, but he was too far on his way, while the enemy had got poſſeſſion of his cloſe quarters; ſo that he did not mind me.</q>—"Well, well," ſaid he, <q>we all owe Heaven a teath.—Go your ways, you ragamuffin, and take an example and a warning; look you, and repent of your miſteets.</q>—So ſaying, he puſhed the ſeaman out of the birth.</p>
                     <p>While he entertained us with reflections ſuitable to this event, we heard the boatſwain pipe to dinner; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the boy belonging to our meſs ran to the locker, from whence he carried off a large wooden platter, and in a few minutes returned with it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Morgan himſelf enriched this meſs with a lump of ſalt butter, ſcooped from an old gallipot, and a handful of onions ſhorn, with ſome pounded pepper.

ſufficient for the occaſion, and therefore deſired to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, expreſſing a curioſity to know the meaning of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yan-day—They told me, that on Mondays, Wedneſdays, and Fridays, the ſhip's company had no allowance of meat, and that theſe meagre days were called banyan-days, the reaſon of which they did not know; but I have ſince learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they take their denomination from a ſect of devotees in ſome parts of the Eaſt-Indies, who never taſte fleſh.</p>
                     <p>After dinner Thomſon led me round the ſhip, ſhewed me the different parts, deſcribed their uſes, and, as far as he could, made me acquainted with the particulars of the diſcipline and economy practiſed on board. He then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the boatſwain an hammock for me, which was ſlung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin, and, as I had no bed-clothes, procured credit for me with the purſer for a mattraſs and two blankets. At ſeven o'clock in the evening Morgan viſited the ſick, and, having ordered what was proper for each, I aſſiſted Thomſon in making up his preſcriptions; but when I followed him with the medicines into the ſick-birth or hoſpital, and, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſituation of the patients, I was much leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that people ſhould die on board, than that any ſick perſon ſhould recover. Here I ſaw about fifty miſerable diſtempered wretches, ſuſpended in rows, ſo huddled one upon another, that not more than fourteen inches ſpace was allotted for each with his bed and bedding; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the light of the day as well as of freſh air; breathing nothing but a noiſome atmoſphere of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid ſteams exhaling from their own excrements and diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bodies, devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that ſurrounded them, and deſtitute of every convenience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for people in that helpleſs condition.</p>

                        <p>A diſagreeable accident happens to me in the diſcharge of my office—Morgan's noſe is offended—a dialogue between him and the ſhip's ſteward—upon examination I find more cauſes of complaint than one—my hair is cut off—Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's cookery—the manner of ſleeping on board—I am awaked in the night by a dreadful noiſe</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I COULD not comprehend how it was poſſible for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to come near thoſe who hung on the inſide towards the ſides of the ſhip, in order to aſſiſt them, as they ſeemed barricadoed by thoſe who lay on the outſide, and entirely out of the reach of all viſitation—much leſs could I conceive how my friend Thomſon would be able to adminiſter clyſters, that were ordered for ſome in that ſituation—when I ſaw him thruſt his wig in his pocket, and ſtrip himſelf to his waiſtcoat in a moment, then creep on all fours under the hammocks of the ſick, and, forcing up his bare pate between two, keep them aſunder with one ſhoulder, until he had done his duty. Eager to learn the ſervice, I deſired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that kind; and, he conſenting, I undreſſed myſelf after his example, and, crawling along, the ſhip happened to roll; this motion alarming me, I laid hold of the firſt thing that came within my graſp with ſuch violence, that I overturned it, and ſoon found by the ſmell that iſſued upon me, I had not unlocked a box of the moſt delicious perfume; it was well for me that my noſe was none of the moſt delicate, elſe I know not how I might have been affected by this vapour, which diffuſed itſelf all over the ſhip to the utter diſcompoſure of every body who tarried on the ſame deck—neither was the conſequence of this diſgrace confined to my ſenſe of ſmelling only; for I felt my misfortunes more ways than one. That I might not, however, appear altogether diſconcerted in this my firſt eſſay, I got up, and puſhing my head with great force, between two hammocks, towards the middle, where the greateſt reſiſtance was, I made an opening indeed, but, not underſtanding the knack of dexterouſly turning my ſhoulder to maintain my advantage, had the mortification to find myſelf ſtuck up as it were in a pillory, and the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:027715_0174_0FD5ECC45949A5E8"/>
weight of three of four people bearing on each ſide of my neck; ſo that I was in danger of ſtrangulation. While I remained in this defenceleſs poſture, one of the ſick men, rendered peeviſh by his diſtemper, was ſo enraged at the ſmell I had occaſioned, and the rude ſhock he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from me in my elevation, that, with many bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, he ſeized me by the noſe, which he tweaked ſo unmercifully that I roared with anguiſh. Thomſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my condition, ordered one of the waiters to my aſſiſtance, who with much difficulty diſengaged me from this ſituation, and hindered me from taking vengeance on the ſick man, whoſe indiſpoſition would not have ſcreened him from the effects of my indignation.</p>
                     <p>After having made an end of our miniſtry for that time, we deſcended to the cockpit, my friend comforting me for what had happened with a homely proverb, which I do not chuſe to repeat. When we had deſcended half way down the ladder, Mr. Morgan, before he ſaw us, having intelligence by his noſe of the approach of ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, cried, <q>Cot have mercy upon my ſenſes! I believe the enemy has poarded us in a ſtink-pot!</q>—Then directing his diſcourſe to the ſteward, from whom he imagined the odour proceeded, he reprimanded him ſeverely for the freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth, and threatened to ſmoke him like a padger with ſulphur, if ever he ſhould preſume to offend his neighbours with ſuch ſmells for the future: the ſteward, conſcious of his own innocence, replied with ſome warmth, <q>I know of no ſmells but thoſe of your own making.</q> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee introduced a ſmart dialogue, in which the Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man undertook to prove, that, though the ſtench he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of did not flow from the ſteward's own body, he was nevertheleſs the author of it, by ſerving out damaged proviſions to the ſhip's company, and, in particular, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified cheeſe, from the uſe of which only, he affirmed, ſuch unſavoury ſteams could ariſe. Then he launched out into the praiſe of good cheeſe, of which he gave the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis, explained the different kinds of that commodity, with the methods practiſed to make and preſerve it, and concluded with obſerving, that, in yielding good cheeſe, the county of Glamorgan might vie with Cheſhire itſelf, and was much ſuperior to it in the produce of goats and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:027715_0175_0FD5ECC45E9B9628"/>
putter. I gathered from this converſation, that, if I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in my preſent pickle, I ſhould be no welcome gueſt, and therefore deſired Mr. Thomſon to go before, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent my calamity; at which the firſt mate, expreſſing ſome concern, went upon deck immediately, taking his way through the cable tire, and by the main hatchway, to avoid encountering me, deſiring to clean myſelf as ſoon as poſſible; for he intended to regale himſelf with a diſh of ſalmagundy and a pipe. Accordingly I ſet about this diſagreeable buſineſs, and ſoon found I had more cauſes of complaint than I at firſt imagined; for I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome gueſts had honoured me with their company, whoſe viſit I did not at all think ſeaſonable; neither did they ſeem inclined to leave me in a hurry; for they were in poſſeſſion of my chief quarters, where they fed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve at the expence of my blood. But, conſidering it would be much eaſier to extirpate this ferocious colony in the infancy of their ſettlement than after they ſhould be multiplied and naturaliſed to the ſoil, I took the advice of my friend, (who, to prevent ſuch misfortunes, went always cloſe ſhaved,) and made the boy of our meſs cut off my hair, which had been growing ſince I left the ſervice of Lavement, and the ſecond mate lent me an old bob-wig to ſupply the loſs of that covering. This affair being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every thing adjuſted in the beſt manner my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would permit, the deſcendant of Caractaous returned, and, ordering the boy to bring a piece of ſalt beef from the brine, cut off a ſlice, and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, which ſeaſoning with a moderate proportion of pepper and ſalt, he brought it into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with oil and vinegar—then, taſting the diſh, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured us it was the beſt ſalmagundy that ever he made, and recommended it to our palate with ſuch heartineſs, that I could not help doing honour to his preparation. But I had no ſooner ſwallowed a mouthful than I thought my entrails were ſcorched, and endeavoured with a deluge of ſmall beer to allay the heat it occaſioned. Supper being over, Mr. Morgan having ſmoked a couple of pipes, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the moiſture he had expended with as many cans of flip, of which we all partook, a certain yawning began to admoniſh me, that it was high time to repair by ſleep the injury I had ſuffered for want of reſt the preceding night;
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:027715_0176_0FD5ECC5BA7FB158"/>
which being perceived by my companions, whoſe time of repoſe was now arrived, they propoſed we ſhould turn in, or, in other words, go to bed. Our hammocks, which hung parallel to one another on the outſide of the birth, were immediately unlaſhed, and I beheld my meſs-mates ſpring with great agility into their reſpective neſts, where they ſeemed to lie concealed, very much at their eaſe.—But it was ſome time before I could prevail upon myſelf to truſt my carcaſe at ſuch a diſtance from the ground, in a narrow bag, out of which I imagined I ſhould be apt, on the leaſt motion in my ſleep, to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones, I ſuffered myſelf, however, to be perſuaded, and, taking a leap to get in, threw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quite over with ſuch violence, that, had I not luckily got hold of Thomſon's hammock, I ſhould have pitched upon my head on the other ſide, and in all likelihood fractured my ſkull. After ſome fruitleſs efforts I ſucceeded at laſt; but the apprehenſion of the jeopardy, in which I believed myſelf, withſtood all the attacks of ſleep till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the morning-watch, when, in ſpite of my fears, I was overpowered with ſlumber; though I did not long enjoy this comfortable ſituation, being arouſed with a noiſe ſo loud and ſhrill, that I thought the drums of my ears were burſt by it: this was followed by a dreadful ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons pronounced by a hoarſe voice, which I could not underſtand. While I was debating with myſelf whether or not I ſhould wake my companion, and inquire into the occaſion of this diſturbance, I was informed by one of the quarter maſters, who paſſed by me with a lanthorn in his hand, that the noiſe which alarmed me was occaſioned by the boatſwain's mate who called up the larboard watch, and that I muſt lay my account with ſuch interruption every morning at the ſame hour. Being now more aſſured of my ſafety, I addreſſed myſelf again to reſt, and ſlept till eight o'clock, when riſing, and breakfaſting with my comrades on biſcuit and brandy, the ſick were viſited and aſſiſted as before; after which viſitation, my good friend Thomſon explained and performed another piece of duty, to which I was a ſtranger. At a certain hour in the morning the boy of the meſs went round all the decks, ringing a ſmall hand-bell, and, in rhimes compoſed for the occaſion, invited all thoſe who had ſores to repair

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHILE I was buſied with my friend in this practice, the doctor chanced to paſs by the place where we were, and, ſtopping to obſerve me, appeared very well ſatisfied with my method of application, and afterwards ſent for me to his cabin, where, having examined me touching my ſkill in ſurgery, and the particulars of my fortune, he intereſted himſelf ſo far in my behalf as to promiſe his aſſiſtance in procuring a warrant for me, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had been already found qualified at ſurgeons-hall for the ſtation I filled on board; and in this good office he the more cordially engaged, when he underſtood I was a nephew to Lieutenant Bowling, for whom he expreſſed a particular regard. In the mean time I could learn from his diſcourſe, that he did not intend to go to ſea again with Captain Oakhum, having, as he thought, been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently uſed by him during the laſt voyage.</p>
                     <p>While I lived tolerably eaſy, in expectation of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I was not altogether without mortifications, which I not only ſuffered from the rude inſults of the ſailors and petty officers, (among whom I was known by the name of <hi>Loblolly boy,</hi>) but alſo from the diſpoſition of Morgan, who, though friendly in the main, was often very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome with his pride, which expected a good deal of ſubmiſſion from me, and delighted in recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands.</p>
                     <p>About ſix weeks after my arrival on board, the ſurgeon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to me, by which I was appointed ſurgeon's third mate on board the Thunder. This he had procured by his intereſt at the navy-office, as alſo another for himſelf, by virtue of which he was removed into a ſecond rate. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his kindneſs in the ſtrongeſt terms my gratitude could ſuggeſt, and profeſſed my ſorrow at the proſpect of loſing ſo valuable a friend, to whom I hoped to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended myſelf ſtill farther by my reſpectful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent behaviour. But his generoſity reſted not here; for, before he left the ſhip, he made me a preſent of a che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t and ſome clothes, that enabled me to ſupport the rank to which he had raiſed me. I found my ſpirit revive with my good fortune; and, now I was an officer, reſolved to maintain the dignity of my ſtation againſt all oppoſition or affronts; nor was it long before I had occaſion to exert my reſolution; my old enemy, the midſhipman, (whoſe name was Crampley) entertaining an implacable animoſity againſt me for the diſgrace he had ſuffered on my account, had ſince that time taken all opportunities of reviling and ridiculing me, when I was not entitled to retort this bad uſage—and even after I had been rated on the books, and muſtered as ſurgeon's mate, did not think fit to reſtrain his inſolence. In particular, being one day preſent, while I dreſſed a wound in a ſailor's leg, he began to ſing a ſong, which I thought highly injurious to the honour of my country, and therefore ſignified my reſentment by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that the Scots always laid their account with finding enemies among the ignorant, inſignificant, and malicious. This unexpected piece of aſſurance enraged him to ſuch a degree, that he lent me a blow on the face, which I verily thought had demoliſhed my cheek-bone; I was not ſlow in returning the obligation, and the affair began to be very ſerious, when by accident Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and one of the maſter's mates, coming that way, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and, inquiring into the cauſe, endeavoured to promote a reconciliation; but finding us both exaſperated to the uttermoſt, and bent againſt accommodation, they adviſed us either to leave our difference undecided till we ſhould have an opportunity of terminating it on ſhore like gentlemen, or elſe chuſe a proper place on board, and bring it to an iſſue by boxing. This laſt expedient was greedily embraced by both; and, being forthwith
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:027715_0179_0FD5ECCDE201B428"/>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the ground propoſed, we ſtripped in a moment, and began a very furious conteſt, in which I ſoon found myſelf inferior to my antagoniſt, not ſo much in ſtrength and agility as in ſkill, which he had acquired in the ſchool of Hockley in the Hole and Tottenham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>court. Many croſs-buttocks did I ſuſtain, and pegs on the ſtomach without number, till at laſt, my breath being qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>te gone, as well as my vigour waſted, I grew deſperate; and, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting all my ſtrength in one effort, threw in at once head, hands and feet, with ſuch violence, that I drove my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt three paces backward into the main hatchway, down which he fell; and, pitching upon his head and right ſhoulder, remained without ſenſe and motion. Morgan, looking down, and ſeeing him lie in that condition, cried, <q>Upon my conſcience, as I am a Chriſtian ſinner, (look you,) I believe his pattles are all ofer; but I take you all to witneſs, that there was no treachery in the caſe, and that he has ſuffered by the chance of war.</q> So ſaying, he deſcended to the deck below to examine into the ſituation of my adverſary, and left me very little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with my victory, as I found myſelf not only terribly bruiſed, but likewiſe in danger of being called to account for the death of Crampley: but this fear vaniſhed, when my fellow-mate, having, by bleeding him in the jugular, brought him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o himſelf, and inquired into the ſtate of his body, called up to me, to be under no concern, for the midſhipman had received no other damage than as pretty a luxation of the <hi>os humeri,</hi> as one would deſire to ſee on a ſummer's day. Upon this information I crawled down to the cock-pit, and acquainted Thomſon with the affair, who providing himſelf with bandages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neceſſary for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, went up to aſſiſt Mr. Morgan in the reduction of the diſlocation. When this was ſucceſsfully performed, they wiſhed me joy of the event of the combat, and the Welchman, after obſerving, that in all likelihood the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Scots and Britons were the ſame people, bade me <q>praiſe Got for putting mettle in my pelly, and ſtrength in my limbs to ſupport it.</q> I acquired ſuch reputation by this rencounter, (which laſted twenty minutes,) that every body became more cautious in behaviour towards me, though Crampley, with his arm in a ſling, talked very high, and threatened to ſeize the firſt opportunity of
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:027715_0180_0FD5ECD0D98D6990"/>
retrieving on ſhore the honour he had loſt by an accident, from which I could juſtly claim no merit.</p>
                     <p>About this time Captain Oakhum, having received ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orders, came on board, and brought along with him a ſurgeon of his own country, who ſoon made us ſenſible of the loſs we ſuffered in the departure of Doctor Atkins; for he was groſsly ignorant, and intolerably aſſuming, falſe, vindictive, and unforgiving; a mercileſs tyrant to his inferiors, an abject ſycophant to thoſe above him. In the morning after the captain came on board, our firſt mate, according to cuſtom, went to wait on him with a ſick liſt, which when this grim commander had peruſed, he cried with a ſtern countenance, <q>Blood and oons! ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-one ſick people on board of my ſhip! Harkee, you Sir, I'll have no ſick people on board of my ſhip, by G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>d.</q> The Welchman replied, he ſhould be very glad to find no ſick people on board; but, while it was otherwiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did no more than his duty in preſenting him with a liſt: "You and your liſt may be d—n'd," ſaid the captain, throwing it at him; <q>I ſay there ſhall be no ſick in this ſhip while I have the command of her.</q> Mr. Morgan, being nettled at this treatment, told him, his indignation ought to be directed to Got Almighty, who viſited his people with diſtempers, and not to him, who contributed all in his power towards their cure. The baſhaw, not being uſed to ſuch behaviour in any of his officers, was enraged to fury at this ſatirical inſinuation, and, ſtamping with his foot, called him inſolent ſcoundrel, threatening to have him pinioned to the deck, if he ſhould preſume to utter another ſyllable. But the blood of Caractacus, being thoroughly heated, diſdained to be reſtricted by ſuch a command, and began to manifeſt itſelf in—<q>Captain Oakhum, I am a ſhentleman of birth and parentage, (look you,) and peradventure I am moreover—</q> Here his harangue was broke off by the captain's ſteward, who, being Morgan's countryman, hurried him out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin before he had time to exaſperate his maſter to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree; and this would certainly have been the caſe; for the indignant Welchman could hardly be hindered, by his friend's arguments and entreaties, from re-entering the preſence-chamber, and defying Captain Oakhum to his teeth. He was, however, appeaſed at length, and came down to the birth, where, finding Thomſon and me at
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:027715_0181_0FD5ECD268DB2AE0"/>
work preparing medicines, he bade us leave off our labour, and go to play; for the captain, by his ſole word and power, and command, had driven ſickneſs a-pegging to the tevil, and there was no more malady on board. So ſaying, he drank off a gill of brandy, ſighed grievouſly three times, poured forth an ejaculation of <q>Got bleſs my heart, liver, and lungs!</q> and then began to ſing a Welch ſong with great earneſtneſs of viſage, voice, and geſture. I could not conceive the meaning of this ſingular phenomenon, and ſaw by the looks of Thomſon, who at the ſame time ſhook his head, that he ſuſpected poor Cadwallader's brains were unſettled. He, perceiving our amazement, told us he would explain the myſtery, but at the ſame time bade us take notice, that he had lived poy, patchelor, married man, and widower, almoſt forty years, and in all that time there was no man or mother's ſon in the whole world, who durſt uſe him ſo ill as Captain Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum had done. Then he acquainted us with the dialogue that paſſed between them, as I have already related it, and had no ſooner finiſhed this narration than he received a meſſage from the ſurgeon to bring the ſick liſt to the quarter-deck, for the captain had ordered all the patients thither to be reviewed. This inhuman order ſhocked us extremely, as we knew it would be impoſſible to carry ſome of them on the deck, without imminent danger of their lives; but, as we likewiſe knew it would be to no purpoſe for us to remonſtrate againſt it, we repaired to the quarter-deck in a body to ſee this extraordinary muſter; Morgan obſerving by the way, that the captain was going to ſend to the other world a great many evidences to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy againſt himſelf. When we appeared upon deck, the captain bade the doctor, who ſtood bowing at his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, look at theſe lazy lubberly ſons of bitches, who were good for nothing on board but to eat the king's proviſion, and encourage idleneſs in the ſkulkers; the ſurgeon grinned approbation, and, taking the liſt, began to examine the complaints of each as they could crawl to the place appointed. The firſt who came under his cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance was a poor fellow juſt freed of a fever, which had weakened him ſo much, that he could hardly ſtand. Mr. Macſhane (for that was the doctor's name) having felt his pulſe, proteſted he was as well as any man in the world,

and the captain delivered him over to the boatſwain's mate, with orders that he ſhould receive a round dozen at the gangway immediately, for counterfeiting himſelf ſick; but, before the diſcipline could be executed, the man dropped down on the deck, and had well nigh periſhed under the hands of the execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The third complained of a pleuretic ſtitch, and ſpitting of blood, for which Doctor Machſhane preſcribed exerciſe at the pump, to promote expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but whether this was improper for one in his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that it was uſed to exceſs, I know not, but in leſs than half an hour he was ſuffocated with a deluge of blood that iſſued from his lungs. A fourth with much difficulty climbed to the quarter-deck, being loaded with a monſtrous aſcites or dropſy that invaded his cheſt ſo much, that he could ſcarce fetch his breath; but his diſeaſe being interpreted into fat, occaſioned by idleneſs and exceſs of eating, he was ordered, with a view to promote perſpiration and inlarge his cheſt, to go aloft immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it was in vain for this unwieldy wretch to alledge his utter incapacity; the boatſwain's driver was commanded to whip him up with the cat and nine tails: the ſmart of this application made him exert himſelf ſo much, that he actually arrived at the puttock-ſhrouds; but when the enormous weight of his body had nothing elſe to ſupport it than his weakened arms, either out of ſpite or neceſſity, he quitted his hold, and plunged into the ſea, where he muſt have been drowned, had not a ſailor, who was in a boat along-ſide, ſaved his life, by keeping him afloat, till he was hoiſted on board by a tackle. It would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and diſagreeable to deſcribe the fate of every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable object that ſuffered by the inhumanity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the captain and ſurgeon, who ſo wantonly ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the lives of their fellow creatures. Many were brought up in the height of fevers, and rendered delirious by the injuries they ſuffered by the way. Some gave up the
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:027715_0183_0FD5ECD631893A88"/>
ghoſt in the preſence of their inſpectors; and others who were ordered to their duty, languiſhed a few days at work, among their fellows, and then departed without any ceremony. On the whole, the number of ſick was reduced to leſs than a dozen; and the authors of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction were applauding themſelves for the ſervice they had done to their king and country, when the boatſwain's mate informed his honour, that there was a man below laſhed to his hammock by the direction of the doctor's mate, and that he begged hard to be releaſed; affirming, that he had been ſo maltreated only for a grudge Mr. Morgan bore him, and that he was as much in his ſenſes as any man aboard.—The captain hearing this, darted a ſevere look at the Welchman, and ordered the man to be brought up immediately: upon which Morgan proteſted with great fervency, that the perſon in queſtion was as mad as a March hare; and begged for the love of Got, they would at leaſt keep his arms pinioned during his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, to prevent him from doing miſchief.—This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the commander granted for his own ſake, and the patient was produced, who inſiſted on his being in his right wits, with ſuch calmneſs and ſtrength of argument, that every body preſent was inclined to believe him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Morgan, who affirmed there was no truſting to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, for he himſelf had been ſo much impoſed upon by his behaviour two days before, that he had actually unbound him with his own hands, and had well nigh been murdered for his pains: this was confirmed by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one of the waiters, who declared, he had pulled this patient from the doctor's mate, whom he had gotten down and almoſt ſtrangled. To this the man anſwered, that the witneſs was a creature of Morgan's, and was ſuborned to give his teſtimony againſt him by the malice of the mate, whom the defendant had affronted, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to the people on board that Mr. Morgan's wife kept a gin ſhop in Rag-fair.—This anecdote produced a laugh at the expence of the Welchman, who, ſhaking his head with ſome emotion, ſaid—<q>Ay, ay, 'tis no matter—Got knows it is an arrant falſehood.</q>—Captain Oakhum, without any further heſitation, ordered the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be unfettered; at the ſame time threatening to make Morgan exchange ſituations with him for his ſpite;

but the Briton no ſooner heard the deciſion in favour of the madman, than he got up the mizen-ſhrouds, crying to Thomſon and me to get out of his reach, for we ſhould ſee him play the devil with a vengeance. We did not think fit to diſregard his caution, and accordingly got up on the poop, whence we beheld the maniac, (as ſoon as he was releaſed,) fly at the captain like a fury, crying, <q>I'll let you know, you ſcoundrel, that I am commander of this veſſel,</q> and pummel him without mercy. The ſurgeon, who went to the aſſiſtance of his patron, ſhared the ſame fate; and it was with the utmoſt difficulty, that he was maſtered at laſt, after having done great execution among thoſe who oppoſed him.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE captain was carried into his cabin, ſo enraged with the treatment he had received, that he ordered the fellow to be brought before him, that he might have the pleaſure of piſtoling him with his own hand; and would certainly have ſatisfied his revenge in this manner, had not the firſt lieutenant remonſtrated againſt it, by obſerving, that in all appearance the fellow was not mad, but deſperate; that he had been hired by ſome enemy of the captain to aſſaſſinate him, and therefore ought to be kept in irons till he could be brought to a court-martial, which, no doubt, would ſift the affair to the bottom, (by which means important diſcoveries might be made,) and then ſentence the criminal to a death adequate to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits.—This ſuggeſtion, improbable as it was, had the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:027715_0185_0FD5ECD85BDEFE98"/>
deſired effect upon the captain, being exactly calculated for the meridian of his intellects; more eſpecially, as Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Macſhane eſpouſed this opinion, in conſequence of his previous declaration that the man was not mad.—Morgan finding there was no more damage done, could not help diſcovering by his countenance, the pleaſure he enjoyed on this occaſion; and while he bathed the doctor's face with an embrocation, ventured to aſk him, Whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board? But he would have been wiſer in containing this ſally, which his patient carefully laid up in his memory, to be taken notice of at a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it ſeaſon.—Meanwhile we weighed anchor, and on our way to the Downs, the madman, who was treated as a priſoner, took an opportunity, while the centinel attended him at the head, to leap over-board, and fruſtrate the revenge of the captain.—We ſtaid not long at the Downs, but took the benefit of the firſt eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly wind to go round to Spithead; where having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on board proviſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It was not without great mortification I ſaw myſelf on the point of being tranſported to ſuch a diſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy climate, deſtitute of every convenience that could render ſuch a voyage ſupportable, and under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of an arbitrary tyrant, whoſe command was almoſt intolerable. However, as theſe complaints were common to a great many on board, I reſolved to ſubmit patiently to my fate, and contrive to make myſelf as eaſy as the nature of the caſe would allow.—We got out of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel with a proſperous breeze, which died away, leaving us becalmed about fifty leagues to the weſtward of the Lizard; but this ſtate of inaction did no laſt long; for next night our main-top-ſail was ſplit by the wind, which in the morning increaſed to a hurricane.—I was wakened by a moſt horrible din, occaſioned by the play of the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages upon the decks above, the cracking of cabins, the howling of the wind through the ſhrouds, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſe of the ſhip's crew, the pipes of the boatſwain and his mates, the trumpets of the lieutenants, and the clanking of the chain-pumps—Morgan, who had never been at ſea before, turned out in a great hurry, crying,

                        <q>Cot have mercy and compaſſion upon us? I believe we have got upon the confines of Lucifer and the d—ned!</q>—while poor Thomſon lay quaking in his hammock, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up petitions to heaven for our ſafety.—I roſe and joined the Welchman with whom, (after having forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ourſelves with brandy,) I went above; but if my ſenſe of hearing was ſtartled before, how muſt my ſight have been appalled in beholding the effects of the ſtorm! The ſea was ſwelled into billows mountain-high, on the top of which our ſhip ſometimes hung, as if it was to be precipitated to the abyſs below! Sometimes we ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two waves that roſe on each ſide higher than our top-maſt head, and threatened, by daſhing together, to overwhelm us in a moment! Of all our fleet, conſiſting of a hundred and fifty ſail, ſcarce twelve appeared, and theſe driving under their bare poles, at the mercy of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt. At length the maſt of one of them gave way, and tumbled over-board with a hideous craſh! Nor was the proſpect in our own ſhip much more agreeable; a number of officers and ſailors ran backward and forward with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction in their looks, hallooing to one another, and undetermined what they ſhould attend to firſt. Some clung to the yards, endeavouring to unbend the ſails that were ſplit into a thouſand pieces, flapping in the wind; others tried to furl thoſe which were yet whole, while the maſts, at every pitch, bent and quivered like twigs, as if they would have ſhivered into innumerable ſplinters!—While I conſidered this ſcene with equal terror and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, one of the main-braces broke, by the ſhock, whereof two ſailors were flung from the yard's arm into the ſea, where they periſhed, and poor Jack Rattlin was thrown down upon the deck, at the expence of a broken leg. Morgan and I ran immediately to his aſſiſtance, and found a ſplinter of the ſhin-bone thruſt, by the violence of the fall, through the ſkin: as this was a caſe of too great conſequence to be treated without the authority of the doctor, I went down to his cabin to inform him of the accident, as well as to bring up dreſſings, which we always kept ready prepared.—I entered his apartment without any ceremony, and, by the glimmering of a lamp, perceived him on his knees, before ſomething that very much reſembled a crucifix; but this I will
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:027715_0187_0FD5ECDCD8883278"/>
not inſiſt upon, that I may not ſeem too much a ſlave to common report, which indeed aſſiſted my conjecture on this occaſion, by repreſenting Dr. Macſhane as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the church of Rome.—Be this as it will, he got up in a ſort of confuſion, occaſioned (I ſuppoſe) by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed in his devotion, and in a trice ſnatched the ſubject of my ſuſpicion from my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When I ſignified to the boatſwain the doctor's deſire, he ſwore a terrible oath that he could not ſpare one man from the deck, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he expected the maſt would go by the board every minute.—This piece of information did not at all contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to my peace of mind; however, as my friend Rattlin complained very much, with the aſſiſtance of Morgan, I ſupported him to the lower deck, whither Mr. Macſhane, after much entreaty, ventured to come, attended by Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with a box full of dreſſings, and his own ſervant, who carried a whole ſet of capital inſtruments.—He examined the fracture and the wound, and, concluding from a livid colour extending itſelf upon the limb, that a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would enſue, reſolved to amputate the leg immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.—This was a dreadful ſentence to the patient, who recruiting himſelf with a quid of tobacco, pronounced with a woeful countenance, <q>What! is there no remedy, doctor? muſt I be dock'd! can't you ſplice it?</q>—"Aſſuredly, Doctor Macſhane," ſaid the firſt mate, <q>with ſubmiſſion, and deference, and veneration to your ſuperior abilities, and opportunities and ſtations, (look you,) I do apprehend, and conjecture, and aver, that there is no occaſion nor neceſſity to ſmite off this poor man's leg.</q> 
                        <q>God Almighty bleſs you, dear Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man!</q> cried Rattlin, <q>may you have fair wind and weather whereſoever you're bound, and come to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in the road of heaven at laſt.</q>—Macſhane, very much incenſed at his mate's differing in opinion from him ſo openly, anſwered, that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to him, and, in a peremptory tone,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:027715_0188_0FD5ECDE81839A90"/>
ordered him to apply the tourniquet. At the ſight of which, Jack ſtarting up, cried, <q>Avaſt, avaſt! d—n my heart, if you clap your nippers on me, till I know wherefore!—Mr. Random, won't you lend a hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaving my precious limb?

ſtanding; upon which I ſnatched up the bone, and levelled it with all my force at him, ſaying, <q>Whoever you are, take that for your curioſity.</q>—It had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect, for we heard the liſtener tumble down, and afterwards crawl to his own cabin—I applauded myſelf much for this feat, which turned out one of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky exploits of my life, Macſhane from that time mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out for deſtruction.—About a week after this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, as I was going my rounds among the ſick, I was taken priſoner, and carried to the poop, by the maſter at arms, where I was loaded with irons, and ſtapled to the deck, on pretence that I was a ſpy on board, and had conſpired againſt the captain's life.—How ridiculous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this imputation was, I did not fail to ſuffer by it all the rigour that could be ſhewn to the worſt of criminals, being expoſed in this miſerable condition to the ſcorching heat of the ſun by day, and the unwholeſome damps by night, during the ſpace of twelve days, in which I was neither brought to trial, nor examined touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of my charge.—I had no ſooner recovered the uſe of my reflection, which had been quite overthrown by this accident, than I ſent for Thomſon, who, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling me on the occaſion, hinted, that I owed this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to the hatred of the doctor, who had given an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt me to the captain, in conſequence of which I was arreſted, and all my papers ſeized.—While I was curſing my capricious fate, I ſaw Morgan aſcend the poop, guarded by two corporals, who made him ſit down by me, that he might be pinioned in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine.—Notwithſtanding my ſituation, I could ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from laughing at the countenance of my fellow-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, who, without ſpeaking one word, allowed his feet to be incloſed in the rings provided for that purpoſe; but when they pretended to faſten him on his back, he grew outrageous, and, drawing a large couteau from his ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocket, threatened to rip up the belly of the firſt man that ſhould approach him, in order to treat him in ſuch an unworthy manner.—They were preparing to uſe him very roughly, when the lieutenant on the quarter-deck called out to them to let him remain as he was.—He then crept towards me, and taking me by the hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

who ſat by us trembling, with a pale viſage, told him, there were two more rings for his feet, and he ſhould be glad to find him in ſuch good company.—But it was not the intention of our adverſary to include the ſecond mate in our fate; him he excepted to be his drudge in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick, and, if poſſible, his evidence againſt us: with this view he ſounded him afar off, but finding his integrity incorruptible, harraſſed him ſo much out of ſpite, that in a ſhort time this mild creature grew weary of his life.</p>
                     <p>While I and my fellow-priſoner comforted each other in our tribulation, the admiral diſcovered four ſail to leeward, and made ſignal for our ſhip and four more to give chace: hereupon every thing was cleared for an engagement, and Macſhane, foreſeeing he ſhould have occaſion for more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants than one, obtained Morgan's liberty; while I was left in this deplorable poſture to the chance of battle.—It was almoſt dark when we came up with the ſternmoſt chace, which we hailed, and inquired who they were; they gave us to underſtand they were French men of war, upon which Captain Oakhum commanded them to ſend their boat on board of him; but they refuſed, telling him, if he had any buſineſs with them, to come on board their ſhip: he then threatened to pour in a board ſide upon them, which they promiſed to return.—Both ſides were as good as their word, and the engagement began with great fury.—The reader may gueſs how I paſſed my time, lying in this helpleſs ſituation, amidſt the terrors of a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

towards me, aſked if I was wounded, and before I could anſwer, received a great ſhot in his belly which tore out his entrails, and he fell flat on my breaſt.—This accident entirely bereft me of all diſcretion: I redoubled my cries, which were drowned in the noiſe of the battle; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf diſregarded, loſt all patience, and became fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic: I vented my rage in oaths and execrations, till my ſpirits being quite exhauſted, I remained quiet and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the load that oppreſſed me. The engagement laſted till broad day, when Captain Oakhum, finding he was like to gain neither honour nor advantage by the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, pretended to be undeceived by ſeeing their colours; and hailing the ſhip with whom he had fought all night, proteſted he believed them Spaniards, and the guns being ſilenced on each ſide, ordered the barge to be hoiſted out, and went on board of the French commodore.—Our loſs amounted to ten killed, and eighteen wounded, moſt part of whom afterwards died.—My fellow-mates had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſpatched their buſineſs in the cock-pit, than full of friendly concern they came to viſit me.—Morgan aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt, and ſeeing my face almoſt covered with brains and blood, concluded I was no longer a man for this world; and, calling to Thomſon with great emotion, bade him come up, and take his laſt farewel of his comrade and countryman, who was poſting to a petter place, where there were no Macſhanes nor Oakhums to aſperſe and torment him.—"No," ſaid he, taking me by the hand, <q>you are going to a country where there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the authors of our miſery; but our diſcourſe being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard by the centinel who guarded me, he was no ſooner relieved, than he reported to the captain every ſyllable of our converſation, according to the orders he had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the effect of this information ſoon appeared in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the maſter at arms, who replaced Morgan in his former ſtation; and gave the ſecond mate a caution to keep a ſtrict guard over his tongue, if he did not chuſe to accompany us in our confinement.—Thomſon foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the whole ſlavery of attending the ſick and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as the cruelty of Macſhane, muſt now fall upon his ſhoulders, grew deſperate at the proſpect, and, though I never heard him ſwear before, imprecated dreadful cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the heads of his oppreſſors, declaring that he would rather quit life altogether, than be much longer under the power of ſuch barbarians.—I was not a little ſtartled at his vivacity, and endeavoured to alleviate his complaints, by repreſenting the ſubject of my own, with as much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation as it would bear, by which compariſon he might ſee the balance of misfortune lay on my ſide, and take an example from me of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thomſon liſtened attentively to what we ſaid, and at laſt, ſhedding a flood of tears, ſhook his head, and left us without making any reply.—About eleven at night he came to ſee us again, with a ſettled gloom on his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and gave us to underſtand that he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone exceſſive toil ſince he ſaw us, and, in recompence, had been groſsly abuſed by the doctor, who taxed him with being confederate with us, in a deſign of taking away his life and that of the captain.

                        <p>We lament the fate of our companion—the captain offers Morgan his liberty, which he refuſes to accept—we are brought before him and examined—Morgan is ſent back into cuſtody, whither alſo I am remanded, after a curious trial.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE news of this event affected my fellow-priſoner and me extremely, as our unfortunate companion had juſtly acquired, by his amiable diſpoſition, the love and eſteem of us both; and the more we regretted his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fate, the greater horror we conceived for the villain who was undoubtedly the occaſion of it. This abandoned miſcreant did not diſcover the leaſt ſymptom of concern for Thomſon's death, although he muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelf of having driven him by ill uſage to that fatal reſolution; but deſired the captain to ſet Morgan at liberty again to look after the patients. Accordingly, one of the corporals was ſent up to unfetter him; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he would not be releaſed until he ſhould know for what he was confined, nor would he be a tennis-ball, nor a ſhuttle-cock, nor a trudge, nor a ſcullion, to any captain under the ſun. Oakhum, finding him obſtinate, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it would not be in his power to exerciſe his tyranny much longer with impunity, was willing to ſhew ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of juſtice, and therefore ordered us both to be brought before him on the quarter-deck, where he ſat in ſtate, with his clerk on one ſide, and his counſellor Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhane on the other. When we approached, he honoured us with this ſalutation—<q>So, gentlemen, damn my blood! many a captain in the navy would have ordered you both to be tuck'd up to the yard's arm, without either judge or jury, for the crimes you have been guilty of; but, damn my blood, I have too much good nature in

So may the farmer hang his kids for his diverſion, and amuſement, and mirth; but there is ſuch a thing as juſtice, if not upon earth, ſurely in heaven, that will puniſh with fire and primſtone all thoſe that take away the lives of innocent people out of wantonneſs and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity, (look you)—In the mean time I ſhall be glad to know the crimes laid to my charge, and ſee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who accuſes me.</q>—"That you ſhall," ſaid the captain: "here, doctor, what have you to ſay?"—Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhane, ſtepping forward, hemmed a good while in order to clear his throat; and, before he began, Morgan accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thus: <q>Doctor Macſhane, look in my face—look in the face of an honeſt man, who abhors a falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he abhors the tevil, and Got be judge between you and me.</q>—The doctor, not minding this conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made the following ſpeech as near as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: <q>I'll tell you what, Mr. Morgan, to be ſure what you ſay is juſt, in regard to an honeſt man; and, if ſo be it appears as how you are an honeſt man, then it is my opinion, that you deſerve to be acquitted in relation to that there affair; for I tell you what, Captain Oak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum is reſolved for to do every body juſtice.—As for my own part, all that I have to alledge is, that I have been informed you have ſpoken diſreſpectful words againſt your captain, who to be ſure is the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and generous commander in the king's ſervice, without aſparagement or acceptation of man, woman, or child.</q> Having uttered this elegant harangue, on which he ſeemed to plume himſelf, Morgan replied, <q>I do partly gueſs and conceive, and underſtand your meaning, which I wiſh could be more explicit; but, however, I do ſuppoſe I am not to be condemned upon bare hearſay, or, if I am convicted of ſpeaking diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully of Captain Oakhum, I hope there is no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in my words.</q>—<q>But there's mutiny, by God, and that's death by the articles of war,</q> cried Oakhum.—

"In the mean time, let the witneſſes be called." Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Macſhane's ſervant appeared, and the boy of our meſs, whom they had ſeduced and tutored for the purpoſe. The firſt declared, that Morgan, as he deſcended the cockpit-ladder one day, curſed the captain, and called him a ſavage beaſt, ſaying, he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind.—"This," ſaid the clerk, <q>is a ſtrong preſumption of a deſign formed againſt the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's life.—For why? it preſuppoſes malice afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought, and a criminal intention <hi>a priori.</hi>
                        </q>—"Right," ſaid the captain to this miſerable grub who had been an attorney's boy; <q>you ſhall have law enough; here's Cook and Littlejohn for it.</q> This evidence was confirmed by the boy, who affirmed he heard the firſt mate ſay, that the captain had no more bowels than a bear, and the ſurgeon had no more brains than an aſs. Then the centinel who heard our diſcourſe on the poop was examined, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the court, that the Welchman aſſured me Captain Oakhum and Doctor Macſhane would toſs upon billows of burning brimſtone in hell for their barbarity. The clerk obſerved, that there was an evident prejudication, which confirmed the former ſuſpicion of a conſpiracy againſt the life of Captain Oakhum; for, becauſe, how could Morgan ſo poſitively pronounce that the captain and ſurgeon would be damned, unleſs he had an intention to make away with them before they could have time to repent? This ſage explanation had great weight with our noble commander, who exclaimed, <q>What have you to ſay to this, Taffy? you ſeem to be taken all a-back, brother, hah!</q> Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan was too much of a gentleman to diſown the text, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he abſolutely denied the truth of the comment: upon which the captain, ſtrutting up to him with a fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious countenance, ſaid, <q>So, Mr. ſon of a bitch, you confeſs you honoured me with the names of bear and beaſt, and pronounced my damnation! Damn my heart! I have a good mind to have you brought to a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martial and hanged, you dog.</q> Here Macſhane, having occaſion for an aſſiſtant, interpoſed, and begged the captain to pardon Mr. Morgan, with his wonted goodneſs, upon condition that he the delinquent ſhould make ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as the nature of his miſdemeanour demanded: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Cambro-Briton, who on this occaſion would

have made no ſubmiſſion to the Great Mogul ſurrounded by all his guards, thanked the doctor for his mediation, and acknowledged himſelf in the wrong for calling the image of Got a peaſt; "but," ſaid he, <q>I ſpoke by metaphor, and parable, and compariſon, and types; as we ſignify meekneſs by a lamb, letchery by a goat, and craftineſs by a fox, ſo we liken ignorance to an aſs, and brutality to a bear, and fury to a tyger; therefore I made uſe of theſe ſimilies to expreſs my ſentiments, (look you;) and what I ſaid before Got I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay before man or peaſt neither.</q> Oakhum was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at this inſolence, (as he termed it,) that he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his clerk to proceed on the examination of me. The firſt queſtion put to me was touching the place of my nativity, which I declared to be the north of Scotland. "The north of Ireland more like," cried the captain; "but we ſhall bring you up preſently."

"You ſay you are a Proteſtant," ſaid the clerk; <q>make the ſign of the croſs with your finger ſo, and ſwear upon it to that affirmation.</q> When I was about to perform this ceremony, the captain cried with ſome emotion, <q>No, no, damme! I'll have no profanation neither—But go on with your interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</q>—"Well then," proceeded my examiner, how many ſacraments are there?" To which I replied, "Two."—"What are they?" ſaid he. I anſwered, "Baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper."—And ſo you would "explode confirmation and marriage altogether?" ſaid Oakhum. "I thought this fellow was a rank Roman." The clerk, though he was bred under an attorney, could not refrain from bluſhing at this blunder, which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal, by obſerving, that theſe decoys would not do with me, who ſeemed to be an old offender. He went on with aſking, if I believed in tranſubſtantiation;
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:027715_0198_0FD5ECF4D8B856B0"/>
but I treated the notion of a real preſence with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect, that his patron was ſcandalized at my impiety, and commanded him to proceed to the plot: whereupon this miſerable pettifogger told me, there was great reaſon to ſuſpect me of being a ſpy on board, and that I had entered into a conſpiracy with Thomſon, and others not yet detected, againſt the life of Captain Oakhum: which accuſation they pretended to ſupport by the evidence of our boy, who declared he had often heard the deceaſed Thomſon and me whiſpering together, and could diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the words, "Oakhum, raſcal, poiſon, piſtol:" by which expreſſions it appeared, we did intend to uſe ſiniſter means to accompliſh his deſtruction—That the death of Thomſon ſeemed to confirm this conjecture, who, either feeling the ſtings of remorſe for being engaged in ſuch a horrid confederacy, or fearing a diſcovery, by which he muſt have infallibly ſuffered an ignominious death, had put a fatal period to his own exiſtence—But what eſtabliſhed the truth of the whole, was a book in cyphers found among my papers, which exactly tallied with one found in his cheſt after his diſappearance: this, he obſerved, was a preſumption very near proof poſitive, and would determine any jury in Chriſtendom to find me guilty. In my own defence I alledged, that I had been dragged on board at firſt very much againſt my inclination, as I could prove by the evidence of ſome people now in the ſhip, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could have no deſign of becoming a ſpy at that time, and ever ſince had been entirely out of the reach of any correſpondence that could juſtly entail that ſuſpicion upon me—As for the conſpiring againſt my captain's life, it could not be ſuppoſed, that any man in his right wits would harbour the leaſt thought of ſuch an undertaking, which he could not poſſibly perform without certain infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ruin to himſelf, even if he had all the inclination in the world—That allowing the boy's evidence to be true, (which I affirmed was falſe and malicious,) nothing concluſive could be gathered from a few incoherent words: neither was the fate of Mr. Thomſon a circumſtance more favourable for the charge; for I had in my pocket a letter which too well explained that myſtery in a very different manner from that which was ſuppoſed: with theſe words I produced the following letter, which Jack Rattlin

The captain and clerk declared themſelves of the ſame opinion, although I inſiſted on having the remains of it compared with other writings of Thomſon which they had in their poſſeſſion; and I was ordered to anſwer the laſt article of my accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, the book of cyphers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"That is eaſily done," ſaid I. <q>What you are pleaſed to call cyphers are no other than the Greek characters, in which, for my amuſement, I kept a diary of every thing remarkable, that has occurred to my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation ſince the beginning of the voyage till the day on which I was put in irons; and the ſame method was practiſed by Mr. Thomſon, who copied mine.</q>—<q>A very likely ſtory!</q> cried Macſhane; <q>what occaſion was there for uſing Greek characters, if you were not afraid of diſcovering what you had wrote?—But what

d'ye talk of Greek characters?—D'ye think I am ſo ignorant of the Greek language as not to diſtinguiſh its letters from theſe, which are no more Greek than Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe? No, no, I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for you, nor none that ever came from your country.</q> So ſaying, with an unparalleled effrontery, he repeated ſome gibberiſh which by the ſound ſeemed to be Iriſh, and made it paſs for Greek with the captain, who, looking at me with a contemptuous ſneer, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, "Ah, ha! have you caught a Tartar?" I could not help ſmiling at the conſummate aſſurance of this Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, and offered to refer the diſpute to any body on board who underſtood the Greek alphabet: upon which Morgan was brought back, and, being made acquainted with the affair, took the book, and read a whole page in Engliſh without heſitation, deciding the controverſy in my favour. The doctor was ſo far from being out of countenance at this detection, that he affirmed Morgan was in the ſecret, and repeated from his own invention. Oakhum ſaid, "Ay, ay, I ſee they are both in a ſtory," and diſmiſſed my fellow-mate to his cock-loft, although I propoſed that he and I ſhould read and tranſlate ſeparately any chapter or verſe in the Greek Teſtament in his poſſeſſion, by which it would appear whether we or the ſurgeon ſpoke truth. Not being endued with eloquence enough to convince the captain, that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this expedient, I begged to be examined by ſome uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned perſon on board who underſtood Greek: according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole ſhip's company, officers and all, were called upon deck, among whom it was proclaimed, that, if any of them could ſpeak Greek, he or they ſo qualified ſhould aſcend the quarter deck immediately. After ſome pauſe, two foremaſt men came up and profeſſed their ſkill in that language, which (they ſaid) they acquired during ſeveral voyages to the Levant among the Greeks of the Morea. The captain exulted much in this declaration, and put my journal-book into the hands of one of them, who candidly owned he could neither read nor write; the other acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the ſame degree of ignorance, but pretended to ſpeak the Greek lingo with any man on board, and, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to me, pronounced ſome ſentences of a barbarous corrupted language which I did not underſtand,

I aſſerted, that the modern Greek was as different from that ſpoke and written by the ancients as the Engliſh uſed now from the old Saxon ſpoke in the time of Hengiſt; and as I had only learned the true original tongue, in which Homer, Pindar, the evangeliſts, and other great men of antiquity wrote, it could not be ſuppoſed, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I had no ſooner uttered theſe words than the ſurgeon, knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman, accoſted him in Iriſh, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the ſame brogue; when a dialogue enſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which they affirmed to be in Greek, after having ſecured the ſecrecy of the other tar, who had his cue, in the language of the Morea, from his compani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>MEAN while, a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks, the one, to be revenged of the other, came and diſcovered to us the myſtery of Macſhane's dialogue, as I have explained it above. This detection coming to the ears of the doctor, who was ſenſible that (now we were in ſight of Jamaica) we ſhould have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of clearing ourſelves before a court-martial, and at the ſame time of making his malice and ignorance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, he interceded for us with the captain ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that in a few hours we were ſet at liberty, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to return to our duty. This was a happy event for me, my whole body being bliſtered by the ſun, and my limbs benumbed by want of motion: but I could ſcarce perſuade the Welchman to accept of this indulgence, he perſiſting in his obſtinacy to remain in irons, until he ſhould be diſcharged by a court-martial, which he believed would alſo do him juſtice on his enemies; at length I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him the precarious iſſue of a trial, the power and intereſt of his adverſaries, and flattered his revenge with the hope of wreaking his reſentment with his own hands upon Macſhane after our return to England. This laſt argument had more weight with him than all the reſt, and prevailed upon him to repair with me to the cockpit, which I no ſooner entered than the idea of my departed friend preſented itſelf to my remembrance, and filled my eyes with tears. We diſcharged from our meſs the boy who had acted ſo per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The keys of our cheſts and lockers being ſent to us by the doctor, we detained the meſſenger until we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the contents; and my fellow-mate, finding all his Cheſhire cheeſe conſumed to a cruſt, his brandy exhauſted, and his onions gone, was ſeized with a fit of choler, which he diſcharged on Macſhane's man in oaths and exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>tions, threatening to proſecute him as a thief. The fellow ſwore in his turn, that he never had the keys in his poſſeſſion till that time, when he received them from his maſter, with orders to deliver them to us. "As Got is my judge," cried Morgan, <q>and my ſalfation, and my witneſs, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has pilfered my proviſions is a louſy, peggarly, raſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally knave! and by the ſoul of my grandſire! I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach, and accuſe, and indict him of a roppery, if I did but know who he is.</q> Had this misfortune happened at ſea, where we could not repair the loſs, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity this deſcendant of Caractacus would have loſt his wits entirely; but, when I obſerved how eaſy it would be to remedy this paltry miſchance, he became more calm, and reconciled himſelf to the occaſion. A little while after this tranſport, the ſurgeon came into the birth under pretence of taking ſomething out of the medicine-cheſt, and with a ſmiling aſpect wiſhed us joy of our deliverance, which (he ſaid) he had been at great pains to obtain of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who was very juſtly incenſed at our behaviour; but he (the doctor) had paſſed his word for our future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and he hoped we ſhould give him no cauſe to repent of his kindneſs—He expected, no doubt, an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from us for his pretended ſervice, as well as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral amneſty of what was paſt; but he had to do with people who were not quite ſo apt to forgive injuries as he imagined, or to forget that, if our deliverance was owing to his mediation, our calamity was occaſioned by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: I therefore ſat ſilent while my companion anſwered, <q>Ay, ay, 'tis no matter—Got knows the heart—<hi>There is a time for all things,</hi> as the wiſe man ſaith; <hi>there is a time for throwing away ſtones, and a time to gather them up again.</hi>

Be this as it will, we ſailed from Jamaica, and, in ten days or a fortnight, beat up againſt the wind as ſar as the iſle of Vache, with an intention, as was ſaid, to attack the French fleet, then ſuppoſed to be lying near that place; but, before we arrived, they had ſailed for Europe, having firſt diſpatched an advice-boat to Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena with an account of our being in thoſe ſeas, as alſo of our ſtrength and deſtination. We loitered here ſome days longer taking in wood and brackiſh water, in the uſe whereof, however, our admiral ſeemed to conſult the health of the men by reſtricting each to a quart a-day. At length we ſet ſail, and arrived in a bay to the windward of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena, where we came to an anchor, and lay at our eaſe ten days longer. Here again, certain malicious people take occaſion to blame the conduct of their ſuperiors by ſaying, that, in ſo doing, they not only unprofitably waſted time which was very precious, conſidering the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the rainy ſeaſon, but alſo allowed the Spaniards to recollect themſelves from the terror occaſioned by the approach of an Engliſh fleet, at leaſt three times as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous as ever appeared in that part of the world before. But, if I might be allowed to give my opinion of the matter, I would aſcribe this delay to the generoſity of our chiefs, who ſcorned to take any advantage, that fortune might give them, even over an enemy. At laſt, however, we weighed, and anchored again ſomewhat nearer the harbour's mouth, where we made ſhift to land our marines, who encamped on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

which knocked a good many of them on the head. This piece of conduct in chuſing a camp under the walls of an enemy's fortification, which I believe never happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was practiſed, I preſume, with a view of accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoldiers to ſtand fire, who were not as yet much uſed to diſcipline, moſt of them having been taken from the plough-tail a few months before. This expedient again has furniſhed matter for cenſure againſt the miniſtry for ſending a few raw recruits on ſuch an important en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, while ſo many veteran regiments lay inactive at home: but ſurely our governors had their reaſons for ſo doing, which poſſibly may be diſcloſed with other ſecrets of the deep. Perhaps they were loth to riſk their beſt troops on ſuch deſperate ſervice; or the colonels and field-officers of the old corps, who, generally ſpeaking, enjoyed their commiſſions as ſinecures or penſions for ſome domeſtic ſervices tendered to the court, refuſed to embark in ſuch a dangerous and precarious undertaking, for which refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, no doubt, they are to be much commended.</p>

                     <p>OUR forces being landed and ſtationed, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, ſet about erecting a faſcine batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cannonade the principal fort of the enemy, and, in ſomething more than three weeks, it was ready to open. That we might do the Spaniards as much honour as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it was determined in a council of war, that five of our largeſt ſhips ſhould attack the fort on one ſide, while the battery, ſtrengthened by two mortars and twenty-four cohorns, ſhould ply it on the other.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, the ſignal for our ſhip to engage, among others, was hoiſted, we being advertiſed the night before, to make every thing clear for that purpoſe: and in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a difference happened between Captain Oakhum and

his well-beloved couſin and counſellor Macſhane, which had well nigh terminated in an open rupture.—The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who had imagined there was no more danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt by the enemy's ſhot in the cock-pit than in the centre of the earth, was lately informed that a ſurgeon's mate had been killed in that part of a ſhip, by a cannon ball from two ſmall redoubts that were deſtroyed before the diſembarkation of our ſoldiers; and therefore inſiſted upon having a platform raiſed for the convenience of the ſick and wounded, in the after-hold, where he deemed himſelf more ſecure than on the deck above.—The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, offended at this extraordinary propoſal, accuſed him of puſillanimity, and told him there was no room in the hold for ſuch an occaſion; or if there was, he could not expect to be indulged more than the reſt of the ſurgeons of the navy, who uſed the cockpit for that purpoſe: fear rendered Macſhane obſtinate, he perſiſted in his demand, and ſhewed his inſtructions, by which it was authoriſed: the captain ſwore theſe inſtructions were dictated by a parcel of lazy poltroons who were never at ſea; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was obliged to comply, and ſent for the carpenter to give him orders about it: but before any ſuch meaſure could be taken, our ſignal was thrown out, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor compelled to truſt his carcaſe in the cockpit, where Morgan and I were buſy in putting our inſtruments and dreſſings in order.</p>
                     <p>Our ſhip, with others deſtined for this ſervice, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately weighed, and in leſs than half an hour came to an anchor before the caſtle of Boca Chica, with a ſpring upon our cable—and the cannonading (which indeed was terrible!) began. The ſurgeon, after having croſſed himſelf, fell flat on the deck; and the chaplain and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, who were ſtationed with us, in quality of aſſiſtants, followed his example, while the Welchman and I ſat upon a cheſt looking at one another with great compoſure, ſcarce able to refrain from the like proſtration.—And that the reader may know, it was not a common occaſion that alarmed us thus, I muſt inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that aſtoniſhed us. The fire of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards proceeded from eighty-four great guns, beſides a mortar and ſmall arms in Boca Chica, thirty-ſix in Fort St. Joſeph, twenty in two faſcine batteries, and four men

of war, mounting ſixty-four guns each.—This was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by our land-battery mounted with twenty-one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, two mortars and twenty-four cohorns, and five great ſhips of eighty or ſeventy guns that fired without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion—We had not been many minutes engaged, when one of the ſailors brought another on his back to the cockpit, where he toſſed him down like a bag of oats, and pulling out his pouch, put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth without ſpeaking a word; Morgan immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately examined the condition of the wounded man, and cried, <q>As I ſhall anſwer now, the man is as tead as my great-grandfather.</q>—"Dead," ſaid his comrade, <q>he may be dead now, for ought I know, but I'll be damn'd if he was not alive when I took him up.</q>—So ſaying, he was about to return to his quarters, when I bade him carry the body along with him, and throw it over-board.—"D—n the body," ſaid he, <q>I think 'tis fair enough if I take care of my own.</q>—My fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſnatching up the amputation-kni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

God help us!</q>—continued he, <q>if your kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Lieutenant Bowling had been here, we ſhould have had other gueſs-work.</q>—By this time our patients had increaſed to ſuch a number, that we did not know which to begin with; and the firſt mate plainly told the ſurgeon, that if he did not get up immediately, and perform his duty, he would complain of his behaviour to the admiral, and make application for his warrant.—This remonſtrance effectually rouſed Macſhane, who was never deaf to an argument in which he thought his intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; he therefore roſe up, and, in order to ſtrengthen his reſolution, had recourſe more than once to caſe-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of rum, which he freely communicated to the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain and purſer, who had as much need of ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſpiration as himſelf. Being thus ſupported he went to work, and arms and legs were hewed down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy.—The fumes of the liquor mounting into the parſon's brain, conſpired with his former agitation of ſpirits, to make him quite delirious; he ſtript himſelf to the ſkin, and beſmearing his body with blood, could ſcarce be with-held from running upon deck in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Jack Rattlin, ſcandalized at this deportment, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to allay his tranſports with reaſon: but finding all he ſaid ineffectual, and great confuſion occaſioned by his frolics, he knocked him down with his right hand, and by threats kept him quiet in that ſtate of humiliation.—But it was not in the power of rum to elevate the purſer, who ſat on the floor wringing his hands, and curſing the hour in which he left his peaceable profeſſion of a brewer in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,

His reaſon for honouring me in particular with this piece of ſervice, being, that in caſe I ſhould be killed or diſabled by the way, my death or mutilation would be of leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the ſhip's company, than that of the doctor or his firſt mate.—At another time perhaps I might have diſputed this order, to which I was not bound to pay the leaſt regard; but as I thought my reputation depended upon my compliance, I was reſolved to convince my rival that I was no more afraid than he of expoſing myſelf to danger.—With this view I provided myſelf with dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and followed him immediately to the quarter-deck, through a moſt infernal ſcene of ſlaughter, fire, ſmoke, and uproar! Captain Oakhum, who, leaning againſt the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen-maſt, no ſooner ſaw me approach in my ſhirt, with the ſleeves tucked up to my arm pits, and my hands dyed with blood, than he ſignified his diſpleaſure by a frown, and aſked why the doctor himſelf did not come? I told him Crampley had ſingled me out, as if by expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: at which reply he ſeemed ſurpriſed, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to puniſh the midſhipman for his preſumption, after the engagement: in the mean time I was ſent back to my ſtation, and ordered to tell Macſhane, that the captain expected him immediately.—I got ſafe back, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my commiſſion to the doctor, who flatly refuſed to quit the poſt aſſigned to him by his inſtruction: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Morgan, who (I believe) was jealous of my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Inſtead of ſmall beer, each man was allowed three half-quarterns of brandy or rum, which were diſtributed every morning, diluted with a certain quantity of water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either ſugar or fruit to render it palatable, for which reaſon this compoſition was by the ſailors not unaptly ſtiled <hi>neceſſity.</hi> Nor was this limitation of ſimple element owing to a ſcarcity of it on board, for there was at this time water enough in the ſhip for a voyage of ſix months, at the rate of a half a gallon <hi>per</hi> day to each man: but this faſt muſt (I ſuppoſe) have been enjoined by way of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on the ſhip's company for their ſins; or rather with a view to mortify them into a contempt of life, that they

might thereby become more reſolute and regardleſs of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. How ſimply then do thoſe people argue, who aſcribe the great mortality among us to our bad proviſion and want of water; and affirm, that a great many valuable lives might have been ſaved, if the uſeleſs tranſports had been employed in fetching freſh ſtock, turtle, fruit, and other refreſhments from Jamaica, and other adjacent iſlands, for the uſe of the army and fleet! ſeeing it is to be hoped, that thoſe who died went to a better place, and thoſe who ſurvived were the more eaſily maintained.—After all, a ſufficient number remained to fall before the walls of St. Lazar, where they behaved like their own country ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffs, which ſhut their eyes, run into the jaws of a bear, and have their heads cruſhed for their valour.</p>
                     <p>But to return to my narration: after having put gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons into the forts we had taken, and re-embarked our ſoldiers and artillery, a piece of ſervice that detained us more than a week; we ventured up to the mouth of the inner harbour, guarded by a large fortification on one ſide, and a ſmall redoubt on the other, both of which were deſerted before our approach, and the entrance of the harbour blocked up by ſeveral old galleons and two men of war that the enemy had ſunk in the channel.—We made ſhift, however, to open a paſſage for ſome ſhips, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured a ſecond landing of troops at a place called La Quinta, not far from the town, where, after a faint re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from a body of Spaniards, who oppoſed their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarkation, they encamped with a deſign of beſieging the caſtle of St. Lazar, which overlooked and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the city: whether our renowned general had no body in his army who knew how to approach it in form, or that he truſted entirely to the ſame of his arms, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; but, certain it is, a reſolution was taken in a council of war, to attack the place with muſquetry only. This was put in execution, and ſucceeded accordingly: the enemy giving them ſuch an hearty reception, that the greateſt part of the detachment took up their everlaſting abode on the ſpot.—Our chief, not reliſhing this kind of complaiſance in the Spaniards, was wiſe enough to retreat on board with the remains of his army, which, from eight thouſand able men landed on the beach near Boca Chica, was now reduced to fifteen hundred fit for ſervice.—The

This inhuman diſregard was imputed to the ſcarcity of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons; though it is well known that every great ſhip in the fleet could have ſpared one at leaſt for this duty; an expedient which would have been more than ſufficient to remove this ſhocking inconvenience: but perhaps the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was too much of a gentleman to aſk a favour of this kind from his fellow-chief, who, on the other hand, would not derogate ſo much from his own dignity, as to offer ſuch aſſiſtance unaſked; for, I may venture to affirm, that by this time the daemon of diſcord, with her ſooty wings, had breathed her influence upon our councils; and it might be ſaid of theſe great men, (I hope they will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the compariſon,) as for Caeſar and Pompey, the one could not brook a ſuperior, and the other was impatient of an equal; ſo that between the pride of one, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of another, the enterpriſe miſcarried, according to the proverb, <q>Between two ſtools the backſide falls to the ground.</q>—Not that I would be thought to liken any public concern to that opprobrious part of the human body, though I might with truth aſſert, if I durſt uſe ſuch a vulgar idiom, that the nation did hang an a—ſe at its diſappointment on this occaſion; neither would I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to compare the capacity of our heroic leaders to any ſuch wooden convenience as a joint-ſtool or a cloſe-ſtool; but only to ſignify, by this ſimile, the miſtake the people committed in truſting to the union of two inſtruments that were never joined.</p>
                     <p>A day or two after the attempt on St. Lazar, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ordered one of the Spaniſh men of war we had taken to be mounted with ſixteen guns, and manned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments from our great ſhips, in order to batter the town; accordingly, ſhe was towed into the inner harbour in the night, and moored within half a mile of the walls

Then he aſked if I had ever received the ſacrament, or taken the oaths?

In the mean time, being in great danger of ſuffocation, I ſtarted up in a kind of frantic fit, with an intention to plunge myſelf into the ſea, and, as my friend the ſerjeant was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, would certainly have cooled myſelf to ſome purpoſe, had I not perceived a moiſture upon my thigh as I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get out of my hammoc. The appearance of this renewed my hopes, and I had reflection and reſolution enough to take the advantage of this favourable ſymptom, by tearing the ſhirt from my body and the ſheets from the bed, and wrapping myſelf in a thick blanket, in which incloſure, for about a quarter of an hour, I felt the pains of hell; but it was not long before I was recompenſed for my ſuffering by a profuſe ſweat, that, burſting from the whole ſurface of my ſkin, in leſs than two hours relieved me from all my complaints except that of weakneſs, and left me as hungry as a kite. I enjoyed a very comfortable nap, after which I was regaling myſelf with the agreeable reverie of my future happineſs, when I heard Morgan, on the outſide of the curtain, aſk the ſerjeant if I was alive ſtill? "Alive!" cried the other; <q>God forbid he ſhould be otherwiſe! he has lain quiet theſe five hours, and I do not chuſe to diſturb him; for ſleep will do him great ſervice.</q>—"Ay," ſaid my fellow-mate, <q>he ſleeps ſo ſound, (look you,) that he will never waken till the great trump plows.—Got be merciful to his ſoul—He has paid his debt like an honeſt man—Ay, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he is at reſt from all perſecutions, and troubles, and afflictions, of which Got knows, and I know, he had his own ſhare—Ochree!

The ſerjeant, alarmed at his words, came into the birth, and, while he looked upon me, I ſmiled, and tipped him the wink; he immediately gueſſed my meaning, and, remaining ſilent, Morgan was

confirmed in his opinion of my being dead; whereupon he approached with tears in his eyes, in order to indulge his grief with a ſight of the object; and I counterfeited death ſo well by fixing my eyes, and dropping my under-jaw, that he ſaid, <q>There he lies, no petter than a lump of clay, Got help me;</q> and obſerved, by the diſtortion of my face, that I muſt have had a ſtrong ſtruggle. I ſhould not have been able to contain myſelf much longer, when he began to perform the laſt duty of a friend in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my eyes and my mouth; upon which I ſuddenly ſnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at his fingers, and diſcompoſed him ſo much, that he ſtarted back, turned pale as aſhes, and ſtared like the picture of horror: although I could not help laughing at his appearance, I was concerned for his ſituation, and ſtretched out my hand, telling him, I hoped to live and eat ſome ſalmagundy of his making in England. It was ſome time before he could recollect himſelf ſo far as to feel my pulſe, and inquire into the particulars of my diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, when he found I had enjoyed a favourable criſis, he congratulated me upon my good fortune, not failing to aſcribe it, under Got, to the bliſter he had applied to my back at his laſt viſit, "which, by the bye," ſaid he, <q>muſt now be removed and dreſſed:</q> he was actually going to fetch dreſſings, when I feigning aſtoniſhment, ſaid, <q>Bleſs me! ſure you never applied a bliſter to me—there is nothing on my back, I aſſure you.</q> But he could not be convinced till he had examined it, and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conceal his confuſion, by expreſſing his ſurpriſe in finding the ſkin untouched, and the plaiſter miſſing. In order to excuſe myſelf for paying ſo little regard to his preſcription, I pretended to have been inſenſible when it was put on, and to have pulled it off afterwards in a fit of delirium.

At this declaration he grinned, ſhook his fiſt, and ſwore he longed for nothing more than ſuch an opportunity.</p>
                     <p>Mean while our ſhip was ordered to be heaved down, victualled and watered, for her return to England; and our captain, for ſome reaſon or other, not thinking it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for him to reviſit his native country at this time, exchanged with a gentleman, who on the other hand wiſhed for nothing ſo much as to be ſafe without the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic, all his care and tenderneſs of himſelf being inſufficient to preſerve his complexion from the injuries of the ſun and weather.</p>
                     <p>Our tyrant having left the ſhip, and carried his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite Macſhane along with him, to my inexpreſſible ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, our new commander came on board in a ten oar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed barge overſhadowed with a vaſt umbrella, and appeared in every thing the reverſe of Oakhum, being a tall, thin, young man, dreſſed in this manner—A white hat, garniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a red feather, adorned his head, from whence his hair ſlowed upon his ſhoulders in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon: his coat, conſiſting of pink-coloured ſilk, lined with white, by the elegance of the cut, retired backward, as it were, to diſcover a white ſattin waiſtcoat embroidered with gold, unbuttoned at the upper part to diſplay a broach ſet with garnets, that glittered in the breaſt of his ſhirt, which was of the fineſt cambric, edged with rich Mechlin: the knees of his crimſon-velvet breeches ſcarce deſcended ſo low as to meet his ſilk ſtockings, which roſe, without ſpot or wrinkle on his meagre legs, from ſhoes of blue Meroquin, ſtudded with diamond buckles that flamed forth

rivals to the ſun! A ſteel-hilted ſword, inlaid with gold, and decked with a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich taſſel, equipped his ſide, and an amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wriſt: but the moſt remarkable parts of his furniture were a maſk on his face, and white gloves on his hands, which did not ſeem to be put on with an intention to be pulled off occaſionally, but were fixed with a curious ring on the little finger of each hand. In this garb Captain Whiffle (for that was his name) took poſſeſſion of the ſhip, ſurrounded with a crowd of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, all of whom, in their different degrees, ſeemed to be of their patron's diſpoſition; and the air was ſo impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with perfumes, that one may venture to affirm the clime of Arabia Felix was not half ſo ſweet ſcented. My fellow-mate, obſerving no ſurgeon among his train, thought he had found an occaſion too favourable for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be neglected, and remembering the old proverb, "Spare to ſpeak, and ſpare to ſpeed," reſolved to ſolicit the new captain's intereſt immediately, before any other ſurgeon could be appointed for the ſhip. With this view he repaired to the cabin in his ordinary dreſs, conſiſting of a check ſhirt and trowſers, a brown linen waiſtcoat, and a night-cap of the ſame, (neither of them very clean,) which, for his future misfortune, happened to ſmell ſtrong of tobacco. Entering without any ceremony into this ſacred place, he found Captain Whiffle repoſing upon a couch, with a wrapper of fine chintz about his body, and a muſlin cap, bordered with lace, about his head; and, after ſeveral low congees, began in this manner: <q>Sir, I hope you will forgive, and excuſe, and pardon the preſumption of one who has not the honour of being known unto you, but who is, nevertheleſs, a ſhentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man porn and pred, and moreover has had misfortunes, Got help me, in the world.</q>—Here he was interrupted by the captain, who, on ſeeing him, had ſtarted up with great amazement at the novelty of the apparition, and, having recollected himſelf, pronounced with a look and tone ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying diſdain, curioſity and ſurpriſe, <q>Zauns! who art thou?</q>—<q>I am ſurgeon's firſt mate on board of this ſhip,</q> replied Morgan, <q>and I moſt vehemently deſire and beſeech you, with all ſubmiſſion, to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to condeſcend and vouchſafe to inquire into my

character, and my pehaviour, and my deſerts, which, under Got, I hope, will entitle me to the vacancy of ſurgeon.</q>—As he proceeded in his ſpeech, he continued advancing towards the captain, whoſe noſtrils were no ſooner ſaluted with the aromatic flavour that exhaled from him, than he cried with great emotion, <q>Heaven preſerve me! I am ſuffocated!—Fellow, fellow, away with thee—Curſe thee, fellow! get thee gone—I ſhall be ſtunk to death!</q> At the noiſe of his outcries his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ran into his apartment, and he accoſted them thus: <q>Villains! cut throats! traitors! I am betrayed! I am ſacrificed!—Will you not carry that monſter away? or muſt I be ſtifled with the ſtench of him! Oh! oh!</q>—With theſe interjections he ſunk down upon his ſettee in a fit; his valet de chambre plied him with a ſmelling-bottle, one footman chafed his temples with Hungary water, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſprinkled the floor with ſpirits of lavender, a third puſhed Morgan out of the cabin, who, coming to the place where I was, ſat down with a demure countenance, and according to his cuſtom, when he received any indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which he durſt not revenge, began to ſing a Welch ditty. I gueſſed he was under ſome agitation of ſpirits, and deſired to know the cauſe; but, inſtead of anſwering me directly, he aſked, with great emotion, if I thought him a monſter and a ſtinkard? <q>A monſter and a ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard!</q> ſaid I with ſome ſurpriſe; <q>did any body call you ſo?</q>—"Got is my judge," replied he, <q>Captain Fifle did call me both; ay, and all the water in the Tawy will not waſh it out of my remembrance. I do affirm, and avouch, and maintain, with my ſoul, and my pody, and my plood, (look you,) that I have no ſmells about me but ſuch as a Chriſtian ought to have, except the effluvia of tobacco, which is a cephalic, odoriferous, aromatic herb, and he is the ſon of a mountain goat who ſays otherwiſe—As for my being a monſter, let that be as it is; I am as Got was pleaſed to create me, which, peradventure, is more than I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Captain Whiffle ſends for me—his ſituation deſcribed—his ſurgeon arrives, preſcribes for him, and puts him to bed—a bed is put up for Mr. Simper contiguous to the ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, which, with other parts of the captain's behaviour, gives the ſhip's company a very unfavourable idea of their commander—I am detained in the Weſt-Indies by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, and go on board of the Lizard ſloop of war in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſurgeon's mate, where I make myſelf known to the ſurgeon, who treats me very kindly—I go on ſhore, ſell my ticket, purchaſe neceſſaries, and, at my return on board, am ſurprized at the ſight of Crampley, who is appointed lieutenant of the ſloop—we ſail on a cruize—take a prize, in which I arrive at Port Morant under the command of my meſs-mate, with whom I live in great harmony.</p>

                     <p>HE was going on with an eulogium upon the captain, when I received a meſſage to clean myſelf and go up to the great cabin; and with this command I inſtantly complied, ſweetening myſelf with roſe-water from the medicine cheſt. When I entered the room, I was ordered to ſtand by the door until Captain Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

He, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted one ſenſe in this manner, bade me advance gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that his noſe might have intelligence before it could be much offended: I therefore approached with great caution and ſucceſs, and he was pleaſed to ſay, <q>Ay, this creature is tolerable.</q> I found him lolling on his couch with a languiſhing air, his head ſupported by his valet de chambre, who from time to time applied a ſmelling-bottle to his noſe.

While I prepared for this important evacuation, there came into the cabin a young man gaily dreſſed, of a very delicate complexion, with a kind of a languid ſmile on his face, which ſeemed to have been rendered habitual by a long courſe of affectation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The captain no ſooner perceived him, than, riſing haſtily, he flew into his arms, crying, <q>O! my dear Simper! I am exceſſively diſordered! I have been betrayed, frighted, murdered, by the negligence of my ſervants, who ſuffered a beaſt, a mule, a bear, to ſurpriſe me, and ſtink me into convulſions with the fumes of tobacco.</q> Simper (who, by this time I found, was obliged to art for the clearneſs of his complexion) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed an air of ſoftneſs and ſympathy, and lamented, with many tender expreſſions of ſorrow, the ſad accident that had thrown him into that condition; then, feeling his patient's pulſe on the outſide of his glove, gave it as his opinion, that his diſorder was entirely nervous, and that ſome drops of tincture of caſtor and liquid laudanum would be of more ſervice to him than bleeding, by bridling the inordinate ſallies of his ſpirits, and compoſing the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his bile. I was therefore ſent to prepare this preſcription, which was adminiſtered in a glaſs of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſet after the captain had been put to bed, and orders
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:027715_0226_0FD5ED2B20D1D330"/>
ſent to the officers on the quarter-deck to let nobody walk on that ſide under which he lay.</p>
                     <p>While the captain enjoyed his repoſe, the doctor watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over him, and indeed became ſo neceſſary, that a cabin was made for him contiguous to the ſtate-room, where Whiffle ſlept, that he might be at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Next day our commander being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily recovered, gave orders, that none of the lieutenants ſhould appear upon deck without a wig, ſword and ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, nor any midſhipman, or other petty officer, be ſeen with a check ſhirt or dirty linen. He alſo prohibited any perſon whatever, except Simper and his own ſervants, from coming into the great cabin, without firſt ſending in to obtain leave. Theſe ſingular regulations did not prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſhip's company in his favour, but on the contrary gave ſcandal an opportunity to be very buſy with his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and accuſe him of maintaining a correſpondence with his ſurgeon not fit to be named.</p>
                     <p>In a few weeks, our ſhip being under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ailing orders, I was in hope of reviſiting my native country in a very ſhort time, when the admiral's ſurgeon came on board, and, ſending for Morgan and me on the quarter-deck, gave us to underſtand there was a great ſcarcity of ſurgeons in the Weſt-Indies; that he was commanded to detain one mate out of every great ſhip that was bound for England, and deſired us to agree between ourſelves, before the next day at that hour, which of us ſhould ſtay behind. We were thunder-ſtruck at this propoſal, and ſtared at one another ſome time without ſpeaking; at length the Welchman broke ſilence, and offered to remain in the Weſt-Indies, provided the admiral would give him a ſurgeon's warrant immediately: but he was told there was no want of chief ſurgeons, and that he muſt be contented with the ſtation of mate till he ſhould be further provided for in due courſe; whereupon Morgan flatly refuſed to quit the ſhip for which the commiſſioners of the navy had appointed him, and the other told him as plainly, that, if we could not determine the affair by ourſelves before to-morrow morning, he muſt caſt lots, and abide by his chance.—When I recalled to my remembrance the miſeries I had undergone in England, where I had not one friend to promote my intereſt, or favour my advancement in the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:027715_0227_0FD5ED2C8CF7D300"/>
navy, and at the ſame time reflected on the preſent dearth of ſurgeons in the Weſt-Indies, and the unhealthineſs of the climate which every day almoſt reduced the number, I could not help thinking, my ſucceſs would be much more certain and expeditious by my ſtaying where I was, than by returning to Europe—I therefore reſolved to comply with a good grace, and next day, when we were ordered to throw the dice, told Morgan he needed not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, for I would voluntarily ſubmit to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's pleaſure. This frank declaration was commended by the gentleman, who aſſured me it ſhould not fare the worſe with me for my reſignation. Indeed he was as good as his word, and that very afternoon procured a warrant, appointing me ſurgeon's mate of the Lizard ſloop of war, which put me on a footing with every firſt mate in the ſervice.</p>
                     <p>My ticket being made out, I put my cheſt and bedding on board a canoe that lay along-ſide, and having ſhook hands with my truſty friend the ſerjeant, and honeſt Jack Rattlin, who was bound for Greenwich hoſpital, I took my leave of Morgan with many tears, after we had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed our ſleeve-buttons as remembrances of each other.—Having preſented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard, I inquired for the doctor, whom I no ſooner ſaw, than I recollected him to be one of thoſe young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, during our frolic with Jackſon, as I have related before.—He received me with a good deal of courteſy, and when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance, expreſſed great joy at ſeeing me again, and recommended me to an exceeding good meſs, compoſed of the gunner and maſter's mate.—As there was not one ſick perſon in the ſhip, I got leave to go a-ſhore, next day, with the gunner, who recommended me to a Jew, that bought my ticket at the rate of 40 <hi>per cent.</hi> diſcount; and having furniſhed myſelf with what neceſſaries I wanted, returned on board in the evening, and to my ſurpriſe found my old antagoniſt Crampley walking upon deck.—Though I did not fear his enmity, I was ſhocked at his appearance, and communicated my ſentiments on that ſubject to Mr. Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins the ſurgeon, who told me that Crampley, by dint of ſome friends about the admiral, had procured a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:027715_0228_0FD5ED2E6268B740"/>
conſtituting him lieutenant on board the Lizard: and adviſed me, now as he was my ſuperior officer, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have with ſome reſpect towards him, or elſe he would find a thouſand opportunities of uſing me ill.—This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was a bitter potion to me, whom pride and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had rendered utterly incapable of the leaſt ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to, or even of a reconciliation with the wretch who had, on many occaſions, treated me ſo inhumanly. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I reſolved to have as little connection as poſſible with him, and to ingratiate myſelf as much as I could with the reſt of the officers, whoſe friendſhip might be a bulwark to defend me from the attempts of his malice.</p>
                     <p>In leſs than a week we ſailed on a cruize, and having weathered the eaſt end of the iſland, had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to take a Spaniſh barcolongo, with her prize, which was an Engliſh ſhip bound for Briſtol, that had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ailed from Jamaica a fortnight before, without convoy. All the priſoners, who were well, we put on ſhore on the north ſide of the iſland; the prizes were manned with Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the command of the barcolongo given to my friend the maſter's mate, with orders to carry them into Port Morant, and there to remain until the Lizard's cruize ſhould be ended, at which time ſhe would touch at the ſame place in her way to Port Royal—With him I was ſent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Engliſhmen, who amounted to ſixteen, and to take care of them on ſhore, in a houſe that was to be hired as an hoſpital.—This deſtination gave me a great deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as I ſhould, for ſome time, be freed from the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of Crampley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe inveteracy againſt me had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready broke out on two or three occaſions ſince he was become a lieutenant.—My meſs-mate, who very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled my uncle, both in figure and diſpoſition, treated me on board of the prize with the utmoſt civility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; and, among other favours, made me a preſent of a ſilver-hilted hanger, and a pair of piſtols mounted with the ſame metal, which fell to his ſhare in plundering the enemy.—We arrived ſafely at Morant, and going on ſhore, pitched upon an empty ſtore-houſe, which we hired for the reception of the wounded, who were brought to it next day, with beds and other neceſſaries, and four of

                        <p>A ſtrange adventure, in conſequence of which I am extremely happy—Crampley does me ill offices with the captain: but his malice is defeated by the good nature and friendſhip of the ſurgeon—we return to Port-Royal—our captain gets the command of a larger ſhip, and is ſucceeded by an old man—Brayl is provided for—we receive orders to ſail for England.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WHEN my patients were all in a fair way, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and commander, whoſe name was Brayl, carried me up the country to the houſe of a rich plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with whom he was acquainted; where we were ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly entertained, and in the evening ſet out on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the ſhip. When we had walked about a mile by moon-light, we perceived a horſeman behind us, who coming up, wiſhed us <hi>good even,</hi> and aſked which way we went. His voice, which was quite familiar to me, no ſooner ſtruck my ear, than, in ſpite of all my reſolution and reflection, my hair briſtled up, and I was ſeized with a violent fit of trembling, which Brayl miſinterpreting, bade me be under no concern. I told him, he was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the cauſe of my diſorder; and, addreſſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the perſon on horſeback, ſaid, <q>I could have ſworn by your voice, that you was a dear friend of mine, if I had not been certain of his death.</q>—To this addreſs, after ſome pauſe, he replied, <q>There are many voices as well as faces that reſemble one another; but pray, what was your friend's name?</q> I ſatisfied him in that particular, and gave a ſhort detail of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy fate of Thomſon, not without many ſighs and ſome tears. A ſilence enſued which laſted ſome minutes, and then the converſation turned on different ſubjects, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ill we arrived at a houſe on the road, where the horſeman alighted, and begged with ſo much earneſtneſs, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him, that we could not reſiſt.—But if I was alarmed at his voice, what muſt my amazement be, when I diſcovered by the

light, the very perſon of my lamented friend! Perceiving my confuſion, which was extreme, he claſped me in his arms, and bedewed my face with tears.—It was ſome time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re I recovered the uſe of my reaſon, overpowered with this event, and longer ſtill before I could ſpeak. So that all I was capable of was to return his embraces, and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his; while honeſt Brayl, affected with the ſcene, wept as faſt as either of us, and ſignified his participation of our happineſs by hugging us both, and capering about the room like a madman.—At length I retrieved the uſe of my tongue, and cried, <q>Is it poſſible?—can you be my friend Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? No certainly: alas! he was drowned! and I am now under the deception of a dream!</q>—He was at great pains to convince me of his being the individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom I regretted, and bidding me ſit down and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe myſelf, promiſed to explain his ſudden diſappearance from the Thunder, and to account for his being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the land of the living.—This taſk he acquitted himſelf of, after I had drank a glaſs of punch, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected my ſpirits, by informing us, that, with a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to rid himſelf of a miſerable exiſtence, he had gone in the night-time to the head, while the ſhip was on her way, from whence he ſlipped down as ſoftly as he could by the bows, into the ſea, where, after he was hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ducked, he began to repent of his precipitation, and as he could ſwim very well, kept himſelf above water, in hopes of being taken up by ſome of the ſhips a-ſtern;—that in this ſituation he hailed a large veſſel, and begged to be taken in, but was anſwered, that ſhe was a heavy ſailer, and therefore they did not chuſe to loſe time, by bringing to; however, they threw an old cheſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board for his convenience, and told him that ſome of the ſhips a-ſtern would certainly ſave him;—that no other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel came within ſight or cry of him, for the ſpace of three hours, during which time he had the mortification to find himſelf in the middle of the ocean alone, without other ſupport or reſting place but what a ſew crazy boards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded; till at laſt he diſcerned a ſmall ſloop ſteering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, upon which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e ſet up his throat, and had the good fortune to be heard and reſcued from the dreary waſte, by their boat, which was hoiſted out on purpoſe.

"I was no ſooner brought on board," continued he, <q>than I fainted, and when I recovered my ſenſes, found myſelf in bed, regaled with a moſt noiſome ſmell of onions and cheeſe, which made me think at firſt, that I was in my own hammoc along-ſide of honeſt Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and that all which had paſſed was no more than a dream.—Upon inquiry I underſtood that I was on board of a ſchooner belonging to Rhode-Iſland, bound for Jamaica, with a cargo of geeſe, pigs, onions, and cheeſe; and that the maſter's name was Robertſon, by birth a North-Briton, whom I knew at firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight to be an old ſchool-fellow of mine.—When I diſcovered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him, he was tranſported with ſurpriſe and joy, and begged to know the occaſion of my misfortune, which I did not think fit to diſcloſe, becauſe I knew his notions with regard to religion were very ſevere and confined; therefore contented myſelf with telling him, I fell overboard by accident; but made no ſcruple of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the nature of my diſagreeable ſtation, and of acquainting him with my determined purpoſe never to return to the Thunder man of war.—Although he was not of my opinion in that particular, knowing that I muſt loſe my clothes, and what pay was due to me, unleſs I went back to my duty; yet when I deſcribed the circumſtances of the helliſh life I led, under the tyrannic ſway of Oakhum and Macſhane; and among other grievances, hinted a diſſatisfaction at the irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious deportment of my ſhip-mates, and the want of the true Preſbyterian goſpel doctrine; he changed his ſentiments, and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aſide all thoughts of riſing in the navy; and that he might ſhew how much he had my intereſt at heart, undertook to provide for me in ſome ſhape or other, before he ſhould leave Jamaica.—This promiſe he performed to my heart's deſire, by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune, with whom I have lived ever ſince, in quality of ſurgeon and overſeer to his plantations.—He and his lady are now at Kingſton, ſo that I am, for the preſent, maſter of this houſe, to which, from my ſoul, I bid you welcome, and hope you will favour me with your company during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the night.</q>—I needed not a ſecond

invitation; but Mr. Brayl, who was a diligent and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent officer, could not be perſuaded to ſleep out of the ſhip: however, he ſupped with us, and after having drank a chearful glaſs, ſet out for the veſſel, which was not above three miles from the place, eſcorted by a couple of ſtout negroes, whom Mr. Thomſon ordered to conduct him.—Never were two friends more happy in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of each other than we, for the time it laſted: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him the particulars of our attempt upon Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena, of which he had heard but an imperfect account; and he gratified me with a narration of every little inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his life ſince we parted.—He aſſured me, it was with the utmoſt difficulty he could reſiſt his inclination of coming down to Port Royal to ſee Morgan and me, of whom he had heard no tidings ſince the day of our ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but that he was reſtrained by the fear of being detained as a deſerter.—He told me, that when he heard my voice in the dark, he was almoſt as much ſurpriſed as I was at ſeeing him afterwards; and in the confidence of friendſhip, diſcloſed a paſſion he entertained for the only daughter of the gentleman with whom he lived, who, by his deſcription, was a very amiable young lady, and did not diſdain his addreſſes; that he was very much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>avoured by her parents, and did not deſpair of obtaining their conſent to the match, which would at once render him independent of the world.—I congratulated him on his good fortune, which he proteſted ſhould never make him forget his friends; and towards morning we betook ourſelves to reſt.</p>
                     <p>Next day he accompanied me to the ſhip, where Mr. Brayl entertained him at dinner, and we having ſpent the afternoon together, he took his leave of us in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after he had forced upon me ten piſtoles, as a ſmall token of his affection.—In ſhort, while we ſtaid here, we ſaw one another every day, and generally ate at the ſame table, which was plentifully ſupplied by him with all kinds of poultry, butcher's meat, oranges, limes, lemons, pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apples, Madeira wine, and excellent rum; ſo that this ſmall interval of ten days was by far the moſt agreeable period of my life.</p>
                     <p>At length the Lizard arrived; and my patients being all ſit for duty, they and I were ordered on board of her,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:027715_0233_0FD5ED3918275D68"/>
where I underſtood from Mr. Tomlins, that there was a ſhyneſs between the lieutenant and him on my account; that rancoro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s villain having taken the opportunity of my abſence, to fill the captain's ears with a thouſand ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtories, to my prejudice; among other things affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I had been once tranſported for theft, and that when I was in the Thunder man of war I had been whipt for the ſame crime.—The ſurgeon, on the other hand, having heard my whole ſtory from my own mouth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended me ſtrenuouſly, and in the courſe of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured office, recounted all the inſtances of Crampley's malice againſt me, while I remained on board of that ſhip.—Which declaration, while it ſatisfied the captain of my innocence, made the lieutenant as much my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender's enemy as mine. This infernal behaviour of Cramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, with regard to me, added ſuch fuel to my former reſentment, that at certain times I was quite beſide myſelf with the deſire of revenge, and was even tempted to piſtol him on the quarter-deck, though an infamous death muſt inevitably have been my reward. But the ſurgeon, who was my confident, argued againſt ſuch a deſperate action ſo effectually, that I ſtifled the flame, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed me, for the preſent, and reſolved to wait for a more convenient opportunity. In the mean time, that Mr. Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins might be the more convinced of the wrongs I ſuffered by this fellow's ſlander, I begged he would go and viſit Mr. Thomſon, whoſe wonderful eſcape I had made him acquainted with, and inquire of him into the particulars of my conduct while he was my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ellow-mate. This requeſt the ſurgeon complied with, more from a curioſity to ſee a perſon whoſe fate had been ſo extraordinary, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his good opinion of me, which he aſſured me was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready firmly eſtabliſhed. He therefore ſet out for the dwelling-place of my friend, with a letter of introduction from me, and, being received with all the civility and kindneſs I expected, returned to the ſhip, not only ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with my character beyond the power of doubt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, but alſo charmed with the affability and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Thomſon, who loaded him and me with preſents of freſh ſtock, liquors, and fruit. As he would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come and ſee us on board, leſt Crampley ſhould know and detain him, when the time of our departure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:027715_0234_0FD5ED3AA19DF8E8"/>
I obtained leave to go and bid him farewel.—After we had vowed an everlaſting friendſhip, he preſſed upon me a purſe with four doubloons, which I refuſed as long as I could without giving umbrage; and, having cordially embraced each other, I returned on board, where I found a ſmall box, with a letter directed to me, to the care of Mr. Tomlins. Knowing the ſuperſcription to be of Thomſon's hand-writing, I opened it with ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and learned that this generous friend, not contented with loading me with the preſents already mentioned, had ſent, for my uſe and acceptance, half a dozen fine ſhirts, and as many linen waiſtcoats and caps, with twelve pair of new thread-ſtockings. Being thus provided with money, and all neceſſaries for the comfort of life, I began to look upon myſelf as a gentleman of ſome conſequence, and felt my pride dilate apace.</p>
                     <p>Next day we ſailed for Port-Royal, where we arrived ſafely with our prizes, and, as there was nothing to do on board, I went aſhore, and, having purchaſed a laced waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat with ſome other clothes at a ſale, made a ſwaggering figure for ſome days among the taverns, where I ventured to play a little at hazard, and came off with fifty piſtoles in my pocket. Mean while our captain was promoted to a ſhip of twenty guns, and the command of the Lizard given to a man turned of fourſcore, who had been lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſince the reign of King William, and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his long ſervice, would have probably died in that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had he not applied ſome prize-money, he had lately received, to make intereſt with his ſuperiors. My friend Brayl was alſo made an officer about the ſame time, after he had ſerved in quality of midſhipman and mate five and twenty years. Soon after theſe alterations, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pitched upon our ſhip to carry home diſpatches for the miniſtry, and we ſet fail for England, having firſt ſcrubbed her bottom, and taken in proviſion and water for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>We depart for Europe—a miſunderſtanding ariſes between the captain and ſurgeon through the ſcandalous aſperſions of Crampley—the captain dies—Crampley tyranniſes over the ſurgeon, who falls a victim to his cruelty—I am alſo ill-uſed—the ſhip ſtrikes—the behaviour of Crampley and the ſeamen on that occaſion—I get on ſhore, challenge the captain to ſingle combat—am treacherouſly knocked down, wounded, and robbed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>NOW that I could return to my native country in a creditable way, I felt exceſſive pleaſure in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf out of ſight of that fatal iſland, which has been the grave of ſo many Europeans; and, as I was accommodated with every thing to render the paſſage agreeable, I reſolved to enjoy myſelf as much as the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Crampley would permit. This inſidious ſlanderer had found means already to cauſe a miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſurgeon and captain, who by his age and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities was rendered intolerably peeviſh, his diſpoſition having alſo been ſoured by a long courſe of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and had a particular averſion to all young men, eſpecially to ſurgeons, whom he conſidered as unneceſſary animals on board of a ſhip. In conſequence of theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he never conſulted the doctor, notwithſtanding his

being ſeized with a violent fit of the gout and gravel, but applied to a caſk of Holland gin, which was his ſovereign preſcription againſt all diſtempers. But whether he was at this time too ſparing, or took an over-doſe of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, certain it is, he departed in the night without any ceremony, (which indeed was a thing he always deſpiſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and was found ſtiff next morning, to the no ſmall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Crampley, who ſucceeded to the command of the veſſel. For that very reaſon Mr. Tomlins and I had no cauſe to rejoice at this event, fearing that the tyranny of our new commander would now be as unlimited as his power. The firſt day of his command juſtified our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on pretence that the decks were too much crowded, he ordered the ſurgeon's hencoops, with all his fowls, to be thrown over-board, and at the ſame time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited him and me from appearing on the quarter-deck. Mr. Tomlins could not help complaining of theſe injuries, and in the courſe of his expoſtulation dropped ſome haſty words, of which Crampley taking hold, confined him to his cabin, where in a few days, for want of air, he was attacked by a fever, which ſoon put an end to his life, after having made his will, by which he bequeathed all his eſtate, perſonal and real, to his ſiſter, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> to me his watch and inſtruments as remembrances of his friendſhip. I was penetrated with grief on this melancholy occaſion, the more becauſe there was nobody on board to whom I could communicate my griefs, or of whom I could receive the leaſt conſolation or advice. Crampley was ſo far from diſcovering the leaſt remorſe for his barbarity, at the news of the ſurgeon's death, that he inſulted his memory in the moſt abuſive manner, and affirmed he had poiſoned himſelf out of pure fear, dreading to be brought to a court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial for mutiny; for which reaſon he would not ſuffer the ſervice of the dead to be read over his body before it was thrown over-board.</p>
                     <p>Nothing but a ſpeedy deliverance could have ſupported me under the brutal ſway of this baſhaw, who, to render my life the more irkſome, ſignified to my meſs-mates a deſire that I ſhould be expelled from their ſociety. This was no ſooner hinted than they granted his requeſt, and I was fain to eat in a ſolitary manner by myſelf during the reſt of the paſſage, which, however, ſoon drew to a period.</p>

We had been ſeven weeks at ſea, when the gunner told the captain, that by his reckoning we muſt be in ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and deſired he would order the lead to be heaved. Crampley ſwore he did not know how to keep the ſhip's way, for we were not within a hundred leagues of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and therefore he would not give himſelf the trouble to caſt the lead. Accordingly we continued our courſe all that afternoon and night, without ſhortening ſail, though the gunner pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ended to diſcover Scilly light, and next morning proteſted in form againſt the captain's conduct; for which he was put in confinement. We diſcovered no land all that day, and Crampley was ſtill ſo infatuated as to neglect ſounding: but at three o'clock in the morning the ſhip ſtruck, and remained faſt on a ſand-bank. This accident alarmed the whole crew; the boat was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately hoiſted out; but, as we could not diſcern which way the ſhore lay, we were obliged to wait for day-light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the mean time the wind increaſed, and the waves beat againſt the ſloop with ſuch violence, that we expected ſhe would have gone to pieces. The gunner was releaſed and conſulted: he adviſed the captain to cut away her maſt, in order to lighten her; this was performed without ſucceſs: the ſailors, ſeeing things in a deſperate ſituation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cuſtom, broke up the cheſts belonging to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, dreſſed themſelves in their clothes, drank their liquors without ceremony; and drunkenneſs, tumult, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enſued. In the midſt of this uproar I went below to ſecure my own effects, and found the carpenter's mate hewing down the purſer's cabin with his hatchet, whiſtling all the while with great compoſure. When I aſked his intention in ſo doing, he replied very calmly, <q>I only want to taſte the purſer's rum; that's all, maſter.</q>—At that inſtant the purſer, coming down, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d ſeeing his effects going to wreck, complained bitterly of the injuſtice done to him, and aſked the fellow what occaſion he had for liquor, when in all likelihood he would be in eternity in a few minutes?—"All's one for that," ſaid the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; "let us live while we can."—<q>Miſerable wretch that thou art!</q> cried the purſer, <q>what muſt be thy lot in the other world, if thou dieſt in the commiſſion of robbery?</q>—"Why hell, I ſuppoſe," replied the other with great deliberation; while the purſer fell on his

knees, and begged of Heaven that we might not all periſh for the ſake of one Jonas. During this dialogue I clothed myſelf in my beſt apparel, girded on my hanger, ſtuck my piſtols loaded in my belt, diſpoſed of all my valuable moveables about my perſon, and came upon deck with a reſolution of taking the firſt opportunity to get on ſhore, which, when the day broke, appeared at the diſtance of three miles a-head. Crampley, finding his efforts to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t the ſhip off ineffectual, determined to conſult his own ſafety by going into the boat, which he had no ſooner done than the ſhip's company followed ſo faſt, that ſhe would have ſunk along-ſide, had not ſome one wiſer than the reſt cut the rope, and put off. But, before this happened, I had made ſeveral attempts to get in, and was always baulked by the captain, who was ſo eager for excluding me, that he did not mind the endeavours of any other body. Enraged at this inhuman partiality, and ſeeing the rope cut, I pulled one of my piſtols from my belt, and, cocking it, ſwore I would ſhoot any man who would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to obſtruct my entrance. So ſaying, I leaped with my full exertion, and got on board the boat with the loſs of the ſkin off one of my ſhins. I chanced in my deſcent to overturn Crampley, who no ſooner got up than he ſtruck at me ſeveral times with a cutlaſs, and ordered the men to throw me over-board; but they were too anxious about their own ſafety to mind what he ſaid. Though the boat was very deeply loaded, and the ſea terribly high, we made ſhift to get upon dry land in leſs than an hour after we parted from the ſloop. As ſoon as I ſet foot on <hi>terra firma,</hi> my indignation which had boiled ſo long within me, broke out againſt Crampley, whom I immediately challenged to ſingle combat, preſenting my piſtols that he might take his choice; he took one without heſitation, and, before I could cock the other, fired in my face, throwing the piſtol after the ſhot. I felt myſelf ſtunned, and, imagining the bullet had entered my brain, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mine as quick as poſſible, that I might not die unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; then, flying upon my antagoniſt, I knocked out ſeveral of his fore-teeth with the but-end of the piece, and would certainly have made an end of him with that inſtrument, had he not diſengaged himſelf, and ſeized his cutlaſs, which he had given to his ſervant when he received
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:027715_0246_0FD5ED529E4B3408"/>
the piſtol. Seeing him armed in this manner, I drew my hanger, and having flung my piſtol at his head, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him in a tranſport of ſury, and thruſt my wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon into his mouth, which it enlarged on one ſide to his ear. Whether the ſmart of this wound diſconcerted him, or the unevenneſs of the ground made him reel, I know not, but he ſtaggered ſome paces back: I followed cloſe, and with one ſtroke cut the tendons on the back of his hand, upon which his cutlaſs dropt, and he remained de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs.—I know not with what cruelty my rage might have inſpired me, if I had not at that inſtant been felled to the ground by a blow on the back part of my head, which deprived me of all ſenſation.—When I recovered the uſe of my underſtanding, I found myſelf alone in a deſolate place, ſtript of my clothes, money, watch, buckles, and every thing but my ſhoes, ſtockings, breeches, and ſhirt.—What a diſcovery muſt this be to me, who, but an hour before, was worth ſixty guineas in caſh! I curſed the hour of my birth, the parents that gave me being, the ſea that did not ſwallow me up, the poinard of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which could not find the way to my heart, the villainy of thoſe who had left me in that miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the ectacy of deſpair, reſolved to lie ſtill where I was and periſh.</p>

in the courſe of her fortune; but however, ſhe would communicate it to me, in conſideration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I had repoſed in her.—<q>It is of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</q> ſaid ſhe, <q>to tell the names of my parents, who are dead many years ago: let it ſuffice to aſſure you that they were wealthy, and had no other child than me, ſo that I was looked upon as heireſs to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable eſtate, and teized with addreſſes on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Among the number of my admirers, there was a young gentleman of no fortune, whoſe ſole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was on his promotion in the army, in which, at that time, he bore a lieutenant's commiſſion—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an affection for this amiable officer, which in a ſhort time increaſed to a violent paſſion, and, without entering into minute circumſtances, married him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.—We had not enjoyed one another long in ſtolen interviews, when he was ordered with his regiment to Flanders; but before he ſet out, it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, that he ſhould declare our marriage to my father by letter, and implore his pardon for the ſtep we had taken without his approbation.—This was done while I was abroad viſiting, and juſt as I was about to return home, I received a letter from my father, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that ſince I had acted ſo undutifully and meanly, as to marry a beggar, without his privity or conſent, to the diſgrace of his family, as well as the diſappointment of his hopes, he renounced me to the miſerable fate I had entailed upon myſelf, and charged me never to ſet foot within his doors again.—This ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid ſentence was confirmed by my mother, who, in a poſtſcript, gave me to underſtand that her ſentiments were exactly conformable to thoſe of my father, and that I might ſave myſelf the trouble of making any applications, for her reſolution was unalterable.—Thunder-ſtruck with my evil fortune, I called a coach and drove to my huſband's lodgings, where I found him waiting the event of his letter.—Though he could eaſily divine by my looks the iſſue of his declaration, he read with great ſteadineſs the epiſtle I had received; and with a ſmile full of tenderneſs, which I ſhall never forget, embraced me, ſaying, I believe the good lady your mother might have ſpared herſelf the trouble of

the laſt part of her poſtſcript.—Well, my dear Betty, you muſt lay aſide all thoughts of a coach, till I can procure the command of a regiment.—This unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behaviour, while it enabled me to ſupport my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of fortune, at the ſame time endeared him to me the more, by convincing me of his diſintereſted views in eſpouſing me.—I was next day boarded in company with the wife of another officer, who had long been the friend and confident of my huſband, at a village not far from London, where they parted from us in the moſt melting manner, went to Flanders, and were killed in ſight of one another at the battle of the wood.—Why ſhould I tire you with a deſcription of our unutterable ſorrow at the fatal news of this event, the remembrance of which now fills my aged eyes with tears? When our grief ſubſided a little, and reflection came to our aid, we found ourſelves deſerted by the whole world, and in danger of periſhing for want: whereupon we made application for the penſion, and were put upon the liſt.

                     <p>The whole behaviour of this venerable perſon, was ſo primitive, innocent, ſenſible, and humane, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a filial reſpect for her, and begged her advice with regard to my future conduct, as ſoon as I was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to act for myſelf.—She diſſuaded me from a deſign I had formed of travelling to London in hopes of retriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my clothes and pay, by returning to my ſhip, which by this time, I read in a news-paper, was ſafely arrived in the river Thames. "Becauſe," ſaid ſhe, <q>you run the hazard of being treated not only as a deſerter in quitting the ſloop, but alſo as a mutineer in aſſaulting your commanding officer, to the malice of whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge you will be moreover expoſed.</q>—She then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to recommend me as a ſervant to a ſingle lady of her acquaintance, who lived in the neighbourhood, with her nephew, who was a young fox-hunter of great fortune, where I might be very happy, provided I could bear with the diſpoſition and manners of my miſtreſs, which was ſomewhat whimſical and particular.—But above all things ſhe counſelled me to conceal my ſtory, the knowledge of which would effectually poiſon my entertainment: for it was a maxim among moſt people of condition, that no gentleman in diſtreſs ought to be admitted into a family, as a domeſtic, leſt he become proud, lazy, and inſolent.—I was fain to embrace this humble propoſal, becauſe my affairs were deſperate; and in a few days was hired by this lady, to ſerve in quality of her footman; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by my hoſteſs, as a young man, who, having been ſent to ſea by his relations againſt his inclination, was ſhipwrecked and robbed, which had increaſed his diſguſt to that way of life ſo much, that he rather choſe to go to ſervice on ſhore than enter himſelf on board of any other ſhip.—Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to a degree of ſluttiſhneſs: this negligence, together with her contempt for the male part of the creation, gives her nephew no great concern, as by theſe means he will probably keep her fortune, which is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in the family. He therefore permits her to live in her own way, which is ſomething extraordinary, and gratifies her in all her whimſical deſires.—Her apartment is at ſome diſtance from the other inhabited parts of the houſe; and conſiſts of a dining-room, bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber and ſtudy: ſhe keeps a cook-maid, waiting-woman, and footman of her own, and ſeldom eats or converſes with any of the family, but her neice, who is a very lovely creature, and humours her aunt often to the prejudice of her own health, by ſitting up with her whole nights together; for your miſtreſs is too much of a philoſopher to be ſwayed by the cuſtoms of the world, and never ſleeps or eats as other people do.—Among other odd notions, ſhe profeſſes the principles of Roſicrucius, and believes the earth, air, and ſea are inhabited by inviſible beings, with whom it is poſſible for the human ſpecies to entertain correſpondence and intimacy, on the eaſy condition of living chaſte.—As ſhe hopes one day to be admitted into the acquaintance of this kind, ſhe no ſooner heard of me and my cat, than ſhe paid me a viſit, with a view, as ſhe has ſince owned, to be introduced to my familiar; and was greatly mortified to find herſelf diſappointed in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. Being, by this viſionary turn of mind, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted as it were from the world, ſhe cannot advert to the common occurrences of life; and therefore is frequently ſo abſent as to commit very ſtrange miſtakes and extravagances, which you will do well to rectify and repair, as your prudence ſhall ſuggeſt.</q>

How often did I curſe the ſervile ſtation, that placed me ſo infinitely beneath the regard of this idol of my admiration! and how often did I bleſs my fate, that enabled me to enjoy daily the ſight of ſo much perfection!

When I had ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her in this, ſhe expreſſed a deſire of knowing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my fortune both before and ſince my being ſhipwrecked: hereupon (as Mrs. Sagely had counſelled me) I told her, that I had been bound 'prentice to the maſter of a ſhip, contrary to my inclination, which ſhip had foundered at ſea; and I and four more; who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be on deck when ſhe went down, made ſhift to ſwim to the ſhore, where my companions, after having overpowered me, ſtript me to the ſhirt, and left me, as they imagined, dead of the wounds I received in my own defence: then I related the circumſtances of my being found in a barn, with the inhuman treatment I met with from the country people and parſon; which I perceived drew tears from the charming creature's eyes!

aſſented, with a compliment to my inderſtanding in the ſame language, that flattered my vanity extremely.</p>
                     <p>The converſation, among other ſubjects, turned upon the young 'ſquire, whom my lady enquired after under the title of the Savage; and was informed by her niece, that he was ſtill in bed, repairing the fatigue of laſt night's debauch, and recruiting ſtrength and ſpirits to undergo a ſox-chaſe to-morrow morning, in company with Sir Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy Thicket, 'Squire Bumper, and a great many other gentlemen of the ſame ſtamp, whom he had invited on that occaſion; ſo that by day-break the whole houſe would be in an uproar.—This was a very diſagreeable piece of news to the <hi>virtuoſo,</hi> who proteſted ſhe would ſtuff her ears with cotton when ſhe went to bed, and take a doſe of opium to make her ſleep the more ſound, that ſhe might not be diſturbed and diſtracted by the clamour of the brutes.</p>
                     <p>When their dinner was over, I and my fellow-ſervants ſat down to ours in the kitchen, where I underſtood that Sir Timothy Thicket was a wealthy knight in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, between whom and Narciſſa a match had been projected by her brother, who propoſed at the ſame time to eſpouſe Sir Timothy's ſiſter, by which means, as their fortunes were pretty equal, the young ladies would be provided for and their brothers be never the poorer; but the ladies did not concur in the ſcheme, each of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining a hearty contempt for the perſon allotted to her for a huſband by this agreement. This information begat in me a mortal averſion to Sir Timothy, whom I looked upon as my rival, and curſed in my heart for his preſumption. Next morning by day-break, being awakened by the noiſe of the hunters and hounds, I got up to view the cavalcade, and had a ſight of my competitor, whoſe accompliſhments (the eſtate excluded) did not ſeem bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant enough to give me much uneaſineſs with reſpect to Narciſſa, who, I flattered myſelf, was not to be won by ſuch qualifications as he was maſter of, either as to perſon or mind. My miſtreſs, notwithſtanding her precaution, was ſo much diſturbed by her nephew's company, that ſhe did not riſe till five o'clock in the afternoon: ſo that I had an opportunity of examining her ſtudy at leiſure, to which I was ſtrongly prompted by my curioſity. Here I
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027715_0258_0FD5ED6C51445960"/>
ſound a thouſand ſcraps of her own poetry, conſiſting of three, four, ten, twelve, and twenty lines, on an infinity of ſubjects, which, as whim inſpired, ſhe had begun, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtancy or capacity to bring to any degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: but, what was very extraordinary in a female poet, there was not the leaſt mention made of love in any of her performances. I counted fragments of five tragedies, the titles of which were, <q>The ſtern Philoſopher—The double Murder—The ſacrilegious Traitor—The Fall of Lucifer—and the Laſt Day</q>—From whence I gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that her diſpoſition was gloomy, and her imagination delighted with objects of horror. Her library was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the beſt Engliſh hiſtorians, poets, and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, of all the French critics and poets, and of a few books in Italian, chiefly poetry, at the head of which were Taſſo and Arioſto, pretty much uſed—beſides theſe, tranſlations of the claſſics into French, but not one book in Greek or Latin; a circumſtance that diſcovered her ignorance of theſe languages. After having taken a full view of this collection I retired, and at the uſual time was preparing to lay the cloth, when I was told by the maid, that her miſtreſs was ſtill in bed, and had been ſo affected with the notes of the hounds in the morning, that ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually believed herſelf a hare beſet with the hunters, and begged a few greens to munch for her breakfaſt. When I teſtified my ſurpriſe at this unaccountable imagination, ſhe let me know that her lady was very much ſubject to whims of this nature, ſometimes fancying herſelf an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, ſometimes a piece of furniture, during which conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed transformations it was very dangerous to come near her, eſpecially when ſhe repreſented a beaſt; for that lately, in the character of a cat, ſhe had flown at her, and ſcratched h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027715_0259_0FD5ED6D99449CD8"/>
into one of which ſhe immediately diſcharged the cauſe of her diſtemper. I was alſo informed, that nothing contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſo much to the recovery of her reaſon as muſic, which was alſo adminiſtered on thoſe occaſions by Narciſſa, who played perfectly well on the harpſichord, and to whom ſhe (the maid) was juſt then going to intimate her aunt's diſorder. She was no ſooner gone than I was ſummoned by the bell to my lady's chamber, where I found her ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſquat on her hams on the floor, in the manner of puſs when ſhe liſtens to the cries of her purſuers. When I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ſhe ſtarted up with an alarmed look, and ſprung to the other ſide of the room to avoid me, whom, without doubt, ſhe miſtook for a beagle thirſting after her life.—Perceiving her extreme confuſion, I retired, and on the ſtair-caſe met the adorable Narciſſa coming up, to whom I imparted the ſituation of my miſtreſs: ſhe ſaid not a word, but, ſmiling with unſpeakable grace, went into her aunt's apartment, and in a little time my ears were raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the effects of her ſkill. She accompanied the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with a voice ſo ſweet and melodious, that I did not wonder at the ſurpriſing change it produced on the ſpirits of my miſtreſs, which were ſoon compoſed to peace and ſober reflection.</p>
                     <p>About ſeven o'clock the hunters arrived with the ſkins of two foxes and one badger, carried before them as tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their ſucceſs; and when they were about to ſit down to dinner, (or ſupper,) Sir Timothy Thicket deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Narciſſa would honour the table with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: but this, notwithſtanding her brother's threats and entreaties, ſhe refuſed, on pretence of attending on her aunt who was indiſpoſed; ſo that I enjoyed the ſatisfaction of ſeeing my rival mortified: but this diſappointment made no great impreſſion on him, who conſoled himſelf with the bottle, of which the whole company become ſo much ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, that after a moſt horrid uproar of laughing, ſinging, ſwearing, dancing, and fighting, they were all carried to bed in a ſtate of utter oblivion. My duty being altogether detached from the ſquire and his family, I led a pretty eaſy and comfortable life, drinking daily intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating draughts of love from the charms of Narciſſa, which brightened on my contemplation, every day, more and more. Inglorious as my ſtation was, I became blind to

my own unworthineſs, and even conceived hopes of one day enjoying this amiable creature, whoſe affability greatly encouraged theſe preſumptuous thoughts.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>DURING this ſeaſon of love and tranquillity, my muſe which had lain dormant ſo long, awoke, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſeveral ſmall performances on the ſubject of my flame: but, as it concerned me nearly to remain undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in my real character and ſentiments, I was under a neceſſity of mortifying my deſire of praiſe, by confining my works to my own peruſal and applauſe. In the mean time I ſtrove to inſinuate myſelf into the good opinion of both ladies, and ſucceeded ſo well by my diligence and dutiful behaviour, that in a little time I was at leaſt a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſervant, and frequently enjoyed the pleaſure of hearing myſelf mentioned in French and Italian with ſome degree of warmth and ſurprize, by the deareſt object of all my wiſhes, as a perſon who had ſo much of the gentleman in my appearance and diſcourſe, that ſhe could not for her ſoul treat me like a common lacquey. My prudence and modeſty were not long proof againſt theſe bewitching com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments. One day, while I waited at dinner, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation turned upon a knotty paſſage of Taſſo's Gieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, which it ſeems had puzzled them both. After a great many unſatisfactory conjectures, my miſtreſs, taking the book out of her pocket, turned to the place in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and read the ſentence over and over without ſucceſs; at length, deſpairing of finding the author's meaning, ſhe turned to me, ſaying, <q>Come hither, Bruno; let us ſee what fortune will do for us: I will interpret to thee what goes before and what follows in this obſcure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph, the particular words of which I will alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that thou may'ſt, by comparing one with the

other, gueſs the ſenſe of that which perplexes us.</q> I was too vain to let ſlip this opportunity of diſplaying my talents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, without heſitation, read and explained the whole of that which had diſconcerted them, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſtoniſhment of both. Narciſſa's face and lovely neck were overſpread with bluſhes, from which I drew a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able omen, while her aunt, after having ſtared at me a good while with a look of amazement, exclaimed, <q>In the name of Heaven, who art thou?</q>—I told her I had picked up a ſmattering of Italian during a voyage up the Straits. At this ſhe ſhook her head, and obſerved, that no ſmatterer could read as I had done. She then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know if I underſtood French, to which I anſwered in the affirmative: ſhe aſked if I was acquainted with the Latin and Greek; I replied, "A little."—"O ho!" continued ſhe, <q>and with philoſophy and mathematics, I ſuppoſe?</q>—I owned I knew ſomething of each—whereupon ſhe repeated her ſtare and interrogation. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repent my vanity, and, in order to repair the fault I had committed, ſaid, it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable education, becauſe learning was ſo cheap in my country, that every peaſant was a ſcholar; but I hoped her ladyſhip would think my underſtanding no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to my character.

After breakfaſt, my lady, who was a true author, bid me follow her into the ſtudy, where ſhe expreſſed herſelf thus: <q>Since you are ſo learned, you cannot be void of taſte; therefore I am to deſire your opinion of a ſmall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in poetry, which I lately compoſed. You muſt know I have planned a tragedy, the ſubject of which ſhall be the murder of a prince before the altar,

where he is buſy at his devotions. After the deed is perpetrated, the regicide will harangue the people, with the bloody dagger in his hand, and I have already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a ſpeech, which I think will ſuit the character extremely—Here it is.</q> Then, taking up a ſcrap of paper, ſhe read, with violent emphaſis and geſture, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:

                           <l>And human carnage gratifies my ſight.</l>
                           <l>I drag the parent by the hoary hair,</l>

                     <p>Though I did great violence to my underſtanding in praiſing this unnatural rhapſody, I nevertheleſs extolled it as a production that of itſelf deſerved immortal fame, and beſought her ladyſhip to bleſs the world with the fruits of thoſe uncommon talents Heaven had beſtowed upon her. She ſmiled with a look of ſelf-complacency, and, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the incenſe I had offered, communicated all her poetical works, which I applauded one by one with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle candour as I had ſhewn at firſt. Satiated with my flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which I hope my ſituation juſtified, ſhe could not in conſcience refuſe me an opportunity of ſhining in my turn; and therefore, after a compliment to my nice diſcernment and taſte, obſerved, that doubtleſs I muſt have produced ſomething in that way myſelf, which ſhe deſired to ſee. This was a temptation I could by no means reſiſt. I owned that, while I was at college, I wrote ſome ſmall detached pieces at the deſire of a friend who was in love, and, at her requeſt, repeated the following verſes, which indeed my love for Narciſſa had inſpired.</p>

                     <p>Whether or not Narciſſa diſcovered my paſſion, I could not learn from her behaviour, which, though always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent to me, was henceforth more reſerved, and leſs chearful. While my thoughts aſpired to a ſphere ſo far above me, I had unwittingly made a conqueſt of the cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wench and the dairy-maid, who became <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

My good fortune did not long remain a ſecret, being diſcloſed by the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>quent broils of theſe heroines, who kept no decorum in their encounters. The coachman and gardener, who paid their devoirs to my admirers, each to his reſpective choice, alarmed at my ſucceſs, laid their heads together, in order to concert a plan of revenge; and the former having been educated at the academy of Tottenham—court, undertook to challenge me to ſingle combat; he accordingly, with many opprobrious invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, bid me defiance, and offered to box with me for twenty guineas. I told him, that, although I believed myſelf a match for him even at that work, I would not deſcend ſo far below the dignity of a gentleman as to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027715_0265_0FD5ED7DAF24C960"/>
fight like a porter; but, if he had any thing to ſay to me, I was his man at blunderbuſs, muſket, piſtol, ſword, hatchet, ſpit, cleaver, fork, or needle—nay more, that if he gave his tongue any more ſaucy liberties at my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, I would crop his ears without any ceremony. This rodomontade, delivered with a ſtern countenance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute tone, had the deſired effect upon my antagoniſt, who with ſome confuſion ſneaked off, and gave his friend an account of his reception. The ſtory taking air among the ſervants, procured for me the title of <hi>gentleman John,</hi> with which I was ſometimes honoured even by my miſtreſs and Narciſſa, who had been informed of the whole affair by the chambermaid. In the mean time the rival queens expreſſed their paſſion by all the means in their power: the cook entertained me with choice bits, the dairy-maid with ſtroakings: the firſt would often encourage me to declare myſelf, by complimenting me upon my courage and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obſerving, that, if ſhe had a huſband like me to maintain order, and keep accounts, ſhe could make a great deal of money by ſetting up an eating-houſe at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for gentlemen's ſervants on board-wages: the other courted my affection by ſhewing her own importance, and telling me, that many a ſubſtantial farmer in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood would be glad to marry her; but ſhe was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to pleaſe her eye, if ſhe ſhould plague her heart—then ſhe would launch out into the praiſe of my proper perſon, and ſay, ſhe was ſure I would make a good huſband; for I was very good-natured. I began to be uneaſy at the importunities of theſe inamoratoes, whom at another time perhaps I might have pleaſed, without the diſagreeable ſauce of matrimony; but at preſent my whole ſoul was engroſſed by Narciſſa, and I could not bear the thoughts of doing any thing derogatory of the paſſion I entertained for her.</p>

                     <p>Narciſſa went one day to viſit Miſs Thicket, who lived with her brother, within leſs than a mile of our houſe, and was perſuaded to walk home in the cool of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, accompanied by Sir Timothy, who, having a good deal of the brute in him, was inſtigated to uſe ſome unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming familiarities with her, encouraged by the ſolitarineſs of a field through which they paſſed. The lovely creature was incenſed at his rude behaviour, for which ſhe reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in ſuch a manner, that he loſt all regard to decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and actually offered violence to this pattern of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and beauty. But Heaven would not ſuffer ſo much goodneſs to be violated, and ſent me (who, paſſing by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident near the place, was alarmed with her cries) to her ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I flew like lightning to her reſcue, which he perceiving, quitted his prey, and drew his hanger to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe my preſumption. My indignation was too high to admit one thought of fear; ſo that, ruſhing upon him, I ſtruck his weapon out of his hand, and uſed my cudgel ſo ſucceſsfully, that he fell to the ground, and lay, to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, without ſenſe. Then I turned to Narciſſa, who had ſwooned; and, ſitting down by her, gently raiſed her

head, and ſupported it on my boſom, while, with one hand around her waiſt, I kept her in that poſition. My ſoul was thrilled with tumultuous joy at feeling the object of my deareſt wiſhes within my arms, and, while ſhe lay inſenſible, I could not refrain from applying my cheek to her's, and raviſhing a kiſs: in a little time the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reviſit her face, ſhe opened her enchanting eyes, and, having recollected her late ſituation, ſaid with a look full of tender acknowledgment, <q>Dear John, I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely obliged to you!</q> So ſaying, ſhe made an effort to riſe, in which I aſſiſted her, and ſhe proceeded to the houſe, leaning upon me all the way. I was a thouſand times tempted by this opportunity to declare my paſſion, but the dread of diſobliging her reſtrained my tongue. We had not got a hundred paces from the ſcene of her diſtreſs, when I perceived Sir Timothy get up and move homeward; a circumſtance which, though it gave me ſome ſatisfaction, in as much as I thereby knew I had not killed him, filled me with juſt apprehenſion of his reſentment, which I found myſelf in no condition to withſtand, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I conſidered his intimacy with our ſquire, to whom I knew he could eaſily juſtify himſelf for what he had done, by imputing it to his love, and deſiring his brother Bruin to take the ſame liberty with his ſiſter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ont any fear of offence.

I had merited nothing by barely doing my duty. She ſeemed aſtoniſhed at my diſintereſtedneſs, and bluſhed; I felt the ſame ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and with a downcaſt eye, and broken accent, told her I had one requeſt to make, which if her generoſity would grant, I ſhould think myſelf fully recompenſed for an age of miſery. She changed colour at this preamble, and with great confuſion replied, ſhe hoped my good ſenſe would hinder me from aſking any thing ſhe was bound in honour to refuſe, and therefore bid m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

immediately, and with an averted look, ſtretched it out; I imprinted on it an ardent kiſs, and, bathing it with my tears, cried, <q>Dear Madam, I am an unfortunate gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who love you to diſtraction, but would have died a thouſand deaths rather than make this declaration under ſuch a ſervile appearance, were he not determined to yield to the rigour of his fate, to fly from your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching preſence, and bury his preſumptuous paſſion in eternal ſilence.</q>—With theſe words, I roſe up and went away before ſhe could recover ſpirits ſo far as to make any reply. My firſt care was to go and conſult Mrs. Sage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with whom I had maintained a friendly correſpondence ever ſince I left her houſe. When ſhe underſtood my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the good woman with real concern condoled me on my unhappy fate, and approved of my reſolution to leave the country, being perfectly well acquainted with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous diſpoſition of my rival, "who by this time," ſaid ſhe, <q>has no doubt meditated a ſcheme of revenge. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I cannot ſee how you will be able to elude his vengeance; being himſelf in the commiſſion, he will immediately grant warrants for apprehending you; and, as almoſt all the people of this country are dependent on him or his friend, it will be impoſſible for you to find ſhelter among them: if you ſhould be apprehended, he will commit you to jail, where you may poſſibly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in great miſery till the next aſſizes, and then be tranſported for aſſaulting a magiſtrate.</q> While ſhe thus warned me of my danger, we heard a knocking at the door, which threw us both into great conſternation, as in all probability it was occaſioned by my purſuers; whereupon this generous old lady, putting two guineas into my hand, with tears in her eyes bid me, for God's ſake, get out at the back-door, and conſult my ſafety as Providence ſhould direct me. There was no time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.</p>
                     <p>I followed her advice, and eſcaped by the benefit of a dark night to the ſea-ſide, where, while I ruminated on my next excurſion, I was all of a ſudden ſurrounded by armed men, who, having bound my hands and feet, bid me make no noiſe on pain of being ſhot, and carried me on board of a veſſel, which I ſoon perceived to be a ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling cutter. This diſcovery gave me ſome ſatisfaction at
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027715_0269_0FD5ED84D98B8D00"/>
firſt, becauſe I concluded myſelf ſafe from the reſentment of Sir Timothy; but when I found myſelf in the hands of ruffians, who threatened to execute me for a ſpy, I would have thought myſelf happily quit for a year's impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or even tranſportation. It was in vain for me to proteſt my innocence; I could not perſuade them, that I had taken a ſolitary walk to their haunt, at ſuch an hour, merely for my own amuſement, and I did not think it my intereſt to diſcloſe the true cauſe of my retreat, becauſe I was afraid they would have made their peace with juſtice by ſurrendering me to the penalty of the law. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their ſuſpicion, was the appearance of a cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe yacht, which gave them chace, and had well nigh made a prize of their veſſel; when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog, which effectually ſcreened them, and favoured their arrival at Bologne. But, before they got out of ſight of their purſuer, they held a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of war about me, whom ſome of the moſt ferocious among them would have thrown over-board as a traitor who had betrayed them to their enemies; but others, more conſiderate, alledged, that if they put me to death, and ſhould afterwards be taken, they could expect no mercy from the legiſlature, which would never pardon outlawry aggravated by murder. It was therefore determined by a plurality of votes, that I ſhould be ſet on ſhore in France, and left to find my paſſage back to England as I ſhould think proper, which would be puniſhment ſufficient for the bare ſuſpicion of a crime in itſelf not capital. Although this favourable determination gave me great pleaſure, the apprehenſion of being robbed would not ſuffer me to be perfectly at eaſe: to prevent this calamity, as ſoon as I was untied in conſequence of the aforeſaid deciſion, I tore a ſmall hole in one of my ſtockings, into which I dropped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ix guineas, reſerving half a piece and ſome ſilver in my pocket, that, finding ſomething, they might not be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make any farther inquiry. This was a very neceſſary precaution; ſor, when we came in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight of the French ſhore, one of the ſmugglers told me I muſt pay for my paſſage. To this I replied, that my paſſage was none of my own ſeeking, therefore they could not expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from me for tranſporting me into a ſtrange country by force.—"Damme!" ſaid the outlaw, <q>none of your

palaver; but let me ſee what money you have got.</q> So ſaying, he thruſt his hand into my pocket without any ceremony, and emptied it of the contents; then caſting an eye at my hat and wig, which captivated his fancy, he took them off, and, clapping his own on my head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that a fair exchange was no robbery.

At ſome diſtance from them, I perceived ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon in the ſame garb, ſitting in a penſive, ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, entertaining himſelf with a whiff of tobacco, from the ſtump of a pipe as black as jet. The appearance of diſtreſs never failed to attract my regard and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I approached this forlorn tar, with a view to offer him my aſſiſtance, and notwithſtanding the alteration of dreſs, and diſguiſe of a long beard, I diſcovered in him my long loſt and lamented uncle and benefactor, Liente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Bowling!

minutes hearing in another room; but he would by no means conſent to this propoſal, ſaying, <q>Avaſt there, friend; none of your tricks upon travellers; if you have any thing to ſay to me, do it above-board; you need not be afraid of being over-heard; here are none who underſtand our lingo.</q>—Though I was loth to diſcover myſelf before company, I could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from telling him, I was his own nephew Roderick Random. On this information, he conſidered me with great earneſtneſs and aſtoniſhment, and recalling my fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which, though enlarged, were not entirely altered ſince he had ſeen me, came up and ſhook me by the hand very cordially, proteſting he was glad to ſee me well. After ſome pauſe, he went on thus: <q>And yet, my lad, I am ſorry to ſee you under ſuch colours; the more ſo, as it is not in my power, at preſent, to change them for the better, times being very hard with me.</q>—With theſe words I could perceive a tear trickle down his furrowed cheeks, which affected me ſo much, that I wept bitterly.—Imagining my ſorrow was the effect of my misfortunes, he comforted me, by obſerving that life was a voyage in which we muſt expect to meet with all weathers: ſometimes it was calm, ſometimes rough; that a fair gale often ſucceeded a ſtorm: that the wind did not always ſit one way, and that deſpair ſignified nothing: but reſolution and ſkill were better than a ſtout veſſel: for why? becauſe they require no carpenter, and grow ſtronger the more labour they undergo. I dried up my tears, which I aſſured him were not ſhed for my own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but for his, and begged leave to accompany him into another room, where we could converſe more at our eaſe.—There I recounted to him the ungenerous uſage I had met with from Potion; at which he ſtarted up, ſtalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acroſs the room three or four times, in a great hurry, and graſping his cudgel, cried, <q>I would I were along-aſide of him!—that's all.—I would I were along-ſide of him!</q>—I then gave him a detail of all my adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſufferings, which affected him more than I could have imagined; and concluded with telling him that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Oakhum was ſtill alive, and that he might return to England when he would, to ſolicit his affairs, without danger or moleſtation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—He was wonderfully pleaſed at
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027715_0272_0FD5ED8914274188"/>
this piece of information, of which, however, he ſaid he could not at preſent avail himſelf, for want of money to pay for his paſſage to London. This objection I ſoon removed, by putting five guineas into his hand, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, I thought myſelf extremely happy in having an opportunity of manifeſting my gratitude to him in his neceſſity.—But it was with the utmoſt difficulty I could prevail upon him to accept of two, which he affirmed, were more than ſufficient to pay the neceſſary expence.—After this friendly conteſt was over, he propoſed we ſhould have a meſs of ſomething: "For," ſaid he, <q>it has been banyan day with me a great while.—You muſt know I was ſhipwrecked five days ago, near a place called Luſieux, in company with thoſe Dutchmen who are now drinking below; and having but little money when I came a-ſhore, it was ſoon ſpent, becauſe I let them have ſhare and ſhare while it laſted.—Howſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhould have remembered the old ſaying, <hi>Every hog his own apple:</hi> for when they found my hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed they went all hands to ſhooling and begging; and becauſe I would not take a ſpell at the ſame duty, refuſed to give me the leaſt aſſiſtance; ſo that I have not broke bread theſe two days.</q> I was ſhocked at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his diſtreſs, and ordered ſome bread, cheeſe, and wine to be brought immediately, to allay his hunger, until a fricaſſee of chickens could be prepared.—When he had recruited his ſpirits with this homely fare, I deſired to know the particulars of his peregrination, ſince the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at Cape Tiberoon; which were briefly theſe: the money he had about him being all ſpent at Port Louis, the civility and hoſpitality of the French cooled to ſuch a degree, that he was obliged to liſt on board of one of their king's ſhips, as a common foremaſtman, to prevent himſelf from ſtarving on ſhore.—In this ſituation he continued two years, during which time he had acquired ſome knowledge of their language, and the reputation of a good ſeaman: the ſhip he belonged to was ordered home to Old France, where ſhe was laid up as unfit for ſervice, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on board of one of Monſieur D'Antin's ſquadron, in quality of quarter-maſter; which office he performed in a voyage to the Weſt-Indies, where they engaged with our ſhip, as before related; but his conſcience upbraiding

I thought I perceived a great deal of ſweetneſs and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his countenance; therefore he had no ſooner alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than I accoſted him, and in a few words explained my ſituation: he liſtened with great politeneſs, and, when I had made an end of my ſtory, ſaid, <q>Well, monſieur, what would you have me do?</q>—I was effectually abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this interrogation, which I believed no man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe or generoſity could make, and made no other reply than a low bow: he returned the compliment ſtill lower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tripped into an apartment, while the landlord let me know, that my ſtanding there to interrupt company gave offence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

humanity to my miſerable carcaſe. A thouſand times I wiſhed myſelf a bear, that I might retreat to woods and deſerts, far from the inhoſpitable haunts of man, where I could live by my own talons, independent of treacherous friends and ſupercilious ſcorn.</p>
                     <p>As I lay in this manner, groaning over my hapleſs fate, I heard the ſound of a violin, and, raiſing my head, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a company of men and women dancing on the graſs at ſome diſtance from me. I looked upon this to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſeaſon for diſtreſs to attract compaſſion, when every ſelfiſh thought is baniſhed, and the heart dilated with mirth and ſocial joy; wherefore I got up, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached thoſe happy people, whom I ſoon diſcovered to be a party of ſoldiers, with their wives and children, unbend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diverting themſelves at this rate after the fatigue of a march. I had never before ſeen ſuch a parcel of ſcare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crows together, neither could I reconcile their meagre gaunt looks, their ſqualid and ragged attire, and every other external ſymptom of extreme woe, with this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of feſtivity. I ſaluted them, however, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great politeneſs: after which they formed a ring, and danced round me. This jollity had a wonderful effect upon my ſpirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was infected with their gaiety, and in ſpite of my diſmal ſituation, forgot my cares, and joined in their extravagance. When we had recreated ourſelves a good while at this diverſion, the ladies ſpread their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuas on the ground, upon which they emptied their knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks of ſome onions, coarſe bread, and a few flaſks of poor wine: being invited to a ſhare of the banquet, I ſat down with the reſt, and in the whole courſe of my life never made a more comfortable meal. When our repaſt was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we got up again to dance; and, now that I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf refreſhed, I behaved to the admiration of every body: I was lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Having therefore maturely weighed the circumſtances <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> I ſignified my conſent, and was admitted into the regiment of Picardy, ſaid to be the oldeſt corps in Europe. The company, to which this command belonged, was quartered at a village not far off, whither we marched next day, and I was preſented to my captain, who ſeemed very well pleaſed with my appearance, gave me a crown to drink, and ordered me to be accommodated with clothes, arms, and accoutrements: whereupon I ſold my livery ſuit, purchaſed linen, and, as I was at great pains to learn the exerciſe, in a very ſhort time became a complete ſoldier.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before we received orders to join ſeveral more regiments, and march with all expedition into Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, in order to reinforce Mareſchal Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We began our march accordingly, and I then became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that part of a ſoldier's life to which I had been hitherto a ſtranger. It is impoſſible to deſcribe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> hunger and thirſt I ſuſtained, and the fatigue I underwent in a march of ſo many hundred miles, during which I was ſo much chafed with the heat and motion of my limbs, that in a very ſhort time the inſide of my thighs and legs were deprived of ſkin, and I proceeded in the utmoſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orture. This misfortune I owed to the plumpneſs of my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I curſed, and envied the withered conditions of my comrades, whoſe bodies could not ſpare juice enough to ſupply a common iſſue, and were indeed proof againſt all manner of friction. The continual pain I felt made me fretful, and my peeviſhneſs was increaſed by the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my pride in ſeeing thoſe miſerable wretches, whom a hard gale of wind would have ſcattered through the air like chaff, bear thoſe toils with alacrity under which I was ready to ſink.</p>
                     <p>One day while we enjoyed a halt, and the ſoldiers with their wives had gone out to dance according to cuſtom, my comrade ſtaid at home with me on pretence of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and inſulted me with his pity and conſolation! He told me, though I was young and tender at preſent, I would ſoon be ſeaſoned to the ſervice, and he did not doubt but I ſhould have the honour to contribute in ſome

meaſure to the glory of the king.—<q>Have courage, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my child,</q> ſaid he, <q>and pray to the good God, that you may be as happy as I am, who have had the honour of ſerving Lewis the Great, and of receiving many wounds in helping to eſtabliſh his glory.</q> When I looked upon the contemptible object that pronounced theſe words, I was amazed at the infatuation that poſſeſſed him, and could not help expreſſing my aſtoniſhment at the abſurdity of a rational being, who thinks himſelf highly honoured in being permitted to encounter abject poverty, oppreſſion, famine, diſeaſe, mutilation, and evident death, merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince, by whom his ſufferings were diſregarded, and his name ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unknown. I obſerved, that if his ſituation was the conſequence of compulſion, as having been preſſed into the ſervice, I would praiſe his patience and fortitude in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his lot—if he had taken up arms in defence of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured country, he was to be applauded for his patriotiſm—or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge from a greater evil, he was juſtifiable in his own conſcience, (though I could have no notion of miſery more extreme than that he ſuffered;) but to put his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his prince, was no more than profeſſing himſelf a deſperate ſlave, who voluntarily underwent the utmoſt wretchedneſs and peril, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the moſt flagrant crimes, to ſooth the barbarous pride of a fellow-creature, his ſuperior in nothing but the power he derived from the ſubmiſſion of ſuch wretches as him. The ſoldier was very much affronted at the liberty I took with his king, which he ſaid nothing but my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance could excuſe: he affirmed, that, the characters of princes were ſacred, and ought not to be pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

natural right to liberty, that allegiance and protection are reciprocal, that, when the mutual ties are broken by the tyranny of the king, he is accountable to the people for his breach of contract, and ſubject to the penalty of the law, and that thoſe inſurrections of the Engliſh, which are branded with the name of rebellion by the ſlaves of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, were no other than glorious efforts to reſcue that independence, which was their birth-right, from the ravenous claws of uſurping ambition. The Frenchman, provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name, loſt all patience, and reproached me in ſuch a manner, that my temper forſook me, and I clenched my fiſt, with an intention to give him an hearty box on the ear. Perceiving my deſign, he ſtarted back, and demanded a parley; upon which I checked my indignation, and he gave me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that a Frenchman never forgave a blow; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if I was not weary of my life, I would do well to ſpare him that mortification, and do him the honour of meaſuring his ſword with mine like a gentleman. I took his advice, and followed him to a field hard by, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I was aſhamed at the pitiful figure of my antagoniſt, who was a poor, little, ſhivering creature, decrepid with age, and blind of one eye. But I ſoon found the folly of judging from appearance, being at the ſecond paſs wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſword-hand, and immediately diſarmed with ſuch a jerk, that I thought the joint was diſlocated. I was no leſs confounded than enraged at this event, eſpecially as my adverſary did not bear his ſucceſs with all the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that might have been expected; for he inſiſted upon my aſking pardon for my affronting his king and him. This I would by no means comply with, but told him, it was a mean condeſcenſion, which no gentleman in his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ought to propoſe, and none in my ſituation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form;—and, if he perſiſted in his ungenerous demand, I would in my turn claim ſatisfaction with my muſket, at which weapon we ſhould be more upon a par than with the ſword, of which he ſeemed ſo much maſter.</p>

The ſame day an Iriſh drummer, having heard my misfortune, viſited me, and, after having condoled me on the chance of war, gave me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he was maſter of the ſword, and would in a very ſhort time inſtruct me ſo thoroughly in that noble ſcience, that I ſhould be able to chaſtiſe the old Gaſcon for his inſolent boaſting at my expence. This friendly office he proffered on pretence of the regard he had for his countrymen; but I afterwards learned, the true motive was no other than a jealouſy he entertained of a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between the Frenchman and his wife, which he did not think proper to reſent in perſon. Be this as it will, I accepted his offer, and practiſed his leſſons with ſuch application, that I ſoon believed myſelf a match for my conqueror. In the mean time we continued our march, and arrived at the camp of Mareſchal Noailles the night before the battle of Dettingen.

have paſſed at a great diſadvantage, or remain where they were, and periſh for want of proviſion, if they would not condeſcend to ſurrender at diſcretion. How they ſuffered themſelves to be pent up in this manner, it is not my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to relate; I ſhall only obſerve, that, when we had taken poſſeſſion of our ground, I heard an old officer, in converſation with another, profeſs a ſurpriſe at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Lord Stair, who had the reputation of a good general. But it ſeems, at this time, that nobleman was over-ruled, and only acted in an inferior character; ſo that no part of the blame could be imputed to him, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his diſapprobation of the ſtep, in conſequence of which the whole army was in the utmoſt danger: but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or deſtiny acted miracles in their behalf, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the royal clemency of the king of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who headed the allies in perſon, and, no doubt, put a ſtop to the carnage, our loſs amounted to five thouſand men, among whom were many officers of diſtinction. Our miſcarriage opened a paſſage for the foe to Hanau, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they immediately marched, leaving their ſick and wounded to the care of the French, who next day took poſſeſſion of the field of battle, buried the dead, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the living with humanity. This was a great conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, who thence took occaſion to claim the victory, and the genius of the French nation never appeared more conſpicuous than now, in the rodomontades they uttered on the ſubject of their generoſity and courage; every man, by his own account, performed feats that would have ecliſped all the heroes of antiquity.

aſſumed the character of a deſperate ſtag that turns upon the hounds, and keeps them at bay. There was not a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſoldier engaged, who had not by the proweſs of his ſingle arm, demoliſhed a whole platoon, or put a ſquadron of horſe to flight; and, among others, the meagre Gaſcon extolled his exploits above thoſe of Hercules or Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne. As I ſtill retained my reſentment for the diſgrace I ſuffered in my laſt rencontre with him, and, now that I thought myſelf qualified, I longed for an opportunity to retrieve my honour; I magnified the valour of the Engliſh with all the hyperboles I could imagine, and decried the puſillanimity of the French in the ſame ſtyle, comparing them to hares flying be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was ſtung to the quick by this ſarcaſm, and, with an air of threatening diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, bid me know myſelf better, and remember the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection I had already received from him for my inſolence; for he might not always be in the humour of ſparing a wretch who abuſed his goodneſs. To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick in the breech, which overturned him in an inſtant. He ſtarted up with wonderful agility, and, drawing his ſword, attacked me with great fury: ſeveral people interpoſed; but, when he informed them of its being an affair of honour, they retired, and left us to decide the battle by ourſelves. I ſuſtained his onſet with little damage, having only received a ſmall ſcratch on my right ſhoulder, and, ſeeing his breath and vigour almoſt exhauſted, aſſaulted him in my turn, cloſed with him, and wreſted the ſword out of his hand in the ſtruggle. Having thus acquired the victory, I deſired him to beg his life; to which demand he made no anſwer, but ſhrugged up his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his ears, expanded his hands, elevated the ſkin of his forehead and eye-brows, and depreſſed the corners of his mouth in ſuch a manner, that I could ſcarce reſrain from laughing aloud at his groteſque appearance. That I might, however, mortify his vanity, which had triumphed without bounds over my misfortune, I thruſt his ſword up to the hilt in ſomething (it was not a tanſy) that lay ſmoking on the plain, and joined the reſt of the ſoldiers with an air of tranquillity and indifference.</p>

There was nothing more of moment attempted by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the armies during the remaining part of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, which being ended, the Engliſh marched back to the Netherlands; part of our army was detached to French Flanders, and our regiment ordered into winter-quarters in Champaigne. It was the fate of the grenadier company, to which I now belonged, to lie at Rheims, where I found myſelf in the utmoſt want of every-thing. My pay, which amounted to five ſols a-day, far from ſupplying me with neceſſaries, was ſcarce ſufficient to procure a wretched ſubſiſtence to keep ſoul and body together; ſo that I was, by hunger and hard duty, brought down to the meagre condition of my fellow-ſoldiers, and my linen reduced from three tolerable ſhirts to two pair of ſleeves and necks, the bodies having been long ago converted into ſpatterdaſhes; and after all I was better provided than any private man in the regiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this urgency of my affairs, I wrote to my uncle in England, though my hopes from that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were not at all ſanguine for the reaſons I have already explained, and in the mean time had recourſe to my old remedy patience, conſoling myſelf with the flattering ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of a lively imagination, that never abandoned me in my diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>One day, while I ſtood centinel at the gate of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-officer, a certain nobleman came to the door, followed by a gentleman in mourning, to whom at parting I heard him ſay, "You may depend upon my good offices." This aſſurance was anſwered by a low bow of the perſon in black, who, turning to go away, diſcovered to me the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual countenance of my old friend and adherent Strap. I was ſo much aſtoniſhed at the ſight that I loſt the power of utterance, and, before I could recollect my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was gone without taking any notice of me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, had he ſtaid, I ſcarcely ſhould have ventured to accoſt him, becauſe, though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features of his face, I could not be poſitively certain as to the reſt of his perſon, which was very much altered for the better ſince he left me at London; neither could I conjecture by what means he was enabled to appear in the ſphere of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

therefore took the firſt opportunity of aſking the porter if he knew the gentleman to whom the marquis ſpoke? The Swiſs told me his name was Monſieur d'Eſtrapes, that he had been valet de chambre to an Engliſh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lately deceaſed, and that he was very much regarded by the marquis for his fidelity to his maſter, between whom and that nobleman a very intimate friendſhip had ſubſiſted. Nothing could be more agreeable to me than this piece of intelligence, which baniſhed all doubt of its being my friend, who had found means to Frenchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As ſoon, therefore, as I was relieved, I went to his lodging accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a direction given me by the Swiſs, and had the good fortune to find him at home. That I might ſurpriſe him the more, I concealed my name and buſineſs, and only deſired the ſervant of the houſe to tell Monſieur d'Eſtrapes, that I begged the honour of half an hour's converſation with him. He was confounded and diſmayed at this meſſage, when he underſtood it was ſent by a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, though he was conſcious to himſelf of no crime: all that he had heard of the Baſtile appeared to his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with aggravated horror, and it was not before I had waited a conſiderable time, that he had reſolution enough to bid the ſervant ſhew me up ſtairs. When I entered his chamber, he returned my bow with great civility, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by a forced complaiſance to diſguiſe his fear, which appeared in the paleneſs of his face, the wildneſs of his looks, and the ſhaking of his limbs. I was diverted at his conſternation, which redoubled when I told him in French, I had buſineſs for his private ear, and demanded a particular audience. The valet being withdrawn, I aſked in the ſame language, if his name was d'Eſtrapes? To which he anſwered with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Why did you conſent to my leaving you?—But I knew the reaſon—you thought you had got more creditable friends, and grew aſhamed of my acquaintance—Ah! Lord help us! though I was a little ſhort-ſighted, I was not altogether blind—and, though I did not complain, I was not the leſs ſenſible of your unkindneſs, which was indeed the only thing that induced me to ramble abroad, the Lord knows whither; but I muſt own it has been a lucky ramble for me, and ſo I forgive you, and may God forgive you.—O L—d! O L—d! is it come to this?</q>—I was nettled at the charge, which, though juſt, I could not help thinking unſeaſonable, and told him with ſome tartneſs, that, whether his ſuſpicions were ill or well grounded, he might have choſen a more convenient opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing them, and that the queſtion now was, whether or no he found himſelf diſpoſed to lend me any aſſiſtance.—"Diſpoſed!" replied he with great emotion; <q>I thought you had known me ſo well as to aſſure yourſelf, without aſking, that I and all that belongs to me are at your command. In the mean time you ſhall dine with me, and I will tell you ſomething that perhaps will not be diſpleaſing to you.</q>—Then, wringing my hand, he ſaid, "It makes my heart bleed to ſee you in that garb!" I thanked him for his invitation, which, I obſerved, could not be unwelcome to a perſon who had not eaten a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable meal theſe ſeven months; but I had another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to make, which I begged he would grant before dinner, and that was the loan of a ſhirt—for, although my back had been many weeks a ſtranger to any comfort of that kind, my ſkin was not yet quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I was raviſhed at this piece of good news, and, having accommodated myſelf in a moment, hugged my benefactor for his generous offer, ſaying I was overjoyed to find him undebanched by proſperity, which ſeldom fails of corrupting the heart. He beſpoke for dinner ſome ſoup and bouille, a couple of pullets roaſted, and a diſh of aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragus, and in the interim entertained me with biſcuit and Burgundy; after which repaſt, he entreated me to gratify his longing deſire of knowing every circumſtance of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſince his departure from London. This I complied with, beginning at the adventure of Gawky, and relating every particular event in which I had been concerned from that day to the preſent hour. During the recital, my friend was ſtrongly affected, according to the various ſituations deſcribed; he ſtarted with ſurpriſe, glowed with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gaped with curioſity, ſmiled with pleaſure, trembled with fear, and wept with ſorrow, as the viciſſitudes of my life inſpired theſe different paſſions; and, when my ſtory was ended, ſignified his amazement on the whole by lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his eyes and hands, and proteſting, that, though I was a young man, I had ſuffered more than all the bleſſed martyrs.</p>

of Strap, who had been very happy in his ſervice, and given ſuch ſatisfaction, that his maſter on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed recommended him to ſeveral perſons of diſtinction for his diligence, ſobriety, and affection, and left him by will his wearing apparel, gold-watch, ſword, rings, ready money, and all the moveables he had in France, to the value of three hundred pounds, "which I now," ſaid he, <q>in the ſight of God and man, ſurrender to your abſolute diſpoſal: here are my keys; take them, I beſeech you, and God give you joy of the poſſeſſion.</q> My brain was almoſt turned with this ſudden change of fortune, which I could ſcarce believe real; however, I poſitively refuſed this extravagant proffer of my friend, and put him in mind of my being a ſoldier; at which he ſtarted, crying, <q>Odſo! that's true—We muſt procure your diſcharge—I have ſome intereſt with a nobleman who is able to do me that favour.</q> We conſulted about this affair, and it was determined, that Monſieur d'Eſtrapes ſhould wait upon the marquis in the morning, and tell him he had by accident found his brother, whom he had not ſeen for many years before, a private ſoldier in the regiment of Picardy, and implore that nobleman's intereſt for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. In the mean time we enjoyed ourſelves over a bottle of good Burgundy, and ſpent the evening in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing ſchemes for our future conduct, in caſe I ſhould be ſo lucky as to get rid of the army. The buſineſs was to make ourſelves eaſy for life by means of his legacy, a taſk very difficult, and, in the uſual methods of laying out money, altogether impracticable; ſo that, after much canvaſſing, we could come to no reſolution that night, but, when we parted, recommended the matter to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attention of each other. As for my own part, I puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled my imagination to no purpoſe; when I thought of turning merchant, the ſmallneſs of our ſtock, and the riſk of ſeas, enemies, and markets, deterred me from that ſcheme. If I ſhould ſettle as a ſurgeon in my own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I would find the buſineſs already overſtocked, or, if I pretended to ſet up in England, muſt labour under want of friends, and powerful oppoſition, obſtacles unſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the moſt ſhining merit; neither ſhould I ſucceed in my endeavours to riſe in the ſtate, inaſmuch as I could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers, nor proſtitute my

                     <p>Early in the morning, I went to the lodgings of my friend, whom I found exulting over his happy invention; for I no ſooner entered his apartment, than he addreſſed me in theſe words, with a ſmile of ſelf applauſe: <q>Well, Mr. Random, a lucky thought may come into a fool's head ſometimes—I have hit it—I'll hold you a button my plan is better than yours, for all your learning.—But you ſhall have the preference in this as in all other things; therefore proceed, and let us know the effects of your meditation—and then I will impart my own ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple excogitations.</q>—I told him, that not one thought occurred to me which deſerved the leaſt notice, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my impatience to be acquainted with the fruits of his reflection.—"As we have not," ſaid he, <q>money ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintain us during a tedious expectation, it is my opinion, that a bold puſh muſt be made, and I ſee none ſo likely to ſucceed as your appearing in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a gentleman, which is your due, and making your addreſſes to ſome lady of fortune who can render you independent at once—Nay, don't ſtare—I affirm that this ſcheme is both prudent and honourable; for I would not have you throw yourſelf away upon an old toothleſs, wheezing dame, whoſe breath would ſtink you into a conſumption in leſs than three months; neither would I adviſe you to aſſume the character of a wealthy ſquire, as your common fortune-hunters do, by which means many a poor lady is cheated into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and inſtead of enjoying the pomp and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur that was promiſed, ſees her dowry ſeized by her huſband's rapacious creditors, and herſelf reduced to miſery and deſpair.—No, I know you have a ſoul that diſdains ſuch impoſition; and are maſter of qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of mind and body, which alone entitle you to a match that will ſet you above the world.—I have clothes in my poſſeſſion, that a duke need not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wear.—I believe they will fit you as they are, if not, there are plenty of taylors in France.—Let us

                     <p>After breakfaſt, Monſieur d'Eſtrapes went to pay his devoirs to the Marquis, and was ſo ſucceſsful in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that I obtained a diſcharge in a few days, upon which we ſet out for Paris.—Here I had time to reflect and congratulate myſelf upon this ſudden tranſition of fate, which, to bear with moderation, required ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of philoſophy and ſelf-denial.—This will be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, if I give a detail of the particulars, to the quiet poſſeſſion of which I was raiſed in an inſtant, from the moſt abject miſery and contempt.—My wardrobe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of five faſhionable coats, full mounted; two of which were plain, one of cut velvet, one trimmed with gold, and another with ſilver lace; two frocks, one a white drab with large plate buttons, and the other of blue, with gold binding; one waiſtcoat of gold brocade; one of blue ſatin embroidered with ſilver; one of green ſilk, trimmed with broad figured gold lace; one of black ſilk with fring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; one of white ſatin; one of black cloth, and one of ſcarlet; ſix pair of cloth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The other move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables which I poſſeſſed by the generoſity and friendſhip of Strap, were, a gold watch with a chaſed caſe, two va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable diamond rings, two mourning ſwords, one with a ſilver handle, and a fourth cut ſteel inlaid with gold; a diamond ſtock-buckle, and a ſet of ſtone buckles for the knees and ſhoes; a pair of ſilver-mounted piſtols with

rich houſings, a gold-headed cane, and a ſnuff-box of tortoiſe-ſhell mounted with gold, having the picture of a lady in the lid.—The gentleman had left many other things of value, which my friend had converted into caſh before I met with him, ſo that over and above theſe particulars, our ſtock in ready money amounted to ſomething more than two hundred pounds.</p>
                     <p>Thus equipt, I put on the gentleman of figure, and attended by my honeſt friend, who was contented with the ſtation of my valet, viſited the Louvre, examined the gallery of Luxemburgh, and appeared at Verſailles, where I had the honor of ſeeing his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty eat a conſiderable quantity of olives.—During the month I ſpent at Paris, I went ſeveral times to court, the Italian opera, and play-houſe, danced at the maſquerade, and, in ſhort, ſaw every thing remarkable in and about the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.—After which we ſet out for England by the way of Flanders, paſſed through Bruſſels, Ghent, and Bruges, and took ſhipping at Oſtend, from whence in fourteen hours we arrived at Deal, hired a poſt-chaiſe, and in twelve hours more got ſafe to London; having diſpoſed of our heavy baggage in the waggon.</p>

This ſilly conceit intoxicated me ſo much, that I was guilty of a thouſand ridiculous coquetries, and I dare ſay, how favourable ſoever the thoughts of the company might be at my firſt appearance, they were ſoon changed by my abſurd behaviour into pity or contempt.—I roſe up and ſat down, covered and uncovered my head twenty times between the acts; pulled out my watch, clapped it to my ear, wound it up, ſet it, gave it the hearing again; diſplayed my ſnuff-box, affected to take ſnuff, that I might have an opportunity of ſhewing my brilliant, and wiped my noſe with a perfumed handkerchief;—then dangled my cane, and adjuſted my ſword-k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

My attention was engaged in ſpite of myſelf, and I could not help weeping with the heroine of the ſtage; though I practiſed a great many ſhifts to conceal this piece of impolite weakneſs.—When the play was ended, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

my complaiſance, and with a tender look declined giving me the trouble; looking at her watch, and teſtifying her ſurpriſe at the negligence of her footman, whom ſhe had ordered to have a chair ready for her at that hour.—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated my intreaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was maſter of; and in the event, ſhe was prevailed upon to accept of a propoſal I made to ſend my ſervant for a chair or coach. Accordingly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strap was detached for that purpoſe, and returned without ſucceſs, there being none to be found; by this time the play-houſe was quite empty, and we were obliged to retire: as I led her through the paſſage, I obſerved five or ſix young fellows of faſhion, ſtanding in a corner, one of whom, as I thought, tipt my charmer the wink, and when we were paſt, I heard them ſet up a loud laugh.—This arouſed my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and I was reſolved to be fully ſatisfied of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's character before I ſhould have any nearer connection with her.—As no convenience appeared, I propoſed, that I ſhould conduct her to a tavern, where we might ſtay a few minutes, till my ſervant could fetch a coach from the Strand.—She ſeemed particularly ſhy of truſting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a tavern with a ſtranger; but at laſt yielded to my pathetic r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This information, by which I was to underſtand that her huſband was a knight, did not

check my addreſſes, which became more and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and I was even hardy enough to raviſh a kiſs.—But, O heavens! inſtead of banqueting on the ambroſial flavour that her delicacy and complexion promiſed, I was almoſt ſuffocated with the ſteams of Geneva! An exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind from a mouth which had juſt before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an utter abhorrence of all ſpirituous liquors, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed my doubts into certainty, but my raptures into loathing; and it would have been impoſſible for me to have preſerved common complaiſance five minutes longer, when my ſervant returned with a coach.—I took the advantage of this occaſion, and preſented my hand to the lady, who put in practice againſt me the whole artillery of her charms, ogling, languiſhing, ſighing, and ſqueezing, with ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reſerve, that Strap perceived her tenderneſs, and rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed his hands with joy as he followed us to the door;—but I was proof againſt all her endearments, and handed her into the coach with an intention to take my leave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. She gueſſed my deſign, and invited me to her houſe, whiſpering, that now Sir John was gone to bed, ſhe could have the pleaſure of my converſation for half an hour without interruption.—I told her there was no mortification I would not undergo, rather than endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the repoſe of her ladyſhip; and bidding the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man drive on, wiſhed her a good night. She loſt all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at my indifference, and ſtopping the coach at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of about twenty yards from me, popped out her head, and bawled with the lungs of a fiſh-woman, <q>D—n you, you dog, won't you pay the coach hire?</q> I made no anſwer: upon which ſhe held forth againſt me with an eloquence peculiar to herſelf; calling me pitiful fellow, ſcoundrel, and an hundred ſuch appellations; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with an oath, that for all my appearance, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I had got no money in my pocket.</p>
                     <p>Having thus vented her indignation, ſhe ordered the coachman to proceed, and I returned to the tavern, where I beſpoke ſomething for ſupper, very well pleaſed at the iſſue of this adventure.—I diſpenſed with the attendance of the waiter at table, on pretence that my own ſervant was preſent, and when we were alone, ſaid to Strap; <q>Well, Monſieur d'Eſtrapes, what d'ye think of this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</q> My friend, who had not opened his mouth ſince
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027715_0301_0FD5EDCA9DDD85E8"/>
her departure, could make no other anſwer than the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllable, "Think!" which he pronounced with a note of fear and aſtoniſhment.—Surpriſed at this emphaſis, I ſurveyed my valet, and, perceiving a wildneſs in his looks, aſked if he had ſeen his grandfather's ghoſt?—"Ghoſt!" ſaid he, <q>I am ſure I have ſeen a devil incarnate! Who would have thought that ſo much deviliſh malice and Billingſgate, could lurk under ſuch ſweetneſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and modeſty of behaviour? Ah! God help us! <hi>Fronti nulla fides—nimium ne credi colori</hi>—but we ought to down on our knees and bleſs God for delivering us from the jaws of that painted ſepulchre.</q>—I was pretty much of Strap's opinion, and though I did not believe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any danger from the allurements of that ſiſterhood, I determined to act with great circumſpection for the future, and ſhun all commerce of that kind, as equally prejudicial to my purſe and conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>My next care was to introduce myſelf into a ſet of good acquaintance; for which purpoſe I frequented a certain coffee-houſe, noted for the reſort of good company, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh as well as foreigners, where my appearance procured all the civilities and advances I could deſire. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ordinary in the ſame houſe, I went up ſtairs to dinner with the other gueſts, and found myſelf at table with thirteen people, the greateſt part of whom were better dreſſed than myſelf.—The converſation, which was moſtly carried on in French, turned chiefly on politics; and I ſoon found the whole company was in the French intereſt, myſelf excepted, and a teſty old gentleman, who contradicted every thing that was advanced in favour of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, with a ſurlineſs truly Engliſh.—But this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ambaſſador.—This diſſertation introduced another on the Pragmatic Sanction, handled with great warmth, by a young gentleman at my right hand, dreſſed in a green frock trimmed with gold, who juſtified the French king for his breach of that contract; and affirmed, that he could not have obſerved it, without injuring his own glory.—Although I was not at all convinced by this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's arguments, I could not help admiring his viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which I imagined muſt be the effect of his illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous birth, and noble education, and accordingly rated him in my conjecture as a young prince on his travels.—The diſcourſe was afterwards ſhifted by an old gentleman of a very martial appearance, to the laſt campaign, when the battle of Dettingen was fought over again, with ſo many circumſtances to the honor of the French, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the allies, that I began to entertain ſome doubts of my having been there in perſon; and took the liberty to mention ſome objections to what he advanced.</p>
                     <p>This freedom introduced a diſpute which laſted a good while, to the mortification of all preſent; and was at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the determination of a grave perſon, whom they ſtiled doctor, and who, under a ſhew of great moderation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided it againſt me, with ſo little regard to truth, that I taxed him with partiality in pretty ſevere terms, to the no ſmall entertainment of the true Engliſh politician, who rejoiced at my defence of a cauſe he had ſo often eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſucceſs: my opponent, pleaſed with the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory he had gained, affected a great deal of candour, and told me he ſhould not have been ſo poſitive, if he had not been at great pains to inform himſelf of each particular.—"Indeed," ſaid he, <q>I am convinced, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſteps conſidered, things could not happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for we generals who have ſeen ſervice, though we may not be on the ſpot ourſelves, know by the leaſt ſketch of the diſpoſition, what muſt be the event.</q>—He then cenſured with great freedom, every circumſtance of the conduct of thoſe who commanded the allies; from thence made a tranſition to the miniſtry, which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with many invectives, for employing people who had neither experience nor capacity, to the prejudice of old officers who had been diſtinguiſhed for both; dropt many hints of his own importance; and concluded with
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027715_0303_0FD5EDD762B7A648"/>
obſerving, that the French and Spaniards know better how to value generals of merit; the good effects of which are ſeen in the conqueſts they gain, and the admirable diſcipline of their troops, which are at the ſame time bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clothed and paid than any ſoldiers in the univerſe. Theſe remarks furniſhed the green knight with an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of launching out into the praiſe of the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general, civil as well as military; on which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he made many odious compariſons to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Engliſh. Every body almoſt aſſented to the obſervations he made, and the doctor gave his ſanction, by ſaying, the people of France were undoubtedly the happieſt ſubjects in the world.—I was ſo much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and confounded at their infatuation and effrontery, that I had not power to utter one word in oppoſition to their aſſertions; but my moroſe aſſociate could not put up with the indignity that was offered to old England, and therefore with a ſatirical grin addreſſed himſelf to the general in theſe words: <q>Sir, Sir, I have often heard it ſaid, <hi>She's a villainous bird that befouls her own neſt.</hi>—As for what thoſe people, who are foreigners, ſay, I don't mind it, they know no better; but you who were bred and born, and have got your bread under the Engliſh government, ſhould have more regard to gratitude as well as truth, in cenſuring your native country.—If the miniſtry have thought fit to lay you aſide, I ſuppoſe they have their own reaſons for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and you ought to remember that you ſtill live on the bounty of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſpeak ſo freely of the adminiſtration of your own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Paris, as you have done of ours in London, you would have been ſent to the Baſtile without ceremony, where you might have rotted in a dungeon, and never ſeen the light of the ſun again.—Now, Sir, take my word for it, although our conſtitution ſcreens us from ſuch oppreſſion, we want not laws to chaſtiſe the authors of ſeditious diſcourſe; and if I hear another ſyllable out of your mouth, in contempt or prejudice of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I will give you a convincing proof of what I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and have you laid by the heels for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</q>—This declaration had an effect on the company, as ſudden as ſurpriſing.—The young prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as ſupple as a ſpaniel, the ambaſſador trembled, the general ſat ſilent and abaſhed, and the doctor, who, it ſeems, had felt the rod of power, grew pale as death, and aſſured us all, that he had no intention to affront any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or people.—<q>Your principles, doctor, (reſumed the old gentleman,) are no ſecret—I have nothing to ſay upon that head; but am very much ſurpriſed that a man who deſpiſes us ſo much, ſhould notwithſtanding live among us when he has no viſible motive for ſo doing.—Why don't you take up your habitation in your beloved France, where you may rail at England without cenſure!</q>—To this the doctor thought fit to make no reply; and an unſocial ſilence enſued; which I perceiving, took notice, that it was pity idle diſputes, maintained very often for whim or diverſion, ſhould create any miſunderſtanding among gentlemen of good ſenſe; and propoſed to drink down all animoſity in another bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.—This motion was applauded by the whole company: the wine was brought, and the Engliſh champion declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had no ſpleen againſt any man for differing in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from him, any more than for difference of complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, drank to the good health of all preſent; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment was returned, and the converſation once more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unreſerved, though more general than before.—Among other topics, the ſubject of war was introduced, on which the general declaimed with great eloquence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting many of his own exploits by way of illuſtration.—In the courſe of this harangue he happened to mention the word <hi>epaulement,</hi> upon which the teſty gentleman
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:027715_0305_0FD5EDDA5BCD14A8"/>
aſked the meaning of that term.—<q>I'll tell you what an epaulement is, replied he—"I never ſaw an epaulement but once—and that was at the ſiege of Namur—In a council of war, Monſieur Cohorn, the famous engineer, affirmed, that the place could not be taken.—Yes,</q> ſaid the prince of Vaudemont, <q>it may be taken by an epaulement.—This was immediately put in execution, and in twenty-four hours Marſhal Boufflers was fain to capitulate.</q>—Here he made a full ſtop, and the old gentleman repeated the queſtion, <q>But, pray, what is an epaulement?</q>—To this the officer made no immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reply, but rung the bell and called for a bill, which being brought, he threw down his proportion of the reckoning, and telling the company he would ſhew them what an epaulement is, when his Majeſty thought fit to intruſt him with the command of our army abroad, ſtrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away with great dignity—I could not imagine why he was ſo ſhy of explaining one of the moſt ſimple terms of fortification; which I forthwith deſcribed as a ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work compoſed of earth, gabions, or faſcines; but I was very much ſurpriſed when I afterwards underſtood that this reſerve proceeded from his ignorance.—Having paid our bill, we adjourned to the coffee-room, where my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labourer inſiſted on treating me with a diſh, giving me to underſtand at the ſame time, that I had acquired his good opinion, both with reſpect to my principles and intellects.—I thanked him for his compliment, and profeſſing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an utter ſtranger in this part of the world, begged he would have the goodneſs to inform me of the quality and characters of the people who dined above.—This requeſt was a real favour to one of his diſpoſition, which was no leſs communicative than curious; he therefore complied with great ſatisfaction, and told me, to my extreme aſtoniſhment, that the ſuppoſed young prince was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer at one of the theatres; and the ambaſſador no other than a fidler belonging to the opera. "The doctor," ſaid he, <q>is a Roman Catholic prieſt, who ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the character of an officer, and aſſumes the name of captain; but more generally takes the garb, title and behaviour of a phyſician, in which capacity he wheedles himſelf into the confidence of weak-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, and by arguments no leſs ſpecious than

When a ſtory is told of any great general, he immediately matches it with one of himſelf, though he is often unhappy in his invention, and commits ſuch groſs blunders in the detail, that every body is in pain for him.—Caeſar, Pompey, and Alexander the Great, are continually in his mouth; and as he reads a good deal without any judgment to digeſt it, his ideas are confuſed, and his harangues as unintelligible as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; for once he begins, there is no chance of his leaving off ſpeaking, while one perſon remains to yield attention; therefore the only expedient I know for putting a ſtop to his loquacity, is to lay hold of ſome incongruity he has uttered, and demand an explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or aſk the meaning of ſome difficult term that he knows by name only; this will effectually put him to ſilence, if not to flight, as it happened when I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about an epaulement. Had he been acquainted with the ſignification of that word, his triumph would have been intolerable, and we muſt have quitted the field firſt, or been worried with impertinence.</q> Having thus gratified my curioſity, the old gentleman began to diſcover his own in queſtions relating to myſelf, to which I thought proper to return ambiguous anſwers. <q>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,

I affected indifference, and replied in a careleſs manner, <q>Some trifle of ſixty or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty guineas:</q> upon which he ſtared in my face for ſome time, and then aſked me if I was an Engliſhman? I anſwered in the negative. <q>You are from Ireland then, Sir, I preſume,</q> ſaid he. I made the ſame reply. "Oh! perhaps," ſaid he, <q>you were born in one of our ſettlements abroad.</q> I ſtill anſwered, "No." He ſeemed very much ſurpriſed, and ſaid, he was ſure I was not a foreigner. I made no reply, but left him upon the tenter-hooks of impatient uncertainty. He could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his anxiety, but aſked pardon for the liberty he had taken, and, to encourage me the more to diſcloſe my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, diſplayed his own without reſerve.—"I am," ſaid he, <q>a ſingle man, have a conſiderable annuity on which I live according to my own inclination, and make the ends of the year meet very comfortably.

This ridiculous od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity danced up to the table at which we ſat, and, after a thouſand grimaces, aſked my friend by the name of Mr. Medlar, if we were not engaged upon buſineſs? My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion put on a ſurly countenance, and replied, <q>No great buſineſs, doctor—but, however</q>—"O then," cried the phyſician, <q>I muſt beg your indulgence a little; pray pardon me, gentlemen. Sir,</q> ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to me, <q>your moſt humble ſervant, I hope you will forgive me, Sir—I muſt beg the favour to ſit—Sir—Sir, I have ſomething of conſequence to impart to my friend Mr. Medlar—Sir, I hope you will excuſe my freedom in whiſpering, Sir.</q> Before I had time to give this complaiſant perſon my permiſſion, Mr. Medlar cried, <q>I'll have no whiſpering—if you have any thing to ſay to me, ſpeak with an audible voice.</q> The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſeemed a little diſconcerted at this exclamation, and turning again to me, making a thouſand apologies for pretending to make a myſtery of any thing, which he ſaid was owing to his ignorance of my connection with Mr. Medlar, but, now he underſtood I was a friend, he would communicate what he had to ſay in my hearing. He then began, after two or three hems, in this manner: <q>You muſt know, Sir, I am juſt come from dinner at my Lady Flareit's,</q> then addreſſing himſelf to me, <q>a lady of quality, Sir, at whoſe table I have the honour of dining ſometimes. There was Lady Stately, and my Lady Larum, and Mrs. Dainty, and Miſs Biddy Gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027715_0309_0FD5EDE897D159E0"/>
So, Sir, her ladyſhip ſeeing me exceſſively fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, for ſhe was the laſt of fifteen patients (people of diſtinction, Sir) whom I had viſited this forenoon, inſiſted upon my ſtaying dinner—though, upon my word, I proteſt I had no appetite; however, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with her ladyſhip's requeſt, Sir, I ſat down, and the converſation turning on different ſubjects, among other things, Mr. Chatter aſked very earneſtly, when I ſaw Mr. Medlar? I told him I had not had the pleaſure of ſeeing you theſe nineteen hours and a half; for you may remember, Sir, it was nearly about that time; I won't be poſitive as to a minute.—No! ſays he; then I deſire you will go to his lodgings immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after dinner, and ſee what is the matter with him; for he muſt certainly be very bad, from having laſt night eat ſuch a vaſt quantity of raw oyſters.</q> The cruſty gentleman, who, from the ſolemnity of his delivery, expected ſomething extraordinary, no ſooner heard his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion than he ſtarted up in a teſty humour, crying, "Pſhaw, pſhaw! d—n your oyſters," and walked away after a ſhort compliment of "Your ſervant, Sir," to me. The doctor got up alſo, ſaying, <q>I vow and proteſt, upon my word, I am actually amazed;</q> and followed Mr. Medlar to the bar, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, haſtily, <q>I might have known that before now, if it had not been for your impertinent intruſion;</q> and walked off very much diſappointed. The ceremonious phyſician returned immediately, and ſat down by me, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thouſand pardons for leaving me alone, and giving me to underſtand, that what he had communicated to Mr. Medlar at the bar was an affair of the laſt importance, that would admit of no delay. He then called for ſome coffee, and launched out into the virtues of that berry, which he ſaid, in cold phlegmatic conſtitutions like his, dried up the ſuperfluous moiſture, and braced the relaxed nerves. He told me, that it was utterly unknown to the ancients, and derived it name from an Arabian word, which I might eaſily perceive by the ſound and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From this topic he transferred his diſquiſition to the word <hi>drink,</hi> which he affirmed was improperly applied
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027715_0310_0FD5EDED0D4E2C78"/>
to the taking of coffee, inaſmuch as people did not drink but ſip or ſipple that liquor—that the genuine meaning of drinking is to quench one's thirſt, or commit a debauch by ſwallowing wine—that the Latin word, which convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame idea, was <hi>bibere</hi> or <hi>potare,</hi> and that of the Greeks <hi>pinein</hi> or <hi>poteein,</hi> though he was apt to believe they were indifferently uſed on different occaſions: for example, to drink a vaſt quantity, or, as the vulgar expreſs it, to drink an ocean of liquor, was in Latin <hi>potare,</hi> and in Greek <hi>poteein;</hi> and, on the other hand, to uſe it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, was <hi>bibere</hi> and <hi>pinein</hi>—that this was only a conjecture of his own, which, however, ſeemed to be ſupported by the word <hi>bibulous,</hi> which is particularly applied to the pores of the ſkin, that can only drink a very ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the circumambient moiſture, by reaſon of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their diameters—whereas, from the verb <hi>poteein</hi> is derived the ſubſtantive <hi>potamos,</hi> which ſignifies a river, or vaſt quantity of liquor. I could not help ſmiling at this learned and important inveſtigation, and to recommend myſelf the more to my new acquaintance, whoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was by this time well informed of, I obſerved, that what he alledged did not, to the beſt of my remembrance, appear in the writings of the ancients; for Horace uſes the words <hi>poto</hi> and <hi>bibo</hi> indifferently for the ſame purpoſe, as in the twentieth ode of his firſt book;

                        <p>Wagtail introduces me to a ſet of fine gentlemen, with whom I ſpend the evening at a tavern—our converſation—the characters of my new companions—the doctor is roaſted—the iſſue of our debauch.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I ACCEPTED his offer with pleaſure, and we went thither in a hackney-coach, where I ſaw a great number of gay figures fluttering about, moſt of whom ſpoke to the doctor with great familiarity. Among the reſt ſtood a group of them around the fire, whom I immediately knew to be the very perſons who had the night before, by their laughing, alarmed my ſuſpicions of the lady who had put herſelf under my protection. They no ſooner perceived me enter with Dr. Wagtail, (for that was my companion's name,) than they tittered and whiſpered one to another; and I was not a little ſurpriſed to find, that they were the gentlemen to whoſe acquaintance he deſigned to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me; for, when he obſerved them together, he told me who they were, and deſired to know by what name he ſhould introduce me. I ſatisfied him in that particular, and he advanced with great gravity, ſaying, <q>Gentlemen, your moſt obedient. Give me leave to introduce my friend Mr. Random to your ſociety.</q> Then turning
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027715_0312_0FD5EDF384F61C70"/>
to me, <q>Mr. Random, this is Mr. Bragwell—Mr. Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sir—Mr. Chatter—my friend, Mr. Slyboot, and Mr. Ranter, Sir.</q> I ſaluted each of them in order, and, when I came to take Mr. Slyboot by the hand, I perceived him thruſt his tongue in his che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, to the no ſmall entertainment of the company; but I did not think proper to take any notice of it on this occaſion. Mr. Ranter too (who I afterwards learned was a player) diſplayed his talents by mimicking my air, features, and voice, while he returned my compliment; this feat I ſhould not have been ſo ſenſible of, had I not ſeen him behave in the ſame manner to my friend Wagtail, when he made up to them at firſt. But for once I let him enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without queſtion or controul, reſolved, however, to chaſtiſe his inſolence at a more convenient opportunity. Mr. Slyboot, gueſſing I was a ſtranger, aſked if I had lately been in France? and, when I anſwered in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, inquired if I had ſeen the Luxemburgh galley? I told him I had conſidered it more than once with great attention: upon this a converſation enſued, in which I diſcovered him to be a painter. While we were diſcourſing upon the particulars of this famous performance. I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard Banter aſk Dr. Wagtail, where he had picked up this Mr. Random? To which queſtion the phyſician an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <q>Upon my word, a mighty pretty ſort of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman—a man of fortune, Sir—he has made the grand tour, and ſeen the beſt company in Europe, Sir.</q>—"What, he told you ſo, I ſuppoſe?" ſaid the other; <q>I take him to be neither more nor leſs than a French valet de chambre.</q>—"O! barbarous, barbarous!" cried the doctor; <q>this is actually, upon my word, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unaccountable. I know all his family perfectly well, Sir—he's of the Randoms in the north—a very ancient houſe, Sir, and a diſtant relation of mine.</q>—I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr. Banter, and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company in general: but, as I might poſſibly by their means acquire a more extenſive and agreeable acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I determined to bear theſe little mortifications as long as I could without injuring the dignity of my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. After having talked for ſome time on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, plays, politics, and other coffee-houſe ſubjects, it
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027715_0313_0FD5EDF504A96F88"/>
was propoſed we ſhould ſpend the evening at a noted tavern in the neighbourhood, whither we repaired in a body. Having taken poſſeſſion of a room, called for French wine, and beſpoke ſupper, the glaſs went about pretty freely, and the characters of my aſſociates opened upon me more and more. It ſoon appeared that the doctor was entertained as a butt for the painter and player to exerciſe their wit upon for the diverſion of the company. Mr. Ranter began the game by aſking him what was good for hoarſeneſs, lowneſs of ſpirits, and indigeſtion, for he was troubled with all theſe complaints to a very great degree. Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature of his caſe, and, in a very prolix manner, harangued upon prognoſtics, diagnoſtics, ſymptomatics, therapeutics, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anition, and repletion; then calculated the force of the ſtomach and lungs in their reſpective operations, aſcribed the player's malady to a diſorder in theſe organs proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from hard drinking and vociferation, and preſcribed a courſe of ſtomachics, with abſtinence from venery, wine, loud ſpeaking, laughing, ſinging, coughing, ſneezing, or hallooing. "Pah, pah," cried Ranter, interrupting him, <q>the remedy is worſe than the diſeaſe—I wiſh I knew where to find ſome tinder-water.</q>—<q>Tinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water!</q> ſaid the doctor; <q>upon my word I don't apprehend you, Mr. Ranter.</q>—<q>Water extracted from tinder,</q> replied the other; <q>an univerſal ſpecific for all diſtempers incident to man. It was invented by a learned German monk, who for a valuable conſideration imparted the ſecret to Paracelſus.</q>—"Pardon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>," cried the painter, <q>it was firſt uſed by Solomon, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a Greek manuſcript in his own hand-writing, lately found at the foot of Mount Lebanon by a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant who was digging for potatoes.</q>—"Well," ſaid Wagtail, <q>in all my vaſt reading I never met with ſuch a preparation! neither did I know till this minute, that Solomon underſtood Greek, or that potatoes grew in Paleſtine.</q> Here Banter interpoſed, ſaying, he was ſurpriſed Doctor Wagtail ſhould make the leaſt doubt of Solomon's underſtanding Greek, when he is repreſented to us as the wiſeſt and beſt educated prince in the world; and as for potatoes, they were tranſplanted thither from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in the time of the Cruſades, by ſome knights of that
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027715_0314_0FD5EDF6214643C8"/>
country. "I profeſs," ſaid the doctor, <q>there is nothing more likely—I would actually give a vaſt ſum for a ſight of that manuſcript, which muſt be ineſtimable—and, if I underſtood the proceſs, would ſet about it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q> The player aſſured him, that the proceſs was very ſimple—that he muſt cram a hundred weight of dry tinder into a glaſs retort, and, diſtilling it by the force of animal heat, it would yield half a ſcruple of inſipid water, one drop of which is a full doſe. "Upon my integrity!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the credulous doctor, <q>this is amazing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, that a <hi>caput mortuum</hi> ſhall yield any water at all!—I muſt own I have always been an enemy to ſpecifics, which I thought inconſiſtent with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the animal oeconomy; but certainly the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Solomon is not to be queſtioned—I wonder where I ſhall find a glaſs retort large enough to contain ſuch a vaſt quantity of tinder, the conſumption of which muſt undoubtedly raiſe the price of paper—or where ſhall I find animal heat ſufficient even to warm ſuch a maſs?</q>—Slyboot informed him, that he might have a retort blown for him as big as a church, and that the eaſieſt method of raiſing the vapour by animal heat would be to place it in the middle of an infirmary for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh patients, who might lie upon matraſſes around, and in contact with it. He had no ſooner pronounced theſe words than Wagtail exclaimed in a rapture, <q>An admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expedient, as I hope to be ſaved! I will poſitively put it in practice.</q> This ſimplicity of the phyſician furniſhed excellent diverſion for the company, who in their turns ſneered at him in ironical compliments, which his vanity ſwallowed as the genuine ſentiments of their hearts. Mr. Chatter, impatient of ſo long a ſilence, now broke out, and entertained us with a catalogue of all the people who danced at the laſt Hampſtead aſſembly, with a moſt circumſtantial account of the dreſs and ornaments of each, from the lappets of the ladies to the ſhoe-buckles of the men, concluding with telling Bragwell, that his miſtreſs Melinda was there, and ſeemed to miſs him, and ſoliciting his company at the next occaſion of this kind. <q>No, no, damme,</q> ſaid Bragwell, <q>I have ſomething elſe to mind than dangling after a parcel of giddy-headed girls—beſides you know my temper is ſo unruly, that
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027715_0315_0FD5EDF919B6B7C8"/>
I am apt to involve myſelf in ſcrapes when a woman is concerned—The laſt time I was there, I had an affair with Tom Trippet.</q>—"O! I remember that," cried Banter; <q>you lugged out before the ladies; and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you for ſo doing, becauſe you had an opportunity of ſhewing your manhood without running any riſk.</q>"Riſk!" ſaid the other with a fierce countenance; <q>d—n my blood!

Bragwell was as much impoſed upon by

the painter's waggery as the doctor, and declined engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the affair, ſaying, he had a very great regard for Mr. Slyboot, but had laid it down as a maxim, never to fight except when his honour was engaged. A thouſand jokes of this kind were paſſed; the wine circulated, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ſerved in, we ate heartily, returned to the bottle; Bragwell became noiſy and troubleſome, Banter grew more and more ſevere, Ranter rehearſed, Slyboot made faces at the whole company, I ſung French catches, and Chatter kiſſed me with great affection; while the doctor, with a woeful countenance, ſat ſilent like a diſciple of Pythagoras. At length it was propoſed by Bragwell, that we ſhould ſcour the hundreds, ſweat the conſtable, maul the watch, and then reel ſoberly to bed.</p>
                     <p>While we deliberated on this expedition, the waiter came into the room, and aſked for Dr. Wagtail; when he underſtood he was preſent, he told him there was a lady below to inquire for him; at which the phyſician ſtarted from his melancholy contemplation, and, with a look of extreme confuſion, aſſured the company he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be the perſon wanted; for he had no connection with any lady whatever—and bid the drawer tell her ſo. <q>For ſhame!</q> cried Banter, <q>would you be ſo impolite as to refuſe the lady a hearing? perhaps ſhe comes for a conſultation—it muſt be ſome extraordinary affair that brings a lady to a tavern at this time o'night. Mr. Ranter, pray do the doctor's <hi>baiſe-mains</hi> to the lady, and ſquire her hither.</q> The player immediately ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered out, and returned, leading in, with much ceremony, a tall ſtrapping wench, whoſe appearance proclaimed her occupation. We received her with the utmoſt ſolemnity, and with a good deal of entreaty ſhe was perſuaded to ſit, when a profound ſilence enſued, during which ſhe fixed her eyes, with a diſconſolate look upon the doctor, who was utterly confounded at her behaviour, and returned her melancholy four-fold; at length, after a good many pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſighs, ſhe wiped her eyes, and accoſted him thus: <q>What, not one word of comfort? will nothing ſoften that ſtony heart of thine?

His natural paleneſs changed into a ghaſtly clay colour, his eyes rolled, his lip trembled, and he anſwered in an accent not to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; <q>Upon my word, honour, and ſalvation! Madam, you are actually miſtaken in my perſon. I have a moſt particular veneration for your ſex, Madam, and am actually incapable of injuring any lady in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Madam—beſides, Madam, to the beſt of my recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, I never had the honour of ſeeing you before, as I hope to be ſaved, Madam.</q>—"How, traitor!" cried ſhe, <q>doſt thou diſown me then?—Miſtaken! no—too well I know that fair bewitching face! too well I know that falſe enchanting tongue! Alas! gentlemen, ſince the villain compels me by his unkindneſs to expoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and him, know, that this betrayer, under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of honourable addreſſes, won my heart, and, taking advantage of his conqueſt, robbed me of my virgin treaſure, and afterwards abandoned me to my fate!—I am now four months gone with child by him, turned out of doors by my relations, and left a prey to miſery and want!—Yes, thou barbarian,</q> ſaid ſhe, turning to Wagtail, <q>thou tiger, thou ſuccubus! too well thou knoweſt my ſituation—but I will tear out thy faithleſs heart, and deliver the world from ſuch a monſter.</q> So ſaying, ſhe ſprang forward at the doctor, who with incredible agility jumped over the table, and ran behind Bragwell, while the reſt of us endeavoured to appeaſe the furious heroine. Although every body in the company affected the utmoſt ſurpriſe, I could eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it was a ſcheme concerted among them to produce diverſion at the doctor's expence; and, being under no concern about the conſequence, I entered into the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, and enjoyed the diſtreſs of Wagtail, who with tears in his eyes begged the protection of the company, declaring himſelf as innocent of the crime laid to his charge as the <hi>foetus in utero,</hi> and hinting at the ſame time, that nature had not put it in his power to be guilty of ſuch a treſpaſs—"Nature!" cried the lady; there was no <q>nature in the caſe—he abuſed me by the help of charms
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027715_0318_0FD5EDFB57EB7D48"/>
and ſpells, elſe how is it poſſible, that any woman could have liſtened to the addreſſes of ſuch a ſcare-crow!—Were theſe owliſh eyes made for ogling, that carrion complexion to be admired, or that mouth, like a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoe, to be kiſſed? No, no, you owe your ſucceſs to your philtres, to your drugs and incantations, and not to your natural talents, which are in every reſpect mean and contemptible?</q> The doctor now thought he had got an opportunity of vindicating himſelf effectually, and deſired the complainant to compoſe herſelf but for half an hour, in which he undertook to prove the abſurdity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the power of incantations, which were only idle dreams of ignorance and ſuperſtition. He accordingly pronounced a very learned diſcourſe upon the nature of ideas, the powers and independence of the mind, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of ſtimulating medicines, the difference between a proneneſs to venery, which many ſimples would create, and a paſſion limited to one object, which can only be the reſult of ſenſe and reflection, and concluded with a pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic remonſtrance, ſetting forth his unhappineſs in being perſecuted with the reſentment of a lady whom he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver injured, nor even ſeen before that occaſion, and whoſe faculties were, in all likelihood, ſo much impaired by her misfortunes, that an innocent perſon was in danger of being ruined by her diſorder. He had no ſooner finiſhed his harangue than the forlorn princeſs renewed her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and cautioned the company againſt his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which, ſhe ſaid, was able to bias the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial bench in Chriſtendom. Banter adviſed him to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe her immediately as the only means to ſalve his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and offered to accompany him to the Fleet for that purpoſe; but Slyboot propoſed, that a father ſhould be purchaſed for the child, and a comfortable alimony ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on the mother. Ranter promiſed to adopt the infant <hi>gratis.</hi> Wagtail was ready to worſhip him for his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity; and though he perſiſted in proteſting his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, condeſcended to every thing rather than his unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed character ſhould be called in queſtion.—The lady rejected the propoſal, and inſiſted on matrimony. Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well took up the cudgels for the doctor, and undertook to rid him of her importunity for half a guinea; upon which Wagtail, with great eagerneſs, pulled out his purſe,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:027715_0319_0FD5EE019E47E078"/>
and put it into the hand of his friend, who, taking half a piece out of it, gave it to the plaintiff, and bid her thank God for her good fortune. When ſhe had received this bounty, ſhe affected to weep, and begged, ſince the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician had renounced her, he would at leaſt vouchſafe her a parting kiſs; this he was prevailed upon to grant with great reluctance, and went up with his uſual ſolemnity to ſalute her, when ſhe laid hold of his check with her teeth, and held faſt, while he roared with anguiſh, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable diverſion of all preſent. When ſhe thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to releaſe him, ſhe dropped a low courtſey to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and quitted the room, leaving the doctor in the utmoſt horror, not ſo much on account of the pain, as the apprehenſion of the conſequence of the bite; for by this time he was convinced of her being mad. Banter preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the actual cautery, and put the poker in the fire to be heated, in order to fear the place. The player was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that Bragwell ſhould ſcoop out the part affected with the point of his ſword; but the painter prevented both theſe dreadful operations by recommending a balſam he had in his pocket, which never failed to cure the bite of a mad dog: ſo ſaying, he pulled out a ſmall bladder of black paint, with which he inſtantly anointed not only the ſore but the greateſt part of the patient's face, and left it in a frightful condition. In ſhort, the poor creature was ſo harraſſed with fear and vexation, that I pitied him extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſent him home in a chair, contrary to the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every body preſent.</p>
                     <p>This freedom of mine gave umbrage to Bragwell, who teſtified his diſpleaſure by ſwearing a few threats, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making application; which was no ſooner perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. Slyboot, who ſat by me, than with a view of promoting a quarrel, he whiſpered to me, that he thought Bragwell uſed me very ill; but every man was the beſt judge of his own affairs.—I anſwered aloud, that I would neither ſuffer Mr. Bragwell nor him to uſe me ill with impunity; and that I ſtood in no need of his counſel in regard to the regulation of my conduct.—He thought proper to aſk a thouſand pardons, and aſſured me, he meant no offence; while Bragwell feigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aſleep, that he might not be obliged to take notice of what paſſed. But the player, who had more animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027715_0320_0FD5EE02DC06FCE0"/>
and leſs diſcretion than Slyboot, unwilling to let the affair reſt, where he had dropt it, jogged Mr. Bragwell, and told him ſoftly, that I called him names, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to cudgel him.—This I underſtood by his ſtarting up and crying, <q>Blood and wounds! you lie—No man durſt treat me ſo ignominiouſly: Mr. Random, did you call me names, and threaten to drub me?</q> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the imputation, and propoſed to puniſh the ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel, who endeavoured to foment diſturbance in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; Bragwell ſignified his approbation, and drew his ſword; I did the ſame, and accoſted the actor in theſe words, <q>Lookee, Mr. Ranter, I know you poſſeſs all the mimickry and miſchievous qualities of an ape, becauſe I have obſerved you put them all in practice more than once to-night on me and others; now I want to ſee if you reſemble one in nimbleneſs alſo; therefore I deſire you to leap over this ſword without heſitation;</q> ſo ſaying, I held it parallel to the horizon, at the diſtance of about three feet from the floor, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, "Once—twice—thrice, and away;"—but inſtead of complying with my commands, he ſnatched his hat and hanger, and aſſuming the look, ſwagger, and phraſe of Piſtol, burſt out into the following exclamation: <q>Ha! muſt I then perform inglorious prank, of Sylvan ape in mountain foreſt caught! Death rock me aſleep, abridge my doleful days, and lay my head in fury's lap—Have we not Hieren here?</q>—This buffoonery did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his expectation, for by this time the company was bent on ſeeing him in a new character. Mr. Banter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to hold my ſword a foot or two higher, that he might have an opportunity of exerting himſelf—The painter told him, if he performed well, he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him as a vaulter to the proprietors of Sadler's Wells; and Bragwell crying, "Leap for the king," ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the point of his ſword to the player's poſteriors, with ſuch ſucceſs, that he ſprang over in a trice, and finding the door unguarded, vaniſhed in a twinkling; glad, no doubt, of having paid his ſhare of the reckoning ſo eaſily.</p>
                     <p>It being now near two o'clock in the morning, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the bill, and ſallied out into the ſtreet.—The painter ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

being unable to ſpeak or ſtand, was ſent to a Bagnio; and Banter and I accompanied Bragwell to Moll King's coffee-houſe, where, after he had kicked half a dozen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry whores, we left him aſleep on a bench, and directed our courſe towards Charing-Croſs, near which place both he and I lodged.</p>
                     <p>The natural dryneſs of my companion being overcome by liquor, he honoured me by the way with many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments and profeſſions of friendſhip, for which I made ſuitable acknowledgments, and told him, I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy in having, by my behaviour, removed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable opinion he entertained of me at firſt ſight.—He was ſurprized at this declaration, and begged me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain myſelf: upon which I mentioned what I had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard him ſay of me to Wagtail, in the coffee-houſe.—He laughed, and made an apology for his freedom, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me, that my appearance had very much prepoſſeſſed him in my favour: and what he ſaid, was only intended as a joke on the doctor's ſolemnity.—I was highly pleaſed at being undeceived in this particular, and not a little proud of the good opinion of this wit, who ſhook me by the hand at parting, and promiſed to meet me next day at the ordinary.</p>

ſomething to communicate.—"By your countenance," ſaid I, "I expect to hear good tidings."—"Indifferent," replied he, tittering, "that is, hereafter as it ſhall be.—<q>You muſt know, I have ſome thoughts of altering my condition.</q>—"What!" cried I, aſtoniſhed, <q>a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial ſcheme? O rare Strap! thou haſt got the heels of me at laſt.</q>—"N'—no leſs, I'll aſſure you," ſaid he, burſting into a laugh of ſelf-approbation, <q>a tallow-chandler's widow, that lives hard by, has taken a liking to me—a fine jolly dame, as plump as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge.—She has a well furniſhed houſe, a briſk trade, and a good deal of the ready.—I may have her for the aſking.—She told a friend of mine, a brother footman, that ſhe would take me out of a ſtinking clout.—But I refuſed to give my final anſwer, till I knew your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the matter.</q>—I congratulated Monſieur d'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrapes upon his conqueſt, and approved of the ſcheme, provided he could be aſſured of thoſe circumſtances of her fortune; but adviſed him to do nothing raſhly, and give me an opportunity of ſeeing the lady before matters ſhould be brought to a concluſion.—He aſſured me he would do nothing without my conſent and approbation, and that very morning, while I was at breakfaſt, introduced his inamorata to my acquaintance.—She was a ſhort thick woman, about the age of thirty-ſix, and had a particular prominence of belly, which I perceived at firſt ſight, not without ſome ſuſpicion of foul play.—I deſired her, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to ſit and treated her with a diſh of tea; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe turning on the good qualities of Strap, whom I repreſented as a prodigy of ſobriety, induſtry and virtue.—When ſhe took her leave, he followed her to the door, and returned licking his lips, and aſking if I did not think ſhe was a luſcious creature.—I made no myſtery of my apprehenſion, but declared my ſentiments of her without reſerve; at which he was not ſurpriſed, telling me he had obſerved the ſame ſymptom, but was informed by his friend that ſhe was only liver-grown, and would in a few months be as ſmall in the waiſt as ever.—"Yes," ſaid I, <q>a few weeks, I believe, will do the buſineſs.—In ſhort, Strap, it is my opinion, that you are egregiouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon; and that this friend is no other than a raſcal who wants to palm his trull upon you for a wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

that he may at once deliver himſelf from the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the mother, and the expence of her bantling; for which reaſon I would not have you truſt implicitly to the report he makes of her wealth, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his behaviour; nor run your head precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately into a nooſe, that you may afterwards wiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for the hangman's.</q>—He ſeemed very much ſtartled at my inſinuation, and promiſed to look twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leaped; ſaying, with ſome heat, <q>Odds, if I find his intention is to betray me, we ſhall ſee which of us is the better man.</q>—My prediction was verified in leſs than a fortnight; her great belly producing an infant, to the unſpeakable amazement of Strap, who was, before this happened, inclinable to believe I had refined a little too much in my penetration. His falſe friend diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in a few days after, an execution was iſſued againſt her goods and houſhold furniture, which were ſeized by the creditors.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile I met my friend Banter at the ordinary, and in the evening went to the opera with him and Mr. Chatter, who pointed out Melinda in one of the boxes, and offered to introduce me to her, obſerving at the ſame time, that ſhe was a reigning toaſt, worth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds.—This piece of information made my heart bound with joy, and I diſcovered great eagerneſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the propoſal; upon which he aſſured me I ſhould dance with her at the next aſſembly, if he had any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that quarter; ſo ſaying, he went round, ſpoke to her ſome minutes, and, as I imagined, pointed at me; then returning, told me, to my inexpreſſible pleaſure, that I might depend upon what he had promiſed, for ſhe was now engaged as my partner.—Banter, in a whiſper, gave me to underſtand, that ſhe was an incorrigible coquette, who would grant the ſame favour to any young fellow in England, of a tolerable appearance, merely to engage him among the herd of her admirers, that ſhe might have the pleaſure of ſeeing them daily increaſe;—that ſhe was of a cold inſenſible diſpoſition, dead to every paſſion but vanity, and ſo blind to merit, that he would lay any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the wealthieſt fool ſhould carry her at laſt. I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted a good deal of this intelligence to the ſatirical turn of my friend, or reſentment for having himſelf ſuffered a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027715_0324_0FD5EE0ECB6D7DC8"/>
rebuff from the lady in queſtion; and at any rate truſted ſo much to my own accompliſhments, as to believe no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could reſiſt the ardor of my addreſſes.</p>
                     <p>Full of this confidence I repaired to Hampſtead, in company with Billy Chatter, my Lord Hobble, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Wagtail. Here I ſaw a very brilliant aſſembly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I had the honour to walk a minuet with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, who charmed me with her frank manner and eaſineſs of behaviour.—Before the country dances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, I received a meſſage by a perſon, I did not know, from Bragwell, who was preſent, importing, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body, who knew him, preſumed to dance with Melinda while he was there in perſon; and that I would do well to relinquiſh her without noiſe, becauſe he had a mind to lead up a country dance with her. This extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, which was delivered in the lady's hearing, did not at all diſcompoſe me, who by this time was pretty well acquainted with the character of my rival. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without the leaſt ſymptom of concern, bid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman tell Mr. Bragwell, that ſince I was ſo happy as to obtain the lady's conſent, I ſhould not be ſolicitous about his; and deſired the bearer himſelf to bring me no ſuch impertinent meſſages for the future. Melinda affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſort of confuſion, and pretended to wonder that Mr. Bragwell ſhould give himſelf ſuch liberties, with regard to her, who had no manner of connection with the fellow. I laid hold of this opportunity to diſplay my valour, and offered to call him to an account for his inſolence, which ſhe abſolutely refuſed, under pretence of conſulting my ſafety; though I could perceive by the ſparkling of her eyes, that ſhe would not have thought herſelf affronted in being the ſubject of a duel. I was by no means plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this diſcovery of her thoughts, which not only argued the moſt unjuſtifiable vanity, but likewiſe the moſt barbarous indifference; however, I was allured by her fortune, and reſolved to gratify her pride, in making her the occaſion of a public quarrel between me and Bragwell, who, I was pretty certain, would never drive matters to a dangerous extremity.</p>
                     <p>While we danced together, I obſerved this formidable rival at one end of the room, encircled with a cluſter of beaux, to whom he talked with great vehemence, caſting
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027715_0325_0FD5EE111ECCA8A8"/>
many big looks at me from time to time: I gueſſed the ſubject of their diſcourſe, and as ſoon as I had handed my partner to her ſeat, ſtrutted up to the place where he ſtood, and cocking my hat in his face, demanded aloud, if he had any thing to ſay to me. He anſwered with a ſullen tone, "Nothing at preſent, Sir," and turned about upon his heel.—"Well," ſaid I, <q>you know where I am to be found at any time.</q>—His companions ſtared at one another, and I returned to the lady, whoſe features brightened at my approach, and immediately a whiſper ran through the whole room; after which, ſo many eyes were turned upon me, that I was ready to ſink with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.—When the ball broke up, I led her to her coach, and, like a true French gallant, would have got up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it, in order to protect her from violence on the road; but ſhe abſolutely refuſed my offer, and expreſſed her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that there was not an empty ſeat for me within it.</p>
                     <p>Next day in the afternoon, I waited on her at her lodgings, by permiſſion, in company with Chatter, and was very civilly received by her mother, with whom ſhe lived;—there were a good many faſhionable people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, chiefly young fellows; and immediately after tea, a couple of card tables were ſet, at one of which I had the honour to play with Melinda, who in leſs than three hours made ſhift to plunder me of eight guineas.—I was well enough content to loſe a little money with a good grace, that I might have an opportunity to ſay ſoft things in the mean time, which are ſtill more welcome, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with good luck; but I was by no means ſatisfied with her fair play, a circumſtance that ſhocked me not a little, and greatly impaired my opinion of her diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and delicacy.—However, I was reſolved to profit by this behaviour, and treat her in my turn with leſs ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; accordingly I laid cloſe ſiege to her, and finding her not at all diſguſted with the groſs incenſe I offered, that very night made a declaration of love in plain terms.—She received my addreſſes with great gaiety, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to laugh them off, but at the ſame time treated me with ſuch particular complacency, that I was perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I had made a conqueſt of her heart, and concluded myſelf the happieſt man alive. Elevated with theſe flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ideas, I ſat down again to cards after ſupper, and with

                     <p>It was late before I took my leave, after being favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a general invitation; and when I got into bed, the adventures of the day hindered me from ſleeping.—Sometimes I pleaſed myſelf with the hopes of poſſeſſing a fine woman with ten thouſand pounds; then I would ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on the character I had heard of her from Banter, and compare it with the circumſtances of her conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, which ſeemed to bear too great a reſemblance to the picture he had drawn.—This introduced a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly reflection on the expence I had undergone, and the ſmallneſs of my funds to ſupport it, which, by the bye, were none of my own.—In ſhort, I found myſelf involved in doubts and perplexit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>In the morning, Strap, with whom I had not conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for two days, preſented himſelf with the utenſils for ſhaving me; upon which, I aſked his opinion of the lady whom he had ſeen me conduct to her coach at Hampſtead.—"Odd! ſhe's a delicious creature," cried he, <q>and, as I am informed, a great fortune.—I am ſorry you did not inſiſt on going home with her.—I dare ſay, ſhe would not have refuſed your company; for ſhe ſeems to be a good-humoured ſoul.</q>—<q>There's a time for all things,</q> ſaid I. <q>You muſt know, Strap, I was in company with her till one o'clock this morning.</q>—I had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, than he began to caper about the room, and ſnap his fingers, crying in a tranſport, "The day's our own!—The day's our own!" I gave him to underſtand that his triumph was a little premature, and that I had more difficulties to ſurmount than he was aware of; then I recounted to him the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I had received from Banter.—At which he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed colour, ſhook his head, and obſerved there was no faith in woman.—I told him, I was reſolved to make a bold puſh notwithſtanding, although I foreſaw it would lead me into a great expence; and bid him gueſs the ſum I had loſt laſt night at cards.—He ſcratched his chin, and profeſſed his abhorrence of cards, the very name of which being mentioned made him ſweat with vexation, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called the money-dropper to his remembrance; <q>But

however,</q> ſaid he, <q>you have to do with other gueſs people now.—Why, I ſuppoſe, if you had a bad run laſt night, you would ſcarce come off for leſs than ten or twelve ſhillings.</q>—I was mortified at this piece of ſimplicity, which I imagined, at that time, was all affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by way of reprimand for my folly; and aſked with ſome heat, if he thought I had ſpent the evening in a cellar with chairmen and bunters; giving him to know, at the ſame time, that my expence amounted to eighteen guineas.—It would require the pencil of Hogarth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the aſtoniſhment and concern of Strap, on hearing this piece of news; the baſon in which he was preparing the lather for my chin, dropped out of his hands, and he remained ſome time immoveable in that ludicrous attitude, with his mouth open, and his eyes thruſt forward conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably beyond their ſtation; but remembering my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which was touchy and impatient of control, he ſmothered his chagrin, and attempted to recollect himſelf.—With this view he endeavoured to laugh, but in ſpite of his teeth, broke out into a whimper, took up his waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball and pewter pot, ſcrubbed my beard with the one, and diſcharged the other upon my face.—I took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his confuſion, but after he had fully recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, put him in mind of his right, and aſſured him of my readineſs to ſurrender his effects whenever he ſhould think proper to demand them.—He was nettled at my inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he thought proceeded from my diſtruſt of his friendſhip; and begged I would never talk to him in that ſtrain again, unleſs I had a mind to break his heart.</p>
                     <p>This good creature's unalterable friendſhip for me, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me with the moſt grateful ſentiments, and acted as a ſpur to my reſolution of acquiring a fortune, that I might have it in my power to manifeſt my generoſity in my turn—For this purpoſe, I determined to bring mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to a ſpeedy concluſion with Melinda, well knowing that a few ſuch nights as the laſt, would effectually inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate me from proſecuting that, or any other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous amour.</p>
                     <p>While my meditation was buſied in planning out my future conduct, Mr. Banter favoured me with a viſit; and after breakfaſt, aſked how I had paſſed the preceding evening?—I anſwered, I was very agreeably entertained

He took no notice of this apoſtrophe, but went on: <q>For my own part, I neither know nor deſire to know, who, or what you are; this I am certain of, that few people make a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of their origin and ſituation, who can boaſt of any thing advantageous in either;—and my own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the matter is, that you have raiſed yourſelf by your induſtry, from nothing to the appearance you now maintain, and which you endeavour to ſupport by ſome matrimonial ſcheme.</q>—Here he fixed his eyes ſtedfaſtly upon me, and perceiving my face covered with bluſhes, told me, now he was confirmed in his opinion:—"Look ye, Random," ſaid he, <q>I have divined your plan, and am confident it will never ſucceed—You are too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and too ignorant of the town, to practiſe the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cheats of your profeſſion, and detect the conſpiracies that will be formed againſt you—Beſides you are down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right baſhful—what the devil! ſet up for a fortune-hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before you have conquered the ſenſe of ſhame!

me, you may ſay as Teague did, <hi>By my ſoul I have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a loſs!</hi> She would take care to ſpend her own fortune in a twinkling, and ſoon make you ſick of her extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</q> I was alarmed by this diſcourſe, while I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the freedom of it, and expreſſed my diſguſt by tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he was miſtaken in my intentions, and deſiring he would give me leave to regulate my conduct according to the dictates of my own reaſon. He made an apology for the liberty he had taken, and aſcribed it to the warmth of his friendſhip for me, as an uncommon inſtance of which he borrowed five guineas, aſſuring me there were very few people in the world whom he would ſo far favour with his confidence. I gave him the money, and profeſſed myſelf ſo well convinced of his ſincerity, that he had no occaſion to put it to ſuch extraordinary proofs for the future.—<q>I thought,</q> ſaid he, <q>to have aſked five pieces more; but, hearing you were bubbled of eighteen laſt night, I preſumed you might be out of caſh, and reſolved to model my demand accordingly.</q> I could not help ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the cavalier behaviour of this ſpark, of whom I deſired to know his reaſon for ſaying I was bubbled: whereupon he gave me to underſtand, that, before he came to my lodgings, he had beat up Tom Toſsle, who, having been preſent, informed him of the particulars, rehearſed all the fine things I ſaid to Melinda, with which he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to entertain the town—and, among other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, aſſured him, my miſtreſs cheated with ſo little art, that nobody but a mere novice could have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon.</p>
                     <p>The thoughts of becoming a ſubject of raillery for cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, and loſing my money to boot, ſtung me to the quick; but I made a virtue of my indignation, and ſwore that no man ſhould with impunity either aſperſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Melinda, or turn my behaviour into ridicule. He replied in a dry manner, that I would find it an Herculean taſk to chaſtiſe every body who ſhould laugh at my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence; and, as for the character of Melinda, he did not ſee how I could ſuffer by what was laid to her charge; for that cheating at cards, ſo far from being reckoned a blemiſh among people of faſhion, was looked upon as an honourable indication of ſuperior genius and addreſs.—

                     </argument>
                     <p>BEING as willing to drop the theme, as he to propoſe it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I accompanied him thither, where we found Mr. Medlar and Dr. Wagtail diſputing upon the word <hi>cuſtard,</hi> which the phyſician affirmed ſhould be ſpelled with a <hi>g.</hi> becauſe it was derived from the Latin verb <hi>guſtare</hi> "to taſte." But Medlar pleaded cuſtom in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>c.</hi> obſerving, that by the doctor's rule we ought to change pudding into budding, becauſe it is derived from the French word <hi>boudin;</hi> and, in that caſe, why not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the original orthography and pronunciation of all the foreign words we have adopted, by which means our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would become a diſſonant jargon without ſtandard or propriety? The controverſy was referred to us; and Banter, notwithſtanding his real opinion to the contrary, decided in favour of Wagtail: upon which the peeviſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitant aroſe, and uttering the monoſyllable "Piſh" with great emphaſis, removed to another table.</p>
                     <p>We then inquired of the doctor what progreſs he had made in the experiment of diſtilling tinder-water? and he told us he had been at all the glaſs-houſes about town, but could find nobody who would undertake to blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity preſcribed; but he intended to try the proceſs on as much as would produce five drops, which would be ſufficient to prove the ſpecific, and then he would make it a parliamentary affair—that he had already purchaſed a conſiderable weight of rags, in reducing of which to tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he had met with a misfortune which had obliged him to change his lodgings; for he had gathered them in a heap on the floor, and ſet fire to them with a candle, on the ſuppoſition that the board would ſuſtain no damage,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:027715_0331_0FD5EE1DE085FD20"/>
becauſe it is the nature of the flame to aſcend; but by ſome very extraordinary accident the wood was invaded, and began to blaze with great violence, which diſordered him ſo much, that he had not preſence of mind enough to call for aſſiſtance, and the whole houſe muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed with him in the midſt of it, had not the ſmoke that rolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and brought people to his ſuccour—that he had loſt a pair of black velvet breeches and a tye-wig in the hurry, beſides the expence of the rags, which were rendered uſeleſs by the water uſed to quench the flame, and the damage of the floor, which he was compelled to repair—that his landlord, believing him diſtracted, had inſiſted on his quitting his apartment at a minute's warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which put him to incredible inconvenience; but now he was ſettled in a very comfortable houſe, and had the uſe of a large paved yard for preparing his tinder; ſo that he hoped in a very ſhort time to reap the fruits of his labour.</p>
                     <p>After having congratulated the doctor on his proſpect, and read the papers, we repaired to an auction of pictures, where we entertained ourſelves an hour or two; from thence we adjourned to the Mall, and, after two or three turns, went back to dinner, Banter aſſuring us, that he intended to roaſt Medlar at the ordinary; and indeed we were no ſooner ſet than this cynic began to execute his purpoſe, by telling the old gentleman he looked extremely well, conſidering the little ſleep he had enjoyed laſt night. To this compliment Medlar made no reply but by a ſtare, accompanied with a ſignificant grin; and Banter went on thus: <q>I don't know whether moſt to admire the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your mind or the vigour of your body. Upon my ſoul, Mr. Medlar, you do generous things with the beſt taſte of any man I know! You extend your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to real objects, and exact only ſuch returns as they are capable of making. You muſt know, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</q> ſaid he, turning to the company, <q>I had been up moſt part of the night with a friend who is ill of a fever, and, on my return home this morning, I chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to paſs by a gin-ſhop, ſtill open, whence iſſued a confuſed ſound of mirth and jollity: upon which, I pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in my head, and perceived Mr. Medlar dancing
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:027715_0332_0FD5EE1FCED005D0"/>
bare-headed in the midſt of ten or twenty ragged bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who rejoiced at his expence. But indeed, Mr. Medlar, you ought not to ſacrifice your conſtitution to your benevolence—conſider you grow old apace, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore ought to have a reverend care of your health, which muſt certainly be very much impaired by theſe nocturnal expeditions.</q> The teſty ſenior could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er contain himſelf, but cried haſtily, <q>'Tis well known that your tongue is no ſlander.</q>—"I think," ſaid the other, <q>you might ſpare that obſervation, as you are very ſenſible that my tongue has done you ſignal ſervice on many occaſions. You may remember that, when you made your addreſſes to the fat widow who kept a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic-houſe at Iſlington, there was a report ſpread, very much to the prejudice of your manhood, which coming to the ears of your miſtreſs, you were diſcarded imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; and I brought matters to a reconciliation, by aſſuring her you had three baſtards at nurſe in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: how you ruined your affairs afterwards, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my buſineſs nor inclination to relate.</q> This anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, which had no other foundation than in Banter's own invention, afforded a good deal of mirth to every perſon preſent, and provoked Mr. Medlar beyond all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance; ſo that he ſtarted up in a mighty paſſion, and, forgetting that his mouth was full, beſpattered thoſe who ſat next him, while he diſcharged his indignation in a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of oaths, and called Banter inſignificant puppy, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent jackanapes, and a hundred ſuch appellations, telling the company he had invented theſe falſe malicious aſperſions, becauſe he would not lend him money to ſquander away upon rooks and whores.—"A very likely ſtory," ſaid Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <q>that I ſhould attempt to borrow money of a man who is obliged to practiſe a thouſand ſhifts to make his weekly allowance hold out till Saturday's night. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſleeps four and twenty hours at a ſtretch, by which means he ſaves three meals, beſides coffee-houſe expence—ſometimes he is fain to put up with bread and cheeſe, and ſmall beer, for dinner—and ſometimes he regales on two pennyworth of ox-cheeſe in a cellar.</q>—"You are a lying miſcreant," cried Medlar, in an extaſy of rage; <q>I can always command money enough to pay your taylor's bill, which I am ſure is no trifle; and I
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:027715_0333_0FD5EE220195F1E0"/>
have a good mind to give you a convincing proof of my circumſtances by proſecuting you for defamation, ſirrah.</q> By this time the violence of his wrath had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of his appetite, and he ſat ſilent, unable to ſwallow one mouthful, while his tormentor enjoyed his mortification and increaſed his chagrin by adviſing him to lay in plentifully for his next day's faſt.</p>

That he had been the ruin of many a young man, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing them into debauched company, and ſetting a lewd example of all manner of wickedneſs; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I was on my guard, he would ſtrip me in a ſhort time both of my money and reputation. I thanked him for his information, and promiſed to conduct myſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, wiſhing, however, his caution had been a few hours more early, by which means I might have ſaved five guineas. Notwithſtanding this intelligence, I was inclinable to impute ſome part of this charge to Medlar's revenge for the liberties taken with him at dinner, and therefore, as ſoon as I could diſengage myſelf, applied to Wagtail for his opinion of the character in queſtion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to compare their accounts, allowing for the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of each, and form my judgment upon both, without adhering ſtrictly to either. The doctor aſſured me, that he was a very pretty gentleman of family and fortune, a ſcholar, a wit, a critic, and perfectly well acquainted with the town; that his honour and courage were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, though ſome extravagances he had been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, and his talent for ſatire, had procured him enemies, and made ſome people ſhy of his acquaintance. From theſe different ſketches I concluded, that Banter was a young fellow of ſome parts, who had ſpent his fortune, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his appetites, and fallen out with the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not enjoy it to his wiſh.</p>
                     <p>I went to the Bedford coffee-houſe in the evening,

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:027715_0335_0FD5EE26DF409470"/>
a hackney-coach to the place appointed, where I found a tall, raw-boned man, with a hard featured countenance, and black buſhy beard, walking by himſelf, wrapped up in a ſhabby great coat, over which his own hair deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a leathern queue from his head, that was covered with a greaſy hat trimmed with a tarniſhed <hi>point d' Fſpagne.</hi> He no ſooner perceived me advancing, than without any preamble, he pulled a piſtol from his boſom, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me, ſnapt it. Alarmed at this rude ſalutation, I made a ſtand, and before he could adjuſt his other piece, fired one of mine at him, without doing any damage. By this time he was ready with his ſecond, which flaſhed in the pan without going off: upon which he called with a true Tipperary cadence, "Fire away, honey,"—and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hammer his flint with great deliberation.—But I was reſolved to make uſe of the advantage fortune had given me; and therefore ſtept up, without throwing away my fire, deſiring him to aſk his life, or prepare for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; but this ſtout Hibernian refuſed to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, and complained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before he could return my ſhot, ſaying, I ought to go back to my ſtation, and let him have an equal chance with me.—I endeavoured to perſuade him that I had given him a double chance already; and it was my buſineſs to prevent him from enjoying a third;—but now, ſince I had an opportunity, I demanded a parley, and deſired to know the condition, and reaſon for calling me to the field, who, to the beſt of my remembrance, ſo far from having done him an injury, had never before ſeen him.—He told me, that he was a gentleman of fortune, who had ſpent all he had, and hearing that Melinda had got ten thouſand pounds, he intended to make himſelf maſter of that ſum by eſpouſing her, and was determined in an honourable way, to cut the throats of all thoſe who ſtood between him and his hopes.—I then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes; and now that I had ſeen him, being more and more aſtoniſhed at the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the promiſe, deſired he would explain that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.—He gave me to underſtand that he truſted entirely to his birth and perſonal merit; that he had frequently written to Melinda, ſetting forth his claim and pretenſions, but ſhe was never kind enough to ſend an anſwer, or even
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:027715_0336_0FD5EE2857D24058"/>
to admit him into her preſence; and that the promiſe he mentioned in his letter was made by his friend Mr. Gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagan, who aſſured him, that no woman could reſiſt a man of his appearance. I could not forbear laughing to exceſs at the ſimplicity of my rival, who did not ſeem to reliſh my mirth, but began to be very ſerious: upon which I endeavoured to appeaſe him by giving him my word and honour, that ſo far from prejudicing his addreſſes to the lady, I would repreſent him to her in the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable light I could, with any regard to truth; but he muſt not be ſurpriſed if ſhe ſhould remain blind to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, for nothing was more capricious than a woman's mind, and the affection of that ſex was ſeldom purchaſed with virtue alone.—That my declaration might have the better effect, I took notice of his diſhabille, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſorrow at ſeeing a gentleman reduced, ſlipped two guineas into his hand, at the ſight of which he threw away his piſtols, and hugging me in his arms, cried, <q>Arrah, by Jeſus, now you are the beſt friend I have met with theſe ſeven long years.</q>—When I had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome minutes in his embrace, he quitted me, and picking up his ruſty arms, wiſhed the devil might burn him, if ever he ſhould give me any further trouble about womankind.</p>
                     <p>The quarrel being thus amicably compoſed, I begged leave to look at his piſtols, which I found ſo crazy and ſo foul, that I believe it was happy for him neither of them was diſcharged, for one of them would certainly have ſplit in the going off, and he would in all probability have loſt his hand in the exploſion; but what gave me a lively idea of the man's character was to find upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that one of them had been loaded without being primed, and the other primed without a charge.</p>
                     <p>While we walked homeward together, I expreſſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of knowing my new friend's hiſtory; and he informed me of his having ſerved in the German army as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

he had been in England ſome years ſoliciting his friends for proviſion in the Britiſh army; but being hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, he was deſired by Mr. Gaghagan to turn his thoughts to matrimony, and make his fortune by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous match; in conſequence of which advice he had made up to Melinda; and having heard by means of an Iriſh footman in the family, that I was her chief favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, had called me out, in hopes of removing, by my death, the greateſt obſtruction to his deſires; but now he was convinced of my honour and generoſity, he ſwore by the bleſſed Virgin, he would think of her no more if there was not another woman in the world.—As a further proof of his veracity, which I did not at all doubt, he opened an old iron ſnuff-box, and pulled out his commiſſion in the Imperial army, and his captain's challenge, which he preſerved as teſtimonials of his character.—I was ſo well convinced of this poor man's honeſty and courage, that I determined to ſpeak in his behalf to ſome of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who might recommend his caſe to the conſideration of thoſe who could provide for him; and in the mean time to accommodate him with a few clothes, by which his appearance would be much mended, and himſelf ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to renew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As we walked along converſing ſociably together, we were met by a file of muſqueteers, and Strap at their head, who no ſooner approached, than with a frantic look, he cried, <q>Seize them!—In the name of God! ſeize them!</q>—We were accordingly ſurrounded, and I put in arreſt by the corporal, who was commanding of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer; but Captain O'Regan diſengaged himſelf, and ran with ſuch ſpeed towards Tottenham-court road, that he was out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When my arms were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up, and myſelf ſecured, Strap became a little more compoſed, and aſked pardon for the liberty he had taken, which he hoped I would excuſe, as it proceeded from his affection; he then told me, that, ſuſpecting the letter (which by the bye was brought by the author himſelf) contained ſomething extraordinary, he had peeped through the key-hole, and ſeen me load my piſtols; upon which he ran down to Whitehall, and applied to the officer on guard for a party to put me in arreſt; but before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, I was gone in a coach; that he had inquired
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027715_0338_0FD5EE2B566F1A60"/>
which way I went, and having heard that duels were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fought at the back of Montague-houſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the guard to this place, where he thanked God for having found me ſafe and ſound. I gave him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that I forgave his officious concern for once, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned him in pretty ſevere terms from making me the ſubject of idle converſation for the future; then turning to the corporal, thanked him for his care, and gave him a crown to drink with his men, aſſuring him that the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre was over long before he came up, and every thing compromiſed, as he might have obſerved by our behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; as a farther proof of which, he would find upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, that one of my piſtols had been diſcharged; but this civil perſon, without giving himſelf or me any further trouble, received the bounty with a thouſand bows and acknowledgments, and returning the piſtols releaſed me immediately.</p>
                     <p>He was not gone an hundred yards when my friend O'Regan came up, in order to reſcue me, with two Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdemalions whom he had engaged for that purpoſe, about the purlieus of St. Giles's: one of them was armed with a muſket that wanted a lock, and another with a ruſty broad-ſword; but their dreſs ſurpaſſed all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—When he underſtood I was already free, he made an apology for his abrupt departure, and introduced me to his two companions: firſt, to Counſellor Fitzclab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who, he told me, was then employed in compiling a hiſtory of the kings of Munſter, from Iriſh manuſcripts; and then to his friend Mr. Gaghagan, who was a profound philoſopher and politician, and had projected many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſchemes for the good of his country.—But it ſeems theſe literati had been very ill rewarded for their ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labours; for between them both, there was but one ſhirt, and half a pair of breeches.—I thanked them very kindly for their readineſs to aſſiſt me, and having offered my ſervice in my turn, bade them a good-morrow, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring O'Regan to accompany me to my lodgings, where he was fitted with decent clothes from my wardrobe, ſo much to his ſatisfaction, that he ſwore eternal gratitude and friendſhip to me, and, at my requeſt, recounted all the adventures of his life.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoon, I waited on Melinda, who received
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027715_0339_0FD5EE495F5C2ED8"/>
me with great kindneſs and familiarity, and laughed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively at my adventure with the Iriſhman, to whoſe wiſhes ſhe was no ſtranger, having more than a dozen letters in her poſſeſſion, which he had wrote to her on the ſubject of love, and which, for my entertainment, ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my peruſal.—Having made ourſelves merry at the expence of this poor admirer, I ſeized the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her mother's going out of the room, and introduced my own paſſion, which I recommended to her with all the ardour and eloquence I was maſter of.—I flattered, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſwore, intreated, and acted a thouſand extravagancies in hopes of making ſome impreſſion on her heart; but ſhe heard every thing I ſaid without diſcovering the leaſt emotion; and other company came in, before ſhe would vouchſafe one ſerious reply.—After tea, the cards were brought in, according to cuſtom, and it was my good fortune to have Melinda for my partner; by which means, inſtead of loſing, I came off with five guineas clear gain.</p>
                     <p>I ſoon became acquainted with a good many people of faſhion, and ſpent my time in the modiſh diverſions of the town, ſuch as plays, operas, maſquerades, drums, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and puppet ſhows: chiefly in company with Melin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, whom I cultivated with all the eagerneſs and addreſs that my proſpect could inſpire, and my education afford: I ſpared neither my perſon nor my purſe, to gratify her vanity and pride; my rivals were intimidated, and indeed outſhone; and, after all, I began to fear that the dear creature had not a heart to loſe.—At laſt, finding myſelf unable to ſupport the expence of this amour much longer, I was determined to bring the matter to a criſis; and one evening, while we were <hi>téte a téte,</hi> complained of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, deſcribed the tortures of ſuſpence to a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick mind, and preſſed her to diſcloſe her ſentiments of matrimony and me, with ſuch earneſtneſs, that ſhe could not with all her art ſhift the ſubject; but was obliged to come to an eclairciſſement.—She told me with a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs air, that ſhe had no objection to my perſon, and if I could ſatisfy her mother in other particulars, I ſhould not find her averſe to the match; but ſhe was reſolved to do nothing in an affair of ſuch momentous concern, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advice and conſent of her parent.—This was not a very agreeable declaration to me, whoſe aim had been
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:027715_0340_0FD5CD96646E08D8"/>
to win her inclination firſt, and then ſecure my conqueſt by a private marriage, to which I flattered myſelf ſhe would expreſs no reluctance—That I might not, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, deſert my cauſe before it was deſperate, I waited on her mother, and with great formality demanded the daughter in marriage: the good lady, who was a very notable woman, behaved with great ſtate and civility; thanked me for the honour I intended her family, and ſaid, ſhe did not doubt but that I was in all reſpects qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make a woman happy; but it concerned her as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, anxious about the welfare of her child, to inquire into the particulars of my fortune, and know what ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I propoſed to make. To this information, which would have utterly diſconcerted me, if I had not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, I replied without heſitation, that though my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was very ſmall, I was a gentleman by birth and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, would maintain her daughter in the ſphere of a gentlewoman, and ſettle her own dowry on her and her heirs for ever.—This careful matron did not ſeem to reliſh my propoſal, but obſerved with a demure countenance, that there was no neceſſity for ſettling that upon her child which was her own already: however, if I pleaſed, her lawyer ſhould confer with mine upon the matter; and in the mean time, ſhe deſired I would favour her with the peruſal of my rent-roll.—Notwithſtanding the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was under, I could ſcarce forbear laughing in her face at the mention of my rent-roll, which was indeed a ſevere ſatire upon my pretenſions. I frankly owned I had no landed eſtate: and told her, that I could not exactly ſpecify the ſum I was maſter of, until I had regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated my affairs, which were at preſent in ſome diſorder; but that I would take an opportunity of ſatisfying her on that head very ſoon.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before I took my leave; and returned to my lodgings in a very melancholy mood, perſuaded that I had nothing more to expect from that quarter: I was confirmed in this opinion next day, when I went back with a view of explaining myſelf more fully to the old gentlewoman; and was told by the footman that his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were not at home, although I had ſeen Melinda through the blinds at a parlour window, as I went up to the door. Incenſed at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027715_0341_0FD5CD96C32D3798"/>
without ſaying one word, and as I repaſſed the parlour, bowed to Miſs, who ſtill remained in the ſame ſituation, ſecurely ſcreened, as ſhe thought, from my view.</p>
                     <p>This diſappointment gave me more uneaſineſs on Strap's account than my own; for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda; on the contrary, the remembrance of my charming Narciſſa was a continual check upon my conſcience, during the whole courſe of my addreſſes; and perhaps contributed to the bad ſucceſs of my ſcheme, by controuling my raptures, and condemning my deſign.</p>
                     <p>There was a neceſſity for informing my companion of every thing that happened to me, and I performed this piece of duty in an affected paſſion, ſwearing I would be his pack horſe no longer, and deſiring him to take the management of his affairs into his own hands. This fineſſe had the deſired effect, for inſtead of grumbling over my miſcarriage, Strap was frightened at the paſſion I feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and begged me for the love of God to be appeaſed; obſerving, that although we had ſuffered a great loſs, it was not irreparable; and if fortune frowned to-day, ſhe might perhaps ſmile to-morrow.—I pretended to acquieſce in his remarks, praiſed his equanimity, and promiſed to improve by misfortune.—He, on the other hand, pretended to be perfectly well ſatisfied with my conduct, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection; but in ſpite of all his affectation, I could perceive his inward affliction, and his viſage ſenſibly increaſed in longitude from that day.</p>

                     <p>IN the mean time my attention was wholly engroſſed in ſearch of another miſtreſs, and the deſire of being
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:027715_0342_0FD5EE3044AA4A48"/>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on Melinda, in both which ſchemes I was very much aſſiſted by Billy Chatter, who was ſuch a neceſſary creature among the ladies, that in all private dances he engaged the men. To him therefore I applied, deſiring he would introduce me to a partner of ſome figure, at the next private aſſembly, for the ſake of a frolic, the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which I would afterwards communicate. Billy, who had heard ſomething of a difference between Melinda and me, immediately ſmoked part of my deſign, and, thinking I only wanted to alarm her jealouſy a little, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to gratify my deſire by matching me with a partner worth thirty thouſand pounds, whom the ladies of this end of the town had lately taken into their management and protection. Upon farther inquiry, I found this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's name was Miſs Biddy Gripewell; that her father, who had been a pawn-broker, died inteſtate, by which means all his ſubſtance deſcended to his daughter, who was ſo little a favourite, that, could the old man have prevailed with his own rapacious diſpoſition to part with as much money as would have paid the expence of a will, ſhe would not have inherited the ſixth part of his fortune; that during his life, ſo far from being educated in a way ſuitable to ſuch great expectations, ſhe was obliged to live like a ſervant wench, and do the moſt menial offices in the family. But his funeral was no ſooner performed than ſhe aſſumed the fine lady, and found ſo many people of both ſexes to flatter, careſs, and inſtruct her, that, for want of diſcretion and experience, ſhe had grown inſufferably vain and arrogant, and pretended to no leſs than a duke or earl at leaſt for her huſband; that ſhe had the misfortune to be neglected by the Engliſh quality, but a certain poor Scottiſh lord was then making intereſt to be introduced to her acquaintance. In the mean time ſhe was fallen into the hands of a notable lady, who had already diſpoſed of her to a lieutenant of foot, a diſtant relation of her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though miſs as yet knew nothing of the affair; and laſtly, that, if I propoſed to dance with her, I muſt give him leave to repreſent me as a knight or foreign count at leaſt. I was raviſhed at this piece of information, and conſented for one night to perſonate a French marquis, that I might the eaſier fulfil my revenge.</p>
                     <p>Having made the appointment with Chatter, I went to
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:027715_0343_0FD5EE315BF0B5C0"/>
Banter's lodgings, as I had by this time conceived a great opinion of his penetration and knowledge; and, after I had enjoined ſecrecy, told him every circumſtance of my diſgrace with Melinda, and imparted the plan I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to mortify that proud coquette, deſiring his advice in improving, and aſſiſtance in executing the ſcheme. Nothing could be more agreeable to his miſanthropical temper than an account of her behaviour and my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he applauded my reſolution, and propoſed that I ſhould not only provide myſelf with a proper partner, but alſo procure ſuch an one for Miſs Gooſetrap as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly entail upon her the ridicule of all her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: for this purpoſe he mentioned his barber, who, he ſaid, was a great coxcomb lately come from Paris, whoſe abſurd affectation and grimace would eaſily paſs upon her for the ſprightly politeſſe of a gentleman im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by travel. I hugged him for this hint, and he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, it would be no difficult matter to make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Melinda, having ſeen him by accident, was captivated by his appearance, and longed for his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He actually engaged him on this pretence, and painted his good fortune in ſuch colours, that the poor ſhaver was quite beſide himſelf with joy. He was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fitted with a tawdry ſuit of clothes belonging to Banter, and by him recommended to Chatter as a very pretty fellow juſt returned from his travels. Maſter Billy, who acted as a gentleman uſher to a great many of the fair ſex in and about town, undertook at once to beſpeak Melinda in his behalf; and every thing happened accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my wiſh.</p>
                     <p>At the time appointed I appeared, dreſſed to the beſt advantage, and, in the character of a Marquis had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of opening the ball with the rich heireſs, who attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the eyes of the whole company by the prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of jewels with which ſhe was adorned. Among others, I perceived Melinda, who could no more conceal her envy than aſtoniſhment at my ſucceſs: her curioſity was ſtill more flagrant and tormenting; for ſhe had never ſeen Miſs Gripewell before; and Chatter, who alone could give her any ſatisfaction on that head, was engaged in converſation at the other end of the room. I obſerved her impatience, and exulted in her chagrin; and, after my partner was ſet,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:027715_0344_0FD5EE32E272A250"/>
took the opportunity of paſſing by her to make a flight bow without ſtopping, which completed my triumph and her indignation. She changed colour, bridled up, aſſumed an air of diſdain, and flirted her fan with ſuch fury that it went to pieces in a moment, to the no ſmall entertainment of thoſe who ſat near and obſerved her.</p>
                     <p>At length the metamorphoſed barber took her out, and acted his part with ſuch ridiculous extravagance, that the mirth of the whole company was excited at his expence, and his partner ſo much aſhamed, that, before the country dances began, ſhe retired in great confuſion, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of being taken ſuddenly ill, and was followed by her gallant, who no doubt imagined her indiſpoſition was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love, and laid hold of the occaſion of conducting her home to comfort her with an aſſurance of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a reciprocal paſſion. They were no ſooner gone than an inquiſitive whiſper of "Who is he?" ran round the room, and Chatter could give them no other intelligence about him than that he was a man of fortune juſt returned from his travels: I, who alone was acquainted with his real quality, affected ignorance, well knowing, that female curioſity would not reſt ſatisfied with ſuch a general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that the diſcovery would proceed with a better grace from any body than me.</p>
                     <p>Mean while I was tempted by the richneſs of the prize to practiſe upon Miſs Gripewell's heart, but ſoon found it too well fortified with pride and indifference to yield to any efforts in my own character, and I neither would nor could preſerve the title I had borrowed longer than that night.</p>
                     <p>As I expected, every thing came to light next day. The barber, in pure ſimplicity of heart, detected himſelf to Melinda, and diſcovered the foundation of his hopes; ſhe ſickened at the affront, and was aſhamed to ſhew her face in public for many weeks after this accident.

                     <p>Finding my finances diminiſhed more than one half, and my project as little advanced as on the firſt day of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:027715_0345_0FD5EE348AE5EEA8"/>
in town, I began to deſpair of any ſucceſs, and grew melancholy at the proſpect of approaching want. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the horrors of this fiend, I had recourſe to the bottle, and kept more company than ever, I became particularly attached to the play-houſe, converſed with the actors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcenes, grew acquainted with a body of templars, and in a ſhort time commenced a profeſſed wit and critic. Indeed I may ſay without vanity, that I was much better qualified than any one of my companions, who were, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, of all the creatures I ever converſed with, the moſt ignorant and aſſuming. By means of theſe avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations I got the better of care, and learned to ſeparate my ideas in ſuch a manner, that, whenever I was attacked by a gloomy reflection, I could ſhove it aſide, and call in ſome agreeable reverie to my aſſiſtance. This was not the caſe with Strap, who practiſed a thouſand ſhifts to conceal the ſorrow that preyed upon his carcaſe, and reduced him to the reſemblance of a mere ſkeleton.</p>
                     <p>While I thus poſted in a thoughtleſs manner towards po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, I one day received by the penny poſt a letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a woman's hand, containing a great many high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown compliments, warm proteſtations of love, couched in a very poetical ſtile, an earneſt deſire of knowing whether or not my heart was engaged, by leaving an anſwer at a certain place, directed to R. B. and the whole ſubſcribed "Your <hi>Incognita.</hi>" I was tranſported with joy on read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contents of this billet-doux, which I admired as a maſterpiece of tenderneſs and elegance, and was already up to the ears in love with the author, whom my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation repreſented as a lady of fortune, in the bloom of youth and beauty. Elevated with this conjecture, I went to work, and exhauſted my invention in compoſing an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuitable to the ſublimity of her ſtile, and the ardour of her ſentiments, I expreſſed my admiration of her wit in terms the moſt hyperbolical, and while I acknowledged myſelf unworthy of her regard, declared myſelf enamoured of her underſtanding, and in the moſt pathetic manner implored the honour of an interview. Having finiſhed this performance, and communicated it to Strap, who ſkipped about for joy, I diſpatched him with it to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, which was the houſe of a milliner not far from Bond-ſtreet, and deſired him to keep watch near the door
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:027715_0346_0FD5EE36BB76FA08"/>
for ſome time, that he might diſcover the perſon who ſhould call for it. In leſs than an hour he returned with a joyful countenance, and told me that, ſoon after he bad delivered the letter, a chairman was called, to whom it was given, with directions to carry it to the houſe of a rich gentleman in the neighbourhood, whither he (Strap) followed him and ſaw it put into the hands of a waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who paid the meſſenger and ſhut the door—that upon inquiry at an ale-houſe hard by, where he called for a pint of beer, he underſtood that the gentleman, to whom the houſe belonged, had an only daughter, very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, who would inherit his whole eſtate, and who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was the author of the billet I had received. I was of the ſame opinion, and, hugging myſelf in the happy proſpect, dreſſed immediately, and paſſed in great ſtate by the houſe that contained my unknown admirer—nor was my vanity diſappointed; for I perceived a beautiful young creature ſtanding at one of the windows of the dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, who, I imagined, obſerved me with more than common curioſity. That I might indulge her view, and at the ſame time feaſt my own, I affected to ſtop, and give orders to Strap in the ſtreet, juſt oppoſite to her ſtation, by which means I had an opportunity of ſeeing her more diſtinctly, and of congratulating myſelf on having made a conqueſt of ſo much perfection. In a few minutes ſhe retired, and I betook myſelf to the ordinary in a rapture of hope, which deprived me of my appetite for that meal, and ſent me home in the evening to indulge my contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                     <p>Early next day I was favoured with another epiſtle from my unknown charmer, ſignifying her unutterable joy at the receipt of mine, which, while it made a tender of my heart, convinced her of the value of it; above all things, ſhe profeſſed extreme pleaſure in finding me ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to her underſtanding, a circumſtance that not only flattered her in the moſt ſenſible part, but at the ſame time argued my own ſagacity. As for the interview I deſired, ſhe aſſured me, that I could not be more eager for ſuch an occaſion than ſhe; but ſhe muſt not only ſacrifice a little more to decorum, but be ſatisfied of my honourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, before ſhe could grant that requeſt: mean while ſhe gave me to underſtand, that, although ſhe might owe
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:027715_0347_0FD5EE3B79CB8458"/>
ſome deference to the opinion of certain perſons, ſhe was reſolved, in an affair that ſo nearly concerned her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to conſult her own inclination preferable to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the whole world, eſpecially as ſhe was urged to ſuch condeſcenſion by no conſideration of fortune, what ſhe depended upon being her own without reſtriction or control. Struck with admiration at the philoſophy and ſelf-denial of my miſtreſs, who ſeemed inſenſible of the beauty ſhe poſſeſſed, and in particular raviſhed with that piece of intelligence by which I learned her fortune was independent, I reſumed the pen, launched out into enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums on the dignity of her ſentiments, affected to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the charms of external beauty, pretended to ground my paſſion on the qualities of her mind, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her rigour in ſacrificing my repoſe to an over-ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous regard to decorum, and declared the purity of my deſigns in the moſt ſolemn and pathetic vows. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, being ſealed and directed, was ſent to the place appointed by Strap, who, that we might be ſtill the more confirmed in our belief, renewed his watch, and in a little time brought back the ſame information as before, with this addition, that Miſs Sparkle, (the name of my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed correſpondent,) looking out at the window, no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſaw the meſſenger arrive than ſhe ſhut the caſement in a ſort of beautiful confuſion, and diſappeared; eager, no doubt, to hear from the dear object of her love.</p>
                     <p>My doubts now vaniſhed, the long-expected port ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and I looked upon myſelf as perfectly ſecure of that happineſs I had been in queſt of ſo long. After din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſauntered in company with Dr. Wagtail to that part of the town in which my inamorata lived, and, as he was a mere regiſter, inquired of him into the name, character, and fortune of every body who poſſeſſed a good houſe in the ſtreets through which we paſſed. When it came to his turn to mention Sir John Sparkle, he repreſented him as a man of an immenſe eſtate, and narrow diſpoſition, who mewed up his only child, a fine young lady, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of mankind, under the ſtrict watch and inſpection of an old governante, who was either ſo honeſt, envious, or infatiable, that nobody had been as yet able to make her a friend, or get acceſs to her charge, though numbers attempted it every day—not ſo much on account of her
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:027715_0348_0FD5EE3CDB5D3408"/>
expectations from her father, who, being a widower, might marry again, and have ſons, as for a fortune of twelve thouſand pounds left her by an uncle, of which ſhe could not be deprived. This piece of news, exactly tallying with the laſt part of the letter I had been honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in the morning, had ſuch an effect on me, that any man except Wagtail might have obſerved my emotion; but his attention was too much engroſſed by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his own importance, to be affected with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of any other body, unleſs it happened to be ſo particular that he could not help taking notice of it.</p>
                     <p>When I had diſengaged myſelf from him, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation grew inſipid to me, I went home, and made Strap acquainted with the fruits of my reſearches. This faithful ſquire was almoſt ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aked with tranſport, and even wept with joy, but whether on account of himſelf or me, I ſhall not pretend to determine. Next day a third billet-doux was brought to me, containing many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of tenderneſs, mingled with ſome affecting doubts about the artifice of man, the inconſtancy of youth, and the jealouſy often attending the moſt ſincere paſſion, withal deſiring I would excuſe her, if ſhe ſhould try me a little longer, before ſhe declared herſelf beyond the power of retracting. Theſe intereſting ſcruples added fuel to my flame, and impatience to my hope; I redoubled my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of her indifference, and preſſed her to an aſſignation with ſuch fervid entreaties, that in a few days ſhe conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet me at the houſe of that milliner, who had forwarded all my letters. During the interval between the date of her promiſe and the hour of appointment, my pride ſoared beyond all reaſon and deſcription; I loſt all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the gentle Narciſſa, and my thoughts were wholly employed in planning triumphs over the malice and contempt of the world.</p>
                     <p>At length the happy hour arrived; I flew to the place of rendezvous, and was conducted into an apartment, where I had not waited ten minutes when I heard the ruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſilk, and the ſound of feet aſcending the ſtairs: my heart took the alarm, and beat quick, my cheeks glowed, my nerves thrilled, and my knees ſhook with extaſy! I perceived the door opening, ſaw a gold brocade petticoat advance, and ſprang forward to embrace my charmer.—

Heaven and earth! how ſhall I paint my ſituation, when I found Miſs Sparkle converted into a wrinkled hag turned of ſeventy! I was ſtruck dumb with amazement, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified with horror! This ancient Urganda perceived my diſorder, and, approaching with a languiſhing air, ſeized my hand, aſking in a ſqueaking tone if I was indiſpoſed? Her monſtrous affectation completed the diſguſt I had conceived for her at firſt appearance, and it was a long time before I could command myſelf ſo much as to behave with common civility: at length, however, I recollected myſelf, and pronounced an apology for my behaviour, which, I ſaid, proceeded from a dizzineſs that ſeized me all of a ſudden. My hoary Dulcinea, who, no doubt, had been alarmed at my confuſion, no ſooner learned the cauſe, to which I now aſcribed it, than ſhe diſcovered her joy in a thouſand amorous coquetries, and aſſumed the ſprightly airs of a girl of ſixteen. One while ſhe ogled me with her dim eyes quenched in rheum; then, as if ſhe was aſhamed of that freedom, ſhe affected to look down, bluſh, and play with her ſan, then toſs her head, that I might not perceive a palſy that ſhook it, aſk ſome childiſh queſtions with a liſping accent, giggle and grin with her mouth ſhut, to conceal the ravages of time upon her teeth, leer upon me again, ſigh piteouſly, fling herſelf about in her chair to ſhew her agility, and act a great many more abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that youth and beauty can alone excuſe. Shocked as I was at my diſappointment, my diſpoſition was incapable of affronting any perſon who loved me; I therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to put a good face on the matter for the preſent, reſolving to drop the whole affair as ſoon as I ſhould get clear of her company; with this view I uttered ſome civil things, and in particular deſired to know the name and condition of the lady who had honoured me ſo much. She told me her name was Withers; that ſhe lived with Sir John Sparkle in quality of governeſs to his only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which ſituation ſhe had picked up a comfortable ſufficiency to make her eaſy for life; that ſhe had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſeeing me at church, where my appearance and deportment made ſuch an impreſſion upon her heart, that ſhe could enjoy no eaſe until ſhe had enquired into my character, which ſhe found ſo amiable in all reſpects, that ſhe yielded to the violence of her inclination, and ventured
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:027715_0350_0FD5EE400396A7C8"/>
to declare her paſſion, with too little regard perhaps to the decorum of her ſex; but ſhe hoped I would forgive a treſpaſs, of which I myſelf was, in ſome meaſure, the cauſe, and impute her intruſion to the irreſiſtible dictates of love. No decayed rake ever-ſwallowed a bolus with more reluctance than I felt in making a reply ſuitable to this compliment, when, inſtead of the jewel, I found the crazy caſket only in my power; and yet my hopes began to revive a little, when I conſidered, that, by carrying on the appearance of an intrigue with the duenna, I might poſſibly obtain acceſs to her charge. Encouraged by this ſuggeſtion, my temper grew more ſerene; my reſerve wore off: I talked <hi>en cavalier,</hi> and even made love to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated coquette, who ſeemed extremely happy in her adorer, and ſpread all her allurements to make her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined conqueſt more ſecure. The good woman of the houſe treated us with tea and ſweatmeats, and afterwards withdrew, like a civil experienced matron as ſhe was. Left thus to our mutual endearments, Miſs Withers (for ſhe was ſtill a maiden) began to talk of matrimony, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſo much impatience in all her behaviour, that, had ſhe been fifty years younger, I might poſſibly have grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her longing without having recourſe to the church; but this my virtue as well as intereſt forbade. When the inclinations of an old maid ſettle upon a young fellow, he is perſecuted with her addreſſes; but, ſhould he once grant her the favour, he will never be able to diſentangle himſelf from her importunities and reproaches. It was my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to defer the ceremony as long as poſſible, under the moſt ſpecious pretences, with a view of becoming acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Miſs Sparkle in the mean time; and I did not deſpair of ſucceſs when I conſidered, that in the courſe of our correſpondence I ſhould, in all probability, be invited to viſit my miſtreſs in her own apartment, and by that means have an opportunity of converſing with her charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ward. Pleaſed with this proſpect, my heart dilated with joy, I talked in raptures to the ſtale governante, and kiſſed her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I loſt all patience and reflection, flung away from her in an inſtant, ſnatched my hat and cane, and ran down ſtairs as if the Devil had me in purſuit, and could ſcarce reſtrain the convulſions of my bowels, which were greviouſly offended by the perfume that aſſaulted me.

                     <p>After I had waſhed my mouth more than once, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited my ſpirits with a glaſs of wine, I recounted to him every particular of what had happened; to which he made no other reply for ſome time, than lifting up his eyes, claſping his hands, and uttering a hollow groan.—At length he obſerved, in a melancholy tone, that it was a thouſand pities my organs were ſo delicate as to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſmell of garlic: "Ah!

Whether the old gentlewoman reſented my abrupt departure ſo much, that her love changed into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, or was aſhamed to ſee me on account of her infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, I know not, but I was never troubled again with her paſſion.</p>

                        <p>I cultivate an acquaintance with two noblemen—am intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Earl Strutwell—his kind promiſe and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the behaviour of his porter and lackey—he receives me with an appearance of uncommon affection—undertakes to ſpeak in my behalf to the miniſter—informs me of his ſucceſs, and wiſhes me joy—introduces a converſation about Petronius Arbiter—falls in love with my watch, which I preſs upon him—I make a preſent of a diamond ring to Lord Straddle—impart my good fortune to Strap, and Banter who diſabuſes me, to my utter mortification.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BAFFLED hitherto in my matrimonial ſchemes, I began to queſtion my talents for the ſcience of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-bunting, and to bend my thoughts towards ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment under the government.—With the view of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing which, I cultivated the acquaintance of Lords Straddle and Swillpot, whoſe fathers were men of intereſt at court.—I found theſe young noblemen as open to my advances as I could deſire: I accompanied them in their midnight rambles, and often dined with them at taverns, where I had the honour of paying the reckoning.</p>
                     <p>I one day took the opportunity, while I was loaded with proteſtations of friendſhip, to diſcloſe my deſire of being ſettled in ſome ſinecure, and to ſolicit their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in my behalf.—Swillpot ſqueezing my hand, ſaid, I might depend upon his ſervice, by G—d. The other ſwore that no man would be more proud than he to run my errands. Encouraged by theſe declarations, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to expreſs an inclination to be introduced to their fathers, who were able to do my buſineſs at once. Swill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot frankly owned he had not ſpoke to his father theſe three years; and Straddle aſſured me his father having lately diſobliged the miniſter by ſubſcribing his name to a proteſt in the Houſe of Peers, was thereby rendered inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſerving his friends at preſent; but he undertook to make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell, who was hand and glove with a certain perſon who ruled the roaſt. This offer I embraced with many acknowledgments, and plied him ſo cloſely, in ſpite of a thouſand evaſions, that
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:027715_0353_0FD5EE47AA4C6E20"/>
he found himſelf under a neceſſity of keeping his word, and actually carried me to the levee of this great man, where he left me in a crowd of fellow-dependants, and was uſhered to a particular cloſet audience; from whence in a few minutes he returned with his Lordſhip, who took me by the hand, aſſured me he would do me all the ſervice he could, and deſired to ſee me often.—I was charmed with my reception, and although I had heard that a courtier's promiſe was not to be depended upon, I thought I diſcovered ſo much ſweetneſs of temper in this Earl's countenance, that I did not doubt of profiting by his protection. I reſolved, therefore, to avail myſelf of his permiſſion, and waited on him next audience-day, when I was favoured with a particular ſmile, ſqueeze of the hand, and a whiſper, ſignifying that he wanted half an hour's converſation with me <hi>téte a téte,</hi> when he ſhould be diſengaged, and for that purpoſe deſired me to come and drink a diſh of chocolate with him to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—This invitation, which did not a little flatter my vanity and expectation, I took care to obſerve, and went to his Lordſhip's houſe at the time appointed. Having rapped at the gate, the porter unbolted and kept it half open, placing himſelf in the gap, like ſoldiers in a breach, to diſpute my paſſage. I aſked if his lord was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring?—He anſwered with a ſurly aſpect, "No."—"At what hour does he commonly riſe?" (ſaid I.)—"Sometimes ſooner, ſometimes later," (ſaid he, cloſing the door upon me by degrees.)—I then told him I was come by his Lordſhip's own appointment; to which this Cerberus replied, <q>I have received no orders about the matter;</q> and was upon the point of ſhutting me out, when I recollected myſelf all of a ſudden, and ſlipping a crown into his hand, begged as a favour that he would enquire and let me know whether or not the Earl was up. The grim janitor relented at the touch of my money, which he took with all the indifference of a tax-gatherer, and ſhewed me into a parlour, where, he ſaid, I might amuſe myſelf till ſuch time as his Lordſhip ſhould be awake.—I had not ſat ten minutes in this place, when a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entered, and without ſpeaking, ſtared at me. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted this piece of his behaviour into <q>Pray, Sir, what is your buſineſs?</q> and aſked the ſame queſtion I
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:027715_0354_0FD5CD93E88BAB50"/>
had put to the porter, when I accoſted him firſt. The lackey made the ſame reply, and diſappeared before I could get any further intelligence.—In a little while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on pretence of poking the fire, and looked at me again with great earneſtneſs; upon which I began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his meaning, and tipping him with half a crown, deſired he would be ſo good as to fall upon ſome method of letting the Earl know that I was in the houſe.—He made a low bow, and ſaid, "Yes, Sir," and vaniſhed.—This bounty was not thrown away, for in an inſtant he came back, and conducted me to a chamber, where I was received with great kindneſs and familiarity by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whom I found juſt riſen, in his morning gown and ſlippers.—After breakfaſt, he entered into a particular converſation with me about my travels, the remarks I had made abroad, and examined me to the full extent of my underſtanding.—My anſwers ſeemed to pleaſe him very much, he frequently ſqueezed my hand, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me with a ſingular complacency in his countenance, bid me depend upon his good offices with the miniſtry in my behalf. "Young men of your qualifications," ſaid he, <q>ought to be cheriſhed by every adminiſtration.—For my own part, I ſee ſo little merit in the world, that I have laid it down as a maxim, to encourage the leaſt appearance of genius and virtue, to the utmoſt of my power.—You have a great deal of both; and will not fail of making a figure one day, if I am not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but you muſt lay your account with mounting by gradual ſteps to the ſummit of your fortune.—<hi>Rome was not built in a day.</hi> As you underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages perfectly well, how would you like to croſs the ſea, as ſecretary to an embaſſy?</q>—I aſſured his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with great eagerneſs, that nothing could be more agreeable to my inclination: upon which he bid me make myſelf eaſy, my buſineſs was done, for he had a place of that kind in his view.—This piece of generoſity affected me ſo much, that I was unable for ſome time to expreſs my gratitude, which at length broke out in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my own unworthineſs, and encomiums on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.—I could not even help ſhedding tears at the goodneſs of this noble Lord, who no ſooner perceived them, than he caught me in his arms, hugged and kiſſed
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:027715_0355_0FD5EE4AEA933738"/>
me with a ſeemingly paternal affection.—Confounded at this uncommon inſtance of fondneſs for a ſtranger, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a few moments ſilent and aſhamed, then roſe and took my leave, after he had aſſured me that he would ſpeak to the miniſter in my favour that very day, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that I would not for the future give myſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of attending at his levee, but come at the ſame hour every day when he ſhould be at leiſure, which was three times a-week.</p>
                     <p>Though my hopes were now very ſanguine, I determined to conceal my proſpect from every body, even from Strap, until I ſhould be more certain of ſucceſs, and in the mean time give my patron no reſpite from my ſolicitations. When I renewed my viſit, I found the ſtreet-door opened to me as if by enchantment; but, in my paſſage towards the preſence-room, I was met by the valet de chambre, who caſt ſome furious looks at me, the meaning of which I could not comprehend. The Earl ſaluted me at entrance with a tender embrace, and wiſhed me joy of his ſucceſs with the premier, who, he ſaid, had preferred his recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to that of two other noblemen very urgent in behalf of their reſpective friends, and abſolutely promiſed that I ſhould go to a certain foreign court in quality of ſecretary to an ambaſſador and plenipotentiary, who was to ſet out in a few weeks on an affair of vaſt importance to the nation. I was thunderſtruck with my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and could make no other reply, than kneel and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to kiſs my benefactor's hand, which he would not permit, but raiſing me up, preſſed me to his breaſt with ſurpriſing emotion, and told me he had now taken upon himſelf the care of making my fortune.—What enhanced the value of the benefit ſtill the more, was his making light of the favour, and ſhifting the converſation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubject: among other topics of diſcourſe, that of the <hi>Belle Lettres</hi> was introduced, upon which his Lordſhip held forth with great taſte and erudition, and diſcovered an intimate knowledge of the authors of antiquity.—<q>Here's a book,</q> ſaid he, taking one from his boſom, <q>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with great elegance and ſpirit, and though the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:027715_0356_0FD5EE4CC925C818"/>
hand Petronius Arbiter, and aſked my opinion of his wit and manner.—I told him, that, in my opinion, he wrote with great eaſe and vivacity, but was withal ſo lewd and indecent, that he ought to find no quarter or protection among people of morals and taſte.—"I own," replied the Earl, <q>that his taſte in love is generally decried, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed condemned by our laws; but perhaps that may be more owing to prejudice and miſapprehenſion, than to true reaſon and deliberation.—The beſt man among the ancients is ſaid to have entertained that paſſion; one of the wiſeſt of their legiſlators has permitted the indulgence of it in his commonwealth; the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated poets have not ſcrupled to avow it at this day; it prevails not only over all the Eaſt, but in moſt parts of Europe; in our own country it gains ground apace, and in all probability will become in a ſhort time, a more faſhionable vice than ſimple fornication.—Indeed, there is ſomething to be ſaid in vindication of it; for notwithſtanding the ſeverity of the law againſt offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this way, it muſt be confeſſed that the practice of this paſſion is unattended with that curſe and burden upon ſociety, which proceeds from a race of miſerable and deſerted baſtards, who are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either murdered by their parents, deſerted to the utmoſt want and wretchedneſs, or bred up to prey upon the commonwealth; and it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prevents the debauchery of many a young maiden, and the proſtitution of honeſt mens wives; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the conſideration of health, which is much leſs liable to be impaired in the gratification of this appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, than in the exerciſe of common venery, which by ruining the conſtitutions of our young men, has produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a puny progeny that degenerates from generation to generation: nay, I have been told, that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive perhaps more powerful than all theſe, that induces people to cultivate this inclination; namely, the exquiſite pleaſure attending its ſucceſs.</q>

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:027715_0357_0FD5EE501F2914D0"/>
abſurd, and of pernicious conſequence; and declared my utter deteſtation and abhorrence of it in theſe lines of the ſatyriſt:
<q>
                           <l>Eternal infamy the wretch confound,</l>
                           <l>Who planted firſt this vice on Britiſh ground!</l>
                           <l>A vice! that, 'ſpite of ſenſe and nature, reigns,</l>
                           <l>And poiſons genial love, and manhood ſtains!</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Earl ſmiled at my indignation, told me he was glad to find my opinion of the matter ſo conformable to his own, and that what he had advanced was only to provoke me to an anſwer, with which he profeſſed himſelf perfectly well pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>After I had enjoyed a long audience, I happened to look at my watch, in order to regulate my motions by it: and his lordſhip, obſerving the chaſed caſe, deſired to ſee the device, and examine the execution, which he approved with ſome expreſſions of admiration. Conſidering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations I lay under to his lordſhip, I thought there could not be a fitter opportunity than the preſent to manifeſt in ſome ſhape my gratitude; I therefore begged he would do me the honour to accept of the watch as a ſmall teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſenſe I had of his Lordſhip's generoſity; but he refuſed it in a peremptory manner, and ſaid he was ſorry I ſhould entertain ſuch a mercenary opinion of him, obſerving at the ſame time, that it was the moſt beautiful piece of workmanſhip he had ever ſeen, and deſiring to know where he could have ſuch another. I begged a thouſand pardons for the freedom I had taken, which I hoped he would impute to nothing elſe than the higheſt veneration for his perſon—told him that, as it came to my hand by accident in France, I could give him no information about the maker; for there was no name on the inſide; and once more humbly entreated, that he would indulge me ſo far as to uſe it for my ſake. He was ſtill poſitive in refuſing it, but was pleaſed to thank me for my generous offer, ſaying, it was a preſent that no noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man need be aſhamed of receiving, though he was reſolved to ſhew his diſintereſtedneſs with regard to me, for whom he had conceived a particular friendſhip, and inſiſted (if I was willing to part with the watch) upon knowing what it coſt, that he might at leaſt indemnify me by refunding
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:027715_0358_0FD5EE50234D8578"/>
the money. On the other hand I aſſured his lordſhip, that I ſhould look upon it as an uncommon mark of diſtinction, if he would take it without farther queſtion; and, rather than diſoblige me, he was at laſt perſuaded to put it in his pocket, to my no ſmall ſatisfaction, who took my leave immediately, after having received a kind ſqueeze, and an injunction to depend on his promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Buoyed up with this reception, my heart opened; I gave away a guinea among the lacqueys who eſcorted me to the door, flew to the lodgings of Lord Straddle upon whom I forced my diamond ring as an acknowledgment for the great ſervice he had done me, and from thence hied myſelf home, with an intent of ſharing my happineſs with honeſt Strap. I determined, however, to heighten his pleaſure by depreſſing his ſpirits at firſt, and then bringing in the good news with double reliſh. For this purpoſe I affected the appearance of diſappointment and chagrin, and told him in an abrupt manner, that I had loſt the watch and diamond. Poor Hugh, who had been already harraſſed into a conſumption by intelligence of this ſort, no ſooner heard theſe words than, unable to contain himſelf, he cried with diſtraction in his looks, <q>God in heaven forbid!</q>—I could carry on the farce no longer, but, laughing in his face, told him every thing that had paſſed as before recited. His features were immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bended, and the tranſition ſo affecting, that he wept with joy, calling my Lord Strutwell by the appellations of jewel, phoenix, <hi>rara avis,</hi> and praiſing God, that there was ſtill ſome virtue among our nobility. Our mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations being over, we gave way to our imagination, and anticipated our happineſs by proſecuting our ſucceſs through the different ſteps of promotion, till I arrived at the rank of prime miniſter, and he to that of my firſt ſecretary.</p>
                     <p>Intoxicated with theſe ideas, I went to the ordinary, where, meeting with Banter, I communicated the whole affair in confidence to him, concluding with an aſſurance, that I would do him all the ſervice in my power. He heard me to an end with great patience, then, regarding me a good while with a look of diſdain, pronounced, "So, your buſineſs is done, you think!"—<q>As good as done, I believe,</q> ſaid I. "I'll tell you," replied he,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:027715_0359_0FD5EE51D6AEF9F0"/>
                        <q>what will do it more effectually—a halter—'Sdeath! if I had been ſuch a gull to two ſuch ſcoundrels as Strut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well and Straddle, I would without any more ado tuck myſelf up.</q> Shocked at this exclamation, I deſired him, with ſome confuſion, to explain himſelf: upon which he gave me to underſtand, that Straddle was a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible wretch, who lived by borrowing, and pimping for his fellow peers; that, in conſequence of this laſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, he had doubtleſs introduced me to Strutwell, who was ſo notorious for a paſſion for his own ſex, that he was amazed his character had never reached my ears; and that ſo far from being able to obtain for me the poſt he had promiſed, his intereſt at court was ſo low, that he could ſcarce provide for a ſuperannuated footman once a-year in the cuſtoms or exciſe;—that it was a common thing for him to amuſe ſtrangers, whom his jackals run down, with ſuch aſſurances and careſſes as he had beſtowed on me, until he had ſtripped them of their caſh, and every thing valuable about them, very often of their chaſtity, and then leave them a prey to want and infamy—that he allowed his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants no other wages than that part of the ſpoil which they could glean by their induſtry—and that the whole of his conduct towards me was ſo glaring, that nobody who knew any thing of mankind could have been impoſed upon by his inſinuations.</p>
                     <p>I leave the reader to judge how I reliſhed this piece of information, which precipitated me from the moſt exalted pinnacle of hope to the loweſt abyſs of deſpondence, and well nigh determined me to take Banter's advice, and finiſh my chagrin with a halter. I had no room to ſuſpect the veracity of my friend, becauſe, upon recollection, I found every circumſtance of Strutwell's behaviour exactly tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying with the character he had deſcribed: his hugs, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, ſqueezes, and eager looks, were now no longer a myſtery—no more than his defence of Petronius, and the jealous frown of his valet de chambre, who, it ſeems, had been the favourite pathic of his lord.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>I attempt to recover my watch and jewel, but to no purpoſe—reſolve to revenge myſelf on Strutwell by my importunity—am reduced to my laſt guinea—obliged to inform Strap of my neceſſity, who is almoſt diſtracted with the news—but nevertheleſs obliged to pawn my beſt ſword for preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence—that ſmall ſupply being exhauſted, I am almoſt ſtupified with my misfortune—go to the gaming-table by the advice of Banter, and come off with unexpected ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs—Strap's extaſy—Mrs. Gawky waits upon me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes remorſe for her perfidy, and implores my aſſiſtance—I do myſelf a piece of juſtice by her means, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards reconcile her to her father.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I WAS ſo confounded that I could make no reply to Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who reproached me with great indignation for having thrown away upon raſcals that, which, had it been converted into ready money, would have ſupported the rank of a gentleman for ſome months, and enabled me at the ſame time to oblige my friends. Stupified as I was, I could eaſily divine the ſource of his concern, but ſneaked away in a ſolitary manner, without yielding the leaſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his expoſtulations, and began to deliberate with myſelf in what manner I ſhould attempt to retrieve the moveables I had ſo fooliſhly loſt. I ſhould have thought it no robbery to take them again by force, could I have done it without any danger of being detected; but, as I could have no ſuch opportunity, I reſolved to work by <hi>fineſſe,</hi> and go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle, where I was ſo fortunate as to find him.—"My Lord," ſaid I, <q>I have juſt now recollected, that the diamond I had the honour of preſenting to you is looſened in the ſocket, and there is a young fellow juſt arrived from Paris, who is reckoned the beſt jeweller in Europe; I knew him in France; and, if your Lordſhip will give me leave, I will carry the ring to him to be ſet to rights.</q> His lordſhip was not to be caught in the ſnare—he thanked me for my offer, and told me, that, having himſelf obſerved the defect, he had already ſent it to his own jeweller to be mended: and indeed, by
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:027715_0361_0FD5EE555A79E4A0"/>
this time, I believe it was in the jeweller's hands, though not in order to be mended; for it ſtood in need of no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.</p>
                     <p>Baulked in this piece of politics, I curſed my ſimplicity, but reſolved to play a ſurer game with the earl, which I thus deviſed. I did not doubt of being admitted into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar converſation with him as before, and hoped by ſome means to get the watch into my hand, then, on pretence of winding or playing with it, drop it on the floor, which in all probability would diſorder the work ſo as to ſtop its motion. This event would furniſh me with an opportunity of inſiſting upon carrying it away in order to be repaired; and had this happened, I ſhould have been in no hurry to bring it back. What pity it was I could not find an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of putting this fine ſcheme in execution! When I went to renew my viſit to his lordſhip, my acceſs to the parlour was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> free as ever; but, after I had waited ſome time, the valet de chambre came in with his lord's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, and a deſire to ſee me to-morrow at his levee, being at preſent ſo much indiſpoſed that he could not ſee company. I interpreted his meſſage into a bad omen, and came away, muttering curſes againſt his lordſhip's polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ready to go to loggerheads with myſelf for being ſo egregriouſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. But, that I might have ſome ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the loſs I had ſuſtained, I beſieged him cloſely at his levee, and perſecuted him with my ſolicitations, not without faint hopes, indeed, of reaping ſomething more from my induſtry than the bare pleaſure of making him uneaſy, though I could never obtain another private hearing during the whole courſe of my attendance; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had I reſolution enough to undeceive Strap, whoſe looks in a little time were ſo whetted with impatience, that whenever I came home, his eyes devoured me, as it were, with eagerneſs of attention.</p>
                     <p>At length, however, finding myſelf reduced to my laſt guinea, I was compelled to diſcloſe my neceſſity, though I endeavoured to ſweeten the diſcovery by rehearſing to him the daily aſſurances I received from my patron. But theſe promiſes were not of efficacy ſufficient to ſupport the ſpirits of my friend, who no ſooner underſtood the lowneſs of my finances than, uttering a dreadful groan, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "In the name of God, what ſhall we do?" In
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:027715_0362_0FD5EE5767ADEDB0"/>
order to comfort him, I ſaid that many of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who were in a worſe condition than we, ſupported, notwithſtanding, the character and appearance of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and adviſing him to thank God, that we had as yet incurred no debt, propoſed he ſhould pawn my ſword of ſteel inlaid with gold, and truſt to my diſcretion for the reſt. This expedient was wormwood and gall to poor Strap, who, in ſpite of his invincible affection for me, ſtill retained notions of economy and expence ſuitable to the narrowneſs of his education; nevertheleſs, he complied with my requeſt, and raiſed ſeven pieces on the ſword in a twinkling. This ſupply, inconſiderable as it was, made me as happy for the preſent as if I had five hundred pounds in bank; for by this time I was ſo well ſkilled in procraſtinating every troubleſome reflection, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of want ſeldom affected me very much, let it be ever ſo near: and now, indeed, it was nearer than I imagined; for my landlord, having occaſion for money, put me in mind of my being indebted to him five guineas in lodging, and, telling me that he had a ſum to make up, begged I would excuſe his importunity, and diſcharge the debt. Though I could ill ſpare ſo much caſh, my pride took the reſolution of diſburſing it, which I did in a cavalier man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after he had written a diſcharge, telling him with an air of ſcorn and reſentment, I ſaw he was reſolved that I ſhould not be long in his books, while Strap, who ſtood by, and knew my circumſtances, wrung his hands in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, gnawed his nether lip, and turned yellow with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. Whatever appearance of indifference my vanity enabled me to put on, I was thunderſtruck with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which I had no ſooner ſatisfied than I haſtened into company, with a view of beguiling my cares with conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, or drowning them in wine.</p>
                     <p>After dinner accordingly a party was made in the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe, from whence we adjourned to the tavern, where inſtead of ſharing the mirth of the company, I was as much chagrined at their good humour as a damned ſoul in hell would be at a glimpſe of heaven.—In vain did I ſwallow bumper after bumper! the wine had loſt its effect upon me, and ſo far from raiſing my dejected ſpirits, could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ven lay me aſleep.—Banter who was the only inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate I had, (Strap excepted,) perceived my anxiety, and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:027715_0363_0FD5EE586131E8D8"/>
when we broke up, reproached me with puſillanimity, for being caſt down at any diſappointment that ſuch a raſcal as Strutwell could be the occaſion of.—I told him I did not at all ſee how Strutwell's being a raſcal alleviated my misfortune: and gave him to underſtand, that my preſent grief did not ſo much proceed from that diſappointment, as from the low ebb of my fortune, which was ſunk to ſomething leſs than two guineas.—At this declaration he cried, "Pſhaw! is that all?" and aſſured me there were a thouſand ways of living in town without fortune, he himſelf having ſubſiſted many years entirely by his wit.—I expreſſed my eager deſire of being acquainted with ſome of theſe methods, and he, without further expoſtulation, bid me follow him.—He conducted me to a houſe under the piazzas in Covent Garden, which we entered, and having delivered our ſwords to a grim fellow, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them at the foot of the ſtair-caſe, aſcended to the ſecond ſtory, where I ſaw multitudes of people ſtanding round two gaming tables, loaded in a manner with gold and ſilver.—My conductor let me know that this was the houſe of a worthy Scotch lord, who uſing the privilege of his peerage, had ſet up a public gaming table, from the profits of which he drew a comfortable livelihood.—He then explained the difference between the <hi>ſitters</hi> and the <hi>betters;</hi> characterized the firſt as old rooks, and the laſt as bubbles; and adviſed me to try my fortune at the ſilver table, by betting a crown at a time.—Before I would venture any thing, I conſidered the company more particularly, and there appeared ſuch a group of villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faces, that I was ſtruck with horror and aſtoniſhment at the ſight! I ſignified my ſurpriſe to Banter, who whiſpered in my ear, that the bulk of thoſe preſent were ſharpers, highwaymen, and apprentices, who having em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzled their maſter's caſh, made a deſperate puſh in this place, to make up their deficiencies.—This account did not encourage me to hazard any part of my ſmall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but at length being teized by the importunities of my friend, who aſſured me there was no danger of being ill uſed, people being hired by the owner to ſee juſtice done to every body; I began by riſking one ſhilling, and in leſs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n an hour, my winning amounted to thirty.—Convinced by this time of the fairneſs of the game, and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:027715_0364_0FD5EE5BE17D3A18"/>
animated with ſucceſs, there was no need for any further perſuaſion to continue the play; I lent Banter (who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had any money in his pocket) a guinea, which he carried to the gold table and loſt in a moment.—He would have borrowed another, but finding me deaf to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, went away in a pet.—Mean while my gain advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſix pieces, and my deſire of more increaſed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; ſo that I moved to the higher table, where I laid half a guinea on every throw, and fortune ſtill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring me, I became a ſitter, in which capacity I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until it was broad day; when I found myſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many viciſſitudes, one hundred and fifty guineas in pocket.</p>
                     <p>Thinking it now high time to retire with my booty, I aſked if any body would take my place, and made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to riſe; upon which an old Gaſcon, who ſat oppoſite to me, and of whom I had won a little money, ſtarted up with fury in his looks, crying, <q>
                           <hi>Reſtez, foutre, reſtez, il faut donner moi mon ranvanchio!</hi>
                        </q> At the ſame time a Jew, who ſat near the other, inſinuated, that I was more beholden to art than fortune, for what I had got; that he had obſerved me wipe the table very often, and that ſome of the diviſions ſeemed to be greaſy. This intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced a great deal of clamour againſt me, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially among the loſers, who threatened with many oaths and imprecations, to take me up by a warrant as a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, unleſs I would compromiſe the affair by refunding the greateſt part of my winning.—Though I was far from being eaſy under this accuſation, I relied upon my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, threatened in my turn to proſecute the Jew for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, and boldly offered to ſubmit my cauſe to the examination of any juſtice in Weſtminſter; but they knew themſelves too well to put their characters on that iſſue, and finding I was not to be intimidated into any conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, dropped their plea, and made way for me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw. I would not however ſtir from the table until the Iſraelite had retracted what he had ſaid to my diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and aſked pardon before the whole aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>As I marched out with my prize, I happened to tread upon the toes of a tall, raw-boned fellow, with a hooked noſe, fierce eyes, black thick eye-brows, a pig-tail wig of the ſame colour, and a formidable hat pulled over his
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:027715_0365_0FD5EE5D51F2E4F8"/>
forehead, who ſtood gnawing his ſingers in the crowd, and no ſooner felt the application of my ſhoe-heel, than he roared out in a tremendous voice, <q>Blood and wounds, you ſon of a whore! what's that for?</q>—I aſked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with a great deal of ſubmiſſion, and proteſted I had no intention of hurting him; but the more I humbled myſelf the more he ſtormed, and inſiſted upon gentleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfaction, at the ſame time provoking me with ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous names, that I could not put up with; ſo that I gave a looſe to my paſſion, returned his Billingſgate, and challenged him to follow me down to the piazzas.—His indignation cooled as mine warmed, he refuſed my invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſaying, he would chuſe his own time, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the table muttering threats, which I neither dreaded nor diſtinctly heard; but deſcending with great deliberation, received my ſword from the door-keeper, whom I gratified with a guinea according to the cuſtom of the place, and went home in a rapture of joy.</p>
                     <p>My faithful valet, who had ſat up all night in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt uneaſineſs on my account, let me in with his face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlubbered with tears, and followed me to my chamber, where he ſtood ſilent like a condemned criminal, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of hearing that every ſhilling was ſpent.—I gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſituation of his thoughts, and aſſuming a ſullen look, bid him fetch me ſome water to waſh.—He replied, without lifting his eyes from the ground, <q>In my ſimple conjecture, you have more occaſion for reſt, not having, I ſuppoſe, ſlept theſe four and twenty hours.</q>—<q>Bring me ſome water,</q> (ſaid I in a peremptory tone;) upon which he ſneaked away, ſhrugging his ſhoulders. Before he returned, I had ſpread my whole ſtock on the table in the moſt oſtentations manner; ſo that when it firſt ſaluted his view, he ſtood like one intranced, and having rubbed his eyes more than once, to aſſure himſelf of his being awake, broke out into, <q>Lord have mercy upon us, what a vaſt treaſure is here?</q>—<q>'Tis all our own, Strap,</q> ſaid I, <q>take what is neceſſary, and redeem the ſword immediately.</q>—He advanced towards the table, ſtopt ſhort by the way, looked at the money and me by turns, and with a wildneſs in his countenance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from joy checked by diſtruſt, cried, <q>I dare ſay it is honeſtly come by.</q>—To remove his ſcruples, I made

God be praiſed! a white ſtone!</q>—ſo that I was afraid the ſudden change of fortune had diſordered his intellects, and that he was run mad with joy.—Extremely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this event, I attempted to reaſon him out of his frenzy, but to no purpoſe, for without regarding what I ſaid, he continued to friſk up and down, and repeat his rhapſody of, "God be praiſed! a white ſtone!" At laſt I roſe in the utmoſt conſternation, and laying violent hands upon him, put a ſtop to his extravagance, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him down to a ſettee that was in the room.—This conſtraint baniſhed his delirium; he ſtarted, as if juſt awoke, and, terrified at my behaviour, cried, <q>What is the matter?</q> When he learned the cauſe of my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, he was aſhamed of his tranſports, and told me, that in mentioning the white ſtone, he alluded to the <hi>Dies faſti</hi> of the Romans, <hi>albo lapide notati.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having no inclination to ſleep, I ſecured my caſh, dreſſed, and was juſt going abroad, when the ſervant of the houſe told me, there was a gentlewoman at the door who wanted to ſpeak with me. Surpriſed at this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I bid Strap ſhow her up, and in leſs than a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute ſaw a young woman of a ſhabby decayed appearance enter my room. After half a dozen curt'ſies, ſhe began to ſob, and told me her name was Gawky; upon which I immediately recollected the features of Miſs Lavement, who had been the firſt occaſion of my misfortunes.—Though I had all the reaſon in the world to reſent her treacherous uſage of me, I was moved at her diſtreſs, and, profeſſing my ſorrow at ſeeing her ſo reduced, deſired her to ſit, and inquired into the particulars of her ſituation. She fell upon her knees, and implored my forgiveneſs for the injuries ſhe had done me, proteſting before God, that ſhe was forced againſt her inclination into that helliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which had almoſt deprived me of my life, by the entreaties of her huſband, who, having been afterwards renounced by his father on account of his marriage with her, and unable to ſupport a family on his pay, left his wife at her father's houſe, and went with the regiment to Germany, where he was broke for miſbehaviour at the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027715_0367_0FD5EE5FD807E6B8"/>
battle of Dettingen, ſince which time ſhe had heard no tidings of him. She then gave me to underſtand, with many ſymptoms of penitence, that it was her misfortune to bear a child four months after marriage, by which her parents were ſo incenſed, that ſhe was turned out of doors with the infant, that died ſoon after, and had hitherto ſubſiſted, in a miſerable indigent manner, on the extorted charity of a few friends, who were now quite tired of giving; that, not knowing where or how to ſupport her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one day longer, ſhe had fled for ſuccour even to me, who of all mankind had the leaſt cauſe to aſſiſt her, relying upon the generoſity of my diſpoſition, which, ſhe hoped, would be pleaſed with this opportunity of avenging itſelf in the nobleſt manner on the wretch who had wronged me.—I was very much affected with her diſcourſe, and having no cauſe to ſuſpect the ſincerity of her repentance, raiſed her up, freely pardoned all ſhe had done againſt me, and promiſed to befriend her as much as lay in my power.</p>
                     <p>Since my laſt arrival in London, I had made no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to the apothecary, imagining it would be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to make my innocence appear, ſo unhappily was my accuſation circumſtanced: Strap indeed had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to juſtify me to the ſchoolmaſter; but ſo far from ſucceeding in his attempt, Mr. Concordance dropt all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with him, becauſe he refuſed to quit his connection with me.—Things being in this ſituation, I thought a fairer opportunity of vindicating my character could not offer, than that which now preſented itſelf; therefore ſtipulated with Mrs. Gawky, that before I yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the leaſt aſſiſtance, ſhe ſhould do me the juſtice to clear my reputation, by explaining upon oath before a magiſtrate, the whole of the conſpiracy, as it had been executed againſt me.—When ſhe had given me this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I preſented her with five guineas, a ſum ſo much above her expectation, that ſhe could ſcarce believe the evidence of her ſenſes, and was ready to worſhip me for my benevolence.—The declaration, ſigned with her own hand, I ſent to her father, who, upon recollecting and comparing the circumſtances of my charge, was convinced of my integrity, and waited on me next day, in company with his friend the ſchoolmaſter, to whom he had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated

my vindication.—After mutual ſalutation Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Lavement began a long apology for the unjuſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I received; but I ſaved him a good deal of breath, by interrupting his harangue, and aſſuring him, that ſo far from entertaining any reſentment againſt him, I thought myſelf obliged to his lenity, which allowed me to eſcape, after ſuch ſtrong preſumptions of guilt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me. Mr. Concordance thinking it now his turn to ſpeak, obſerved, that Mr. Random had too much candour and ſagacity to be diſobliged at their conduct, which, all things conſidered, could not have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, with any honeſty of intention, "Indeed," ſaid he, <q>if the plot had been unravelled to us by any ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intelligence; if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The warrior's powder was quite ſpent; the lawyer adviſed him to drop the proſecution; and a grave matron, who ſat on the left hand of the victorious wit, told her ſhe muſt not let her tongue run ſo faſt among ſtrangers. This reprimand, ſoftened with the appellation of child, convinced me, that the ſatirical lady was no other than Miſs Snapper, and I reſolved to regulate my conduct accordingly. The champion, finding himſelf ſo ſmartly handled, changed his battery, and began to expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate on his own exploits. "You talk of ſhot, Madam," ſaid he, <q>damme!

I don't chuſe to name no names, ſink me! but, howſomever, this I will refer, by G—d, and that is this—a muſqueteer of the French guards, having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a ſtandard from a certain cornet of a certain regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, damme! was retreating with the prize as faſt as his horſes heels could carry him, ſink me! upon which, I ſnatched up a firelock that belonged to a dead man, damme! whiz! and ſhot his horſe under him, d—n my blood! The fellow got upon his feet, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me; upon which I charged my bayonet breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high, and run him through the body, by G—d!—One of his comrades, coming to his aſſiſtance, ſhot me in the ſhoulder as I told you before, and another gave me a confuſion on the head with the butt-end of his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine; but damme, that did not ſignify—I killed one, put the other to flight, and, taking up the ſtandard, carried it off very deliberately. But the beſt joke of all was, the ſon of a b—of a cornet, who had ſurrendered it in a cowardly manner, ſeeing it in my poſſeſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it from me in the front of the line.</q> 
                        <q>D—n my blood,</q> ſays he, <q>where did you find my ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard?</q> ſays he.

                     </p>
                     <p>Having vented this repetition of expletive, the lawyer owned he had not been requited according to his deſerts, obſerved that the labourer is always worthy of his hire,

                        </q>
The ſenſe of the reſt he perverted, as he went on, with ſuch ſurpriſing facility, that I could not help thinking he had been at ſome pains to burleſque the performance. Miſs Snapper aſcribed it to the true cauſe, namely, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and, when he aſked her how ſhe reliſhed the muſic, anſwered, in her opinion, the muſic and the words were much of a piece. "O! d—n my blood!' ſaid he, <q>I take that as a high compliment; for every body allows the words are damnable fine.</q> "They may be ſo," replied the lady, <q>for aught I know, but they are above my comprehenſion.</q>—<q>I an't obliged to find you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, Madam, curſe me!</q> cried he.—<q>No, nor to ſpeak ſenſe neither,</q> ſaid ſhe.—"D—n my heart," ſaid he, "I'll ſpeak what I pleaſe."

I'm a gentleman, and bear the king's commiſſion—'Sblood! ſome people deſerve to have their noſes pulled for their impertinence.</q> I thought to have checked theſe ejaculations by a frown, becauſe he had talked ſo much of his valour, that I had long ago rated him an aſs in a lion's ſkin; but, ſo far from anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my expectations, he took umbrage at the contraction of my brows, ſwore he did not value my ſulky look a fig's end, and proteſted he feared no man breathing. Miſs Snapper ſaid, ſhe was very glad to find herſelf in company with a man of ſo much courage, who ſhe did not doubt would protect us all from the attempts of highwaymen during our journey. <q>Make yourſelf perfectly eaſy on that head, Madam,</q> replied the officer; <q>I have got a pair of piſtols (here they are) which I took from a
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:027715_0376_0FD5EE71F4590BF8"/>
horſe-officer at the battle of Dettingen—they are dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-loaded, and if any highwayman in England robs you of the value of a pin, while I have the honour of being in your company, d—n my heart.</q> When he had expreſſed himſelf in this manner, a prim gentlewoman, who had ſat ſilent hitherto, opened her mouth, and ſaid, ſhe wondered how any man could be ſo rude as to pull out ſuch weapons before ladies. "Damme, Madam," cried the champion, <q>if you are ſo much afraid at ſight of a piſtol, how d'ye propoſe to ſtand fire if there ſhould be occaſion?</q> She then told him, that if ſhe thought he could be ſo unmannerly as to uſe fire arms in her preſence, whatever might be the occaſion, ſhe would get out of the coach immediately, and walk to the next village, where ſhe might procure a convenience to herſelf. Before he could make any anſwer, my Dulcinea interpoſed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that, ſo far from being offended at a gentleman's uſing his arms in his own defence, ſhe thought herſelf very lucky in being along with one by whoſe valour ſhe ſtood a good chance of ſaving herſelf from being rifled. The prude caſt a diſdainful look at miſs, and ſaid, that people who had but little to loſe are ſometimes the moſt ſolicitous about preſerving it. The old lady was affronted at this inuendo, and took notice, that people ought to be very well informed before they ſpeak ſlightingly of other people's fortunes, leſt they diſcover their own envy, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ridiculous. The daughter declared, that ſhe did not pretend to vie with any body in point of riches, and if the lady who inſiſted upon non-reſiſtance, would promiſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify us all for the loſs we ſhould ſuſtain, ſhe would be one of the firſt to perſuade the captain to ſubmiſſion, in caſe we ſhould be attacked. To this propoſal, reaſonable as it was, the reſerved lady made no other reply than a ſcornful glance, and a toſs of her head. I was very well pleaſed with the ſpirit of my miſtreſs, and even wiſhed for an opportunity of diſtinguiſhing my courage under her eye, which I believed could not fail of prepoſſeſſing her in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, when all of a ſudden Strap rode up to the coach-door, and told us in a great fright, that two men on horſeback were croſſing the heath, (for by this time we had paſſed Hounſlow,) and made directly towards us. This piece of information was no ſooner delivered than Mrs. Snapper

began to ſcream, her daughter grew pale, the other lady pulled out her purſe to be in readineſs, the lawyer's teeth chattered, while he pronounced, <q>'Tis no matter—we'll ſue the county, and recover;</q> the captain gave evident ſigns of confuſion, and I, after having commanded the coachman to ſtop, opened the doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, jumped out, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the warrior to follow me: but, finding him back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and aſtoniſhed, I took his piſtols, and giving them to Strap, who, by this time, had alighted, and trembled very much, I mounted on horſeback; and taking my own (which I could better depend upon) from the holſters, cocked them both, and faced the robbers, who were now very near us. Seeing me ready to oppoſe them on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and another man armed a-foot, they made a halt, at ſome diſtance to reconnoitre us, and after having rode round us twice, myſelf ſtill facing about as they rode, went off, the ſame way they came, at a hand gallop. A gentleman's ſervant coming up with a horſe at the ſame time, I offered him a crown to aſſiſt me in purſuing them, which he no ſooner accepted than I armed him with the officer's piſtols, and we galloped after the thieves, who, truſting to the ſwiftneſs of their horſes, ſtopped till we came within ſhot of them, and then firing at us, put their nags to the full ſpeed. We followed them as faſt as our beaſts could carry us, but not being ſo well mounted as they, our efforts would have been to little purpoſe, had not the horſe of one of them ſtumbled, and thrown his rider with ſuch violence over his head, that he lay ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when we came up, and was taken without the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, while his comrade conſulted his own ſafety in flight, without regarding the diſtreſs of his friend. We ſcarce had time to make ourſelves maſters of his arms, and tie his hands together, before he recovered his ſenſes, when, learning his ſituation, he affected ſurprize, demanded to know by what authority we uſed a gentleman in that manner, and had the impudence to threaten us with a proſecution for robbery. In the mean time we perceived Strap coming up with a crowd of people armed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of weapons, and among the reſt a farmer, who no ſooner perceived the thief whom we had ſecured, than he cried with great emotion, <q>There's the fellow who robbed me an hour ago of twenty pounds in a
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:027715_0378_0FD5EE74DC666E78"/>
canvas bag.</q> He was immediately ſearched, and the money ſound exactly as it had been deſcribed: upon which, we committed him to the charge of the countryman, who carried him to the town of Hounſlow, which it ſeems the farmer had alarmed; and I having ſatisfied the footman for his trouble, according to promiſe, returned with Strap to the coach, where I found the captain and lawyer buſy in adminiſtering ſmelling-bottles and cordials to the grave lady, who had gone into a fit at the noiſe of the firing.</p>
                     <p>When I had taken my ſeat, Miſs Snapper, who from the coach had ſeen every thing that happened, made me a compliment on my behaviour, and ſaid ſhe was glad to ſee me returned, without having received any injury; her mother too owned herſelf obliged to my reſolution; and the lawyer told me, that I was entitled by act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a reward of forty pounds, for having apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a highwayman.—The ſoldier obſerved, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in which impudence and ſhame ſtruggling produced ſome diſorder, that if I had not been in ſuch a damned hurry to get out of the coach, he would have ſecured the rogues effectually, without all this buſtle and loſs of time, by a ſcheme which my heat and precipitation ruined.—"For my own part," continued he, <q>I am always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely cool on theſe occaſions.</q>—<q>So it appeared by your trembling,</q> ſaid the young lady.—<q>Death and damnation!</q> cried he, <q>your ſex protects you, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: if any man on earth durſt tell me ſo much, I'd ſend him to hell, damn my heart! in an inſtant.</q>—So ſaying, he fixed his eyes upon me, and aſked if I had ſeen him tremble.—I anſwered without heſitation, "Yes."—"Damme, Sir," ſaid he, "d'ye doubt my courage?"—I replied, "Very much."—This declaration quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted him.—He looked blank, and pronounced with a faultering voice, <q>Oh! 'tis very well—D—n my blood! I ſhall find a time.</q>—I ſignified my contempt of him, by thruſting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him ſo much, that he ſcarce ſwore another oath aloud during the whole journey.</p>
                     <p>The preciſe lady, having recruited her ſpirits by the help of ſome ſtrong waters, began a ſoliloquy, in which ſhe wondered that any man who pretended to maintain the character of a gentleman, could, for the ſake of a little
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:027715_0379_0FD5EE76CA38CE58"/>
paultry coin, throw perſons of honour into ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries as might endanger their lives; and profeſſed her ſurprize, that women were not aſhamed to commend ſuch brutality. At the ſame time vowing, that for the future ſhe would never ſet foot in a ſtage-coach, if a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience could be had for love or money.</p>
                     <p>Nettled at her remarks, I took the ſame method of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying my ſentiments, and wondered in my turn, that any woman of common ſenſe ſhould be ſo unreaſonable as to expect that people, who had neither acquaintance nor connection with her, would tamely allow themſelves to be robbed and mal-treated, merely to indulge her capricious humour. I likewiſe profeſſed my aſtoniſhment at her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence and ingratitude in taxing a perſon with brutality, who deſerved her approbation and acknowledgment; and vowed, that if ever we ſhould be aſſaulted again, I would leave her to the mercy of the ſpoiler, that ſhe might know the value of my protection.</p>
                     <p>This perſon of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation any further, but ſeemed to chew the cud of her reſentment with the creſt-fallen captain, while I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into diſcourſe with my charmer, who was the more pleaſed with my converſation, as ſhe had conceived a very indifferent opinion of my intellects from my former ſilence. I ſhould have had cauſe to be equally ſatisfied with the ſprightlineſs of her genius, could ſhe have curbed her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with judgment; but ſhe laboured under ſuch a profuſion of talk, that I dreaded her unruly tongue, and felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal clack! How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when I conſidered on the other hand, the joys at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the poſſeſſion of twenty thouſand pounds, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her imperfections, ſeized occaſion by the forelock, and endeavoured to inſinuate myſelf into her affection.—The careful mother kept a ſtrict watch over her, and though ſhe could not help behaving civilly to me, took frequent opportunities of diſcouraging our communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reprimanding her for being ſo free with ſtrangers and telling her ſhe muſt learn to ſpeak leſs and think more.—Abridged of the uſe of ſpeech, we converſed with our eyes, and found the young lady very eloquent in this kind of diſcourſe. In ſhort, I had reaſon to believe, that ſhe was ſick of the old gentlewoman's tuition, and
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:027715_0380_0FD5EE7A5EDB94F8"/>
that I ſhould find it no difficult matter to ſuperſede her authority.</p>
                     <p>When we arrived at the place where we were to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, I alighted, and helped my miſtreſs out of the coach, as well as her mother, who called for a private room, to which they withdrew, in order to eat by themſelves.—As they retired together, I perceived that Miſs had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> more twiſts from nature than I had before obſerved, being bent ſideways into the figure of an S, ſo that her progreſſion very much reſembled that of a crab.—The prude alſo choſe the captain for her meſs-mate, and ordered break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt for two only to be brought into another ſeparate room; while the lawyer and I, deſerted by the reſt of the company, were fain to put up with each other. I was a good deal chagrined at the ſtately reſerve of Mrs. Snap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who I thought did not uſe me with all the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance I deſerved; and my companion declared, that he had been a traveller theſe twenty years, and never knew the ſtage-coach rules ſo much infringed before. As for the honourable gentlewoman, I could not conceive the meaning of her attachment to the lieutenant; and aſked the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer if he knew for which of the ſoldier's virtues ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him; the counſellor facetiouſly replied, <q>I ſuppoſe the lady knows him to be an able conveyancer, and wants him to make a ſettlement intail.</q>—I could not help laughing at the archneſs of the barriſter, who entertained me during breakfaſt with a good deal of wit of the ſame kind, at the expence of our fellow-travellers; and among other things ſaid, he was ſorry to find the young lady ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with ſuch incumbrances.</p>
                     <p>When we had made an end of our repaſt, and paid our reckoning, we went into the coach, took our places, and bribed the driver with ſixpence, to revenge us on the reſt of his fare, by hurrying them away in the midſt of their meal.—This he performed to our ſatisfaction, after he had diſturbed their enjoyment with his importunate clamour. The mother and daughter obeyed the ſummons firſt, and coming to the coach door, were obliged to deſire the coachman's aſſiſtance to get in, becauſe the lawyer and I had agreed to ſhew our reſentment by our neglect.—They were no ſooner ſeated than the captain appeared, as much heated as if he had been purſued a dozen miles by an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:027715_0381_0FD5EE7CEFE45488"/>
and immediately after him came the lady, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome marks of diſorder.—Having helped her up, he entered himſelf, growling a few oaths againſt the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for his impertinent interruption; and the lawyer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him by ſaying, that if he had ſuffered a <hi>niſi prius</hi> through the obſtinacy of the defendant, he might have an opportunity to join iſſue at the next ſtage. This laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion gave offence to the grave gentlewoman, who told him, if ſhe was a man, ſhe would make him repent of ſuch obſcenity, and thanked God ſhe had never been in ſuch company before.—At this inſinuation, the captain thought himſelf under a neceſſity of eſpouſing the lady's cauſe; and accordingly threatened to cut off the lawyer's ears, if he ſhould give his tongue any ſuch liberties for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The poor counſellor begged pardon, and univerſal ſilence enſued.</p>

attention; the advantages and diſadvantages attending ſuch a match, were oppoſed to one another by my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; and at length my judgment gave it ſo much in favour of the firſt, that I reſolved to proſecute my ſcheme, with all the addreſs in my power.—I thought I perceived ſome concern in her countenance, occaſioned by my ſilence, which ſhe no doubt imputed to my diſguſt at her mother's behaviour; and as I believed the old woman could not fail of aſcribing my muteneſs to the ſame motive, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to continue that ſullen conduct towards her, and fall upon ſome other method of manifeſting my eſteem for the daughter; nor was it difficult for me to make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my ſentiments by the expreſſion of my looks, which I modelled into the characters of humility and love; and which were anſwered by her with all the ſympathy and approbation I could deſire. But when I began to conſider, that without further opportunities of improving my ſucceſs, all the progreſs I had hitherto made could not much avail, and that ſuch opportunities could not be enjoyed without the mother's permiſſion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, it would be requiſite to vanquiſh her coldneſs and ſuſpicion, by my aſſiduities and reſpectful behaviour on the road; and ſhe would in all likelihood invite me to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit her at Bath, where I did not fear of being able to cultivate her acquaintance as much as would be neceſſary to the accompliſhment of my purpoſe.—And, indeed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident furniſhed me with an opportunity of obliging her ſo much, that ſhe could not, with any appearance of good manners, forbear to gratify my inclination.</p>
                     <p>When we arrived at our dining-place, we found all the eatables in the inn beſpoke by a certain nobleman, who had got the ſtart of us; and in all likelihood, my miſtreſs and her mother muſt have dined with Duke Humphrey, had I not exerted myſelf in their behalf, and bribed the landlord with a glaſs of wine, to curtail his Lordſhip's entertainment of a couple of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="142" facs="unknown:027715_0383_0FD5EE7F918E1848"/>
hoped I would be ſo kind as to ſee her ſometimes at Bath.—While I enjoyed myſelf in this manner, the preciſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had the good fortune to meet with her huſband, who was no other than gentleman, or in other words, <hi>valet de chambre</hi> to the very nobleman whoſe coach ſtood at the door. Proud of the intereſt ſhe had in the houſe, ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to ſhew her power, by introducing the captain to her ſpouſe, as a perſon who had treated her with great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; upon which he was invited to a ſhare of their din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; while the poor lawyer finding himſelf utterly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, made application to me, and was, through my interceſſion, admitted into our company.—Having ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our appetites, and made ourſelves very merry at the expence of the perſon of honour, the civil captain and complaiſant huſband, I did myſelf the pleaſure of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bill by ſtealth, for which I received a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apologies and acknowledgments from my gueſts, and we re-imbarked at the firſt warning.—The officer was obliged at laſt to appeaſe his hunger with a luncheon of bread and cheeſe, and a pint bottle of brandy, which he diſpatched in the coach, curſing the inappetence of his Lordſhip, who had ordered dinner to be put back a whole hour.</p>
                     <p>Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey, which was ended about twelve o'clock, when I waited on the ladies to the houſe of a relation, in which they intended to lodge, and paſſing that night in the inn, took lodgings next morning for myſelf.</p>
                     <p>The forenoon was ſpent in viſiting every thing that was worth ſeeing in the place, which I did in company with a gentleman to whom Banter had given me a letter of introduction; and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies, and found Miſs a good deal indiſpoſed with the fatigues of the journey.—As they foreſaw they ſhould have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a male acquaintance, to ſquire them at all public places, I was received with great cordiality, and had the mother's permiſſion to conduct them next day to the Long Room, which we no ſooner entered, than the eyes of every body preſent were turned upon us; and whem we had ſuffered the martyrdom of their looks for ſome time, a whiſper circulated at our expence, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many contemptuous ſmiles, and tittering
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:027715_0384_0FD5EE816D96DA48"/>
obſervations, to my utter ſhame and confuſion.—I did not ſo much conduct as follow my charge to a place, where ſhe ſeated her mother and herſelf, with aſtoniſhing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, notwithſtanding the unmannerly behaviour of the whole company; which ſeemed to be aſſumed merely to put her out of countenance.—The celebrated Mr. N—ſh, who commonly attends in this place as maſter of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, perceiving the diſpoſition of the aſſembly, took upon himſelf the taſk of gratifying their ill nature ſtill farther, by expoſing my miſtreſs to the edge of his wit. With this view he approached us with many bows and grimaces, and after having welcomed Miſs Snapper to the place, aſked her, in the hearing of all preſent, if ſhe could inform him of the name of Tobit's dog—I was ſo much incenſed at his inſolence, that I ſhould certainly have kicked him where he ſtood, without ceremony, had not the young lady prevented the effects of my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by replying, with the utmoſt vivacity, <q>His name was N—ſh, and an impudent dog he was.</q> This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee, ſo unexpected and juſt, raiſed ſuch an univerſal laugh at the aggreſſor, that all his aſſurance was inſufficient to ſupport him under their deriſion; ſo that after he had endeavoured to compoſe himſelf by taking ſnuff, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a ſmile, he was obliged to ſneak off in a very ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous attitude; while my Dulcinea was applauded to the ſkies, for the brilliancy of her wit, and her acquaintance immediately courted by the beſt people of both ſexes in the room.—This event, with which I was infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at firſt, did not fail of alarming me, upon further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, when I conſidered, that the more ſhe was careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by perſons of diſtinction, the more her pride would be inflamed, and conſequently the obſtacles to my ſucceſs multiplied and enlarged.—Nor were my preſaging fears untrue.—That very night I perceived her a little intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the incenſe ſhe had received, and though ſhe ſtill behaved with a particular civility to me, I foreſaw that, as ſoon as her fortune ſhould be known, ſhe would be ſurrounded with a ſwarm of admirers, ſome one of whom might poſſibly, by excelling me in point of wealth, or in the arts of flattery or ſcandal, ſupplant me in her eſteem, and find means to make the mother of his party. I reſolved, therefore, to loſe no time, and, being invited
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:027715_0385_0FD5EE831D095598"/>
to ſpend the evening with them, ſound an opportunity, in ſpite of the old gentlewoman's vigilance, to explain the meaning of my glances in the coach, by paying homage to her wit, and profeſſing myſelf enamoured of her perſon.—She bluſhed at my declaration, and in a favourable manner diſapproved of the liberty I had taken, putting me in mind of our being ſtrangers to each other, and deſiring I would not be the means of interrupting our acquaintance, by any ſuch unſeaſonable ſtrokes of gallantry for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—My ardour was effectually checked by this repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was, however, delivered in ſuch a gentle manner, that I had no cauſe to be diſobliged; and the arrival of her mother relieved me from a dilemma, in which I ſhould not have known how to demean myſelf a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute longer.—Neither could I reſume the eaſineſs of carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with which I came in, my miſtreſs acted on the reſerve, and the converſation beginning to flag, the old lady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced her kinſwoman of the houſe, and propoſed a hand at whiſt.</p>
                     <p>While we amuſed ourſelves at this diverſion, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from the gentlewoman, that there was to be an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly next night, at which I begged to have the honour of dancing with Miſs. She thanked me for the favour I intended her, aſſured me ſhe never did dance, but ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a deſire of ſeeing the company; when I offered my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which was accepted, not a little proud of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from appearing with her in a ſituation, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my profeſſion to the contrary, was not at all agreeable to my inclination.</p>
                     <p>Having ſupped, and continued the game, till ſuch time as the ſucceſſive yawns of the mother warned me to be gone, I took my leave, and went home, where I made Strap very happy with an account of my progreſs.—Next day I put on my gayeſt apparel, and went to drink tea at Mrs. Snapper's, according to appointment, when I found to my inexpreſſible ſatisfaction, that ſhe was laid up with the tooth-ach, and that Miſs was to be entruſted to my care.—Accordingly we ſet out for the ball-room, pretty early in the evening, and took poſſeſſion of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious place, where we had not ſat longer than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to be the adorable Narciſſa! Good Heaven! what were the thrillings of my ſoul at that inſtant! my reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was overwhelmed with a torrent of agitation! my heart throbbed with ſurpriſing violence! a ſudden miſt overſpread my eyes! my ears were invaded with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound! I panted for want of breath, and, in ſhort, was for ſome moments entranced!—This firſt tumult ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a crowd of flattering ideas ruſhed upon my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; every thing that was ſoft, ſenſible and engaging in the character of that dear creature, recurred to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; and every favourable circumſtance of my own qualifications appeared, in all the aggravation of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, to heighten my expectation!—Neither was this tranſport of long duration: the dread of her being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſpoſed of, intervened, and overcaſt my enchanting reverie! My preſaging apprehenſion repreſented her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled in the arms of ſome happy rival, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for ever loſt to me! I was ſtung with this ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and believing the perſon who conducted her to be the huſband of this amiable young lady, already devoted him to my fury, and ſtood up to mark him for my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; when I recollected, to my unſpeakable joy, her brother, the fox-hunter, in the perſon of her gallant.—Undeceived ſo much to my ſatisfaction in this particular, I gazed in a frenzy of delight, on the irreſiſtible charms of his ſiſter, who no ſooner diſtinguiſhed me in the crowd, than her evident confuſion afforded a happy omen to my flame.—At ſight of me ſhe ſtarted, the roſes inſtantly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from her poliſhed cheeks, and returned in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a double glow, that overſpread her lovely neck, while her enchanting boſom heaved with ſtrong emotion.—I hailed theſe favourable ſymptoms, and lying in wait for her looks did homage with my eyes.—She ſeemed to approve my declaration, by the complacency of her aſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I was ſo tranſported with the diſcovery, that, more than once, I was on the point of making up to her, and diſcloſing the throbbing of my heart in perſon, had not that profound veneration, which her preſence always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, reſtrained the unſeaſonable impulſe.—All my powers being ingroſſed in this manner, it may eaſily be imagined how ill I entertained Miſs Snapper, on whom I could not now turn my eyes, without making compariſons,

very little to her advantage.—If was not even in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to return diſtinct anſwers to the queſtions ſhe aſked from time to time, ſo that ſhe could not help obſerving my abſence of mind; and, having a turn for obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, watched my glances, and tracing them to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine object, diſcovered the cauſe of my diſorder.

I feigned igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of her meaning, and having ſeen her ſafely at her lodgings, took my leave, and went home in an extaſy; where I diſcloſed every thing that had happened to my confidant and humble ſervant Strap, who did not reliſh the accident ſo well as I expected; and obſerved, that a bird in hand is worth two in the buſh.—"But however," ſaid he, "you know beſt,—you know beſt."—Next day as I went to the bath, in hopes of ſeeing or hearing ſome tidings of my fair enſlaver, I was met by a gentlewoman, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving looked hard at me, cried, "O Chriſt, Mr. Random!" Surpriſed at this exclamation, I examined the countenance of the perſon who ſpoke, and immediately recognized my old ſweet-heart and fellow-ſufferer Miſs Williams.</p>
                     <p>I was mightily pleaſed to find this unfortunate woman under ſuch a decent appearance, profeſſed my joy at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſo well, and deſired to know where I ſhould have the pleaſure of her converſation.

to my own lodgings, where, after a very affectionate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, the informed me of her being very happy in the ſervice of a young lady, to whom ſhe was recommended by a former miſtreſs deceaſed, into whoſe family ſhe had recommended herſelf by the honeſt deceit we had concerted, while ſhe lived with me in the garret at London.—She then expreſſed a veh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She interrupted me when I had finiſhed that period, with: "Good God! is it poſſible!"—and then begged I would be ſo good as to continue my relation; which I did as briefly as I could, burning with impatience to know the cauſe of her ſurpriſe, about which I had already formed a very intereſting conjecture.—When I had brought my adventures down to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, ſhe ſeemed very much affected with the different circumſtances of my fortune; and ſaying with a ſmile, ſhe believed my diſtreſſes were now at a period, proceeded to inform me, that the lady whom ſhe ſerved was no other than the charming Narciſſa, who had honoured her with her confidence for ſome time;—in conſequence of which truſt, ſhe had often repeated the ſtory of John Brown, with great admiration and regard; that ſhe loved to dwell upon the particulars of his character, and did not ſcruple to own a tender approbation of his flame.—I became de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious with this piece of intelligence, ſtrained Miſs Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams in my embrace, called her the angel of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and acted ſuch extravagances, that ſhe might have been convinced of my ſincerity, had ſhe not been ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of my honour before.—As ſoon as I was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to yield attention, ſhe deſcribed the preſent ſituation of her miſtreſs, who had no ſooner reached her lodgings the night before, than ſhe cloſeted her, and in a rapture of joy, gave her to know that ſhe had ſeen me at the ball, where I appeared in the character which ſhe always thought my due, with ſuch advantage of transformation, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs my image had been engraven on her heart, it would have been impoſſible to know me for the perſon who had worn her aunt's livery;—that, by the language of my eyes, ſhe was aſſured of the continuance of my paſſion for
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:027715_0389_0FD5EE8D2F8B18C8"/>
her, and conſequently of my being unengaged to any other; and that though ſhe did not doubt I would ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon ſome method of being introduced, ſhe was ſo impatient to hear of me, that ſhe (Miſs Williams) had been ſent abroad this very morning on purpoſe to learn the name and character I at preſent bore.—My boſom had been hitherto a ſtranger to ſuch a flood of joy as now ruſhed upon it: my faculties were overborne by the tide; it was ſome time before I could open my mouth; and much longer ere I could utter a coherent ſentence.—At length, I fervently requeſted her to lead me immediately to the object of my adoration: but ſhe reſiſted my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and explained the danger of ſuch premature conduct.—"How favourable ſoever," ſaid ſhe, <q>my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's inclination towards you my be, you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, ſhe will not commit the ſmalleſt treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs on decorum, either in diſcloſing her own, or in receiving a declaration of your paſſion: and although the great veneration I have for you, has prompted me to reveal what ſhe communicated to me in confidence, I know ſo well the ſeverity of her ſentiments with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the punctilios of her ſex, that, if ſhe ſhould learn the leaſt ſurmiſe of it, ſhe would not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs me as a wretch unworthy of her benevolence, but alſo for ever ſhun the efforts of your love.</q>—I aſſented to the juſtneſs of her remonſtrance, and deſired ſhe would aſſiſt me with her advice and direction: upon which, it was concerted between us, that, for the preſent, I ſhould be contented with her telling Narciſſa, that in the courſe of her enquiries, ſhe could only learn my name: and that if in a day or two I could fall upon no other method of being introduced, ſhe would deliver a letter from me, on pretence of conſulting her happineſs; and ſay that I met her in the ſtreet, and bribed her to that piece of ſervice.—Matters being thus adjuſted, I kept my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to breakfaſt, and learned from her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that my rival Sir Timothy had drank himſelf into an apoplexy, of which he died five months ago; that the ſavage was ſtill unmarried, and that his aunt had been ſeized with a whim which he little expected, and choſen the ſchool-maſter of the pariſh for her lord and huſband: but matrimony not agreeing with her conſtitution, ſhe

                     <argument>
                        <p>I become acquainted with Narciſſa's brother, who invites me to his houſe, where I am introduced to that adorable creature—after dinner the ſquire retires to take his nap—Freeman, gueſſing the ſituation of my thoughts, withdraws likewiſe, on pretence of buſineſs—I declare my paſſion to Narciſſa—am well received—charmed with her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the ſquire detains us to ſupper—I elude his deſign by ſtratagem, and get home ſober.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the afternoon I drank tea at the houſe of Mr. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to whom I had been recommended by Banter, where I had not ſat five minutes till the fox hunter came in, and, by his familiar behaviour, appeared to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with my friend. I was at firſt under ſome concern, leſt he ſhould recollect my features; but when I ſound myſelf introduced to him as a gentleman from London, without being diſcovered, I bleſſed the opportunity that brought me into his company, hoping that, in the courſe of our acquaintance, he would invite me to his houſe—nor were my hopes fruſtrated; for, as we ſpent the evening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he grew extremely fond of my converſation, aſked a great many childiſh queſtions about France and other fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts, and ſeemed ſo highly entertained with my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that in his cups he ſhook me often by the hand, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

me an honeſt fellow, and, in fine, deſired our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at dinner next day at his own houſe. My imagination was ſo much employed in anticipating the happineſs I was to enjoy the next day, that I ſlept very little that night, but, riſing up early in the morning, went to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, where I met my ſhe-friend, and imparted to her my ſucceſs with the ſquire. She was much pleaſed at the occaſion, which ſhe ſaid could not fail of being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Narciſſa, who, in ſpite of her paſſion for me, had mentioned ſome ſcruples relating to my true ſituation and character, which the delicacy of her ſentiments ſuggeſted, and which ſhe believed I would find it neceſſary to remove, though ſhe did not know how. I was a good deal ſtartled at this inſinuation, becauſe I foreſaw the difficulty I ſhould find in barely doing myſelf juſtice: for although it never was my intention to impoſe myſelf upon any woman, much leſs on Narciſſa, as a man of fortune, I laid claim to the character of a gentleman by birth, education, and behaviour; and yet (ſo unlucky had the circumſtances of my life fallen out) I ſhould find it a very hard matter to make good my pretenſions even to theſe, eſpecially to the laſt, which was the moſt eſſential. Miſs Williams was as ſenſible as I of this my diſadvantage, but comforted me with obſerving, that, when once a woman has beſtowed her affections on a man, ſhe cannot help judging of him, in all reſpects, with a partiality eaſily influenced in his favour—ſhe remarked, that although ſome ſituations of my life had been low, yet none of them had been infamous; that my indigence had been the crime, not of me, but of fortune; and that the miſeries I had undergone, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the faculties both of mind and body, qualified me the more for any dignified ſtation, and would, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, recommend me to the good graces of any ſenſible woman—ſhe therefore adviſed me to be always open and unreſerved to the inquiries of my miſtreſs, without unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily betraying the meaneſt occurrences of my fate, and truſt to the ſtrength of her love and reflection for the reſt. The ſentiments of this ſenſible young woman on this, as well as on almoſt every other ſubject, perfectly agreed with mine; I thanked her for the care ſhe took of my intereſts, and, promiſing to behave myſelf according to her direction, we parted, after ſhe had aſſured me that I might depend
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:027715_0392_0FD5EE8FDFBBA840"/>
upon her beſt offices with her miſtreſs, and that ſhe would, from time to time, communicate to me ſuch intelligence as ſhe ſhould procure, relating to my flame. Having dreſſed myſelf to the beſt advantage, I waited for the time of din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the moſt fearful impatience, and, as the hour drew nigh, my heart beat with ſuch increaſed velocity, and my ſpirits contracted ſuch diſorder, that I began to ſuſpect my reſolution, and even to wiſh myſelf diſengaged. At laſt Mr. Freeman called at my lodgings in his way, and I accompanied him to the houſe where all my happineſs was depoſited. We were very kindly received by the ſquire, who ſat ſmoaking his pipe in a parlour, and aſked if we choſe to drink any thing before dinner? Though I never had more occaſion for a cordial, I was aſhamed to accept his offer, which was alſo refuſed by my friend. We ſat down, however, and entered into converſation, which laſted half an hour, ſo that I had time to recollect myſelf, and (ſo capricious were my thoughts) even to hope that Narciſſa would not appear—when all of a ſudden a ſervant, coming in, gave us notice, that dinner was upon the table—and my perturbation returned with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that I could ſcarce conceal it from the company as I aſcended the ſtair-caſe. When I entered the dining<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, the firſt object that ſaluted my raviſhed eyes was the divine Narciſſa, bluſhing like Aurora, adorned with all the graces that meekneſs, innocence and beauty can diffuſe! I was ſeized with a giddineſs, my knees tottered, and I ſcarce had ſenſe enough to perform the ceremony of ſalutation, when her brother, ſlapping me on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cried, "Meaſter Random, that there is my ſiſter." I approached her with eagerneſs and fear, but in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our embrace, my ſoul was agonized with rapture! It was a lucky circumſtance for us both, that my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer was not endued with an uncommon ſtock of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration; for our mutual confuſion was ſo manifeſt, that Mr. Freeman perceived it, and, as we went home toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, congratulated me on my good fortune. But ſo far was Bruin from entertaining the leaſt ſuſpicion, that he encouraged me to begin a converſation with my miſtreſs in a language unknown to him, by telling her, that he had brought a gentleman (meaning me) who could jabber with her, in French and other foreign lingos, as faſt as ſhe

                           </gap>ano, and tell me if ſhe underſtands it as well as ſhe would be thought to do. There's her aunt and ſhe will chatter together whole days in it, and I can't have a mouthful of Engliſh for love or money.</q> I conſulted the looks of my amiable miſtreſs, and found her averſe to his propoſal, which indeed ſhe declined with a ſweetneſs of denial peculiar to herſelf, as a piece of diſreſpect to that part of the company which did not underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in queſtion. As I had the happineſs of ſitting op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to her, I feaſted my eyes much more than my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, which ſhe tempted in vain with the moſt delicious bits carved by her fair hand, and recommended by her perſuaſive tongue—but all my other appetites were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the immenſity of my love, which I fed by gazing inceſſantly on the delightful object. Dinner was ſcarce ended, when the ſquire became very drowſy, and, after ſeveral dreadful yawns, got up, ſtretched himſelf, took two or three turns acroſs the room, begged we would allow him to take a ſhort nap, and, having laid a ſtrong injunction on his ſiſter to detain us till his return, went to his repoſe without any farther ceremony. He had not been gone many minutes when Freeman, gueſſing the ſituation of my heart, and thinking he could not do me a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than to leave me alone with Narciſſa, pretended to recollect himſelf all of a ſudden, and, ſtarting up, begged the lady's pardon for half an hour, having luckily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered an engagement of ſome conſequence that he muſt perform at that inſtant. So ſaying, he took his leave, promiſing to come back time enough for tea, leaving my miſtreſs and me in great confuſion. Now that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed an opportunity of diſcloſing the pantings of my ſoul, I had not power to uſe it. I ſtudied many pathetic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, but, when I attempted to give them utterance, my tongue denied its office, and ſhe ſat ſilent, with a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt look, full of anxious alarm, her boſom heaving with expectation of ſome great event. At length I endeavoured to put an end to this ſolemn pauſe, and began with, <q>It is very ſurpriſing, Madam</q>—Here, the ſound dying away, I made a full ſtop—while Narciſſa, ſtarting, bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with a timid accent, anſwered, "Sir?" Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:027715_0394_0FD5EE970D18C0B0"/>
at this note of interrogation, I pronounced with the moſt ſheepiſh baſhfulneſs, "Madam!" To which ſhe replied, <q>I beg pardon—I thought you had ſpoke to me.</q> Another pauſe enſued—I made another effort, and, though my voice faultered very much in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, made ſhift to expreſs myſelf in this manner: <q>I ſay, Madam, 'tis very ſurpriſing, that love ſhould act ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with itſelf as to deprive its votaries of the uſe of their faculties, when they have moſt need of them. Since the happy occaſion of being alone with you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf, I have made many unſucceſsful attempts to declare a paſſion for the lovelieſt of her ſex—a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which took poſſeſſion of my ſoul when my cruel fate compelled me to wear a ſervile diſguiſe ſo unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my birth, ſentiments, and, let me add, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; yet favourable in one reſpect, as it furniſhed me with opportunities of ſeeing and adoring your perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—Yes, Madam, it was then your dear idea entered my boſom, where it has lived unimpaired in the midſt of numberleſs cares, and animated me againſt a thouſand dangers and calamities!</q> While I ſpoke thus, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed her face with her fan, and when I ceaſed, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf from the moſt beautiful confuſion, told me that ſhe thought herſelf very much obliged by my favourable opinion of her, and that ſhe was very ſorry to hear I had been unfortunate. Encouraged by this gentle reply, I proceeded to own myſelf ſufficiently recompenſed by her kind compaſſion for what I had undergone, and declared, that the future happineſs of my life depended ſolely upon her. "Sir," ſaid ſhe, <q>I ſhould be very ungrateful if, after the ſignal protection you once afforded me, I ſhould refuſe to contribute towards your happineſs in any reaſonable condeſcenſion.</q> Tranſported at this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, I threw myſelf at her feet, and begged ſhe would regard my paſſion with a favourable eye: ſhe was alarmed at my behaviour, entreated me to riſe, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:027715_0395_0FD5EE98FA70A9B0"/>
in ſacrificing them to her deſire. She ſmiled with unſpeakable ſweetneſs, and ſaid, there would be no want of opportunities, provided I could maintain the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion her brother had conceived of me; and I, enchanted by her charms, ſeized her hand, which I well nigh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with kiſſes. But ſhe checked my boldneſs with a ſeverity of countenance, and deſired I would not ſo far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get myſelf or her as to endanger the eſteem ſhe had for me—ſhe reminded me of our being almoſt ſtrangers to each other, and of the neceſſity there was for her knowing me better, before ſhe could take any reſolution in my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and, in ſhort, mingled ſo much good ſenſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in her reproof, that I became as much enamoured of her underſtanding as I had been before of her beauty, and aſked pardon for my preſumption with the utmoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of conviction. She forgave my offence with her uſual affability, and ſealed my pardon with a look ſo full of bewitching tenderneſs, that for ſome minutes my ſenſes were loſt in extaſy! Lafterwards endeavoured to regulate my behaviour according to her deſire, and turn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation upon a more indifferent ſubject; but her preſence was an unſurmountable obſtacle to my deſign; while I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſo much excellence, I ſound it impoſſible to call my attention from the contemplation of it. I gazed with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable fondneſs! I grew mad with admiration!—<q>My condition is inſupportable,</q> cried I; <q>I am diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with paſſion!—Why are you ſo exquiſitely fair? Why are you ſo enchantingly good? Why has nature dignified you with charms ſo much above the ſtandard of women? and, wretch that I am, how dares my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs aſpire to the enjoyment of ſuch perfection!</q>

                     <p>She was ſtartled at my ravings, reaſoned down my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and, by her irreſiſtible eloquence, ſoothed my ſoul into a ſtate of tranquil felicity; but, leſt I might ſuffer a relapſe, induſtriouſly promoted other ſubjects to entertain my imagination. She chid me for having omitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire about her aunt, who, ſhe aſſured me, in the midſt of all her abſence of temper, and detachment from common affairs, often talked of me with uncommon warmth. I profeſſed my veneration for the good lady, excuſed my omiſſion by imputing it to the violence of my love, which engroſſed my whole ſoul, and deſired to know the preſent

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Sir Timothy Thicket, who, ſhe informed me, had found means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe her brother ſo much againſt me, that ſhe ſound it impoſſible to undeceive him, but on the contrary ſuffered very much in her own character by his ſcandalous inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—that the whole pariſh was alarmed and actually in purſuit of me; ſo that ſhe had been in the utmoſt conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon my account, well knowing how little my own innocence and her teſtimony would have weighed with the ignorance, prejudice and brutality of thoſe who muſt have judged me, had I been apprehended—that Sir Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy being ſeized with a fit of the apoplexy, from which with great difficulty he was recovered, began to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of death, and to prepare himſelf accordingly for that great event; as a ſtep to which, he ſent for her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, owned, with great contrition, the brutal deſign he had upon her, and of conſequence acquitted me of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, robbery, and correſpondence with her, which he had laid to my charge; after which confeſſion he lived about a month in a languiſhing condition, and was carried off by a ſecond aſſault.</p>
                     <p>Every word that this dear creature ſpoke rivetted the chains with which ſhe held me enſlaved! My miſchievous fancy began to work, and the tempeſt of my paſſion to wake again, when the return of Freeman deſtroyed the tempting opportunity, and enabled me to quell the riſing tumult. A little while after, the ſquire ſtaggered into the room, rubbing his eyes, and calling for his tea, which he drank out of a ſmall bowl qualified with brandy; we ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſome in the ordinary way: Narciſſa left us in order to
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:027715_0397_0FD5EE9A67A2E190"/>
viſit her aunt, and, when Freeman and I propoſed to take our leave, the fox-hunter inſiſted on our ſpending the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his houſe with ſuch an obſtinacy of affection, that we were obliged to comply. For my own part, I ſhould have been glad of the invitation, by which, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I ſhould have been bleſt with more of his ſiſter's company, had I not been afraid of riſking her eſteem by entering into a debauch of drinking with him, which, from the knowledge of his character, I foreſaw would happen; but there was no remedy—I was forced to rely upon the ſtrength of my conſtitution, which I hoped would reſiſt intoxication longer than the ſquire's, and truſt to the good nature and diſcretion of my miſtreſs for the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Our entertainer, reſolving to begin by times, ordered the table to be furniſhed with liquor and glaſſes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after tea; but we abſolutely refuſed to ſet in for drinking ſo ſoon, and we prevailed upon him to paſs away an hour or two at whiſt, in which he engaged as ſoon as Narciſſa returned. The ſavage and I happened to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at firſt, and, as my thoughts were wholly employed on a more intereſting game, I played ſo ill, that he loſt all patience, ſwore bitterly, and threatened to call for wine, if they would not grant him another aſſociate. This deſire was gratified, and Narciſſa and I were of a ſide; he won for the ſame reaſon that made him loſe before; I was ſatisfied, my lovely partner did not repine, and the time ſlipped away very agreeably, until we were told that ſupper was ſerved in another room.</p>
                     <p>The ſquire was enraged to find the evening ſo unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably ſpent, and wreaked his vengeance on the cards, which he tore, and committed to the flames with many execrations; threatening to make us redeem our loſs with a large glaſs and quick circulation! and indeed we had no ſooner ſupped, and my charmer withdrawn, than he began to out his threats in execution. Three bottles of port (for he drank no other ſort of wine) were placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, with as many water-glaſſes, which were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately filled to the brim, after his example, by each out of his reſpective allowance, and emptied in a trice, <hi>to the beſt in Chriſtendom.</hi>—Though I ſwallowed this, and the next as faſt as the glaſs could be repleniſhed, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſhew of reluctance, I perceived that my brain would
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:027715_0398_0FD5EE9C601FB588"/>
not be able to bear many bumpers of this ſort; and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſeverance of a champion who began with ſuch vigour, I determined to make up for the deficiency of my ſtrength by a ſtratagem, which I actually put in practice when the ſecond courſe of bottles was called for.—The wine being ſtrong and heady, I was already a good deal diſcompoſed by the diſpatch we had made; Freeman's eyes began to reel, and Bruin himſelf was elevated into a ſong, which he uttered with great vociferation. When I therefore ſaw the ſecond round brought in, I aſſumed a gay air, entertained him with a French catch on the ſubject of drinking, which, though he did not underſtand, delighted him highly, and, telling him that your choice ſpirits at Paris never troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with glaſſes, aſked if he had not a bowl or cup in the houſe that would contain a whole quart of wine.—"Odds niggers!" cried he, <q>I have a ſilver caudle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup that holds juſt the quantity, for all the world—fetch it hither, Numps.</q>—The veſſel being produced, I bid him decant his bottle into it, which having done, I nodded in a very deliberate manner, and ſaid, <q>I pledge you.</q>—He ſtared at me for ſome time, and crying, "What, all at one pull! Meaſter Randan?"—I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>At one pull, Sir; you are no milk ſop—we ſhall do you juſtice.</q>—"Shall you?" ſaid he, ſhaking me by the hand, <q>odd, then, I'll ſee it out, an't were a mile to the bottom—Here's to our better acquaintance, Meaſter Randan.</q> So ſaying he applied it to his lips, and emptied it in a breath.—I knew the effect of it would be almoſt inſtantaneous; therefore, taking the cup, I began to diſcharge my bottle into it, telling him he was now qualified to drink with the Cham of Tartary.—I had no ſooner pronounced theſe words, than he took umbrage at them, and after ſeveral attempts to ſpit, made ſhift to ſtutter out, <q>A f—t f—t for your Chams of T—Tartary! I am a f—f—free-born Engliſhman, worth th—three thouſand a-year, and v—value no man, damme!</q>—then dropping his jaw, and fixing his eyes, he hickuped aloud, and fell upon the floor as mute as a flounder.—Mr. Freeman heartily rejoiced at his defeat, aſſiſted me in carrying him to bed, where we le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I WAS met next morning at the uſual place by Miſs Williams, who gave me joy of the progreſs I had made in the affection of her miſtreſs, and bleſſed me with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that dear creature's converſation with her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Tranſported at the news of my happineſs, I preſented my ring to the meſſenger, as a teſtimony of my gratitude and ſatisfaction; but ſhe was above ſuch merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſiderations, and refuſed my compliment with ſome reſentment, ſaying, ſhe was not a little mortified to ſee my opinion of her ſo low and contemptible.—I did myſelf a piece of juſtice by explaining my behaviour on this head, and to convince her of my eſteem, promiſed to be ruled by her directions in the proſecution of the whole affair, which I had ſo much at heart, that the repoſe of my life depended upon the conſequence.</p>
                     <p>As I fervently wiſhed for another interview, where I might pour out the effuſions of my love, without danger of being interrupted, and perhaps reap ſome endearing return from the queen of my deſires, I implored her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

and aſſiſtance in promoting this event; but ſhe gave me to underſtand, that Narciſſa would make no precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate compliances of this kind, and that I would do well to cultivate her brother's acquaintance, in the courſe of which I would not want opportunities of removing that reſerve; which my miſtreſs thought herſelf obliged to maintain during the infancy of our correſpondence.—In the mean time, ſhe promiſed to tell her lady, that I had endeavoured by preſents and perſuaſions, to prevail upon her (Miſs Williams) to deliver a letter from me, which ſhe had refuſed to charge herſelf with, until ſhe ſhould know Narciſſa's ſentiments of the matter; and ſaid, by theſe means ſhe did not doubt of being able to open a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary communication between us, which could not fail of introducing more intimate connections.</p>
                     <p>I approved of her council, and our appointment being renewed for next day, left her with an intent of falling upon ſome method of being reconciled to the ſquire, who, I ſuppoſed, would be offended with the trick we had put upon him.—With this view, I conſulted Freeman, who, from his knowledge of the fox-hunter's diſpoſition, aſſured me there was no other method of pacifying him, than that of ſacrificing ourſelves for one night, to an equal match with him in drinking: this I found myſelf neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiated to comply with, for the intereſt of my paſſion, and therefore determined to commit the debauch at my own lodgings, that I might run no riſk of being diſcovered by Narciſſa, in a ſtate of brutal degeneracy.—Mr. Freeman, who was to be of the party, went, at my deſire, to the ſquire in order to engage him, while I took care to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh myſelf for his reception.—My invitation was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my gueſts honoured me with their company in the evening, when Bruin gave me to underſtand that he had dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

I promiſed to atone for my treſpaſs, and having ordered to every man his bottle, began the conteſt with a bumper to the health of Narciſſa.—The toaſts circulated with great devotion, the liquor began to operate, our mirth grew noiſy, and as Freeman and I had the advantage of drinking ſmall French claret, the ſavage was effectually

                     <p>I was next morning, as uſual, favoured with a viſit from my kind and punctual confidante, who telling me, ſhe was permitted to receive my letters for her miſtreſs, I took up the pen immediately, and following the firſt dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of my paſſion, wrote as follows:</p>

                     <p>I informed my friend of the ſquire's conſent, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my dancing with Narciſſa at the ball, and deſired her to tell her miſtreſs, that I would do myſelf the honour of viſiting her in the afternoon, in conſequence of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been complaiſant in that particular.—Miſs Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams expreſſed a good deal of joy, at hearing I was ſo much in favour with the fox-hunter, and ventured to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me, that my viſit would be very agreeable to my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, the rather becauſe Bruin was engaged to dine abroad.

                     <p>Every thing ſucceeding thus to my wiſh, I waited with incredible impatience for the time, which no ſooner arrived, than I haſtened to the ſcene, which my fancy had pre-oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied long before. I was introduced accordingly to the dear enchantreſs, whom I found accompanied by Miſs Williams, who, on pretence of ordering tea, retired at my approach.—This favourable accident, which alarmed my whole ſoul, diſordered her alſo.—I found myſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by an irreſiſtible impulſe, I advanced to her with eagerneſs and awe; and profiting by the confuſion that prevailed over her, claſped the fair angel in my arms, and imprinted a glowing kiſs upon her lips, more ſoft and fragrant than the dewy roſe-bud, juſt burſting from the ſtem! Her face was in an inſtant covered with bluſhes, her eyes ſparkled with reſentment; I threw myſelf at her feet
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:027715_0404_0FD5EEA7D86930F8"/>
and implored her pardon.—Her love became an advocate in my cauſe; her look ſoftened into forgiveneſs; ſhe raiſed me up, and chid me with ſo much ſweetneſs of diſpleaſure, that I ſhould have been tempted to repeat the offence, had not the coming in of a ſervant with the tea-board, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my preſumption. While we were ſubject to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted or overheard, we converſed about the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ball, at which ſhe promiſed to grace me as a partner; but when the equipage was removed, and we were left alone, I reſumed the more intereſting theme, and expreſſed myſelf with ſuch tranſport and agitation, that my miſtreſs, fearing I would commit ſome extravagance, rung the bell for her maid, whom ſhe detained in the room, as a check upon my vivacity.—I was not ſorry for this precaution, becauſe I could unboſom myſelf without reſerve, before Miſs Williams, who was the confidante of us both.—I therefore gave a looſe to the inſpirations of my paſſion, which operated ſo ſucceſsfully upon the tender affections of Narciſſa, that ſhe laid aſide the conſtraint ſhe had hitherto wore, and bleſſed me with the moſt melting declaration of her mutual flame!—It was impoſſible for me to forbear taking the advantage of this endearing condeſcenſion.—She now gently yielded to my embrace, while I, encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling all that I held dear within my arms, taſted, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, the joys of that paradiſe I hoped, in a little time, wholly to poſſeſs!—We ſpent the afternoon in all the extaſy of hope that the moſt fervent love, exchanged by mutual vows, could inſpire; and Miſs Williams was ſo much affected with our chaſte careſſes, which recalled the ſad remembrance of what ſhe was, that her eyes were filled with tears.</p>
                     <p>The evening being pretty far advanced, I forced myſelf from the dear object of my flame, who indulged me in a tender embrace at parting; and, repairing to my lodgings, communicated to my friend Strap every circumſtance of my happineſs, which filled him with ſo much pleaſure, that it ran over at his eyes, and he prayed heartily, that no envious devil might, as formerly, daſh the cup of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from my lip. When I reflected on what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eſpecially on the unreſerved proteſtations of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa's love, I could not help being amazed at her omitting to inquire into the particular circumſtances of the life and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:027715_0405_0FD5EEA95A221428"/>
fortune of one whom ſhe had favoured with her affection, and I began to be a little anxious about the ſituation of her finances, well knowing, that I ſhould do an irrepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able injury to the perſon my ſoul held moſt dear, if I ſhould eſpouſe her without being able to ſupport her in the rank which was certainly her due. I had heard, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, while I ſerved her aunt, that her father had left her a conſiderable ſum, and that every body believed ſhe would inherit the greateſt part of her kinſwoman's dowry; but I did not know how far ſhe might be reſtricted by the old gentleman's will, in the enjoyment of what he left her, and I was too well informed of the virtuoſo's late conduct, to think my miſtreſs could have any expectations from that quarter. I confided, however, in the good ſenſe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of my charmer, who, I was ſure, would not conſent to unite her fate with mine, before ſhe had fully conſidered and provided for the conſequence.</p>
                     <p>The ball-night being arrived, I dreſſed myſelf in a ſuit I had reſerved for ſome grand occaſion, and, having drank tea with Narciſſa and her brother, conducted my angel to the ſcene, where ſhe in a moment eclipſed all her female competitors for beauty, and attracted the admiration of the whole aſſembly. My heart dilated with pride on this occaſion, and my triumph rejected all bounds, when, after we had danced together, a certain nobleman, remarkable for his figure and influence in the <hi>beau monde,</hi> came up, and, in the hearing of all preſent, honoured us with a very particular compliment upon our accompliſhments and appearance—but this tranſport was ſoon checked, when I perceived his lordſhip attach himſelf with great aſſiduity to my miſtreſs, and ſay ſome warm things, which I thought ſavoured too much of paſſion. It was then I began to feel the pangs of jealouſy—I dreaded the power and addreſs of my rival. I ſickened at his diſcourſe.—When ſhe opened her lips to anſwer, my heart died within me—when ſhe ſmiled, I felt the pains of the damned!—I was enraged at his preſumption; I curſed her complaiſance!—At length he quitted her, and went to the other ſide of the room. Narciſſa, ſuſpecting nothing of the rage that inflamed me, put ſome queſtions to me as ſoon as he was gone, to which I made no reply, but aſſumed a grim look, which too well denoted the agitation of my breaſt, and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:027715_0406_0FD5EEAAF32C1130"/>
ſurpriſed her not a little. She no ſooner obſerved my emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than ſhe changed colour, and aſked what ailed me? but, before I could make an anſwer, her brother, pulling me by the ſleeve, bid me take notice of a lady who ſat fronting us, whom I immediately, to my vaſt aſtoniſhment, diſtinguiſhed to be Melinda, accompanied by her mother, and an elderly gentleman whom I did not know.—"Wound! Mr. Randan," cried the ſquire, <q>is ſhe not a delicate piece of ſtuff!—'Sdeath! I have a good mind—if I thought ſhe was a ſingle perſon.</q>—Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the perplexity I was in, I had reflection enough to foreſee, that my paſſion might ſuffer greatly by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of this lady, who in all probability would revenge herſelf upon me for having formerly diſgraced her, by ſpreading reports to my prejudice. I was therefore alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at theſe ſymptoms of the ſquire's admiration, and for ſome time did not know what reply to make, when he aſked my opinion of her beauty. At length I came to a determination, and told him that her name was Melinda, that ſhe had a fortune of ten thouſand pounds, and was ſaid to be under promiſe of marriage to a certain lord, who deferred his nuptials until he ſhould be of age, which would happen in a few months. I thought this piece of intelligence, which I had myſelf invented, would have hindered him effectually from entertaining any farther thoughts of her; but I was egregiouſly miſtaken; the fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunter had too much ſelf-ſufficiency to deſpair of ſucceſs againſt any competitor on earth: he therefore made light of her engagement, ſaying with a ſmile of ſelf approbation, <q>Mayhap ſhe will change her mind—what ſignifies his being a lord?—I think myſelf as good a man as e'er a lord in Chriſtendom, and I'll ſee if a commoner worth three thouſand a-year won't ſerve her turn.</q> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination ſtartled me not a little; I knew he would ſoon diſcover the contrary of what I advanced, and, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he would find her ear open to his addreſſes, did not doubt of meeting with every obſtacle in my amour, that her malice could invent, and her influence with him exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute. This reflection increaſed my chagrin—my vexation was evident—Narciſſa inſiſted on going home immediately, and as I led her to the door, her noble admirer, with a look full of languiſhment, directed to her a profound bow,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:027715_0407_0FD5EEAC5DEE1048"/>
which ſtung me to the ſoul. Before ſhe went into the chair, ſhe aſked, with an appearance of concern, what was the matter with me? and I could pronounce no more than, "By Heaven! I'm diſtracted!"</p>

                        </gap>, I was ſurpriſed with the appearance of Miſs Williams, whom Strap, blubbering all the while, had conducted into the chamber, without giving me previous notice of her approach.—She was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely affected with my condition, which ſhe had learned from him, begged me to moderate my paſſion, ſuſpend my conjectures, and follow her to Narciſſa, who deſired to ſee me forthwith.—That dear name operated upon me like a charm! I ſtarted up, and, without opening my lips, was conducted into her apartment, through the garden, which we entered by a private door.—I found the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature in tears! I was melted at the ſight—we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſilent for ſome time—my heart was too full to ſpeak—her ſnowy boſom heaved with fond reſentment; at laſt ſhe ſobbing, cried <q>what have I done to diſoblige you!</q> My heart was pierced with the tender queſtion! I drew near with the utmoſt reverence of affection! I fell upon my knees before her, and kiſſing her hand, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <q>O! thou art all goodneſs and perfection!

                        </gap> Pleaſed to be thus undeceived, I laughed at his conſternation, and aſked what brought him thither? Upon which he gave me to underſtand, that his concern for me had induced him to follow me to that place, where the ſame reaſon had detained him till now, and he frankly owned, that, in ſpite of the eſteem he had for Miſs Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams, he began to be very uneaſy about me, conſidering the diſpoſition in which I went abroad, and, if I had ſtaid much longer, would have certainly alarmed the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood in my behalf. The knowledge of this his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confounded me! I repreſented to him the miſchievious conſequences that would have attended ſuch a raſh action, and, cautioning him ſeverely againſt any ſuch deſign for the future, concluded my admonition with an aſſurance, that, in caſe he ſhould ever act ſo madly, I would, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, put him to death.—<q>Have a little pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</q> cried he in a lamentable tone; <q>your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure will do the buſineſs, without your committing murder.</q> I was touched with this reproach, and, as ſoon as we got home, made it my buſineſs to appeaſe him by explaining the cauſe of that tranſport, during which I had uſed him ſo unworthily.</p>
                     <p>Next day, when I went into the Long-room, I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeveral whiſpers circulate all of a ſudden, and did not doubt that Melinda had been buſy with my character; but I conſoled myſelf with the love of Narciſſa, upon which I reſted with the moſt perfect confidence, and, going up to the rowly-powly table, won a few pieces from my ſuſpected rival, who with an eaſy politeneſs entered into converſation with me, and, deſiring my company at the coffee-houſe, treated me with tea and chocolate. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered Strutwell, and guarded againſt his inſinuating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; nor was my ſuſpicion wrong placed; he artfully turned the diſcourſe upon Narciſſa, and endeavoured, by hinting at an intrigue he pretended to be engaged in elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to learn what connection there was between her and me. But all his fineſſe was ineffectual; I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his diſſimulation, and gave ſuch general anſwers
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:027715_0410_0FD5EEB4D2E09C70"/>
to his enquiries, that he was forced to drop the ſubject, and talk of ſomething elſe.</p>
                     <p>While we converſed in this manner, the ſavage came in with another gentleman, who introduced him to his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and he was received with ſuch peculiar marks of diſtinction, that I was perſuaded that the courtier intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe him in ſome ſhape or other, and thence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an unlucky omen. But I had more cauſe to be diſmayed the following day, when I ſaw the ſquire in company with Melinda and her mother, who honoured me with ſeveral diſdainful glances; and when I afterwards threw myſelf in his way, inſtead of the cordial ſhake of the hand, he returned my ſalute with the cold reception of <q>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, ſervant,</q> which he pronounced with ſuch indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or rather contempt, that, if he had not been Narciſſa's brother, I ſhould have affronted him in public.</p>
                     <p>Theſe occurrences diſturbed me not a little; I foreſaw the brooding ſtorm, and armed myſelf with reſolution for the occaſion; but, Narciſſa being at ſtake, I was far from being reſigned. I could have renounced every other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of life with ſome degree of fortitude; but the proſpect of loſing her, diſabled all my philoſophy, and tortured my ſoul into madneſs.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Williams found me next morning full of anxious tumult, which did not abate when ſhe told me, that my Lord Quiverwit, having profeſſed honourable intentions, had been introduced to my lovely miſtreſs by her brother, who had at the ſame time, from the information of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, ſpoke of me as an Iriſh fortune-hunter, without either birth or eſtate to recommend me, who ſupported myſelf in the appearance of a gentleman by ſharping and other infamous practices, and who was of ſuch an obſcure origin, that I did not even know my own extraction.—Though I expected all this, I could not hear it with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, eſpecially as truth was ſo blended with falſhood in the aſſertion, that it would be almoſt impoſſible to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the one from the other in my vindication. But I ſaid nothing on this head, being impatient to know how Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa had been affected with the diſcovery. The generous creature, far from believing theſe imputations, was no ſooner withdrawn with her confidante than ſhe inveighed with great warmth againſt the malevolence of the world,

to which only ſhe aſcribed the whole of what had been ſaid to my diſadvantage, and, calling every circumſtance of my behaviour to her, into review before her, found every thing ſo polite, honourable, and diſintereſted, that ſhe could not harbour the leaſt doubt of my being the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman I aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Her admirer, whoſe courage never roſe but in proportion to the wine he had ſwallowed, inſtead of reſenting my addreſs in what is called an honourable way, threatened to proſecute me for an aſſault, and took witneſſes accordingly, while ſhe, piqued at his puſillanimous behaviour, and enraged at the ſarcaſm I had uttered againſt her, endeavoured to make her quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel a public cauſe, and wept aloud with ſpite and vexation. The tears of a lady could not fail of attracting the notice and concern of the ſpectators, to whom ſhe complained of my rudeneſs with great bitterneſs, ſaying, if ſhe was a man I durſt not uſe her ſo. The greateſt part of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, already prejudiced againſt me, were offended at the liberty I had taken, as appeared from their looks, though none of them ſignified their diſguſt any other way, except my Lord Quiverwit, who ventured to ſay with a ſneer, that I was in the right to eſtabliſh my own charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which he had now no longer any doubt. Nettled at this ſevere <hi>equivoque,</hi> which raiſed a laugh at my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, I replied with ſome warmth, <q>I am proud of having in that particular got the ſtart of your lordſhip.</q> He made no anſwer to my repartee, but, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous ſmile, walked off, leaving me in a very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſituation. In vain did I make up to ſeveral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my acquaintance, whoſe converſation, I hoped, would baniſh my confuſion; every body ſhunned me like a perſon infected, and I ſhould not have been able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="173" facs="unknown:027715_0414_0FD5EEB98A082168"/>
juſt oppoſite to a toy-ſhop, which I entered, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ring ſet with a ruby in the form of a heart, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diamond ſparks, for which I paid ten guineas, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it for a preſent to the charmer of my ſoul.</p>
                     <p>I was introduced, at the hour appointed, to this divine creature, who, notwithſtanding what ſhe had heard to my diſadvantage, received me with the utmoſt confidence and tenderneſs, and, having been informed of the general ſketches of my life by Miſs Williams, expreſſed a deſire of knowing the particular circumſtances, which I related with great candour, omitting, however, ſome things which I concluded altogether improper for her ear, and which the reader's reflection will eaſily ſuggeſt. As my ſtory was little elſe than a recital of misfortunes, the tear of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ceaſed not to trickle from her enchanting eyes during the whole of the narration, which, when I had finiſhed, ſhe recompenſed me for my trouble with the moſt endearing proteſtations of eternal love. She bewailed her reſtricted condition, as it was the means of retarding my happineſs; told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Lord Quiverwit, by her brother's permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had been to drink tea with her that very afternoon, and actually propoſed marriage; and, ſeeing me extremely affected with this piece of information, offered to give me a convincing proof of her affection by eſpouſing me in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and leaving the reſt to fate. I was penetrated with this inſtance of her regard, but, that I might not be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in generoſity, reſiſted the bewitching temptation, in conſideration of her honour and intereſt; at the ſame time preſented my ring as a pledge of my inviolable attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and on my knees implored Heaven to ſhower its curſes on my head, if ever my heart ſhould entertain one thought unworthy of the paſſion I then avowed. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my token, gave me in return her picture ſet in minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exquiſitely drawn, and ſet in gold, and in the ſame poſture called Heaven to witneſs, and to judge her flame. Our vows thus reciprocally breathed, a confidence of hope enſued, and, our mutual fondneſs becoming as intimate as innocence would allow, I grew inſenſible of the progreſs of time, and it was morning before I could tear myſelf from this darling of my ſoul! My good angel foreſaw what would happen, and permitted me to indulge myſelf

on this occaſion, in conſideration of the fatal abſence I was doomed to ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>I went to bed immediately on my return to my lodging, and having ſlept about two hours, was waked by Strap, who, in great confuſion, told me there was a footman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with a letter for me, which he would deliver to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body but myſelf.—Alarmed at this piece of news, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my friend to ſhew him up to my chamber, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from him, which he ſaid, required an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate anſwer: upon which I opened it and read:</p>

Nor was an opportunity wanting; for I no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, than he aſked, with a ſtern countenance, what buſineſs I had in Mr. Tophall's garden, ſo early in the morning?—"I don't know, my Lord," ſaid I, <q>how to anſwer a queſtion put to me with ſuch a magiſterial haughtineſs.—If your Lordſhip will pleaſe to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late calmly, you will have no cauſe to repent of your condeſcenſion—otherwiſe, I am not to be intimidated into any confeſſion.</q>—"There's no room for denial," anſwered he, "I ſaw you come out with my own eyes."—Did any other perſon ſee me?" ſaid I.—<q>I neither know nor care,</q> ſaid he: <q>I want no other evidence that that of my own ſenſes.</q>—Pleaſed to hear that the ſuſpicion was confined to him alone, I endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe his jealouſy, by owning an intrigue with the waiting maid; but he had too much diſcernment to be ſo eaſily impoſed upon; and told me there was only one way to convince him of the truth of what I alledged, which was no other than renouncing all claim to Narciſſa upon oath, and promiſing upon honour, never to ſpeak to her for the future.—Exaſperated at this propoſal, I unſheathed my ſword, ſaying, <q>Heavens! what title have you or any man on earth to impoſe ſuch terms on me!</q> He did the ſame, and, making towards me, with a contracted brow, ſaid I was a villain, and had diſhonoured Narciſſa.—"He's a ſcandalous villain," I replied in a tranſport of fury, <q>who brands me with that imputation! She is a thouſand times more chaſte than the mother that bore you; and I will aſſert her honour with my heart's blood!</q> So ſaying, I ruſhed upon him with more eagerneſs than addreſs, and, endeavouring to get within his point, received a wound in my neck, which redoubled my rage.—He excelled me in temper as well as in ſkill, by which means he parried my thruſts with great calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, until I had almoſt exhauſted my ſpirits; and when he perceived me beginning to flag, attacked me fiercely in his turn.—Finding himſelf, however, better oppoſed than he expected, he reſolved to follow his longe, and cloſe with me; accordingly, his ſword entered my waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, on the ſide of the breaſt-bone, and running up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſhirt and ſkin, appeared above my left ſhoulder: I imagined that his weapon had perforated my lungs,

and, of conſequence, that the wound was mortal; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined not to die unrevenged, I ſeized his ſhell, which was cloſe to my breaſt, before he could diſentangle his point, and keeping it faſt with my left hand, ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my own ſword with my right, intending to run him through the heart; but he received the thruſt in his left arm, which penetrated up to the ſhoulder blade.—Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in this expectation, and afraid ſtill that death would fruſtrate my revenge, I grappled with him, and being much the ſtronger, threw him upon the ground, where I wreſted his ſword out of his hand; and ſo great was my confuſion, inſtead of turning the point upon him, ſtruck out three of his fore-teeth with the hilt.—In the mean time, our ſervants ſeeing us fall, ran up to ſeparate and aſſiſt us; but before their approach, I was upon my feet, and had diſcovered that my ſuppoſed mortal wound was only a ſlight ſcratch. The knowledge of my own ſafety diſarmed me of a good deal of reſentment, and I began to enquire with ſome concern into the ſituation of my antagoniſt, who remained on the ground, bleeding plentifully at his mouth and arm.—I helped his footman to raiſe him, and, having bound up his wound with my handkerchief, aſſured him it was not dangerous; I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reſtored his ſword, and offered to ſupport him to his own houſe.—He thanked me with an air of ſullen dignity; and whiſpering to me, that I ſhould hear from him ſoon, went away, leaning on his ſervant's ſhoulder.</p>

I aſked if people gueſſed the occaſion of the quarrel; and underſtanding it was attributed to his Lordſhip's reſentment of my reply in the Long-room, confirmed that conjecture, glad to find Narciſſa unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—My friend, after I had aſſured him that my antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt was in no danger, wiſhed me joy of the event, than which, he ſaid, nothing could happen more opportunely to ſupport the idea he had given of my character to his friends, among whom he had been very aſſiduous in my behalf.</p>
                     <p>On the ſtrength of this aſſurance, I went with him to the coffee-houſe, where I was ſaluted by a great many of thoſe very perſons who ſhunned me the preceding day.—

                     <p>Thither I immediately repaired, and was conducted to an apartment, where I was received by his Lordſhip in bed. Being left by ourſelves, he thanked me in very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite terms, for having uſed the advantage fortune had given me over him, with ſuch moderation; and aſked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for any offence his reſentment might have prompted him to commit.—"I would willingly," ſaid he, <q>make you my friend; but as it is impoſſible for me to diveſt myſelf of my paſſion for Narciſſa, I am too well convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of your ſentiments, to think we ſhall ever agree on that ſubject. I took the liberty, therefore, of ſending for you, in order to own candidly, that I cannot help oppoſing your ſucceſs with that young lady; though at the ſame time I promiſe to regulate my oppoſition by the dictates of juſtice and honour: this, however, I think proper to advertiſe you of, that ſhe has no inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent fortune, and if you ſhould even ſucceed in your addreſſes, you would have the mortification to ſee her reduced to indigence, unleſs you have wherewithal to ſupport her—and I am credibly informed of your inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity that way.—Nay, I muſt confeſs, that, urged by that conſideration, I have actually ſent notice to her brother, of the progreſs I ſuſpect you have made in her affection, and deſired him to take his precautions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</q>—Alarmed and provoked at this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I told his Lordſhip, that I did not ſee how he could reconcile that piece of conduct with his profeſſion of open dealing, and flung away from him in a paſſion.</p>
                     <p>As I walked homeward, in hopes of hearing from my miſtreſs as uſual, by means of Miſs Williams, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with the waving of a handkerchief, from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a coach and ſix that paſſed by me at full ſpeed; and upon further obſervation, I ſaw a ſervant on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back riding after it, who, I knew by his livery, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſquire.—Thunderſtruck with this diſcovery, the knowledge of my misfortune ruſhed all at once upon my reflection!

He repreſented the madneſs of ſuch an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and endeavoured to divert me from it, with great ſtrength of friendſhip and reaſon: but all his arguments would have been ineffectual, had he not put me in mind of the dependence I ought to have on the love of Narciſſa, and attachment of her maid, which could not fail of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opportunities enough to advertiſe me of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, at the ſame time, demonſtrated the injury my charmer's reputation muſt ſuffer from my precipitate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. I was convinced and compoſed by theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I appeared in company with an air of tranquillity, was well received by the beſt company in town, and my misfortune taking air condoled accordingly; while I had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing Melinda ſo univerſally diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, that ſhe was fain to return to London, in order to avoid the ſcoffs and cenſure of the ladies at Bath.—But though the hope of hearing from the darling of my ſoul ſupported my ſpirits a little while, I began to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, when, at the end of ſeveral weeks, I found that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation diſappointed.—In ſhort, melancholy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence took poſſeſſion of my ſoul; and repining at that providence, which, by acting the ſtep-mother towards me, kept me from the fruition of my wiſhes, I determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a fit of deſpair, to riſk all I had at the gaming-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with a view of acquiring a fortune ſufficient to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me independent for life; or of plunging myſelf into ſuch a ſtate of miſery, as would effectually cruſh every ambitious hope that now tortured my imagination.</p>

                     <p>Having thus executed my ſcheme, I went home, amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find myſelf ſo much at eaſe, informed my friend Strap of my miſchance, with ſuch calmneſs, that he, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining I joked, affected to receive the tidings with great equanimity.—But both he and I found ourſelves miſtaken very ſoon.—I had miſinterpreted my own ſtupidity into deliberate reſignation, and he had reaſon to believe me in earneſt, when he ſaw me next morning agitated with the moſt violent deſpair, which he endeavoured to alleviate with all the conſolation in his power.</p>
                     <p>In one of my lucid intervals, however, I charged him to take a place in the ſtage-coach for London; and in the mean time paid my debts in Bath, which amounted to thirty-ſhillings only.—Without taking leave of my friends, I embarked, Strap having the good fortune to find a return horſe, and arrived in town without having met with any thing remarkable on the road, ſave that, while we croſſed Bagſhot heath, I was ſeized with a ſort of inclination to retrieve my fortune, by laying paſſengers under contribution, in ſome ſuch place.—My thoughts were ſo circumſtanced at this time, that I ſhould have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the crime of robbery, ſo righteouſly had I concert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my plan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ventured my life in the execution, had I not been deterred by reflecting upon the infamy that at tends detection.</p>
                     <p>The apartment I formerly lived in being unengaged, I took poſſeſſion of it, and next day went in queſt of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who received me with open arms, in expectation of having his bond diſcharged to his liking: but when he underſtood what had happened, his countenance changed of a ſudden, and he told me, with a dryneſs of diſpleaſure peculiar to himſelf, that if he was in my place he would put it out of fortune's power to play him ſuch another trick, and be avenged of his own indiſcretion at once.—When I deſired him to explain his meaning, he pointed to his neck, raiſed himſelf on his tip-toes, and was going

away without further ceremony, when I put him in mind of my indigence, and demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him. "Five guineas!" cried he, <q>Zounds, had you acted with common prudence, you might have had twenty thouſand in your pocket by this time. I depended upon five hundred from you, as much as if I had had notes for it in the bank; and by all the rules of equity, you are indebted to me for that ſum.</q>—I was neither pleaſed nor convinced by this computation, and inſiſted on my right with ſuch determined obſtinacy, that he was fain to alter his tone, and appeaſe my clamour, by aſſuring me that he was not maſter of five ſhillings.—So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in diſtreſs generally promotes good underſtanding among people; from being a dun, I deſcended to be a client, and aſked his advice about repairing my loſſes.—He counſelled me to have recourſe again to the gaming-table, where I had ſucceeded ſo well before, and to put myſelf in a condition by ſelling my watch.—I followed his direction, and having accommodated him with a few pieces, went to the place, where I loſt every ſhilling.</p>
                     <p>I returned to my lodgings full of deſperate reſolutions, and having made Strap acquainted with my fate, ordered him to pawn my ſword immediately, that I might be enabled to make another effort.—This affectionate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no ſooner underſtood my purpoſe, than ſeized with inſupportable ſorrow at the proſpect of my miſery, he burſt into tears, and aſked what I propoſed to do after the ſmall ſum he could raiſe on the ſword ſhould be ſpent: "On my own account," ſaid he, <q>I am quite uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; for while God ſpares me health and theſe ten fingers, I can earn a comfortable ſubſiſtence any where; but what muſt become of you, who have leſs humility to ſtoop and more appetites to gratify?</q>—Here I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him by ſaying, with a gloomy aſpect, I ſhould never want a reſource while I had a loaded piſtol in my poſſeſſion.—Stupified with horror at this dreadful inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he ſtood mute for ſome time, then broke out into <q>God of his infinite mercy enable you to withſtand that temptation of the devil!—Conſider your immortal ſoul!—there's no repentance in the grave!—O Lord, that ever it ſhould come to this!—Are we not enjoined to reſign ourſelves to the will of Heaven? where is your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience?

                     <p>This kind letter afforded me great conſolation: I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to Banter, and at the ſame time ſhewed him her picture: he approved of her beauty and good ſenſe, and could not help owning that my neglect of Miſs Snapper was excuſable, when ſuch a fine creature engroſſed my attention.</p>
                     <p>I began to be reconciled to my fate, and imagined, that if I could contrive means of ſubſiſting until my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhould arrive, in caſe he was not already at home, he would enable me to do ſomething effectual in behalf of my love and fortune. I therefore conſulted Banter about a preſent ſupply, who no ſooner underſtood that I had credit with a taylor, than he adviſed me to take off two or three ſuits of rich clothes, and convert them into caſh, by ſelling them at half price to a ſaleſman in Monmouth-ſtreet. I was ſtartled at his propoſal, which I thought favoured a little of fraud; but he rendered it palatable by obſerving that in a few months I might be in a condition to do every body juſtice; and in the mean time I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted by the honeſty of my intention. I ſuffered myſelf to be perſuaded by his ſalvo, by which my neceſſity rather than my judgment was convinced; and when I found there were no accounts of the ſhip in which my uncle em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, actually put the ſcheme in practice, and raiſed by it five and twenty guineas, paying him for his advice with the odd five.</p>

                        <p>I am arreſted—carried to the Marſhalſea—find my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance beau Jackſon in that jail—he informs me of his adventures—Strap arrives, and with difficulty is comforted—Jackſon introduces me to a poet—I admire his converſation and capacity—am deeply affected with my misfortune—Strap hires himſelf as a journeyman barber.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT this expedient was in a few weeks attended with a conſequence I did not foreſee: a player having purchaſed one of the ſuits which were expoſed to ſale, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in it on the ſtage one night, while my taylor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately happened to be preſent.—He knew it immediately, and inquiring minutely into the affair, diſcovered my whole contrivance: upon which he came to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and telling me that he was very much ſtraitened for want of money, preſented his bill, which amounted to 50<hi>l.</hi>—Surpriſed at this unexpected addreſs, I affected to treat him cavalierly, ſwore ſome oaths, aſked if he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my honour, and telling him I ſhould take care who I dealt with for the future, bid him come again in three days.—He obeyed me punctually, demanded his money, and finding himſelf amuſed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>are promiſes, arreſted me that very day in the ſtreet.—I was not much ſhocked at this adventure, which, indeed, reſcued me from a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſuſpence in which I had lived ſince his firſt viſit. I refuſed to go to a ſpunging-houſe, where I had heard there was nothing but the moſt flagrant impoſition; and a coach being called, I was carried to the Marſhalſea, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a bailiff and his follower, who were very much diſappointed and chagrined at my reſolution.</p>
                     <p>The turnkey gueſſing from my appearance, that I had money in my pocket, received me with the repetition of the Latin word <hi>depone,</hi> and gave me to underſtand, that I muſt pay before-hand for the apartment I ſhould chuſe to dwell in.—I deſired to ſee his conveniences, and hired a ſmall paultry bed chamber, for a crown a week, which, in any other place, would not have let for half the money.—Having taken poſſeſſion of this diſmal habitation, I

ſent for Strap, and my thoughts were buſied in collecting matter of conſolation to that faithful ſquire, when ſome body knocked at my door, which I no ſooner opened, than a young fellow entered, in very ſhabby clothes and marvellous ſoul linen. After a low bow, he called me by my name, and aſked if I had forgot him. His voice aſſiſted me in recollecting his perſon, which I ſoon recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized to be my old acquaintance beau Jackſon, of whom mention is made in the firſt part of my memoirs.—I ſaluted him, expreſſed my ſatisfaction at finding him alive, and condoled with him on his preſent ſituation; which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, did not ſeem to affect him much, for he laughed very heartily at the occaſion of our meeting ſo unexpectedly in this place.</p>
                     <p>After our mutual compliments were over, I inquired about his amour with the lady of fortune, which ſeemed to be ſo near a happy concluſion when I had the pleaſure of ſeeing him laſt; and, after an immoderate fit of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he gave me to underſtand, that he had been egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly bit in that affair. "You muſt know," ſaid he, <q>that a few days after our adventure with the bawd and her b—ches, I found means to be married to that ſame fine lady you ſpeak of, and paſſed the night with her, at her lodgings, ſo much to her ſatisfaction, that early in the morning, after a good deal of ſniveling and ſobbing, ſhe owned, that, ſo far from being an heireſs of a great fortune, ſhe was no other than a common woman of the town, who had decoyed me into matrimony, in order to enjoy the privilege of a <hi>femme couverte,</hi> and that, unleſs I made my eſcape immediately, I ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for a debt of her contracting by bailiffs employed and inſtructed for that purpoſe. Startled at this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I aroſe in a twinkling, and, taking leave of my ſpouſe with ſeveral hearty damns, got ſafe into the verge of the court, where I kept ſnug until I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſurgeon's mate of a man of war at Portſmouth; for which place I ſet out on a Sunday, went on board of my ſhip, in which I ſailed to the Straits, where I had the good fortune to be made ſurgeon of a ſloop that came home in a few months after, and was put out of commiſſion: whereupon I came to London, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf forgotten, and freed from my wife and her

However, you know my diſpoſition; I defy care and anxiety, and, being on the half-pay liſt, make ſhift to live here tolerably eaſy.</q>—I congratulated him on his philoſophy, and, remembering that I was in his debt, repaid the money he formerly le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t me, which I believe was far from being unſeaſonable. I then inquired about the economy of the place, which he explained to my ſatisfaction, and, after we had agreed to meſs together, he was juſt going to give orders for dinner when Strap arrived.</p>
                     <p>I never in my life ſaw ſorrow ſo extravagantly expreſſed in any countenance as in that of my honeſt friend, which was indeed particularly adapted by nature for ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Being left by ourſelves, I communicated to him my diſaſter, and endeavoured to conſole him with the ſame arguments he had formerly uſed to me, withal repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fair chance I had of being relieved in a ſhort time by Mr. Bowling. But his grief was unutterable; he ſeemed to give attention without liſtening, and wrung his hands in ſilence; ſo that I was in a fair way of being infected with his behaviour, when Jackſon returned, and, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deference I paid to Strap although in a footman's habit, diſtributed his cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mbs of comfort with ſuch mirth, jollity, and unconcern, that the features of the diſtreſſed ſquire relaxed by degrees, he recovered the uſe of ſpeech, and began to be a little more reconciled to this lamentable event. We dined together on boiled beef and greens, brought from a cook's ſhop in the neighbourhood; and, although this meal was ſerved up in a manner little corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with the ſphere of life in which I had lately li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I made a virtue of neceſſity, eat with a good appetite, and treated my friends with a bottle of wine, which had the deſired effect of encreaſing the good humour of my fellow-priſoner, and exhilirating the ſpirits of Strap, who now talked of my misfortune <hi>en cavalier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After dinner Jackſon left us to our private affairs—when I deſired my friend to pack up all our things, and carry them to ſome cheap lodging he ſhould chuſe for himſelf in the neighbourhood of the Marſhalſea, after he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged

my lodging, for which I gave him money. I likewiſe recommended to him the keeping my misfortune ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and ſaying to my landlord, or any other who ſhould inquire for me, that I was gone into the country for a few weeks: at the ſame time I laid ſtrong injunctions upon him to call every ſecond day upon Banter, in caſe he ſhould receive any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> lodgings in Wapping, by which I might be found when my kinſman ſhould arrive.</p>
                     <p>When he departed to execute theſe orders, (which by the bye were punctually performed that very night,) I found myſelf ſo little ſeaſoned to my ſituation, that I dreaded reflection, and ſought ſhelter from it in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the beau, who, promiſing to regale me with a lecture upon taſte, conducted me to the common ſide, where I ſaw a number of naked miſerable wretches aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together. We had not been there many minutes when a figure appeared, wrapped in a dirty rug, tied about his loins with two pieces of liſt of different colours, knotted together, having a black buſhy beard, and his head covered with a huge maſs of brown periwig, which ſeemed to have been raviſhed from the crown of ſome ſcarecrow. This apparition ſtalking in with great ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, made a profound bow to the audience, who ſignified their approbation by a general reſponſe of, <q>How d'ye do, doctor?</q> He then turned towards us, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Jackſon with a particular ſalutation; upon which, my friend, in a formal manner, introduced him to me by the name of Mr. Melopoyn. This ceremony being over, he advanced into the middle of the congregation, which crowded around him, and hemming three times, to my utter aſtoniſhment, pronounced, with great ſignificance of voice and geſture, a very elegant and ingenious diſcourſe upon the difference between genius and taſte, illuſtrating his aſſertions with apt quotations from the beſt authors, ancient as well as modern. When he had finiſhed his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, which laſted a full hour, he bowed again to the ſpectators, not one of whom, I was informed, underſtood ſo much as a ſentence of what he had uttered. They manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, their admiration and eſteem by voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, which Jackſon told me, one week with another,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:027715_0429_0FD5EEDD1C9E33D0"/>
amounted to eighteen pence. This moderate ſtipend, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome ſmall preſents which he received for making up differences and deciding cauſes amongſt the priſoners, juſt enabled him to breathe, and walk about in the groteſque figure I have deſcribed. I underſtood alſo, that he was an excellent poet, and had compoſed a trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was allowed, by every body who had ſeen it, to be a performance of great merit; that his learning was infinite, his morals unexceptionable, and his modeſty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible. Such a character could not fail of attracting my regard; I longed impatiently to be acquainted with him, and deſired Jackſon would engage him to ſpend the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my apartment. My requeſt was granted; he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured us with his company, and, in the courſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, perceiving that I had a ſtrong paſſion for the <hi>belles lettres,</hi> acquitted himſelf ſo well on that ſubject that I expreſſed a fervent deſire of ſeeing his productions: in this too be gratified my inclination—he promiſed to bring his tragedy to my room next day, and in the mean time entertained me with ſome detached pieces, which gave me a very advantageous idea of his poetical talent. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things I was particularly pleaſed with ſome elegies in imitation of Tibullus, one of which I beg leave to ſubmit to the reader, as a ſpecimen of his complexion and capacity.</p>

                     <p>I was wonderfully affected with this pathetic complaint, which ſeemed ſo well calculated for my own diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in love, that I could not help attaching the idea Narciſſa to the name of Monimia, and of forming ſuch melancholy preſages of my paſſion, that I could not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my tranquillity, and was fain to have recourſe to the bottle, which prepared me for a profound ſleep that I could not otherwiſe have enjoyed. Whether theſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions invited and introduced a train of other melancholy reflections, or my fortitude was all exhauſted in the effort I made againſt deſpondence, the firſt day of my impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I cannot determine; but I awoke in the horrors, and found my imagination haunted with ſuch diſmal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, that I was ready to deſpair: and I believe the reader will own, that I had no great cauſe to congratulate myſelf, when I conſidered my ſituation.

I perceived by his countenance that his heart was big with gratitude, and endeavoured to prevent his acknowledgments, by aſking pardon for the liberty I had taken; he made no reply, but, with an aſpect full of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and eſteem, bowed to the ground, while the tears guſhed from his eyes. Affected with theſe ſymptoms of an ingenuous mind, I ſhifted the converſation from this ſubject, and complimented him on his performance, which I aſſured him afforded me infinite pleaſure. My approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made him happy: dinner being ſerved, and Jackſon arrived, I begged their permiſſion for Strap to ſit at table with us, after having informed them, that he was a perſon to whom I was extremely obliged; they were kind enough to grant that favour, and we eat together with great har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Our meal being ended, I expreſſed my wonder at the little regard Mr. Melopoyn had met with from the world, and ſignified a deſire of hearing how he had been treated by the managers of the play-houſes, to whom, I underſtood from Jackſon, he had offered his tragedy without ſucceſs. <q>There is ſo little entertaining in the incidents of my life,</q> ſaid he, <q>that I am ſure the recital will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe your attention; but, ſince you diſcover an inclination to know them, I underſtand my duty too well to diſappoint your deſires.</q>

                     <p>MY father, who was a curate in the country, being, by the narrowneſs of his circumſtances, hindered from main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining me at the univerſity, took the charge of my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon himſelf, and laboured with ſuch induſtry and concern in the undertaking, that I had little cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the want of public maſters. Being at great pains to conſult my natural bias, he diſcovered in me, betimes, an inclination for poetry; upon which he recommended to me an intimate acquaintance with the claſſics, in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of which he aſſiſted me with paternal zeal, and uncommon erudition. When he thought me ſufficiently acquainted with the ancients, he directed my ſtudies to the beſt modern authors, French and Italian, as well as Engliſh, and laid a particular injunction upon me to make myſelf maſter of my mother tongue.</p>

About the age of eighteen I grew ambitious of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a work of ſome conſequence, and, with my father's approbation, actually planned the tragedy you have read; but, before I had finiſhed four acts, that indulgent parent died, and left my mother and me in very indigent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. A near relation, compaſſionating our diſtreſs, took us into his family, where I brought my fable to a concluſion, and ſoon after my mother quitted this life.—When my ſorrow for this melancholy event had ſubſided, I told my kinſman, who was a farmer, that, having paid my laſt duty to my parent, I had now no attachment to detain me in the country, and therefore was reſolved to ſet out for London, and offer my play to the ſtage, where I did not doubt of acquiring a large ſhare of fame as well as fortune, in which caſe I ſhould not be unmindful of my friends and benefactors. My couſin was raviſhed with the proſpect of my felicity, and willingly contributed towards the expence of fitting me out for the expedition.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly I took a place in the waggon, and arrived in town, where I hired an apartment in a garret, willing to live as frugal as poſſible until I ſhould know what I had to expect from the manager, to whom I intended to offer my play—for though I looked upon myſelf as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſecure of a good reception, imagining that a paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee would be as eager to receive as I to preſent my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I did not know whether or not he might not be pre-engaged in favour of another author, which would certainly retard my ſucceſs. On this conſideration too I determined to be ſpeedy in my application, and even to wait upon one of the managers the very next day. For this purpoſe I enquired of my landlord, if he knew where either or both of them lived? and he being curious to know my buſineſs, and at the ſame time appearing to be a very honeſt, friendly man, (a tallow-chandler,) I made him acquainted with my deſign! upon which he told me, that I went the wrong way to work; that I would not find ſuch eaſy acceſs to a manager as I imagined, and that, if I delivered my performance without proper recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would be as one to a thouſand if ever it ſhould be minded. "Take my advice," ſaid he, <q>and your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is done. One of the patentees is a good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic as I am, and uſes the ſame father who confeſſes me.
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:027715_0434_0FD5EEEC305B45C0"/>
I will make you acquainted with this good prieſt, who is an excellent ſcholar, and if he ſhould approve of your play, his recommendation will go a great way in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Mr. Supple to bring it on the ſtage.</q> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded his expedient, and was introduced to the friar, who, having peruſed the tragedy, was pleaſed to ſignify his approbation, and commended me in particular for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving avoided all reflections upon religion. He promiſed to uſe all his influence with his ſon Supple in my behalf, and to inform himſelf that very day, when it would be proper for me to wait upon him with the piece. He was punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in performing his engagement, and next morning gave me to underſtand, that he had mentioned my affair to the manager, and that I had no more to do than to go to his houſe any time in the forenoon, and make uſe of his name, upon which I ſhould find immediate admittance. I took his advice, put my performance in my boſom, and, having received directions, went immediately to the houſe of Mr. Supple, and knocked at the door, which had a wicket in the middle, faced with a net-work of iron, through which a ſervant, having viewed me ſome time, demanded to know my buſineſs. I told him my buſineſs was with Mr. Supple, and that I came from Mr. O'Varniſh. He examined my appearance once more, then went away, returned in a few minutes, and ſaid his maſter was buſy, and could not be ſeen. Although I was a little mortified at my diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I was perſuaded, that my reception was owing to Mr. Supple's ignorance of my errand; and, that I might meet with no more obſtructions of the ſame kind, I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Mr. O'Varniſh to be my introductor the next time. He complied with my requeſt, and obtained immediate admittance to the manager, who received me with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt civility, and promiſed to read my play with the firſt convenience. By his own appointment I called again in a fortnight, but he was gone out; I returned in a week after, and the poor gentleman was extremely ill; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed my viſit in a fortnight after that, and he aſſured me he had been ſo much fatigued with buſineſs, that he had not been able as yet to read it to an end, but he would take the firſt opportunity, and in the mean time obſerved, that what he had yet ſeen of it was very entertaining. I comforted myſelf with this declaration a few weeks longer,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:027715_0435_0FD5EEED9CD491C8"/>
at the end of which I appeared again before the wicket, was let in, and found him laid up with the gout. I no ſooner entered his chamber than, looking at me with a languiſhing eye, he pronounced, <q>Mr. Melopoyn, I'm heartily ſorry for an accident that has happened during my illneſs—you muſt know, that my eldeſt boy, finding your manuſcript upon the table in the dining-room where I uſed to read it, carried it into the kitchen, and leaving it there, a negligent wench of a cook-maid, miſtaking it for waſte-paper, has expended it all but a few leaves in ſingeing fowls upon the ſpit—but I hope the misfortune is not irreparable, ſince, no doubt, you have ſeveral copies.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I proteſt to you, my good friend, Mr. Random, I was extremely ſhocked at this information! but the good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured gentleman ſeemed to be ſo much affected with my misfortune, that I ſuppreſſed my concern, and told him that, although I had not another copy, I ſhould be able to retrieve the loſs by writing another from my memory, which was very tenacious. You cannot imagine how well pleaſed Mr. Supple was at this aſſurance; he begged I would ſet about it immediately, and carefully revolve and recollect every circumſtance, before I pretended to commit it to paper, that it might be the ſame individual play he had peruſed. Encouraged by this injunction, which plainly demonſtrated how much he intereſted himſelf in the affair, I taſked my remembrance and induſtry, and in three weeks produced the exact image of the former, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to him by my good friend Father O'Varniſh, who told me next day, that Mr. Supple would reviſe it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, in order to judge of its ſameneſs with the other, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

For this examination I allotted a week, and, in full confidence of ſeeing it acted in a little while, demanded an audience of the manager when that term was expired. But alas! the ſeaſon had ſlap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away inſenſibly; he convinced me, that, if my play had been put into rehearſal at that time, it could not have been ready for performing until the end of March, when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit nights came on; conſequently it would have interfered with the intereſt of the players, whom it was my buſineſs not to diſoblige.</p>
                     <p>I was fain to acquieſce in theſe reaſons, which, to be

Indeed, I ought to be aſhamed at this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my conduct; for my finances were ſufficient, with good economy, to have maintained me comfortably a whole year. You perhaps will be amazed when I tell you, that in ſix months I expended not a farthing leſs than ten guineas: but when one conſiders the temptations to which a young man is expoſed in this great city, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Nor was the cauſe of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern limited to my own ſituation entirely: I had wrote an account of my good reception to my kinſman the farmer, and deſired him to depend upon me for the money he had kindly accommodated me with about the end of February; which promiſe I now found myſelf unable to perform.—However, there was no remedy but patience: I applied to my landlord, who was a very good-natured man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly owned my diſtreſs, and begged his advice in laying down ſome plan for my ſubſiſtence. He readily promiſed to conſult his confeſſor on this ſubject, and in the mean time told me, I was welcome to lodge and board with him, until fortune ſhould put it in my power to make reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Mr. O'Varniſh, being informed of my neceſſity, offered to introduce me to the author of a weekly paper, who, he did not doubt, would employ me in that way, provided he ſhould find me duly qualified; but, upon enquiry, I underſtood, that this journal was calculated to foment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in the commonwealth, and therefore I deſired to be excuſed from engaging in it. He then propoſed, that I ſhould write ſomething in the poetical way, which I might diſpoſe of to a bookſeller for a pretty ſum of ready money, and perhaps eſtabliſh my own character into the bargain: this event would infallibly procure friends, and my tragedy would appear next ſeaſon to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by being ſupported both by intereſt and reputation.
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:027715_0437_0FD5EEF3F7497528"/>
I was charmed with this proſpect, and, having heard what friends Mr. Pope acquired by his paſtorals, ſet about a work of that kind, and in leſs than ſix weeks compoſed as many eclogues, which I forthwith offered to an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bookſeller, who deſired I would leave them for his peruſal, and he would give me an anſwer in two days. At the end of that time I went to him, when he returned the poems, telling me they would not anſwer his purpoſe, and ſweetened his refuſal by ſaying there were ſome good clever lines in them. Not a little dejected at this rebuff, which I learned from Mr. O'Varniſh, was owing to the opinion of another author, whom this bookſeller always conſulted on theſe occaſions, I applied to another perſon of the ſame profeſſion, who told me, that the town was cloyed with paſtorals, and adviſed me, if I intended to profit by my talents, to write ſomething ſatirical or luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſuch as <hi>The Button-hole, Shockey and Towzer, The Leaky Veſſel, &amp;c.</hi> And yet this was a man in years, who wore a reverend periwig, looked like a ſenator, and went regularly to church. Be that as it will, I ſcorned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute my pen in the manner he propoſed, and carried my papers to a third, who aſſured me that poetry was entirely out of his way, and aſked, if I had got never a piece of ſecret hiſtory thrown into a ſeries of letters, or a volume of adventures, ſuch as thoſe of Robinſon Cruſoe and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Jack, or a collection of conundrums, wherewith to entertain the plantations?

                     <p>I was afterwards perſuaded to offer myſelf as a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and accordingly repaired to a perſon who was ſaid to entertain numbers of that claſs in his pay: he aſſured me he had already a great deal of that work on his hands, which he did not know what to do with, obſerved, that tranſlation was a mere drug, that branch of literature being overſtocked by an inundation of authors from North-Britain, and aſked what I would expect <hi>per</hi> ſheet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That I might not make myſelf too cheap, I determined to ſet a high price upon my qualification, and demanded half a guinea for every tranſlated ſheet.—"Half a guinea!" cried he, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at me; then pauſed a little, and ſaid he had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion

for my ſervice at preſent. I found my error, and, reſolving to make amends, fell one half in my demand: upon which he ſtared at me again, and told me his hands were full. I attempted others without finding employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and was actually reduced to a very uncomfortable proſpect, when I bethought myſelf of offering my talents to the printers of halfpenny ballads, and other ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional eſſays as are hawked about the ſtreets. With this view I applied to one of the moſt noted and vociferous of this tribe, who directed me to a perſon whom I found en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining a whole crowd of them with gin, bread, and cheeſe: he carried me into a little back parlour, very neatly furniſhed, where I ſignified my deſire of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled among his writers, and was aſked what kind of compoſition I profeſſed? Underſtanding that my inclination leaned towards poetry, he expreſſed his ſatisfaction, telling me, one of his poets had loſt his ſenſes, and was confined in Bedlam, and the other was become dozed by drinking drams; ſo that he had not done any thing tolerable theſe many weeks. When I propoſed, that he ſhould enter into terms of agreement, he gave me to underſtand, that his bargains were always conditional, and his authors paid in proportion to the ſale of their works.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore ſettled theſe conditions, which (I do aſſure you) were not very advantageous to me, he aſſigned me a ſubject for a ballad, which was to be finiſhed in two hours; and I retired to my garret in order to perform his injunction.—As the theme happened to ſuit my fancy, I completed a pretty ſort of an ode within the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and brought it to him, big with hope of profit and pleaſure. He read it in a twinkling, and, to my utter aſtoniſhment, told me it would not do; though indeed, he owned I wrote a good hand, and ſpelled very well, but my language was too high flown, and of conſequence not at all adapted to the capacity and taſte of his cuſtomers.—I promiſed to rectify that miſtake, and in half an hour humbled my ſtyle to the comprehenſion of vulgar readers: he approved of the alteration, and gave me ſome hopes of ſucceeding in time, though he obſerved that my perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was very deficient in quaintneſs of expreſſion that pleaſes the multitude: however, to encourage me, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured

the expence of printing and paper, and, if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber aright, my ſhare of the ſale amounted to four pence halfpenny.</p>
                     <p>From that day, I ſtudied the Grub-ſtreet manner with great diligence, and at length became ſuch a proficient, that my works were in great requeſt among the moſt polite of the chairmen, draymen, hackney-coachmen, footmen, and ſervant maids: nay, I have enjoyed the pleaſure of ſeeing my productions adorned with cuts, paſted upon the wall as ornaments in beer-cellars, and coblers ſtalls; and have actually heard them ſung in clubs of ſubſtantial tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.—But empty praiſe, (you know, my dear friend,) will not ſupply the cravings of nature.—I found myſelf in danger of ſtarving in the midſt of all my fame; for of ten ſongs I compoſed, it was well if two had the good fortune to pleaſe.—For this reaſon I turned my thoughts to proſe, and during a tract of gloomy weather, publiſhed an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, on the ſubſtance of which I ſubſiſted very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably a whole month: I have made many a good meal upon a monſter; a rape has often afforded me great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but a murder, well-timed, was my never-failing reſource.—What then!

                        </gap>t up along with Mr. Supple's letter, by one of his ſervants, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me, by his Lordſhip's order, to return in a week.—I did ſo, and was admitted to his Lordſhip, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me very courteouſly, told me he had peruſed my play, which he thought on the whole, was the beſt <hi>coup d' eſſai</hi> he had ever ſeen; but that he had marked ſome places in the margin, which he imagined might be altered for the better.—I was tranſported with this reception, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, (with many acknowledgments of his Lordſhip's generoſity,) to be governed ſolely by his advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.—"Well, then," ſaid he, <q>write another fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py with the alterations I have propoſed, and bring it to me as ſoon as poſſible, for I am reſolved to have it brought on the ſtage this winter.</q>—You may be ſure I ſet about this taſk with alacrity, and although I found his Lordſhip's remarks much more numerous and of leſs importance than I expected, I thought it was not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to diſpute about trifles with my patron; therefore new-modelled it according to his deſire, in leſs than a month.</p>
                     <p>When I waited upon him with the manuſcript, I found one of the actors at breakfaſt with his Lordſhip, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately introduced him to my acquaintance, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to read a ſcene of my play.—This taſk he performed very much to my ſatisfaction with regard to emphaſis and pronunciation; but he ſignified his diſguſt at ſeveral words in every page, which I preſuming to defend, Lord Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle told me, with a peremptory look, I muſt not pretend
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:027715_0441_0FD5CDA2266675A8"/>
to diſpute with him, who had been a player theſe twenty years, and underſtood the economy of the ſtage better than any man living. I was forced to ſubmit, and his Lordſhip propoſed the ſame actor ſhould read the whole play, in the evening, before ſome gentleman of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whom he would convene at his lodgings for that purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>I was preſent at the reading; and I proteſt to you, my dear friend, I never underwent ſuch a ſevere trial in the whole courſe of my life, as at that juncture! for although the player might be a very honeſt man and a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, he was exceſſively illiterate and aſſuming, and made a thouſand frivolous objections, which I was not permitted to anſwer: however, the piece was very much applauded on the whole; the gentlemen preſent, who I underſtood were men of fortune, promiſed to countenance and ſupport it as much as they could; and Lord Rattle aſſuring me, that he would act the part of a careful nurſe to it, deſired me to carry it home, and alter immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to their remarks.—I was fain to acquieſce in his determination, and fulfilled his injunctions with all the expedition in my power; but before I could preſent the new copy, my good friend Mr. Supple had diſpoſed of his property and patent to one Mr. Brayer; ſo that freſh intereſt was to be made with the new manager.—This taſk Lord Rattle undertook, having ſome acquaintance with him, and recommended my performance ſo ſtrongly that it was received.</p>
                     <p>I looked upon myſelf now, as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of all my labour: I waited a few days in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of its being put into rehearſal, and wondering at the delay, applied to my worthy patron, who excuſed Mr. Brayer on account of the multiplicity of buſineſs in which he was involved; and bid me beware of teazing the patentee.—I treaſured up this caution, and exerted my patience three weeks longer; at the end of which his Lordſhip gave me to underſtand, that Mr. Brayer had read my play, and owned it had indubitable merit; but as he had long been pre-engaged to another author, he could not poſſibly repreſent it that ſeaſon; though, if I would reſerve it for the next, and in the interim make
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:027715_0442_0FD5EEF69BB9E298"/>
ſuch alterations as he had propoſed by obſervations in the margin, I might depend upon his compliance.</p>
                     <p>Thunderſtruck at this diſappointment, I could not, for ſome minutes, utter one ſyllable: at length, however, I complained bitterly of the manager's inſincerity in amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me ſo long, when he knew from the beginning, that he could not gratify my deſire.—But his Lordſhip repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me for my freedom, ſaid Mr. Brayer was a man of honour, and imputed his behaviour, with reſpect to me, to nothing elſe but forgetfulneſs.—And indeed I have had ſome reaſon, ſince that time, to be convinced of his bad memory; for, in ſpite of appearances, I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low myſelf to interpret his conduct any other way.—Lord Rattle obſerving me very much affected with my diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, offered his intereſt to bring on my play at the other houſe, which I eagerly accepting, he forthwith wrote a letter of recommendation to Mr. Bellower, actor and prime miniſter to Mr. Vandal, proprietor of that theatre; and deſired me to deliver it with my tragedy, without loſs of time.—Accordingly, I haſtened to his houſe, where, after having waited a whole hour in a lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, I was admitted to his preſence, and my performance received with great ſtate.—He told me he was extremely buſy at preſent, but he would peruſe it as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and bid me call again in a week. I took my leave, not a little aſtoniſhed at the port and ſupercilious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of this ſtage player, who had not treated me with good manners; and began to think the dignity of a poet greatly impaired ſince the days of Euripides and Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; but all this was nothing in compariſon of what I have ſince obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Well, Mr. Random, I went back at the appointed time, and was told that Mr. Bellower was engaged, and could not ſee me.—I repeated my viſit a few days after, and having waited a conſiderable time, was favoured with an audience, during which he ſaid, he had not as yet read my play.—Nettled at this uſage, I could contain myſelf no longer, but telling him, I imagined he would have paid more deference to Lord Rattle's recommendation, demanded my manuſcript with ſome expreſſions of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—"Ay," ſaid he, in a theatrical tone, <q>with all my heart.</q>—Then pulling out a drawer of the bureau

at which he ſat, he took out a bundle, and threw it upon a table that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ear him, pronouncing the word, "There," with great diſdain.—I took it up, and perceiving, with ſome ſurprize, that it was a comedy, told him, it did not belong to me; upon which he offered me another, which I alſo diſclaimed.—A third was produced, and rejected for the ſame reaſon. At length he pulled out a whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>andful, and ſpread them before me, ſaying, <q>There are ſeven—take which you pleaſe—or take them all.</q>—I ſingled out my own, and went away, ſtruck dumb with admiration at what I had ſeen—not ſo much on account of his inſolence, as of the number of new plays, which, from this circumſtance, I concluded were yearly offered to the ſtage.—You may be ſure I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron, who did not receive it with all the indignation I expected; but taxed me with precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and told me, I muſt lay my account with bearing the humours of the players, if I intended to write for the ſtage.—"There is now no other remedy," ſaid he, <q>but to keep it till the next ſeaſon for Mr. Brayer, and alter it at your leiſure in the ſummer time, according to his directions.</q>—I was now reduced to a terrible alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, either to quit all hopes of my tragedy, from which I had all along promiſed myſelf a large ſhare of fortune and reputation, or to encounter eight long months of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, in preparing for, and expecting its appearance.—This laſt penance, painful as it was, ſeemed moſt eligible to my reflection at that time, and therefore I reſolved to undergo it.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould I tire you with particulars of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? I wreſtled with extreme poverty, until the time of my probation was expired; and went to my Lord Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in order to remind him of my affair, when I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to my great concern, that his Lordſhip was on the point of going abroad, and, which was ſtill more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for me, Mr. Brayer had gone into the country; ſo that my generous patron had it not in his power to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ace me perſonally, as he intended: however, he wrote every ſtrong letter to the manager in my favour, and put him in mind of the promiſe he had made in behalf of my play.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as I was certified of Mr. Brayer's return, I
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:027715_0444_0FD5EEFB169D94D0"/>
went to his houſe with this letter, but was told he was gone out.—I called again next day early in the morning, received the ſame anſwer, and was deſired to leave my name and buſineſs. I did ſo, and returned the day after, when the ſervant ſtill affirmed, that his maſter was gone abroad, though I perceived him, as I retired, obſerving me through a window.—Incenſed at this diſcovery I went to a coffee-houſe hard by, and incloſing his Lordſhip's letter in one from myſelf, demanded a categorical an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. I ſent it to his houſe by a porter, who returned in a few minutes, and told me Mr. Brayer would be glad to ſee me that inſtant.—I obeyed the ſummons, and was received with ſuch profuſion of compliments and apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, that my reſentment immediately ſubſided, and I was even in pain for the concern which this honeſt man ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the miſtake of his ſervant, who, it ſeems, had been ordered to deny him to every body but me.—He expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the utmoſt veneration for his good and noble friend Lord Rattle, whom he ſhould always be proud to ſerve; promiſed to peruſe the play with all diſpatch, and give me a meeting upon it; and, as a teſtimony of his eſteem, made me a preſent of a general order for the ſeaſon, by which I ſhould be admitted to any part of the theatre.—This was a very agreeable compliment to me, whoſe greateſt pleaſure conſiſted in ſeeing dramatic performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and you need not doubt that I often availed myſelf of my privilege. As I had an opportunity of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcenes when I pleaſed, I frequently converſed with Mr. Brayer about my play, and aſked when he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put it into rehearſal; but he had always ſo much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon his hands, that it remained with him unopened a conſiderable while; and I became very uneaſy about the ſeaſon, that waſted apace, when I ſaw in the papers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new play advertiſed, which had been written, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, accepted and rehearſed in the compaſs of three months, without my knowledge or ſuſpicion.—You may eaſily gueſs how much I was confounded at this event! I own to you that, in the firſt tranſports of my anger, I ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. Brayer of having acted towards me in the moſt pitiful, perfidious manner; and was actually glad at his diſappointment in the ſucceſs of his favourite piece, which by the ſtrength of art lingered till the third night, and
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:027715_0445_0FD5EF0093DCEA48"/>
then died in a deplorable manner. But, now that paſſion has no ſhare in my reflection, I am willing to aſcribe his behaviour to his want of memory, or want of judgment, which, you know, are natural defects, that are more worthy of compaſſion than reproach.</p>
                     <p>About this time I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman, who having heard of my tragedy, told me, ſhe was acquainted with the wife of a gentleman, who was very well known to a lady, who had great intereſt with a perſon who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit, and that, if I pleaſed, ſhe would uſe her influence in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.—As this nobleman had the character of a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ecenas in the nation, and could ſtamp a value upon any work by his ſole countenance and approbation, I accepted her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with eagerneſs, in full confidence of ſeeing my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eſtabliſhed, and my wiſhes fulfilled in a very ſhort time, provided that I ſhould have the good fortune to pleaſe his Lordſhip's taſte. I withdrew the manuſcript from the hands of Mr. Brayer, and committed it to the care of this gentlewoman, who laboured ſo effectually in my intereſt, that in leſs than a month it was conveyed to the Earl, and in a few weeks after, I had the ſatisfaction to hear that he had read and approved it very much. Tranſported with this piece of intelligence, I flattered myſelf with the hopes of his intereſting himſelf in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but hearing no more of the matter in three whole months, I began (God forgive me!) to ſuſpect the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the perſon who brought me the good tidings; for I thought it impoſſible, that a man of his rank and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, who knew the difficulty of writing a good trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and underſtood the dignity of the work, ſhould read and applaud an eſſay of this kind, without feeling an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to befriend the author, whom his countenance alone could raiſe above dependence. But it was not long before I found my friend very much wronged by my opinion.</p>
                     <p>You muſt know that the civilities I had received from Lord Rattle, and the deſire he manifeſted to promote the ſucceſs of my play, encouraged me to write an account of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad fortune to his Lordſhip, who condeſcended ſo far, as to deſire, by letter, a young ſquire of a great eſtate, with whom he was intimate, to eſpouſe my cauſe, and in
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:027715_0446_0FD5EF01D7C27560"/>
particular to make me acquainted with one Mr. Marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet, a celebrated player, who had lately appeared on the ſtage with aſtoniſhing eclat, and bore ſuch ſway in the houſe where he acted, that the managers durſt not refuſe any thing he recommended. The young gentleman, whom Lord Rattle had employed for this purpoſe, being diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his own intereſt with Mr. Marmozet, had recourſe to a nobleman of his acquaintance, who, at his ſolicitation, was ſo good as to introduce me to him; and the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation turning upon my performance, I was not a little ſurpriſed as well as pleaſed to hear, that Earl Sheerwit had ſpoke very much in its praiſe, and even ſent Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozet the copy, with a meſſage, expreſſing a deſire that he would act in it next ſeaſon.—Nor was the favourite actor backward in commending the piece, which he mentioned with ſome expreſſions of regard that I do not chuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat; aſſuring me that he would appear in it, provided he ſhould be engaged to play at all during the enſuing ſeaſon. In the mean time he deſired I would give him leave to peruſe it in the country, whither he intended to remove next day, that he might have leiſure to conſider and point out ſuch alterations as might, perhaps, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the <hi>jeu de theatre;</hi> and took my direction, that he might communicate by letter, the obſervations he ſhould make. Truſting to theſe aſſurances, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which had been made in my behalf, I hugged my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the expectation of ſeeing it, not only acted, but acted to the greateſt advantage, which I thought could not fail of recompenſing me in an ample manner, for the anxiety and affliction I had undergone: but ſix weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elapſed, I did not know how to reconcile Mr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozet's ſilence, with his promiſe of writing to me in ten days after he ſet out for the country; however, I was at laſt favoured with a letter, importing that he had made ſome remarks on my tragedy, which he would freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare at meeting, and adviſed me to put it, without loſs of time, into the hands of that manager, who had the beſt company; as he himſelf was quite uncertain whether or not he ſhould be engaged that winter.—I was a good deal alarmed at this laſt part of his letter, and adviſed about it with a friend, who told me, it was a plain indication of Mr. Marmozet's deſire to get rid of his promiſe; that his
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:027715_0447_0FD5EF0356A107A0"/>
pretended uncertainty about acting next winter, was no other than a ſcandalous evaſion; for to his certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he was already engaged, or, at leaſt, in terms with Mr. Vandal; and that his deſign was to diſappoint me, in favour of a new comedy, which he had purchaſed of the author, and was intended to bring upon the ſtage, for his own advantage.—In ſhort, my dear Sir, this perſon, who, I muſt own, is of a very ſanguine complexion, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the moral character of Mr. Marmozet with ſuch ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that I began to ſuſpect him of ſome particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and put myſelf upon my guard againſt his inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.—I ought to crave pardon for this tedious narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trivial circumſtances, which, however intereſting they may be to me, muſt certainly be very dry and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid to the ear of one unconcerned in the affair.—But I underſtand the meaning of your looks, and will proceed. Well, Sir, Mr. Marmozet, upon his return to town, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with uncommon complaiſance, and invited me to his lodgings, where he propoſed to communicate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> confeſs, were more unfavourable than I expected; but I anſwered his objections, and, as I thought, brought him over to my opinion; for, on the whole, he ſignified the higheſt approbation of the performance. In the courſe of our diſpute, I was not a little ſurpriſed to find this poor gentleman's memory ſo treacherous as to let him forget what he had ſaid to me before he went out of town, in regard to Earl Sheerwit's opinion of my play, which he now profeſſed himſelf ignorant of; and I was extremely mortified at hearing from his own mouth, that his intereſt with Mr. Vandal was ſo very low, as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient of itſelf, to bring a new piece upon the ſtage. I then begged his advice, and he counſelled me to apply to Earl Sheerwit for a meſſage in my favour to the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who would not preſume to refuſe any thing recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by ſo great a man; and he was ſo kind as to promiſe to ſecond this meſſage with all his power.—I had immediate recourſe to the worthy gentlewoman my friend already mentioned, who opened the channels of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance with ſuch expedition, that in a few days, I had the promiſe of the meſſage, provided I could inſure myſelf of Mr. Vandal's being unengaged to any other author; for his lordſhip did not chuſe to condeſcend ſo far, until he ſhould
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:027715_0448_0FD5EF052AC38668"/>
underſtand that there was a probability, at leaſt, of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. At the ſame time in which I was bleſſed with this piece of news, I was ſtartled at another, by the ſame canal of communication; which was, that Mr. Marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet, before he adviſed me to this application, had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Earl, that he had read my play, and found it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unfit for the ſtage.—Though I could not doubt the certainty of this intelligence, I believed there was ſome miſapprehenſion in the caſe; and without taking any notice of it, told Mr. Marmozet the anſwer I had been, favoured with; upon which he teſtified much joy, and promiſed to aſk Mr. Vandal the queſtion propoſed.—I waited upon him in a day or two, when he gave me to underſtand, that Mr. Vandal having profeſſed himſelf free of all engagements, he had put my play into his hands, and repreſented it as a piece ſtrongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit, who, he aſſured him, would honour him, with a meſſage in its favour; and he deſired me to call for an anſwer at Mr. Vandal's houſe in three days.—I followed his directions, and found the manager, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made acquainted with my buſineſs, owned, that Mr. Marmozet had given him a manuſcript play, but denied that he had mentioned Earl Sheerwit's name.—When I informed him of the circumſtances of the affair, he ſaid he had no engagement with any author: that he would read my tragedy forthwith; and did not believe he ſhould ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to reject it in contradiction to his lordſhip's opinion, for which he had the utmoſt veneration, but put it into rehearſal without loſs of time.—I was ſo much intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this encouragement, that I overlooked the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conduct of Mr. Marmozet, and attended the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at the time appointed, when, to my infinite confuſion, he pronounced my play improper for the ſtage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it accordingly. As ſoon as I could recollect my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the diſorder into which this unexpected refuſal had thrown me, I expreſſed a deſire of hearing his objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were ſo groundleſs, indiſtinct, and unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, that I perſuaded myſelf he had not at all peruſed the piece, but had been prompted by ſomebody, whoſe leſſons he had not rightly retained. However, I have been ſince informed, that the poor man's head, which was not naturally very clear, had been diſordered with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:027715_0449_0FD5EF0C5BFEE2A8"/>
and that he laboured under the tyranny of a wife, and the terrors of hell fire at the ſame time.—Precipitated in this manner from the higheſt pinnacle of hope to the abyſs of deſpondence, I was ready to ſink under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of my affliction; and, in the bitterneſs of my anguiſh, could not help entertaining ſome doubts of Mr. Marmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet's integrity, when I recollected and compared the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his conduct towards me. I was encouraged in this ſuſpicion by being told, that my Lord Sheerwit had ſpoke of his character with great contempt; and in particular reſented his inſolence in oppoſing his own taſte to that of his lordſhip, concerning my tragedy.—While I heſitated between two different opinions of the matter, that friend, who, as I told you before, was a little hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, favoured me with a viſit, and having heard a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial account of the whole affair, could not contain his indignation, but affirmed without ceremony, that Marmozet was the ſole occaſion of my diſappointment; that he had acted from firſt to laſt with the moſt perfidious diſſimulation, cajoling me with inſinuating civilities, while he under-hand employed all his art and influence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the ignorant manager againſt my performance; that nothing could equal his hypocriſy, but his avarice, which engroſſed the faculties of his ſoul ſo much, that he ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled not to be guilty of the meaneſt practices to gratify that ſordid appetite; that, in conſequence of this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he had proſtituted his honour in betraying my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience, and in undermining the intereſt of another author of eſtabliſhed reputation, who had alſo offered a tragedy to the ſtage, which he thought would interfere with the ſucceſs of the comedy he had bought, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bring on at all events.</p>
                     <p>I was ſhocked at the deſcription of ſuch a monſter, which I could not believe exiſted in the world, bad as it is, and argued againſt the aſſeverations of my friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by demonſtrating the bad policy of ſuch behaviour, which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author; and the ſmall temptation that a man of Mr. Marmozet's figure and ſucceſs could have to conſult his intereſt in ſuch a grovelling manner, which muſt create contempt and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of him in his patrons, and effectually deprive him of the countenance and protection he now enjoys in ſuch

an eminent degree. He pretended to laugh at my ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and aſked if I knew for which of his virtues he was ſo much careſſed by the people of faſhion.—"It is not," ſaid he, <q>for the qualities of his heart, that this little paraſite is invited to the tables of dukes and lords, who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment: his avarice they ſee not, his ingratitude they feel not, his hypocriſy accommodates itſelf to their humours, and is of conſequence pleaſing; but he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

who were ſo habituated to falſehood and equivocation, that I verily believe they could not utter one ſyllable of truth, though their lives depended upon their ſincerity. Notwithſtanding all I had ſuffered from the knavery and ſelfiſhneſs of mankind, I was amazed and incenſed at the baſe indifference, which ſuffered ſuch uncommon merit as he poſſeſſed, to languiſh in obſcurity, and ſtruggle with all the miſeries of a loathſome goal, and ſhould have bleſſed the occaſion that ſecluded me from ſuch a perfidious world, had not the remembrance of the amiable Narciſſa preſerved my attachment to that ſociety, of which ſhe conſtituted a part. The picture of that lovely creature was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion of my ſolitude; how often did I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the reſemblance of thoſe enchanting features that firſt captivated my heart! how often did I weep over thoſe endearing ſcenes which her image recalled! and how often did I curſe my perfidious fate, for having robbed me of the fair original! In vain did my imagination flatter me with ſchemes of future happineſs; ſurly reaſon always inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and in a moment overthrew the unſubſtantial fabric by chaſtiſing the extravagance of my hope, and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my unhappy ſituation in the right point of view: in vain did I fly for refuge to the amuſements of the place, and engage in the parties of Jackſon at cards, billiards, nine pins, and fives; a train of melancholy thoughts took poſſeſſion of my ſoul, which even the converſation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoyn could not divert. I ordered Strap to inquire every day at Banter's lodgings, in expectation of hearing again from my charmer, and my diſappointment conſiderably augmented my chagrin. My affectionate valet was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with my ſorrow, and often ſat with me whole hours without ſpeaking, uttering ſigh for ſigh, and ſhedding tear for tear. This fellowſhip increaſed our diſtemper; he became incapable of buſineſs, and was diſcarded by his maſter; while I, ſeeing my money melt away, without any certainty of deliverance, and, in ſhort, all my hopes fruſtrated, grew negligent of life, loſt all appetite, and degenerated into ſuch a ſloven, that, during the ſpace of two months, I was neither waſhed, ſhifted, nor ſhaved; ſo that my face, rendered meagre with abſtinence, was obſcured with dirt, and overſhadowed with hair, and my whole appearance ſqualid, and even frightful, when one

day Strap brought me notice, that there was a man below who wanted to ſpeak with me. Rouſed at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and in full hopes of receiving a letter from the dear object of my love, I ran down ſtairs with the utmoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, and found, to my infinite ſurpriſe, my generous uncle Mr. Bowling! Tranſported at the ſight, I ſprang forward to embrace him: upon which he ſtarted aſide with great agility, drew his hanger, and put himſelf upon his guard, crying, <q>Avaſt, brother, avaſt! ſheer off—Yo ho, you turnkey, why don't you keep a better look out? Here's one of your crazy priſoners broke from his laſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I do ſuppoſe.</q> I could not help laughing heartily at his miſtake, which I ſoon rectified by my voice, that he inſtantly recollected, and ſhook me by the hand with great affection, teſtifying his concern at ſeeing me in ſuch a miſerable condition.</p>
                     <p>I conducted him to my apartment, where, in preſence of Strap, whom I introduced to him as one of my beſt friends, he let me know, that he was juſt arrived from the coaſt of Guinea, after having made a pretty ſucceſsful voyage, in which he had acted as mate, until the ſhip was attacked by a French privateer; that the captain being killed during the engagement, he had taken the command, and was ſo fortunate as to ſink the enemy; after which he ſell in with a merchant-ſhip from Martinico, laden with ſugar, indigo, and ſome ſilver, and, by virtue of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of marque, attacked, took, and brought her ſafe into Kinſale in Ireland, where ſhe was condemned as a lawful prize; by which means he had not only got a pretty ſum of money, but alſo acquired the favour of his owners, who had already conferred upon him the command of a large ſhip, mounted with twenty nine-pounders, ready to ſail upon a very advantageous voyage, which he was not at liberty to diſcover; and he aſſured me, that it was with the greateſt difficulty he had found me, in conſequence of a direction left for him at his lodgings in Wapping.</p>
                     <p>I was rejoiced beyond meaſure at this account of his good fortune, and, at his deſire, recounted all the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that had happened to me ſince we parted. When he underſtood the particulars of Strap's attachment to me, he ſqueezed his hand very cordially, and promiſed to make a man of him; and, giving me ten guineas for my preſent

occaſion, took a direction for the taylor who arreſted me, and went away in order to diſcharge the debt, telling me at parting, that he would ſoon fetch up all my lee-way with a wet ſail.</p>
                     <p>I was utterly confounded at this ſudden tranſition, which affected me more than any reverſe I had formerly felt; and a crowd of incoherent ideas ruſhed ſo impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon my imagination, that my reaſon could neither ſeparate nor connect them—when Strap, whoſe joy had manifeſted itſelf in a thouſand fooleries, came into my room with his ſhaving utenſils, and, without any previous intimation, began to lather my beard, whiſtling with great emotion all the while. I ſtarted from my reverie, and, being too well acquainted with Strap to truſt myſelf in his hands while he was under ſuch agitation, deſired to be excuſed, ſent for another barber, and ſuffered myſelf to be trimmed. Having performed the ceremony of ablution, I ſhifted, and, dreſſing in my gayeſt apparel, waited for the return of my uncle, who was agreeably ſurpriſed at my ſudden transformation.</p>
                     <p>This beneficent kinſman had ſatisfied my creditor, and obtained an order for my diſcharge; ſo that I was no longer a priſoner; but, as I had ſome reluctance to part with my friends and fellows in diſtreſs, I prevailed upon Mr. Bowling to favour us with his company, and invited Mr. Melopoyn and Jackſon to ſpend the evening at my apartment, where I regaled them with a ſupper, good wine, and the news of my releaſe, on which they heartily congratulated me, notwithſtanding the loſs of my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which, they were pleaſed to ſay, they would ſeverely feel. As for Jackſon, his misfortune made ſo little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on himſelf, and he was altogether ſo looſe, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and indiſcreet, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

When our gueſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and my uncle had retired, with an intention to viſit me next morning, I made up a bundle of ſome linen and other neceſſaries, and, bidding Strap carry them to Mr. Melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyn's lodging, went thither myſelf, and preſſed it upon his acceptance, with five guineas, which with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he received, aſſuring me at the ſame time, that he
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:027715_0455_0FD5EF16F3CFD6F8"/>
ſhould never have it in his power to make ſatisfaction. I then aſked if I could ſerve him any other way? to which he anſwered, "You have already done too much;" and, unable to contain the emotions of his ſoul any longer, burſt into tears, and wept aloud. Moved at the ſpectacle, I left him to his repoſe, and, when my uncle returned in the morning, repreſented his character in ſuch a favourable light, that the honeſt ſeaman was affected with his diſtreſs, and determined to follow my example in preſenting him with five pieces more: upon which, that I might ſave him ſome confuſion, I adviſed Mr. Bowling to incloſe it in a letter, to be delivered by Strap after we ſhould be gone.</p>
                     <p>This was accordingly done, I took a formal leave of all my acquaintance in the jail, and juſt as I was about to ſtep into a hackney-coach at the gate, Jackſon calling me, I returned, and he aſked me in a whiſper, if I could lend him a ſhilling? His demand being ſo moderate, and in all likelihood the laſt he would make upon me, I ſlipped a guinea into his hand, which he no ſooner perceived than he cried, "O Jeſus! a guinea!" then, laying hold of a button of my coat, he broke out into an immoderate fit of laughter, and, when his convulſion was ended, told me I was an honeſt fellow, and let me go. The coachman was ordered to drive to Mr. Bowling's lodging, where, when we arrived, he entered into a ſerious diſcourſe with me on the ſubject of my ſituation, and he propoſed, that I ſhould ſail with him in quality of his ſurgeon, in which caſe he would put me in a method of getting a fortune in a few years by my own induſtry, and aſſured me, that I might expect to inherit all that he ſhould die poſſeſſed of, provided I ſhould ſurvive him. Though I was penetrated with a ſenſe of his gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">

I was piqued at this inſinuation, which I looked upon as a reproach, and, without giving

myſelf time to deliberate, accepted his offer. He was overjoyed at my compliance, carried me immediately to his chief owner, with whom a bargain was ſtruck, ſo that I could not retract with honour, had I been ever ſo much averſe to the agreement. That I might not have time to cool, he bid me draw out a liſt of medicines, for a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of five hundred men, adapted to the diſtempers of hot climates, and ſufficient for a voyage of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, and carry it to a certain wholeſale apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, who would alſo provide me in two well-qualified mates. While I was thus employed, Strap came in, and looked very blank, when he underſtood my reſolution; however, after a pauſe of ſome minutes, he inſiſted upon going along with me, and, at my deſire, was made ſhip's ſteward by Captain Bowling, who promiſed to be at the expence of fitting him out, and to lend him two hundred pounds to purchaſe an adventure.</p>
                     <p>When I had delivered my liſt of medicines, choſen a couple of my own countrymen for mates, and beſpoke a ſet of chirurgical inſtruments, my uncle told me, that by his laſt voyage he had cleared almoſt three thouſand pounds, one thouſand of which he would immediately make over, and put into my hands; that he would procure me credit to the value of as much more in ſuch goods as would turn to beſt account in the country to which we were bound; and that, although he looked upon my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt as his own, he would keep the remaining part of his fortune in his own diſpoſal, with a view of preſerving his independence, and the power of puniſhing me, in caſe I ſhould not make a good uſe of what he had already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon me.</p>
                     <p>Without troubling the reader with an account of the effect which this ſurpriſing generoſity had upon my mind, I ſhall only ſay, that his promiſes were inſtantly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an invoice of merchandiſe proper for the voyage preſented to me, that I might purchaſe the goods, and ſhip them with all expedition. In the midſt of this hurry the remembrance of my charming Narciſſa often interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and made me the moſt miſerable of all mortals. I was diſtracted with the thought of being torn from her perhaps for ever; and, though the hope of ſeeing her again might have ſupported me under the torments of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,

I could not reflect upon the anguiſh ſhe muſt feel at parting with me, and the inceſſant ſorrows to which her tender boſom ſhould be expoſed during my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, without being pierced with the deepeſt affliction! As my imagination was daily and nightly upon the rack to invent ſome method of mitigating this cruel ſtroke, or at leaſt of acquitting my love and honour in the opinion of that gentle creature, I at length ſtumbled upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, with which the reader will be made acquainted in due time, and, in conſequence of my determination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs uneaſy and diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>My buſineſs being finiſhed, and the ſhip ready to ſail, I reſolved to make my laſt appearance among my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the other end of the town, where I had not been ſince my impriſonment; and as I had, by the advice of my uncle, taken off ſome very rich clothes for ſale, I put on the gayeſt ſuit in my poſſeſſion, and went in a chair to the coffee-houſe I uſed to frequent, where I found my friend Banter ſo confounded at the magnificence of my dreſs, that, when I made up to him, he gazed at me with a look of aſtoniſhment, without being able for ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes to open his lips—then pulling me aſide by the ſleeve, and fixing his eyes on mine, accoſted me in this manner: <q>Random, where the devil have you been! eh?—What is the meaning of all this finery?—Oho! I underſtand you—you are juſt arrived from the country! What! the roads are good, eh?—Well, Random, you are a bold fellow, and a lucky fellow!—but take care; the pitcher goes often to the well, but is broke at laſt.</q> So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he pointed to his collar, by which geſture, and the broken hints he had ejaculated, I found he ſuſpected me of having robbed on the highway, and I laughed very heartily at his ſuppoſition. Without explaining myſelf any farther, I told him he was miſtaken in his conjecture; that I had been for ſome time paſt with the relation of whom he had frequently heard me ſpeak, and that as I ſhould ſet out next day upon my travels, I had come thither to take my leave of my friends, and to receive of him the money he had borrowed from me, which, now that I was going abroad, I ſhould have occaſion for. He was a little diſconcerted at this demand, but, recollecting himſelf in a moment, ſwore in an affected paſſion, that I had uſed

him extremely ill, and he would never forgive me for having, by this ſhort warning, put it out of his power to free himſelf of an obligation he could no longer bear. I could not help ſmiling at this pretended delicacy, which I commended highly, telling him he needed not be uneaſy on that ſcore; for I would give him a direction to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in the city, with whom I would leave a diſcharge for the ſum, to be delivered on payment. He profeſſed much joy at this expedient, and with great eagerneſs aſked the perſon's name and place of abode, which he forthwith wrote in his pocket-book, aſſuring me, that he ſhould not be long in my debt. This affair, which I knew he would never after think of, being ſettled to his ſatisfaction, I ſent cards to all my friends, deſiring the favour of their company at a tavern in the evening, when they honoured my invitation, and I had the pleaſure of treating them in a very elegant manner, at which they expreſſed as much admiration as applauſe. Having enjoyed ourſelves till midnight, I took my leave of them all, being well nigh ſtifled with careſſes; and next day I ſet out with Strap in a poſt-chaiſe for Graveſend, where we went on board, and, the wind ſerving, weighed anchor in leſs than twelve hours. Without meeting with any accident, we got as far as the Downs, where we were obliged to come to an anchor, and wait for an eaſterly wind to carry us out of the channel.</p>

to remain in the Downs until he ſhould receive ſome diſpatches from London, which he did not expect in leſs than a week. Having imparted my reſolution to my truſty valet, who (though he endeavoured to diſſuade me from ſuch a raſh undertaking) would not quit me in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, I hired horſes, and ſet out immediately for that part of Suſſex where my charmer was confined, which was not above thirty miles diſtant from Deal, where we mounted. As I was perfectly well acquainted with the extent of the ſquire's eſtate and influence, I halted within five miles of his houſe, where we remained till the twilight, at which time we ſet forward, and, by the favour of a dark night, gained a copſe about half a mile from the village where Mrs. Sagely lived. Here we left our horſes tied to a tree, and went directly to the houſe of my old benefactreſs, Strap trembling all the way, and venting ejaculatory pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to Heaven for our ſafety. Her habitation being quite ſolitary, we arrived at the door without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when I ordered my companion to enter by himſelf, and, in caſe there ſhould be company with her, deliver a letter which I had wrote for that purpoſe, and ſay that a friend of her's in London, underſtanding that he intended to travel this road, had committed it to his care.

This he inſtantly performed; and ſhe no ſooner read the contents, which ſpecified my being preſent, than ſhe cried, <q>If the perſon who wrote this letter be at hand, let him ſpeak, that I may be aſſured by his voice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not I may ſafely admit him.</q> I forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied my mouth to the key-hole, and pronounced, <q>Dear mother, you need not be afraid; it is I, ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your goodneſs, who now crave admittance.</q> She knew my voice, and, opening the door immediately, received me with a truly maternal affection, manifeſting, by the tears ſhe let fall, her concern leſt I ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; for ſhe had been informed of every thing that

had happened between Narciſſa and me from the dear cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive's own mouth. When I explained the motive of my journey, which was no other than a deſire of ſeeing the object of my love before I ſhould quit the kingdom, that I might in perſon convince her of the neceſſity I was under to leave her, reconcile her to that event by deſcribing the advantages that in all probability would attend it, repeat my vows of eternal conſtancy, and enjoy the melancholy pleaſure of a tender embrace at parting—I ſay, when I had thus ſignified my intention, Mrs. Sagely told me, that Narciſſa, upon her return from Bath, had been ſo ſtrictly watched, that nobody but one or two of the ſervants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to her brother, were admitted to her preſence; that afterwards ſhe had been a little enlarged, and was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee company, during which indulgence ſhe had been ſeveral times at her cottage; but of late ſhe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by one of the ſervants, who diſcovered to the ſquire, that he had once carried a letter from her to the poſt-houſe directed to me; upon which information ſhe was now more confined than ever; and that I could have no chance of ſeeing her, unleſs I would run the riſk of getting into the garden, where ſhe and her maid were every day allowed to take the air, and lie hid until I ſhould have an opportunity of ſpeaking to them—an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture which would be attended with ſuch danger, that no man in his right wits would attempt it. This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, hazardous as it was, I reſolved to perform, in ſpite of all the arguments of Mrs. Sagely, who reaſoned, chid, and entreated by turns, and the tears and prayers of Strap, who conjured me on his knees to have more regard to myſelf, as well as to him, than to tempt my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in ſuch a precipitate manner. I was deaf to every thing but the ſuggeſtions of my love, and ordered him to return immediately with the horſes to the inn from whence we ſet out, and wait for my coming in that place: he at firſt peremptorily refuſed to leave me, until I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him, that, if our horſes ſhould remain where they were till day-light, they would certainly be diſcovered, and the whole country alarmed. On this conſideration he took leave of me in a ſorrowful plight, kiſſed my hand, and, weeping, cried, <q>God knows if ever I ſhall ſee you again.</q> My kind landlady, finding me obſtinate, gave

Early in the morning I got up, and, armed with a couple of loaded piſtols and a hanger, went to the back of the ſquire's garden, climbed over the wall, and, according to Mrs. Sagely's direction, con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Here I remained from five o'clock in the morning to ſix in the evening, without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a human creature; at laſt I perceived two women ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, whom by my throbbing heart I ſoon recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to be the adorable Narciſſa and Miſs Williams. I felt the ſtrongeſt agitation of ſoul at the ſight, and, gueſſing that they would repoſe themſelves in the alcove, I ſtepped into it unperceived, and laid upon the ſtone-table a picture of myſelf in miniature, for which I had ſat in London, purpoſing to leave it with Narciſſa before I ſhould go abroad. I expoſed it in this manner as an introduction to my own appearance, which, without ſome previous inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I was afraid might have an unlucky effect upon the delicate nerves of my fair enſlaver, and then withdrew into the thicket, where I could hear their diſcourſe, and ſuit myſelf to the circumſtances of the occaſion. As they advanced, I obſerved an air of melancholy in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Narciſſa, blended with ſuch unſpeakable ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I could ſcarce refrain from flying into her arms, and kiſſing away the pearly drop that ſtood collected in each bewitching eye. According to my expectation, ſhe entered the alcove, and, perceiving ſomething on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, took it up. No ſooner did ſhe caſt her eye upon the features than, ſtartled at the reſemblance, ſhe cried, "Gracious God!" and the roſes inſtantly vaniſhed from her cheeks. Her confidante, alarmed at this exclamation, looked at the picture, and, ſtruck with the likeneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "O Jeſus! the very features of Mr. Random! Narciſſa having recollected herſelf a little, ſaid, <q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever angel brought it hither as a comfort to me in my affliction, I am thankful for the benefit, and will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it as the deareſt object of my care.</q> So ſaying, ſhe kiſſed it with ſurpriſing ardour, ſhed a flood of tears,

                     <p>I am afraid I have already encroached upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's patience, with the particulars of this amour, on which, (I own,) I cannot help being impertinently cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial. I ſhall therefore omit the leſs material paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this interview, during which I convinced her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though I could not appeaſe the ſad preſages of her love, with regard to the long voyage and dangers I muſt undergo.—When we had ſpent an hour, (which was all ſhe could ſpare from the barbarity of her brother's vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,) in lamenting over our hard fate, and in repeating our reciprocal vows, Miſs Williams reminded us of the neceſſity there was for our immediate parting; and ſure, lovers never parted with ſuch ſorrow and reluctance as we. But becauſe my words are incapable of doing juſtice to that affecting circumſtance, I am obliged to draw a veil over it, and obſerve, that I returned in the dark to the houſe of Mrs. Sagely, who was overjoyed to hear of my ſucceſs, and oppoſed the tumults of my grief with ſuch
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:027715_0463_0FD5EF2AE4D08F80"/>
ſtrength of reaſon, that my mind regained in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure its tranquility; and that very night, after having forced upon this good gentlewoman a purſe of twenty guineas, as a token of my gratitude and eſteem, I took leave of her, ſet out on foot for the inn, where my arrival freed honeſt Strap from the horrors of unutterable dread.</p>
                     <p>We took horſe immediately, and alighted early next morning at Deal, where I found my uncle in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern on account of my abſence, becauſe he had received his diſpatches, and muſt have weighed with the firſt fair wind, whether I had been on board or not.—Next day a briſk eaſterly gale ſpringing up, we ſet ſail, and in eight and forty hours got clear of the channel.</p>
                     <p>When we were about 200 leagues from the Land's-end, the captain taking me apart into his cabin, told me, that, now he was permitted by his inſtructions, he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the intent and deſtination of our voyage: <q>The ſhip,</q> ſaid he, <q>which has been fitted out at a great expence, is bound for the coaſt of Guinea, where we ſhall exchange part of our cargo for ſlaves and gold duſt; from thence we will tranſport our negroes to Buenos Ayres in New-Spain, where, (by virtue of paſſports obtained from our own court, and that of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,) we will diſpoſe of them and the goods that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on board for ſilver, by means of our ſupercargo, who is perfectly well acquainted with the coaſt, the lingo and inhabitants.</q>—Being thus let into the ſecret of our expedition, I borrowed of the ſupercargo a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh grammar, dictionary, and ſome other books of the ſame language, which I ſtudied with ſuch application, that before we arrived in New-Spain, I could maintain a converſation with him in that tongue.—Being arrived in the warm latitudes, I ordered, (with the captain's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,) the whole ſhip's company to be blooded and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, myſelf undergoing the ſame evacuation, in order to prevent thoſe dangerous fevers, to which northern conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are ſubject in hot climates; and I have reaſon to believe that this precaution was not unſerviceable, for we loſt but one ſailor during our whole paſſage to the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>One day, when we had been about five weeks at ſea, we deſcried to windward a large ſhip bearing down upon us with all the ſail ſhe could carry. Upon which my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:027715_0464_0FD5EF2BD9C8F3C0"/>
ordered the ſtudding-ſails to be hoiſted, and the ſhip to be cleared for engaging; but finding, that (to uſe the ſeaman's phraſe) we were very much wronged by the ſhip that had us in chaſe, and which by this time had hoiſted French colours, he commanded the ſtudding-ſails to be taken in, the courſes to be clewed up, the main top-ſail to be backed, the tompions to be taken out of the guns, and every man to repair to his quarters. While every body was buſied in the performance of theſe orders, Strap came upon the quarter-deck, trembling, and looking aghaſt, and, with a voice half ſuppreſſed by fear, aſked if I thought we were a match for the veſſel in purſuit of us. Obſerving his conſternation, I ſaid, <q>What? are you afraid, Strap? Afraid!</q> he replied, <q>n-n-no, what ſhould I be afraid of? I thank God I have a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;—but I believe it will be a bloody battle, and I wiſh you may not have occaſion for another hand to aſſiſt you in the cock-pit.</q>—I immediately perceived his drift, and making the captain acquainted with his ſituation, deſired he might be ſtationed below with me and my mates. My uncle, incenſed at his puſillanimity, bid me ſend him down inſtantly, that his fear might not infect the ſhip's company: whereupon I told the poor ſteward, that I had begged him for an aſſiſtant, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to go down, and help my mates to get ready the inſtruments and dreſſings.—Notwithſtanding the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he muſt have felt at theſe tidings, he affected a ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of quitting the upper-deck; and ſaid, he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do his duty above board, for he believed himſelf as well prepared for death as any man in the ſhip, no diſparagement to me or the captain.—I was diſguſted at this affectation, and, in order to puniſh his hypocriſy, aſſured him he might take his choice either of going down to the cock-pit with me, or of ſtaying upon deck during the engagement. Alarmed at this indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he replied, <q>Well, to oblige you, I'll go down, but remember it is more for your ſake than my own.</q> So ſaying, he diſappeared in a twinkling, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an anſwer.—By this time we could obſerve two tier of guns in the ſhip which purſued us, and which was now but two ſhort miles aſtern. This diſcovery had an evident effect upon the ſailors, who did not ſcruple to ſay,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:027715_0465_0FD5EF2DD630C940"/>
that we ſhould be torn to pieces, and blown out of the water, and that if in caſe any of them ſhould loſe their precious limbs, they muſt go a begging for life, for there was no proviſion made by the merchants for thoſe poor ſouls who are maimed in their ſervice. The captain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding this backwardneſs, ordered the crew abaft, and ſpoke to them thus: <q>My lads I am told you hang an a—ſe.—I have gone to ſea thirty years, man and boy, and never ſaw Engliſh ſailors afraid before.—Mayhap you think I want to expoſe you for the lucre of gain.—Whoſoever thinks ſo, thinks a damned lie, for my whole cargo is inſured; ſo that in caſe I ſhould be taken, my loſs will not be great.—The enemy is ſtronger than we, to be ſure—What then? have we not a chance for carrying away one of her maſts, and ſo get clear of her?—If we find her too hard for us, 'tis but ſtriking at laſt.—If any man is hurt in the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I promiſe, on the word of an honeſt ſeaman, to make him a recompence, according to his loſs.—So now, you that are lazy, lubberly, cowardly dogs, get away, and ſculk in the hold and bread-room; and you that are jolly boys, ſtand by me, and let us give one broad-ſide for the honour of old England.</q> This elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent harangue was ſo well adapted to the diſpoſition of his hearers, that one and all of them, pulling off their hats, waved them over their heads, and ſaluted him with three cheers: upon which he ſent his boy for two large caſe bottles of brandy, and having treated every man with a dram, they repaired to their quarters, and waited im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently for the word of command.—I muſt do my uncle the juſtice to ſay, that in the whole of his diſpoſition, he behaved with the utmoſt intrepidity, conduct, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.—The enemy being very near, he ordered me to my ſtation, and was juſt going to give the word for hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colours, and firing, when the ſuppoſed French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hauled down his white pennant, jack, and enſign, hoiſted Engliſh ones, and fired a gun a head of us: this was a joyful event to Captain Bowling, who immediately ſhewed his colours, and fired a gun to leeward: upon which the other ſhip ran along-ſide of him, hailed him, and giving him to know, that ſhe was an Engliſh man of war of forty guns, ordered him to hoiſt out his boat, and
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:027715_0466_0FD5EF31D6F190D0"/>
come on board.—This he performed with the more ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity, becauſe, upon inquiry, he found that ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by an old meſs-mate of his, who was overjoyed to ſee him, detained him to dinner, and ſent his barge for the ſupercargo and me, who were very much careſſed on his account.—As this commander was deſtined to cruize upon the French coaſt, in the latitude of Martinico, his ſtem and quarters were adorned with white fluers-de-lis, and the whole ſhell of the ſhip ſo much diſguiſed, for a decoy to the enemy, that it was no wonder my uncle did not know her, although he had ſailed on board of her many years—We kept company with her four days, during which time the captains were never aſunder, and then parted, our courſe lying different from hers.</p>
                     <p>In leſs than a fortnight after, we made the land of Guinea, near the mouth of the river Gambia, and trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the coaſt as far to the ſouthward of the Line as Angola and Bengula, in leſs than ſix months diſpoſed of the greateſt part of our cargo, and purchaſed four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred negroes, my adventure having been laid out chiefly in gold duſt.</p>
                     <p>Our complement being made up, we took our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Cape Negro, and arrived in the Rio de la Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta in ſix weeks, having met with nothing remarkable in our voyage, except an epidemic fever, not unlike the jail diſtemper, which broke out among our ſlaves, and carried off a good many of the ſhip's company; among whom I loſt one of my mates, and poor Strap had well nigh given up the ghoſt.—Having produced our paſſport to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh governor, we were received with great courteſy, ſold our ſlaves in a very few days, and could have out off five times the number at our own price; being obliged to ſmuggle the reſt of our merchandize, conſiſting of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean bale goods, which, however, we made ſhift to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of at a great advantage.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>I am invited to the villa of a Spaniſh don, where we meet with an Engliſh gentleman, and make a very intereſting diſcovery—we leave Buenos Ayres, and arrive at Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>OUR ſhip being freed from the diſagreeable lading of Negroes, to whom, indeed, I had been a miſerable ſlave, ſince our leaving the coaſt of Guinea, I began to enjoy myſelf and breathe with pleaſure the air of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guay; this part of which is reckoned the Montpelier of South America, and has obtained, on account of its cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the name of Buenos Ayres.—It was in this delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place that I gave myſelf entirely up to the thoughts of my dear Narciſſa, whoſe image ſtill kept full poſſeſſion of my breaſt, and whoſe charms, enhanced by abſence, appeared to my imagination, if poſſible, more engaging than ever! I calculated the profits of my voyage, which even exceeded my expectation; reſolved to purchaſe a handſome ſinecure upon my arrival in England, and if I ſhould find the ſquire as averſe to me as ever, marry his ſiſter by ſtealth; and, in caſe our family ſhould increaſe, rely upon the generoſity of my uncle, who was by this time worth a conſiderable ſum.</p>
                     <p>While I amuſed myſelf with theſe agreeable projects, and the tranſporting hopes of enjoying Narciſſa, we were very much careſſed by the Spaniſh gentlemen, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently formed parties of pleaſure for our entertainment, in which we made excurſions a good way into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Among thoſe who ſignalized themſelves by their civility to us, there was one Don Antonio de Ribera, a very polite young gentleman, with whom I had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an intimate friendſhip, who invited us one day to his country houſe, and, as a further inducement to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, promiſed to procure for us the company of an Engliſh ſignor, who had been ſettled in thoſe parts many years, and acquired the love and eſteem of the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, by his affability, good ſenſe, and honourable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                     <p>We accepted his invitation, and ſet out for his Villa,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:027715_0468_0FD5EF38B70F0438"/>
where we had not been longer than an hour, when the perſon arrived, in whoſe favour I had been ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed.—He was a tall man, remarkably well ſhaped, of a fine mien and appearance, commanding reſpect, and ſeemed to be turned of forty; the features of his face were ſaddened with a reſerve and gravity, which in other countries would have been thought the effect of melancholy; but here, appeared to have been contracted by his commerce with the Spaniards, who are remarkable for that ſeverity of countenance. Underſtanding from Don Antonio that we were his countrymen, he ſaluted us all round very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſantly, and fixing his eyes attentively on me, uttered a deep ſigh.—I had been ſtruck with a profound venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him at his firſt coming into the room; and no ſooner obſerved this expreſſion of ſorrow, directed, as it were, in a particular manner to me, than my heart took part in his grief; I ſympathized involuntarily, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my turn. Having aſked leave of our entertainer, he accoſted us in Engliſh, profeſſed his ſatisfaction at ſeeing ſo many of his countrymen in ſuch a remote place, and aſked the captain, who went by the name of Signor Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, from what part of Britain he ſailed, and whither he was bound.—My uncle told him that we had ſailed from the river Thames, and were bound for the ſame place, by the way of Jamaica, where he intended to take in a lading of ſugar.</p>
                     <p>Having ſatisfied himſelf in theſe and other particulars about the ſtate of the war, he gave us to underſtand, that he had a longing deſire to reviſit his native country, in conſequence of which he had already tranſmitted to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope the greateſt part of his fortune in neutral bottoms, and would willingly embark the reſt of it with himſelf in our ſhip, provided the captain had no objection to ſuch a paſſenger.—My uncle very prudently replied, that for his part, he ſhould be glad of his company, if he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the conſent of the governor, without which he durſt not admit him on board, whatever inclination he had to oblige him.—The gentleman approved of his diſcretion, and telling him, that there would be no difficulty in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the connivance of the governor, who was his good friend, ſhifted the converſation to another ſubject.</p>
                     <p>I was overjoyed to hear his intention, and already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:027715_0469_0FD5EF3A548D0838"/>
myſelf ſo much in his favour, that had he been diſappointed, I ſhould have been very unhappy; in the courſe of our entertainment, he eyed me with an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon attachment; I felt a ſurpriſing attraction towards him; when he ſpoke, I liſtened with attention and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; the dignity of his deportment filled me with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and awe; and, in ſhort, the emotions of my ſoul, in the preſence of this ſtranger, were ſtrong and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpent the beſt part of the day with us, he took his leave, telling Captain Thoma, that he ſhould hear from him in a ſhort time. He was no ſooner gone, than I aſked a thouſand queſtions about him of Don Antonio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who could give me no other ſatisfaction, than that his name was Don Rodrigo, that he had lived fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years in theſe parts, was reputed rich, and ſuppoſed to have been unfortunate in his younger years, becauſe he was obſerved to nouriſh a penſive melancholy, even from the time of his firſt ſettlement among them; but that no body had ventured to enquire into the cauſe of his ſorrow, in conſideration of his peace, which might ſuffer in the recapitulation of his misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>I was ſeized with an irreſiſtible deſire of knowing the particulars of his fate, and enjoyed not an hour of repoſe during the whole night, by reaſon of the eager concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that inſpired me, with regard to his ſtory, which I reſolved (if poſſible) to learn.—Next morning, while we were at breakfaſt, three mules, richly capariſoned, arrived, with a meſſage from Don Rodrigo, deſiring our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and that of Don Antonio at his houſe, which was ſituated about ten miles further up the country.—I was pleaſed with this invitation, in conſequence of which we mounted the mules which he had provided for us, and alighted at his houſe before noon.—Here we were ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly entertained by the generous ſtranger, who ſtill ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhew a particular regard for me, and after dinner made me a preſent of a ring ſet with a beautiful amethyſt, the production of that country, ſaying, at the ſame time, that he was once bleſſed with a ſon, who, had he lived, would have been nearly of my age. This obſervation, delivered with a profound ſigh, made my heart throb with violence; a crowd of confuſed ideas ruſhed upon my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:027715_0470_0FD5EF3CAA5CD940"/>
which while I endeavoured to unravel, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle perceived my abſence of thought, and, tapping me on the ſhoulder, ſaid, "Oons! are you aſleep, Rory!" Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had time to reply, Don Rodrigo, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common eagerneſs of voice and look, pronounced, <q>Pray, captain, what is the young gentleman's name?</q>—"His name," ſaid my uncle, "is Roderick Random."—"Gracious powers!" cried the ſtranger, ſtarting up,—"And his mother's?" "His mother," anſwered the captain, amazed, "was called Charlotte Bowling."—"O bounteous Heaven!" exclaimed Don Rodrigo, ſpringing acroſs the table, and claſping me in his arms, <q>my ſon! my ſon! have I found thee again? Do I hold thee in my embrace, after having loſt and deſpaired of ſeeing thee ſo long?</q> So ſaying, he ſell upon my neck, and wept aloud with joy; while the power of nature operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrongly in my breaſt, I was loſt in rapture, and while he preſſed me to his heart, let fall a ſhower of tears in his boſom. His utterance was choaked up a good while, by the agitation of his ſoul; at length he broke out into, <q>Myſterious Providence!—O my dear Charlotte! there yet remains a pledge of our love! and ſuch a pledge—ſo found!—O infinite goodneſs! let me adore thy all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe decrees!</q> Having thus expreſſed himſelf, he kneeled upon the floor, li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>My requeſt was inſtantly complied with, and a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with a ſpare mule, detached to the ſhip, carrying or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the captain to the mate to ſend the ſteward by the bearer. My health being in the mean time re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and my mind compoſed, I began to reliſh this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant turn of my fortune, in reflecting upon the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages with which it muſt be attended; and, as the idea of my lovely Narciſſa always joined itſelf to every ſcene of happineſs I could imagine, I entertained myſelf now with the proſpect of poſſeſſing her in that diſtinguiſhed ſphere

to which ſhe was entitled by her birth and qualifications. Having often mentioned her name while I was deprived of my ſenſes, my father gueſſed, that there was an intimate connection between us, and, diſcovering the picture which hung in my boſom by a ribbon, did not doubt that it was the reſemblance of my amiable miſtreſs: in this belief he was confirmed by my uncle, who told him it was the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a young woman to whom I was under promiſe of marriage. Alarmed at this piece of information, Don Rodrigo took the firſt opportunity of queſtioning me about the circumſtances of this affair, which, when I had candidly recounted, he approved of my paſſion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to contribute all in his power towards its ſucceſs: though I never doubted his generoſity, I was tranſported on this occaſion, and, throwing myſelf at his feet, told him, he had now completed my happineſs; for, without the poſſeſſion of Narciſſa, I ſhould be miſerable among all the pleaſures of life. He raiſed me with a ſmile of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fondneſs, ſaid, he knew what it was to be in love, and obſerved, that, if he had been as tenderly beloved by his father as I was by mine, he would not now perhaps have cauſe.—Here he was interrupted by a ſigh, the tears ſtood collected in his eyes, he ſuppreſſed the dictates of his grief, and, the time being opportune, deſired me to relate the paſſages of my life, which my uncle had told him were manifold and ſurpriſing. I recounted the moſt material circumſtances of my fortune, to which he liſtened with wonder and attention, manifeſting from time to time thoſe different emotions which my different ſituations may be ſuppoſed to have raiſed in a parent's breaſt, and, when my detail was ended, bleſſed God for the adverſity I had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone, which, he ſaid, enlarged the underſtanding, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the heart, ſteeled the conſtitution, and qualified a young man for all the duties and enjoyments of life much better than any education which affluence could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>When I had thus ſatisfied his curioſity, I diſcovered an inclination to hear the particulars of his ſtory, which he gratified by beginning with his marriage, and proceeded to the day of his diſappearing, as I have related in the firſt part of my memoirs.

loſt through the barbarity of an unnatural parent, I took my leave of you, my child, then an infant, with an heart full of unutterable woe, but little ſuſpecting, that my father's unkindneſs would have deſcended to my innocent orphan; and, ſetting out alone at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night for the neareſt ſea-port, early next morning got on board a ſhip, bound (as I heard) for France, and, bargaining with the maſter for my paſſage, bid a long adieu to my native country, and put to ſea with the firſt fair wind. The place of our deſtination was Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville; but we had the misfortune to run upon a ridge of rocks near the iſland of Alderney, called the Caſkets, where the ſea running high, the ſhip went to pieces, the boat ſunk along-ſide, and every ſoul on board pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed except myſelf, who by the aſſiſtance of a grating got aſhore on the coaſt of Normandy: I went directly to Caen, where I was ſo lucky as to meet with a count whom I had formerly known in my travels: with this gentleman I ſet out for Paris, where I was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by him and other friends, as tutor to a young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, whom I accompanied to the court of Spain.

I could not reſt ſatisfied with this imperfect information, and, though the hope of finding you was but languid, reſolved to go in queſt of you in perſon; for which purpoſe I have remitted to Holland the value of twenty thouſand pounds, and am in poſſeſſion of fifteen thouſand more, with which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to embark myſelf on board of Captain Bowling, before I diſcovered this amazing ſtroke of Providence, which you may be ſure has not altered my intention.</q>

                     <p>My father, having entertained us with this agreeable ſketch of his life, withdrew in order to relieve Don Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio, who in his abſence had done the honours of his houſe; and I was juſt dreſſed for my appearance among the gueſts, when Strap arrived from the ſhip.</p>

Never was rapture more ludicrouſly expreſſed than in the behaviour of this worthy creature, who cried, laughed, whiſtled, ſung, and danced, all in a breath; his tranſport was ſcarce over when my father entered, who no ſooner underſtood that this was Strap than he took him

                     <p>I INQUIRED, as ſoon as I got aſhore, about my gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous companion Mr. Thomſon, and hearing that he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a flouriſhing condition upon the eſtate left to him by

his wife's father, who had been dead ſome years, I took horſe immediately, with the conſent of Don Rodrigo, who had heard me mention him with great regard, and in a few hours reached the place of his habitation.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould much wrong the delicacy of Mr. Thomſon's ſentiments to ſay barely, he was glad to ſee me: he felt all that the moſt ſenſible and diſintereſted friendſhip could feel on this occaſion, introduced me to his wife, a very amiable young lady, who had already bleſſed him with two fine children; and, being as yet ignorant of my cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, frankly offered me the aſſiſtance of his purſe and intereſt. I thanked him for his generous intention, and made him acquainted with my ſituation, on which he congratulated me with great joy, and, after I had ſtaid with him a whole day and night, accompanied me back to Kingſton to wait upon my father, whom he invited to his houſe: Don Rodrigo complied with his requeſt, and, having been handſomely entertained during the ſpace of a week, returned extremely well ſatisfied with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of my friend and his lady, to whom at parting, he preſented a very valuable diamond ring as a token of his eſteem. During the courſe of my converſation with Mr. Thomſon, he let me know, that his and my old commander, Captain Oakhum, was dead ſome months, and that, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his death, a diſcovery had been made of ſome valuable effects that he had feloniouſly ſecreted out of a prize by the aſſiſtance of Dr. Macſhane, who was now actually in priſon on that account, and, being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of friends, ſubſiſted ſolely on the charity of my friend, whoſe bounty he had implored in the moſt abject manner, after having been the barbarous occaſion of driving him to that terrible extremity on board the Thunder, which I have formerly related. Whatſoever this wretch might have been guilty of, I applauded Mr. Thomſon's genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity towards him in his diſtreſs, which wrought ſo much upon me alſo, that I ſent him ten piſtoles, in ſuch a private manner that he could never know his benefactor.</p>
                     <p>While my father and I were careſſed among the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on ſhore, Captain Bowling had wrote to his owners by the packet, which ſailed a few days after our arrival, ſignifying his proſperous voyage hitherto, and deſiring them to inſure his ſhip and cargo homeward bound; after

which he applied himſelf ſo heartily to the loading his ſhip, that, with the aſſiſtance of Mr. Thomſon, ſhe was full in leſs than ſix weeks. This kind gentleman likewiſe procured for Don Rodrigo bills upon London for the greateſt part of his gold and ſilver, by which means it was ſecured againſt the riſk of the ſeas and the enemy; and, before we ſailed, ſupplied us with ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Every thing being ready, we took our leave of our kind entertainers, and going on board at Port Royal, ſet ſail for England on the firſt of June.—We beat up to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with fine eaſy weather; and one night believing ourſelves near Cape Tiberoon, lay to, with an intention to wood and water next morning in the bay: while we remained in this ſituation, a ſailor having drank more new rum than he could carry, ſtaggered overboard, and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the means that could be uſed to preſerve him, went to the bottom, and diſappeared. About two hours after this melancholy accident happened, as I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the cool air on the quarter-deck, I heard a voice riſing, as it were, out of the ſea, and calling, <q>Ho, the ſhip, a hoy!</q> Upon which one of the men upon the forecaſtle cried, <q>I'll be d—d'd, if that an't Jack Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſpike, who went overboard!</q> Not a little ſurpriſed at this event, I jumped into the boat that lay along-ſide, with the ſecond mate and four men, and rowing towards the place, from whence the voice (which repeated the hail,) ſeemed to proceed, we perceived ſomething floating upon the water; when we had rowed a little farther, we diſcerned it to be a man riding upon a hen-coop, who, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us approach, pronounced with a hoarſe voice, <q>D—n your bloods! why did you not anſwer when I hailed?</q> Our mate, who was a veritable ſeaman, hearing this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, ſaid, <q>By G—d, my lads, this is none of our man—This is the devil—pull away for the ſhip.</q> The fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows obeyed his command without queſtion, and were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſome fathoms on our return, when I inſiſted on their taking up the poor creature, and prevailed upon them to go back to the wreck, which, when we came near the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and ſignified our intention, we received an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of, "Avaſt, avaſt—what ſhip, brother?" Being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:027715_0478_0FD5EF4F35DB4AE0"/>
in this particular, he cried, <q>D—n the ſhip, I was in hopes it had been my own—where are you bound?</q> We gratified his curioſity in this too; upon which he ſuffered himſelf to be taken on board, and after being comforted with a dram, told us, he belonged to the Veſuvio man of war, upon a cruize off the iſland of Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola; that he had fallen over-board about four and twenty hours ago, and the ſhip being under ſail, they did not chuſe to bring to, but toſſed a hen-coop over-board for his convenience, upon which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning; howſomever, he was as well content to be aboard of us, becauſe he did not doubt but that we ſhould meet his ſhip; and if he had gone aſhore on the bay, he might have been taken priſoner by the French.—My uncle and father were very much divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the account of this fellow's unconcerned beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and in two days meeting with the Veſuvio, as he expected, ſent him on board of her according to his deſire.</p>
                     <p>Having beat up ſucceſsfully the windward paſſage, we ſtretched to the northward, and falling in with a weſterly wind, in eight weeks arrived in ſoundings, and in two days after made the Lizard.—It is impoſſible to expreſs the joy I felt at the ſight of Engliſh ground! Don Rodrigo was not unmoved, and Strap ſhed tears of gladneſs.—The ſailors profited by our ſatisfaction; the ſhoe that was nailed to the maſt, being quite filled with our liberality.—My uncle reſolved to run into the Downs at once; but the wind ſhifting when we were a-breaſt of the iſle of Wight, he was obliged to turn into St. Helens, and come to an anchor at Spithead, to the great mortification of the crew, thirty of whom were immediately preſſed on board of a man of war.</p>
                     <p>My father and I went aſhore immediately at Portſmouth, leaving Strap with the captain to go round with the ſhip, and take care of our effects; and I diſcovered ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to ſee my charming Narciſſa, that my father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to ride acroſs the country to her brother's houſe, while he ſhould hire a poſt-chaiſe for London, where he ſhould wait for me at a place to which I directed him.</p>
                     <p>Fired with all the eagerneſs of paſſion, I took poſt that very night, and in the morning reached an inn, about

Neither were my reflections free from apprehenſion, that ſometimes intervened in ſpite of all my hope, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her as having yielded to the importunity of her brother, and bleſſed the arms of an happy rival.—My thoughts were even maddened with the fear of her death; and when I arrived in the dark at the houſe of Mrs. Sagely, I had not for ſome time the courage to deſire ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, leſt my ſoul ſhould be ſhocked with diſmal tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. At length, however, I knocked, and no ſooner cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the good gentlewoman of my voice, than ſhe opened the door, and received me with a moſt affectionate embrace that brought tears into her aged eyes: <q>For Heaven's ſake, dear mother,</q> cried I, <q>tell me, how is Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa?

                     <p>This good old gentlewoman, to give me a convincing proof of my dear Narciſſa's unalterable love, gratified me with a ſight of the laſt letter ſhe had favoured her with, in which I was mentioned with ſo much honour, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and concern, that my ſoul was fired with impatience, and I determined to ride all night, that I might have it the ſooner in my power to make her happy.—Mrs. Sagely perceiving my eagerneſs, and her maternal affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being equally divided between Narciſſa and me, begged leave to remind me of the ſentiments with which I went abroad, that would not permit me, for any ſelfiſh gratification, to prejudice the fortune of that amiable young lady, who muſt entirely depend upon me, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſtowed herſelf in marriage. I thanked her for her kind concern, and as briefly as poſſible deſcribed my flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſituation, which afforded this humane perſon infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wonder and ſatisfaction. I told her that now I had an opportunity to manifeſt my gratitude for the obligation I owed, I would endeavour to make her old age comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and eaſy; as a ſtep to which I propoſed ſhe ſhould come and live with Narciſſa and me—This venerable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman was ſo much affected with my words, that the tears ran down her ancient cheeks; ſhe thanked Heaven that I had not belied the preſages ſhe had made, on her firſt acquaintance with me; acknowledging my generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as ſhe called it, in the moſt elegant and pathetic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; but declined my propoſal, on account of her attachment to the dear melancholy cottage, were ſhe had ſo peaceably conſumed her ſolitary widowhood. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her immoveable on this ſubject, I inſiſted on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a preſent of thirty guineas, and took my leave, reſolving to accommodate her with that ſum annually, for the more comfortable ſupport of the infirmities of age.</p>
                     <p>Having rode all night, I found myſelf at Canterbury
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:027715_0481_0FD5EF5EAB09D280"/>
in the morning, where I alighted to procure freſh horſes; and, as I walked into the inn, perceived an apothecary's ſhop on the other ſide of the ſtreet, with the name of Morgan over the door: alarmed at this diſcovery I could not help thinking that my old meſs-mate had ſettled in this place; and upon inquiry, found my conjecture true, and that he was married lately to a widow of that city, by whom he had got three thouſand pounds. Rejoiced at this intelligence, I went to his ſhop as ſoon as it was open, and found my friend behind the counter, buſy in preparing a clyſter.—I ſaluted him at entrance, with "Your ſervant, Mr. Morgan."—Upon which he looked at me, and replying, <q>Your moſt humble ſervant, goot Sir;</q> rubbed his ingredients in the mortar, without any emotion. "What!" ſaid I, <q>Morgan, have you forgot your old meſs-mate?</q> At theſe words, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up again, and ſtarting, cried, <q>As Cot is my—ſure it cannot—yes, by my ſalfation, I pelieve it is my tear friend Mr. Rantom.</q>—He was no ſooner convinced of my identity, than he threw down the peſtle, overſet the mortar, and jumping over the board, ſwept up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents with his clothes, flew about my neck, hugged me affectionately, and daubed me all over with turpentine and the yolks of eggs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

In the courſe of our converſation he ſhewed the ſleeve buttons I had exchanged with him at our parting in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and was not a little proud to ſee that I had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his with the ſame care. When I informed him of
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:027715_0482_0FD5EF5FA4EED198"/>
Macſhane's condition, he ſeemed at firſt to exult over his diſtreſs; but after a little recollection, he ſaid, <q>Well, he has paid for his malice, I forgife him, and may Cot forgife him likewiſe.</q> He expreſſed great concern for the ſoul of Captain Oakhum, which he believed was now gnaſhing its teeth: but it was ſome time before I could convince him of Thomſon's being alive, at whoſe good fortune nevertheleſs he was extremely glad.</p>
                     <p>Having renewed our proteſtations of friendſhip, I bid the honeſt Welſhman and his ſpouſe farewel, and, taking poſt-horſes, arrived at London that ſame night, where I found my father in good health, to whom I imparted what I had learned of Narciſſa. This indulgent parent approved of my intention of marrying her even without a fortune, provided her brother's conſent could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, promiſed to make over to me, in a few days, a ſufficiency to maintain her in a faſhionable manner, and expreſſed a deſire of ſeeing this amiable creature who had captivated me ſo much. As I had not ſlept the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was beſides fatigued with my journey, I found myſelf under a neceſſity of taking ſome repoſe, and went to bed accordingly: next morning, about ten o'clock, I took a chair, and, according to Mr. Sagely's directions, went to my charmer's lodgings, and inquired for Miſs Williams. I had not waited in a parlour longer than a minute, when this young woman entered, and no ſooner perceived me than ſhe ſhrieked, and ran backward; I got between her and the door, and, claſping her in my arms, brought her to herſelf by an embrace. "Good Heaven," cried ſhe, <q>Mr. Random, is it you, indeed? my miſtreſs will run diſtracted with joy.</q> I told her, it was from an apprehenſion that my ſudden appearance would have had ſome bad effect on my dear Narciſſa, that I had deſired to ſee her firſt, in order to concert ſome method of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting her miſtreſs gradually with my arrival. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of my conduct, and, after having yielded to the ſuggeſtions of her own friendſhip in aſking if my voyage had been ſucceſsful, charged herſelf with that office, and left me glowing with deſire of ſeeing and embracing the object of my love. In a very little time I heard ſomebody coming down ſtairs in haſte, and the voice of an angel pronounce with an eager tone, <q>O Heavens! is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:027715_0483_0FD5EF611F213D00"/>
where is he?</q> How were my faculties arouſed at this well-known ſound! and how was my ſoul tranſported, when ſhe broke in upon my view in all the bloom of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened beauty!
<q>
                           <l>Grace was in all her ſteps, heav'n in her eye,</l>

                        </q>
You, whoſe ſouls are ſuſceptible of the moſt delicate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, whoſe tender boſoms have felt the affecting vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of love, who have ſuffered an abſence of eighteen long months from the dear object of your hope, and found, at your return, the melting fair as kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant as your heart could wiſh, do me juſtice on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and conceive what unutterable rapture poſſeſſed us both, while we flew into each other's arms! This was no time for ſpeech—locked in a mutual embrace, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome minutes in a ſilent trance of joy!—When I thus encircled all that my ſoul held dear—while I hung over her beauties, beheld her eyes ſparkle, and every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fluſh with virtuous fondneſs—when I ſaw her enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boſom heave with undiſſembled rapture, and knew myſelf the happy cauſe—Heavens! what was my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!—I am tempted to commit my paper to the flames, and to renounce my pen for ever, becauſe its moſt ardent and lucky expreſſion ſo poorly deſcribes the emotions of my ſoul. "O adorable Narciſſa!" cried I; <q>O mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of beauty, love, and truth! I at laſt fold thee in my arms! I at laſt can call thee mine!—No jealous brother ſhall thwart our happineſs again; fortune hath at length recompenſed me for all my ſufferings, and enabled me to do juſtice to my love.</q> The dear creature ſmiled ineffably charming, and, with a look of bewitching ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, ſaid, "And ſhall we never part again?"—<q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!</q> I replied, <q>thou wondrous pattern of all earthly perfection! never, until death ſhall divide us!—By this ambroſial kiſs, a thouſand times more fragrant than the breeze that ſweeps the orange grove, I never more will leave thee.</q>

                     <p>As my firſt tranſport abated, my paſſion grew turbulent and unruly. I was giddy with ſtanding on the brink of bliſs, and all my virtue and philoſophy were ſcarce ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reſtrain the inordinate ſallies of deſire. Narciſſa
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:027715_0484_0FD5EF689BE0B800"/>
perceived the conflict within me, and with her uſual dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of prudence called off my imagination from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in view, and, with eager expreſſions of intereſted cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, deſired to know the particulars of my voyage. In this I gratified her inclination, bringing my ſtory down to the preſent hour. She was infinitely ſurpriſed at the circumſtance of my finding my father, which brought tears into her lovely eyes. She was tranſported at hearing that he approved my flame, diſcovered a longing deſire of being introduced to him, congratulated herſelf and me upon my good fortune, and obſerved, that this great and unexpected ſtroke of fate ſeemed to have been brought about by the immediate direction of Providence. Having entertained ourſelves ſome hours with the genuine effuſions of our ſouls, I obtained her conſent to complete my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as ſoon as my father ſhould judge it proper; and applying with my own hands a valuable necklace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of diamonds and amethyſts ſet alternately, which an old Spaniſh lady at Paraguay preſented me with, I took my leave, promiſing to return in the afternoon with Don Rodrigo. When I went home, this generous parent inquired very affectionately about the health of my dear Narciſſa, to whom, that I might be the more agreeable, he put into my hands a deed, by which I found myſelf in poſſeſſion of fifteen thouſand pounds, excluſive of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of my own merchandiſe, which amounted to three thouſand more. After dinner I accompanied him to the lodging of my miſtreſs, who, being dreſſed for the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, made a moſt dazzling appearance. I could perceive him ſtruck with her figure, which I really think was the moſt beautiful that ever was created under the fun. He embraced her tenderly, and told her, he was proud of having a ſon who had ſpirit to attempt, and qualifications to engage the affections of ſuch a fine lady. She bluſhed at this compliment, and, with eyes full of the ſofteſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment, turned upon me, and ſaid, ſhe would have been unworthy of Mr. Random's attention, had ſhe been blind to his extraordinary merit. I made no other anſwer than a low bow. My father, ſighing, pronounced, <q>Such once was my Charlotte!</q> while the tear ruſhed into his eye, and the tender heart of Narciſſa manifeſted itſelf in two precious drops of ſympathy, which, but for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:027715_0485_0FD5EF68A13C50E8"/>
I would have kiſſed away. Without repeating the particulars of our converſation, I ſhall only obſerve, that Don Rodrigo was as much charmed with her good ſenſe as with her appearance; and ſhe was no leſs pleaſed with his underſtanding and polite addreſs. It was determined, that he ſhould write to the ſquire, ſignifying his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of my paſſion for his ſiſter, and offering a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he ſhould have no reaſon to reject, and that, if he ſhould refuſe the propoſal, he ſhould crown our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wiſhes without any farther regard.</p>

                     <p>AFTER having ſpent the evening to the ſatisfaction of all preſent, my father addreſſed himſelf thus to Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſa: <q>Madam, give me leave to conſider you hereafter as my daughter, in which capacity I inſiſt upon your accepting this firſt inſtance of my paternal duty and affection.</q> With theſe words, he put into her hand a bank-note for 500<hi>l.</hi> which ſhe no ſooner examined than, with a low curtſey, ſhe replied, <q>Dear Sir, though I have not the leaſt occaſion for this ſupply, I have too great a veneration for you to refuſe this proof of your generoſity and eſteem, which I the more freely receive, becauſe I already look upon Mr. Random's intereſt as inſeparably connected with mine.</q> He was extremely well pleaſed at her frank and ingenuous reply: upon which we ſaluted, and wiſhed her good night. The letter, at my requeſt, was diſpatched to Suſſex by an expreſs, and in the mean time Don Rodrigo, to grace my nuptials, hired a ready-furniſhed houſe, and ſet up a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome equipage.</p>
                     <p>Though I paſſed the greater part of the day with the darling of my ſoul, I found leiſure ſometimes to be among my former acquaintance, who were aſtoniſhed at the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence

of my appearance: Banter in particular was confounded at the ſtrange viciſſitudes of my fortune, the cauſes of which he endeavoured in vain to diſcover, until I thought fit to diſcloſe the whole ſecret of my laſt voyage, partly on conſideration of our former intimacy, and partly to prevent unfavourable conjectures which he and others, in all probability, would have made in regard to my circumſtances. He profeſſed great ſatisfaction at this piece of news, and I had no cauſe to believe him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere, when I conſidered, that he would now look upon himſelf as acquitted of the debt he owed me, and at the ſame time flatter himſelf with hopes of borrowing more.—I carried him home to dinner with me, and my father liked his converſation ſo much, that upon hearing his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, he deſired me to accommodate him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and inquire if he would accept of a commiſſion in the army, towards the purchaſe of which he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly lend him money. Accordingly, I gave my friend an opportunity of being alone with me, when, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he told me, that he was juſt upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to an old rich uncle, whoſe heir he was, but wanted a few pieces for immediate expence, which he deſired I would lend him, and take his bond for the whole. His demand was limited to ten guineas; and when I put twenty into his hands, he ſtared at me for ſome moments, then putting it into his purſe, ſaid, <q>Ay, 'tis all one, you'll have the whole in a very ſhort time.</q> When I had taken his note, to ſave the expence of a bond, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome ſurpriſe, that a fellow of his ſpirit ſhould loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter away his time in idleneſs, and aſked why he did not chuſe to make his fortune in the army.—"What!" ſaid he, <q>throw away money upon a ſubaltern's commiſſion, to be under the command of a parcel of ſcoundrels, who have raiſed themſelves above me by the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous practices! no, I love independency too well to ſacrifice my life, health and pleaſure to ſuch a pitiful conſideration.</q>—Finding him averſe to this way of life, I changed the ſubject, and returned to Don Rodrigo, who had juſt received the following epiſtle from the ſquire.</p>

                     <p>My father was not much ſurpriſed at this polite letter, after having heard the character of the author: and as for me, I was even pleaſed at his refuſal, becauſe I now had an opportunity of ſhewing my diſintereſted love. By his permiſſion I waited upon my charmer, and having imparted to her the contents of her brother's letter, at which ſhe wept bitterly, in ſpite of all my conſolation and careſſes, the time of our marriage was fixed at the diſtance of two days.—During this interval in which my ſoul was wound up to the laſt ſtretch of rapturous expectation, Narciſſa en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to reconcile ſome of her relations in town to her marriage with me; but finding them all deaf to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, either out of envy or prejudice, ſhe told me with the moſt enchanting ſweetneſs, while the tears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed her lovely cheeks, <q>Sure the world will no longer queſtion your generoſity, when you take a poor forlorn beggar to your arms.</q> Affected with her ſorrow, I preſſed the fair mourner to my breaſt, and ſwore that ſhe was more dear and welcome on that account, becauſe ſhe had ſacrificed her friends and fortune to her love for me.—My uncle, for whoſe character ſhe had a great venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being by this time come to town, I introduced him to my bride: and although he was not very much ſubject to refined ſenſations, he was ſtruck dumb with admiration at her beauty. After having kiſſed and gazed at her for ſome time, he turned to me, ſaying, <q>Odds bobs, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! here's a notable prize indeed, finely built and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly

rigged, i'faith! If ſhe an't well manned, when you have the command of her, ſirrah, you deſerve to go to ſea in cockle-ſhell.—No offence, I hope, niece; you muſt not mind what I ſay, being (as the ſaying is) a plain ſea-ſaring man, thof, mayhap, I have as much regard for you as another.</q>—She received him with great civility; told him, ſhe had longed a great while to ſee a perſon to whom ſhe was ſo much indebted for his generoſity to Mr. Random; that ſhe looked upon him as her uncle, by which name ſhe begged leave to call him for the future, and that ſhe was very ſure he could ſay nothing that could give her the leaſt offence. The honeſt captain was tranſported at her courteous behaviour, and inſiſted upon <hi>giving her away</hi> at the ceremony, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he loved her as well as if ſhe was his own child, and that he would give two thouſand guineas to the firſt fruit of our love, as ſoon as it could ſqueak.—Every thing being prepared for the ſolemnization of our nuptials, which were to be performed privately at my father's houſe, the auſpicious hour arrived, when Don Rodrigo and my uncle went in the coach to fetch the bride and Miſs Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams; leaving me with a parſon, Banter, and Strap, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whom had as yet ſeen my charming miſtreſs.—My faithful valet, who was on the rack of impatience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a lady of whom he had heard ſo much, no ſooner underſtood that the coach was returned, than he placed himſelf at a window to have a peep at her as ſhe alighted; and when he ſaw her, he clapped his hands together, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the white of his eyes, and with his mouth wide open, remained in a ſort of extaſy, which broke out into, <hi>

                        </hi>—The doctor and Banter were ſurpriſed to hear my man ſpeak Latin; but when my father led Narciſſa into the room, the object of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration was ſoon changed, as appeared in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of both.—Indeed they muſt have been the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of all beings, could they have beheld, without emotion, the divine creature that approached! She was dreſſed in a ſack of white ſattin, embroidered on the breaſt with gold; the crown of her head was covered with a ſmall French cap, from whence deſcended her beautiful hair in ringlets, that waved upon her ſnowy neck, which

dignified the necklace I had given her; her looks glowed with modeſty and love; and her boſom, through the veil of gauze that ſhaded it, afforded a proſpect of Elyſium!—I received this ineſtimable gift of Providence as became me; and in a little time the clergyman did his office, my uncle, at his own earneſt requeſt, acting the part of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my dear Narciſſa, who trembled very much, and had ſcarce ſpirits ſufficient to ſupport her under this great change of ſituation.—Soon as ſhe was mine by the laws of heaven and earth, I printed a burning kiſs upon her lips, my father embraced her tenderly, my uncle hugged her with great affection, and I preſented her to my friend Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When ſhe left the room, her face was overſpread with a bluſh that ſet all my blood in a ſtate of fermentation, and made every pulſe beat with tenfold vigour! She was ſo cruel as to let me remain in this condition a full half hour; when, no longer able to reſtrain my impatience, I broke from the company, burſt into her chamber, puſhed out her confidante, locked the door, and found her—O heaven and earth! a feaſt, a thouſand times more delicious than my moſt ſanguine hope preſaged!—But let me not profane the chaſte myſteries of Hymen—I was the happieſt of men.</p>
                     <p>In the morning I was awaked by three or four drums, which Banter had placed under the window; upon which I withdrew the curtain, and enjoyed the unſpeakable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of contemplating thoſe angelic charms which were now in my poſſeſſion! <hi>Beauty! which, whether ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or awake, ſhot forth peculiar graces!</hi>—The light dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon my Narciſſa's eyes, ſhe awoke alſo, and, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting her ſituation, hid her bluſhes in my boſom. I was diſtracted with joy! I could not believe the evidence of my ſenſes, and looked upon all that had happened as the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:027715_0490_0FD5EF761ED301A8"/>
fictions of a dream! In the mean time my uncle knocked at the door, and bid me turn out; for I had had a long ſpell. I got up accordingly, and ſent Miſs Williams to her miſtreſs, myſelf receiving the congratulations of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bowling, who rallied me in his ſea phraſe with great ſucceſs. In leſs than an hour Don Rodrigo led my wife in to breakfaſt, where ſhe received the compliments of the company on her looks, which they ſaid, if poſſible, were improved by matrimony. As her delicate ears were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with none of thoſe indecent ambiguities, which are too often ſpoke on ſuch occaſions, ſhe behaved with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, unaffected modeſty, and eaſe; and, as a teſtimony of my affection and eſteem, I preſented her, in preſence of them all, with a deed, by which I ſettled the whole fortune I was poſſeſſed of on her and her heirs for ever. She accepted it with a glance of the moſt tender acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, obſerved, that ſhe could not be ſurpriſed at any thing of this kind I ſhould do, and deſired my father to take the trouble of keeping it, ſaying, <q>Next to my own, Mr. Random, you are the perſon in whom I ought to have the greateſt confidence.</q> Charmed with her prudent and ingenuous manner of proceeding, he took the paper, and aſſured her, that it ſhould not loſe its value while in his cuſtody.</p>

One night, in particular, we had ſent our footman to keep one of the ſtage-boxes, which we no ſooner entered, than we perceived in the oppoſite box the ſquire and his lady, who ſeemed not a little ſurpriſed at ſeeing us. I was pleaſed at this opportunity of confront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the more, becauſe Melinda was robbed of all her admirers by my wife, who happened that night to outſhine her ſiſter both in beauty and in dreſs. She was piqued at Narciſſa's victory, toſſed her head a thouſand different ways, flirted her fan, looked at us with diſdain, then whiſpered to her huſband, and broke out into an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected giggle; but all her arts proved ineffectual either to diſcompoſe Mrs. Random, or to conceal her own mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which at length forced her away long before the play was done.

ſpread, with many circumſtances to our diſadvantage, by the induſtry of this malignant creature, a certain ſet of perſons, fond of ſcandal, began to inquire into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my fortune, which they no ſooner underſtood to be independent, than the tables were turned, and our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was courted as much as it had been deſpiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but Narciſſa had too much dignity of pride to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage this change of conduct, eſpecially in her relations, whom ſhe could never be prevailed upon to ſee after the malicious reports they had raiſed to her prejudice.</p>

                        <p>My father intends to viſit the place of his nativity—we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to accompany him—my uncle renews his will in my favour, determining to go to ſea again—we ſet out for Scotland—arrive at Edinburgh—purchaſe our paternal eſtate—proceed to it—halt at the town where I was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated—take up my bond to Crab—the behaviour of Potion and his wife, and one of my female couſins—our reception at the eſtate—Strap marries Miſs Williams, and is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled by my father to his own ſatisfaction—I am more and more happy.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MY father intending to reviſit his native country, and pay the tribute of a few tears at my mother's grave, Narciſſa and I reſolved to accompany him in the execution of this pious office, and accordingly prepared for the journey; in which, however, my uncle would not engage, being reſolved to try his fortune once more at ſea. In the mean time he renewed his will in favour of my wife and me, and depoſited it in the hands of his brother-in-law; while I (that I might not be wanting to my own intereſt) ſummoned the ſquire to produce his father's will at Doctor's Commons, and employed a proctor to manage the affair in my abſence.</p>
                     <p>Every thing being thus ſettled, we took leave of all our friends in London, and ſet out for Scotland, Don Rodrigo, Narciſſa, Miſs Williams, and I in the coach, and Strap, with two men in livery, on horſeback: as we made eaſy ſtages, my charmer held it out very well till we arrived at Edinburgh, where we propoſed to reſt ourſelves
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:027715_0492_0FD5EF79156B69E8"/>
ſome weeks. People of our figure could not fail of attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the notice of ſuch a ſmall place, where, as ſoon as our family was known, we were loaded with careſſes, and Narciſſa was ſo much pleaſed with the civilities ſhe receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſhe proteſted ſhe would never deſire to live in any other part of the world.</p>
                     <p>Here Don Rodrigo having intelligence that his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew the fox-hunter had ſpent his eſtate, which was to be expoſed to ſale by public auction, he determined to make a purchaſe of the ſpot where he was born, and actually bought the whole of his father's lands.</p>
                     <p>In a few days after the bargain was made, we left Edinburgh, in order to go and take poſſeſſion; and, by the way, halted one night in the town where I was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.—Upon inquiry, I found that Mr. Crab was dead; whereupon I ſent for his executor, paid the ſum I owed, with intereſt, and took up my bond. Mr. Potion and his wife, hearing of our arrival, had the aſſurance to come to the inn where we lodged, and ſent up their names, with a deſire of being permitted to pay their reſpects to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and me: but their ſordid behaviour towards me, when I was an orphan, had made too deep an impreſſion on my mind to be effaced by this mean mercenary piece of condeſcenſion: I therefore rejected their meſſage with diſdain, and bid Strap tell them, that my father and I deſired to have no communication with ſuch low-minded wretches as they were.</p>
                     <p>They had not been gone half an hour, when a woman, without any ceremony, opened the door of the room where we ſat, and making towards my father, accoſted him with, "Uncle, your ſervant—I am glad to ſee you."—This was no other than one of my female couſins mentioned in the firſt part of my memoirs, to whom Don Rodrigo replied, "Pray, who are you, Madam?"—"Oh!" cried ſhe, <q>my couſin Rory, there, knows me very well—Don't you remember me, Rory?</q>—"Yes, Madam," ſaid I, <q>for my own part, I ſhall never forget you.—Sir, this is one of the young ladies, who (as I have formerly told you) treated me ſo humanely in my childhood!</q> When I pronounced theſe words, my father's reſentment glowed in his viſage, and he ordered her to begone, with ſuch a commanding aſpect, that ſhe retired in a fright,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:027715_0493_0FD5EF7E34C235D8"/>
muttering curſes as ſhe went down ſtair: we afterwards learned that ſhe was married to an enſign, who had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpent all her fortune; and that her ſiſter had bore a child to her mother's footman, who is now her huſband, and keeps a petty ale-houſe in the country.</p>
                     <p>The fame of our flouriſhing condition having arrived at this place before us, we got notice that the magiſtrates intended next day to compliment us with the freedom of their town; upon which my father, conſidering their complaiſance in the right point of view, ordered the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the coach early in the morning, when we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our eſtate, which lay about a dozen miles from this place.</p>
                     <p>When we came within half a league of the houſe, we were met by a prodigious number of poor tenants, men, women, and children, who teſtified their joy by loud ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, and accompanied our coach to the gate. As there is no part of the world in which the peaſants are more attached to their lords than in Scotland, we were almoſt devoured by their affection, in getting out of the coach: my father had always been their favourite, and now that he appeared their maſter, after being thought dead ſo long, their joy broke out into a thouſand extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances: when we got into the court-yard, we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a vaſt number, who crowded together ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee us, that ſeveral were in danger of being ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death; thoſe who were near Don Rodrigo fell upon their knees, and kiſſed his hand, or the hem of his garment, praying aloud for long life and proſperity to him; others approached Narciſſa and me in the ſame manner; while the reſt clapped their hands at a diſtance, and invoked Heaven to ſhower its choiceſt bleſſings on our heads!—In ſhort, the whole ſcene, though rude, was ſo affecting, that the gentle partner of my heart wept over it, and my father himſelf could not refrain from dropping a tear.</p>
                     <p>Having welcomed his daughter and me to his houſe, he ordered ſome bullocks to be killed, and ſome hogſheads of ale to be brought from the neighbouring village, to regale thoſe honeſt people, who had not enjoyed ſuch a holiday for many years before.</p>
                     <p>Next day we were viſited by the gentlemen in the
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:027715_0494_0FD5EF801C633A28"/>
neighbourhood, moſt of them our relations, one of whom brought along with him my couſin the fox-hunter, who had ſtaid at his houſe ſince he was obliged to leave his own. My father was generous enough to receive him kindly, and even promiſed to purchaſe for him a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the army, at which he expreſſed great thankfulneſs and joy.</p>
                     <p>My charming Narciſſa was univerſally admired and loved for her beauty, affability and good ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo well pleaſed with the ſituation of the place, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany around, that ſhe has not yet diſcovered the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of changing her habitation.</p>
                     <p>We had not been many days ſettled, when I prevailed upon my father to pay a viſit to the village where I had been at ſchool. Here we were received by the principal inhabitants, who entertained us in the church, where Mr. Syntax the ſchoolmaſter (my tyrant being dead) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a Latin ſpeech in honour of our family: and none exerted themſelves more than Strap's father and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, who looked upon the honeſt valet as the firſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of their race, and honoured his benefactors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.—Having received the homage of this place, we retired, leaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the pariſh; and that very night Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been ſhewn to him, and to me on his account, ventured to tell me that he had a ſneaking kindneſs for Miſs Williams, and that if his lady and I would uſe our intereſt in his behalf, he did not doubt that ſhe would liſten to his addreſſes. Surpriſed at this propoſal, I aſked if he knew the ſtory of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate young gentlewoman: upon which he replied, <q>Yes, yes, I know what you mean—ſhe has been unhappy, I grant you—but what of that? I am convinced of her reformation; or elſe you and my good lady would not treat her with ſuch reſpect.—As for the cenſure of the world, I value it not a fig's end: beſides, the world knows nothing of the matter.</q> I commended his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and intereſted Narciſſa in his cauſe; who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded ſo effectually, that in a little time Miſs Williams yielded her conſent, and they were married, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Don Rodrigo, who gave him five hundred pounds to ſtock a farm, and made him overſeer of his
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:027715_0495_0FD5EF816145AB70"/>
eſtate. My generous bed-fellow gave her maid the ſame ſum; ſo that they live in great peace and plenty, within half a mile of us, and daily put up prayers for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                     <p>If there be ſuch a thing as true happineſs on earth, I enjoy it.—The impetuous tranſports of my paſſion are now ſettled, and mellowed into endearing fondneſs and tranquillity of love, rooted by that intimate connection and interchange of hearts, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ought but virtuous wedlock can produce. Fortune ſeems determined to make ample amends for her former cruelty; for my proctor writes, that notwithſtanding the clauſe in my father-in-law's will, on which the ſquire founds his claim, I ſhall certainly recover my wife's fortune, in conſequence of a codicil annexed, which explains that clauſe, and limits her reſtriction to the age of nineteen, after which ſhe was at her own diſpoſal.—I would have ſet out for London immediately after receiving this piece of intelligence; but my dear angel has been qualmiſh of late, and begins to grow remarkably round in the waiſt; ſo that I cannot leave her in ſuch an intereſting ſituation, which I hope will produce ſomething to crown my felicity.</p>
