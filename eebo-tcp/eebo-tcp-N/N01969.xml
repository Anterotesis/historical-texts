            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And he ſaid unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exerciſe lordſhip over them, and they that exerciſe authority upon them, are called Benefactors.</q>

            <p>As to the occaſion of them, it was an unhappy <hi>Contention</hi> among the Diſciples of CHRIST about <hi>Primary</hi> and Superiority, in the Verſe which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002340_0005_0FDB2C288D33D260"/>
preceeds the Text, <hi>there was alſo a ſtrife among them, which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt.</hi> Contention is the fruit of pride and ambition. Men that have a mind to be uppermoſt in the World can't be quiet, unleſs they are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in it. But all the Diſciples of CHRIST were not guilty of this unſeaſonable affectation; the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> it ſeems were the chief in this buſineſs. Its well the other of CHRIST's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had more wiſdom, and more grace, than to make ſo much trouble about ſecular honor and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion.</p>
            <p>IT becomes the Diſciples of CHRIST to be <hi>humble,</hi> and to watch againſt ambition. The meek and the admirable <hi>JESUS</hi> to quiet the Spirits of theſe aſpiring Diſciples tells them, that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lordſhip and Dominion did not belong to them, that he had ſuperior honors to beſtow upon them, after they had ſerved him a while here in the world, and that if they would have a little patience, he would promote them unto great honor, and make them <hi>Sit upon thrones judging the tribes of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEIR buſineſs at preſent was not to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto, but to miniſter; and it was a vanity in them to dream of Temporal Promotion, for <hi>his kingdom was not of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="1">1. THE Power that <hi>Sovereign Princes</hi> are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with, it is a Power of <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip.</hi> They do it <hi>defacto,</hi> and they do it <hi>de jure.</hi> The ſupream Dominion is the LORD's; but there is a delegated Dominion and Power veſted in the Sons of Men. GOD is the Sovereign LORD; but the Princes and Kings of the Earth are his Lieutenants, his Deputies and Vicegerents, and have a lawfull right to exerciſe Dominion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Ends</hi> to which they ought to exerciſe their Authority; to the good, the benefit, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of thoſe who are under their Authority.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE honorable <hi>Appellation</hi> that belongs to them when they exerciſe their Authority regularly, and ſuitably to the original deſign and inſtitution of Government: <hi>They are called Benefactors</hi>

the Kingdoms and Countries under their auſpicious Government.</p>
            <p>THE Kings of the Gentiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were fond of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming magnificent <hi>Titles</hi> unto themſelves, and ſometimes the good they did to the Publick, juſtly merited ſome memorable Appellation.

Acts 24. 2. <hi>Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietneſs, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</hi> &amp;c. This was an Excellent commendation of <hi>Felix,</hi> his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, if it had been <hi>true</hi> and ſpoken without flattery. But <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays of <hi>Felix</hi> that he was <hi>Inexplebilis Gurges</hi> an Inſatiable Gulph of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs. The <hi>Jewiſh Hiſtorian</hi> ſpeaks of his Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, and the <hi>Sacred Story</hi> gives us reaſon end to think that he was Intemperate and Unjuſt; or elſe he would not have trembled as he did, when the <hi>Apoſtle reaſoned before him of righteouſneſs, and of temperance, and of the Judgment to come,</hi> And a Man of ſo much Corruption, could never make a good Governour.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Divine Providence calls ſome from among men, to exerciſe Authority over others.</hi> The Wiſdom of GOD has Eſtabliſhed a Government in the World, and ordained that there ſhould be a rule over Men; and the World without it would no more be a <hi>Coſmos</hi> but a <hi>Chaos.</hi> When <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was Importuned by one to eſtabliſh a popular Parity in the State, Do thou ſays he, firſt begin it in thy own Family. Civil Government is of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and the Inſtitution is ſo neceſſary that human Societies cannot ſubſiſt without it. There is a Rule even in the Kingdom of Darkneſs, and a Prince of the Power of the Air. The light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture led the Nations to practiſe upon this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: the Gentiles had their Kings. But the Divine Providence over-rules; and GOD that Governs the World puts the Scepter into their hands. Hence the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> tells <hi>Belſhezzar,</hi> Dan. 5. 18. <hi>The moſt high God gave unto Nebuchadnezzar thy Father a Kingdom, and Majeſty, &amp; Honour, &amp; Glory.</hi> Hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>By me Kings reign.

            <p>BUT we read it, <hi>By me,</hi> that is, not meerly by Divine Permiſſion, but by Divine <hi>Ordination,</hi> and Appointment: Whether Kingdoms be Hereditary, or Elective, yet the <hi>Powers that be, are ordained of GOD.</hi> The Eternal King has an uncontroulable right to give the Kingdoms of Men unto whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He will; and ſometimes He ſets over them the baſeſt of Men, to the intent that Men may know, that the Moſt High does rule, that Dominion is not founded in Grace, and that the Gifts of Providence are diſpenſed by a Sovereign hand. So ſometimes GOD <hi>lifteth up the poor out of the duſt, and raiſeth up the beggar from the dunghill, to ſet them among princes, and to cauſe them to inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world upon them,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 8.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002340_0012_0FDB2C39680BBD50"/>
(1.) <hi>BY making the beſt Laws for the benefit of the People.</hi> Good Laws are a benefit to a People. And <hi>wiſe Lawgivers are great Benefactors,</hi> and have been honored as ſuch among the Nations. So was <hi>Solon, Lycurgus,</hi> and others. The making of Laws is one branch of the <hi>Power</hi> committed unto Rulers; and the making of good Laws will be one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Inſtance of their <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> their <hi>Integrity,</hi> and their <hi>Publick Care</hi> for their People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LAWS</hi> for the defending them in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rights as Men, and Religious Rights as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: Laws for the direction of the Miniſters of Juſtice; that they may know how to miniſter Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Judgment unto all Iſrael: Laws for the detecting and puniſhing Fraud, Forgery, Perjury, and every bold Iniquity: The moſt effectual Laws poſſible, for the ſuppreſſing Prophaneſs, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; every Immorality; and <hi>Sumptuary</hi> Laws as their Wiſdom ſhall think fit for the governing the Expences of a People, the Retrenching the overgrown and inſupportable Exceſſes and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies; and Encouraging Thriftineſs and Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. The <hi>Romans</hi> made Laws to moderate the Exceſſes of Diet and Apparel.</p>
            <p>BUT then it ſhould be minded, that 'tis <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> that gives life and force to Laws, and makes them quick and powerfull, and without this <hi>the ſons of Zeruia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Luſts of Men are very unruly things, and they that are under the dominion of them will run unto all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Riot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe raging waves of the Sea will be foaming out their own ſhame, theſe Sons of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will not be reſtrained, unleſs the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate

unſheath the Sword of Juſtice, and ſmite thrô the Loins of them that work Iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>BY Employing the beſt of Men in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</hi> I know every good Man is not qualified for Rule. There are Gifts for Government, that are diſtinct from the Gifts of Sanctification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the People will rejoyce when the Righteous are in Authority. If Rulers are ſtrangers to GOD, to CHRIST, to Virtue, to Religion, and they that work wickedneſs are ſet up, and Men of the moſt Loyal and Religious Principles, thrô unreaſonable prejudices laid aſide, it can't be for the Honor of GOD, for the Intereſt of a People, nor for the glory of the Government. When <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaw <hi>folly ſet in great dignity,</hi> he ſays it was <hi>an Error:</hi> Eccl. 10. 5. The moſt diſtinguiſhing honors are certainly due to Men of Merit, to ſuch as have diſtinguiſh'd themſelves by their Virtue, their Loyalty, their Fidelity; by their noble and generous Service for the Publick; their good deeds ſhould not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, their names ought to be in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The Laws of Honour, of Juſtice, and of Gratitude oblige hereunto. The <hi>Roman</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was much owing to their Honor and Juſtice herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the <hi>Perſian Monarchs</hi> kept a Regiſter Book of the Names of the Benefactors, that Honor might be done them accordingly, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. And he that deprives Men of the honor due to Virtue, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of Virtue it ſelf, ſays <hi>Cato.</hi> And on the other hand, when Perſons have rendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of the Publick Truſt, by their meaneſs, their mercinarineſs, their baſeneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002340_0014_0FDB2C3EC50412A8"/>
their looſe principles, and their corrupt and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous practices; they ſhould not have the Publick Countenance; they ſhould have no Opportunity put into their hands to go off with the ſpoil of their oppreſſed Neighbours; they will <hi>tranſgreſs for a piece of bread.</hi> They ſhould therefore <hi>break the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck the ſpoil out of their teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>BY ſetting the beſt Examples before the People.</hi> Good Examples may do a great deal of Good. The Examples of Rulers will be likely to have a great deal of Influence, when they are Men of Virtue, Probity and Goodneſs, and excell therein. Their bright and ſhining Examples will enlighten &amp; influence others. But when Rulers are the <hi>Rulers of Sodom,</hi> the People will be the <hi>People of Gomorrah. If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his ſervants are wicked.</hi> They ſhould not therefore indulge themſelves in any thing that is mean, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, or diſhonourable. Its pity that Men of Honor and Diſtinction in the World, ſhould bring a ſtain upon all their Glory by a ſordid Indulgence unto any baſe Luſt, or tarniſh the brightneſs of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with ſome ſuch Exception as that, or one a great deal worſe than that, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>BY doing what they can to eſtabliſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the true Religion.</hi> Religion is the <hi>Life</hi> of a People, and by taking care of that we ſhall <hi>prolong our days in the land,</hi> which the LORD GOD gave unto our Fathers.</p>
            <p>IT is the <hi>Strength</hi> of a People, and by taking care of that, Rulers will be the Strength, and the <hi>Stability of our times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002340_0015_0FDB2C40CE29E678"/>
IT is the <hi>Safety</hi> of a People, and by taking care of that, we ſhall be ſafe <hi>under the ſhadow of the Almighty.</hi> And in the Day when it ſhall revive and flouriſh, even in that Day ſhall this <hi>Song</hi> be ſung in the Land, <hi>We have a ſtrong City, Salvation will God appoint for walls and for bulwarks</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is the <hi>Glory</hi> of a People, and it will make us <hi>high in name, and in praiſe, and in honour above all people. Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation, but ſin is a reproach unto any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RELIGION has both a <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote the Proſperity of a People: if Religion flouriſhes the Country will flouriſh; and we ſhall proſper whitherſoever we turn our ſelves. Our <hi>Merchandize</hi> will flouriſh, and that will be a benefit to the Country; our <hi>Fiſhery</hi> will flouriſh and that will be an advantage; our <hi>Husbandry</hi> will flouriſh, and that will be a benefit, <hi>for the King himſelf, is ſerved by the field:</hi> then ſhall <hi>Zebulun rejoice in his goings forth, and Iſſachar in his tent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RELIGION tends to <hi>prevent and divert Divine Judgments;</hi> and the Judgments of GOD are waſting and breaking things; they make a Land mourn, they cauſe the <hi>glory of Jacob to wax thin, and the fulneſs of his fleſh to wax lean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>RELIGION tends to <hi>ſecure the Divine Preſence</hi> and Bleſſing; and the Preſence of GOD with a People, is the making of a People; if GOD leave them they can't be happy, if GOD be with them they can't be miſerable. <hi>The Lord his God is with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſhout of a king is in the midſt of them; he hath as it were the ſtrength of a Unicorn,</hi> Numb. 23. 21. Where there is much of Religion or the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002340_0016_0FDB2C44DE19A0A0"/>
Power of godlineſs among a People, GOD will not leave them, nor forſake them. So that our Religion is the foundation of all our hopes &amp; expectations. This is the beſt foundation we can build our hopes upon, both as to the preſent and future Generation; as long as this ſhall continue in its glory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, we may humbly hope for the bleſſing of Heaven even upon our lateſt Poſterity: for the Mercy of the LORD <hi>is from everlaſting to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them that fear him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. LET us conſider the <hi>Obligations</hi> on Rulers to be <hi>Benefactors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>THEY are Ordained of GOD for this very End.</hi> Rom. 13. 4. That they may be <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of GOD for good;</hi> Inſtruments in the hands of Divine Providence to the weal &amp; proſperity of a People. This is the End of their betruſtment, they ſhould therefore lay out themſelves for the good of the People; defend their rights &amp; liberties, and protect them in all their valuable Priviledges, and when they do ſo, they are the light &amp; life of a People. They are <hi>as the light of the Morning, when the Sun ariſeth, even a Morning without clouds,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 4. They are <hi>the breath of our Noſtrils,</hi> the <hi>anointed of the Lord; of whom we ſaid, We ſhall live under their ſhadow among the beathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when Rulers forget their duty, and abuſe their Power; when they neglect their care, their People and their charge; grow Imperious and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, lord it over GOD's Heritage, and are like <hi>the kine of Baſhan in the mountains of Samaria, that oppreſs the poor &amp; cruſh the needy, and ſay to their maſter bring and let us drink;</hi> they are ſo far from
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002340_0017_0FDB2C46E4DE4350"/>
anſwering the Ends of Government, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Benefactors,</hi> that they are the greateſt <hi>Burdens</hi> unto Mankind, and the greateſt <hi>Plagues</hi> and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments to the World. <hi>As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear, ſo is a wicked ruler among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Prov. 28. 15.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>THE Publick Support is another Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them. For this very cauſe do we pay tribute,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>Becauſe they are Gods Miniſters attending continually upon this very thing,</hi> Rom. 13. 6. The <hi>bread of the Governour</hi> is given that they might Imploy their Time, their Talents, and Powers in the Service of the Publick. Reaſon and Conſcience obliges the People to ſupport them if they do attend upon it. And the <hi>Lord JESUS CHRIST</hi> has laid this duty upon the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Rulers, in the ſame Commandment with the duty they owe to GOD. Math. 22. 21. <hi>Render therefore unto Caeſar the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> And therefore as we ſhould be ready to render <hi>tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, and honour to whom honour</hi> is due; ſo they that receive it are verily <hi>debtors unto us,</hi> to do us all the good they can.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>THE ſpecial Truſt &amp; Confidence repoſed in them is a further Obligation upon them.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> as Supream is put in truſt by GOD to be a <hi>Nurſing Father</hi> to His People: and <hi>Governours,</hi> and ſuch as are ſent abroad by him, into the <hi>Kings Provinces,</hi> are Intruſted by their <hi>Royal Maſter,</hi> and He has a Confidence in them that they will Exerciſe their Authority to the beſt advantage of the <hi>Provinces.</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002340_0018_0FDB2C4853B62C50"/>
But if they ſhould ſeek not their welfare but their hurt, and <hi>damage ariſe to the King,</hi> or to His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; They baſely betray their truſt, are falſe to GOD, and diſloyal to their Prince; are criminal and deeply guilty, and forfeit the good Character in the <hi>Text.</hi> Yea, they are under the <hi>Oath</hi> of GOD, and that adds weight &amp; ſolemnity to the truſt; and they can't neglect their duty herein without the deepeſt Perjury and Guilt: The tye is Sacred and Deep to manage this great betruſtment faithfully, and to them may be directed the words of the wiſe Man, <hi>I counſel thee to keep the Kings Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe of the Oath of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>THE Sacred Rules given by the Holy Ghoſt, to direct their Adminiſtrations, are a ſtrong Obligation upon them.</hi> They have indeed the Statutes of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> for their direction: but yet they ſhould make the Statutes of <hi>GOD</hi> the Man of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel; they ſhould have a <hi>Copy</hi> of theſe alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, <hi>and ſhould read therein all the dayes of their lives;</hi> and they ſhall do well if they take heed unto them: They can't be good Rulers, if they have no regard to the Rules of Righteouſneſs and of Juſtice; if they turn aſide after Lucre and take Bribes, and corrupt Judgment, they forget what the Spirit of the LORD ſaid unto <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 2. <hi>The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake unto me; he that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of the Lord.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>OF the Miniſters of Religion.</hi> That the Perſons that Exerciſe this Miniſtry in your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be <hi>Sound in the faith, holding faſt the faithful word,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 11.</p>
            <p>MAGISTRATES and <hi>KINGS,</hi> as one obſerves well, are to be Reformers of Corruption in the Church, as well as of Diſorders in the State.

            <p>THEY are alſo to take care that the dignity of the Miniſtry be preſerved, and the Contempt of the

AND let the Laws for Schools be ſupported with ſuch Sanctions as may break in pieces all the baſe, unworthy Attempts to elude them, by thoſe who are no Friends to Learning. And let GOD raiſe up <hi>of our ſons to be prophets, and our young men to be Nazarites unto the Lord.</hi> And may the Sons that the College brings forth, prove always the Joy of their Parents, and the Honor of their Tutors, the glory of the Univerſity, and a bleſſing to the Country: Peaceable to the State, and Serviceable to the Church.</p>
            <p>IN theſe things our <hi>Rulers</hi> may be Benefactors to us. You have greater <hi>Advantages</hi> to be ſo, and greater <hi>Opportunities,</hi> than other Men. You are under greater <hi>Engagements,</hi> and you have grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Encouragements:</hi> The People of GOD will Honor you in the gate, and riſe up, and call you Bleſſed; and the Churches of GOD will bleſs you; if they ſee your daily care for them, they will put up daily Prayers for you, that the great GOD would recompence all your fatherly Care of the Country and of theſe Churches into your own Boſoms. The People of the Land will be under no temptation to conſpire, or rebel againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and meditate Revolts and Revolutions, but will ſit under the ſhadow of your Government with great Satisfaction and Contentment, and the GOD that choſe our Fathers to be His People, and placed them here becauſe He delighted in them, will alſo delight in you, and <hi>remember you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all the good that you ſhall do for this people.</hi>
