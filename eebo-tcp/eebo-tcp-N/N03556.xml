            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Concerning this Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> whoſe Words I have read, we may obſerve, That it appears from the Date of his Prophecy, that he was one of the ancienteſt of the Prophets who penn'd their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and continued longeſt in the Diſcharge of the prophetical Function, during the ſucceſſive Reigns of ſeveral Kings; for the Word of the Lord came unto him in the Days of <hi>Uzziah, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> and in the Days of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the Son of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> (Chap. 1. 1.) The Prophecy conſiſts of Reproofs, and Convictions of Sin, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of divine Judgments for the awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecure People, and ſerious and urgent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to Repentance, addreſs'd both to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi>

But it may
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004350_0006_100445713ABAAEE8"/>
conduce not a little to the clearing of the Words, to take ſome Notice of the oppoſite Clauſe of the Verſe, <hi>Ephraim compaſſeth me about with Lies, and the Houſe of Iſrael with Deceit. Ephraim</hi> put in Diſtribution with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as here, is commonly uſed to denote the Houſe of the King, the Princes and Rulers of <hi>Iſrael; Jeroboam,</hi> who headed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the Defection from the inſtituted Worſhip of GOD at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> being a Man of that Tribe. And by the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is meant the Body of the ten Tribes. That which they are charged with, is, That they <hi>compaſſed GOD about with Lies, and with Deceit.</hi> In which Words the Prophet taxes the Perfidiouſneſs, Hypocriſy, and Idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> they pretended a mighty Veneration for the GOD of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Zeal for his Service; yet having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted his own Inſtitutions, and ſet up their Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and worſhipping him by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Rites of their own Invention, it was all, in GOD's Account, <hi>Deceit</hi> and a <hi>Lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perfidy, and Hypocriſy in Religion, is, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, called Lying to God. Pſal. 78. 36. <hi>They flattered him with their Mouth, and they lyed to him with their Tongues.</hi> So likewiſe is Idolatry and Falſe-worſhip; it being familiar in Scripture to term Idols, <hi>Vanities,</hi> and <hi>Lies,</hi> a <hi>Work of Errors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers of Lies.</hi>

            <p>To aggravate this Perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Prophet ſets before them the Example of <hi>Judah,</hi> (comprehending the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and other

pious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who adhered to the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the true Worſhip of GOD, after the Revolt of the ten Tribes) with an high Encomium of their Stedfaſtneſs and Integrity. <hi>But Judah yet ruleth with GOD, and is faithful with the Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. That Judah <hi>ruled with GOD.</hi> This has a direct Aſpect on the Princes and Rulers of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were peculiarly deſign'd by GOD to the Government of the Kingdom: They ruled with GOD, as his Delegates, executing their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his Honour and Intereſt, and according to the Direction of his Laws. Some indeed give us this general Meaning of the Words, <hi>Judah</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted faithfully in the Service of GOD, following him as their Guide and Ruler: for <hi>to ſerve GOD, is to rule with him.</hi> The Gloſs, I confeſs, ſeems rather ingenious than ſolid; for, however true it be (and a great Truth doubtleſs it is, tho' a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox to the World) that <q>The Service of GOD is not only true Liberty and Freedom, but Dignity and Dominion.</q> Yet that <hi>Ruling</hi> here is to be underſtood in its proper Signification, appears from the tacit Oppoſition between <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of Iſrael</hi> on the one Hand, and <hi>Judah</hi> on the other. <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the royal Tribe, that is, the Rulers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are ſuppos'd to <hi>rule without GOD,</hi> when they fell to Idolatry; yea, it was their Ambition, and Luſt of Domination, which was the Cauſe of their caſting off the true Worſhip of GOD; for this politick Reaſon it was, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up the idolatrous Worſhip of the golden Calves, and deviſed new Inſtitutions, that by this Means he might ſtrengthen his Dominion,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004350_0008_100444D2D6A6BC90"/>
and prevent the Return of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> which he feared might be occaſion'd by their Reſort to the Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to offer Sacrifice, eſpecially on the three <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>If it be ſaid, That this ſame Prophet gives a very different Character of the Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> repreſenting them as guilty of great Irregularities (for which GOD had a Controverſy with them) in ſeveral Paſſages of his Prophecy, particularly, Chap. 5. 10. <hi>The Princes of Judah were like Men that remove the Bounds;</hi> either by introducing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into GOD's Worſhip, by their impious Examples and Decrees, and ſo encroaching on GOD's Rights, and removing the Bounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or by invading the Rights and Properties

            <p>To ſolve this, we muſt recollect what has been obſerved concerning the Date of this Prophecy, which was given forth, not all at once, but in the ſeveral Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the Days of <hi>Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Whence it appears, That what the holy Prophet has left on Record, was but a brief Summary of thoſe Things that were more largely delivered in the ſucceſſive Reigns of ſo many Kings, and that as he lived and prophecy'd in the Reign of one of the worſt of them, <hi>viz Ahaz,</hi> to the Character of whoſe Reign the worſt Things here charg'd on the Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> might well agree; ſo did he alſo continue in the Diſcharge of the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Office, in the Reign of one of the beſt, his Son and Succeſſor, <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> to whoſe religious and proſperous Reign, the Character exhibited in the Text did undoubtedly belong. Thus <hi>Grotius</hi> underſtands it to be a Deſcription of the Times of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who reſtored the true Worſhip of GOD in <hi>Judah,</hi> when Corruption in Worſhip and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners did exceedingly prevail in the ten Tribes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other Inſtance of their Integrity was, That they continued <hi>faithful with the Saints:</hi> Which is to be underſtood of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> in general, including both Prince and People, as the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> betwixt this, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Branch of the Verſe, requires. This is the Praiſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> That when his Brethren of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> apoſtatiz'd to Idolatry and falſe Worſhip, he was faithful with the <hi>Moſt-Holy,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

to the marginal Verſion, that is, <hi>with GOD;</hi> which denotes his faithful and conſtant adherence to the Worſhip of God; or <hi>with the Saints,</hi> as the Text renders the Word in its moſt proper &amp; uſual Signification. He was faithful in the Service of God in Communion with all the Saints. By the <hi>Saints</hi> may be meant either the godly Patriarchs, and Predeceſſors of the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Moſes</hi> and the ſucceeding Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by whom God revealed to them his Laws and Ordinances, and directed their Worſhip and Obedience to him: So to be <hi>faithful with the Saints,</hi> is to perſevere in the Steps of their pious Anceſtors, and faithfully to retain the true Religion in its Purity, as it was tranſmitted to them by their Hands. Or by <hi>the Saints</hi> may be meant the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> the Miniſters of holy Things, who being conſecrated to God, and his ſpecial Service, were in a peculiar manner dignifyed with the Title of <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>holy Ones,</hi> the High Prieſt, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, <hi>Aaron the Saint of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Now tho' the State of the Jews under the old Teſtament, was properly a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> God himſelf being in a peculiar manner their King, having by various extraordinary Methods, form'd them a People for himſelf, took upon him, by the general Conſent of that Nation, the Government over them; their Conſtitution both civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, was of his forming, the Laws by which their Common-Wealth was adminiſtred, as well as their religious Inſtitutions were enacted by his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Authority; their Magiſtrates and Rulers were of his more immediate and peculiar Deſignation, authorized and furniſh'd by him with Powers for the execution of their Office, as his Deputies on Earth,<note n="‡" place="bottom">For which Reaſon I humbly conceive that the glorious Title of <hi>Gods</hi> in Scripture is attributed, if not appropriated only to the Magiſtrates of the Iſraelitiſh Nation, as they were in a peculiar Manner the Delagates, or Lieutenants of the God of Iſrael on Earth, impower'd by a ſpecial Commiſſion from him to execute his Laws; and eſpecially as they were in that Capacity Types of the Meſſiah, who is that in Truth, which they were in Type, <hi>God over all bleſſed for ever.</hi> To which purpoſe the Words of our Saviour are remarkable, who in quoting that Paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 82. 6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods</hi> &amp;c. from thence juſtifying his own Claim to the Title of <hi>the Son of God</hi> againſt the cavils of the Jews, thus argues, Joh. 10. 36. <hi>If he called them Gods unto whom the Word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken; ſay ye of him, whom the Father hath ſanctifyed, and ſent into the World, thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</hi> Thoſe Words, <hi>and the Scriptures cannot be broken,</hi> plainly ſhew, that the Prophet's Words were ſpoken of the Jewiſh Magiſtrates, with a typical Reference to Chriſt (in which Reſpect they have the Nature of Prophecys, and muſt be fulfilled) and were verifyed and fulfilled in him, who (being God, not only by Office, but by Nature (as the Antitype always carries in it the Truth and Reality of what was but ſhadow'd in the Type) and therefore equal to his Charge) is appointed by the Father, his high Commiſſioner to the Children of Men.</note> who were alſo favour'd with frequent

            <p>I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak in order of theſe two Branches (into which the Subject naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves itſelf.) <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of <hi>Ruling with God. Secondly,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004350_0013_1004501F85F7C560"/>
Of being <hi>faithful with the Saints.</hi> The former Branch principally concerns the Rulers of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People. The latter, the Body of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as their Rulers. Accordingly,</p>
            <p>I. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, when the Rulers of a profeſſing People may be ſaid to <hi>rule with God,</hi> and how much it will be for their Honour and Advantage ſo to do: For <hi>ruling with God</hi> ſpeaks both the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of Rulers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it ſpeaks their <hi>Duty,</hi> the Enquiry ſhall be, When may Rulers or Magiſtrates be ſaid to rule with GOD? To this I ſhall anſwer as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can, in the following Particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When they make <hi>the Glory of GOD,</hi> and <hi>the Good of their People,</hi> the great Ends of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and purſue theſe in all their Acts and Adminiſtrations. Theſe are the proper Ends of the Inſtitution of Government among Men. All civil Power and Authority being <hi>of GOD,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 1.</note> muſt be improved for him; for whatever is <hi>of him</hi> as the firſt Cauſe, muſt be <hi>to him,</hi> to his Glory and Honour, as the laſt End.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 36.</note> The next End in Subordination and Subſerviency to this, is the Good of their People: Magiſtracy being in the original Inſtitution of it, deſign'd for the maintaining and promoting the good Order, Peace, and Welfare of the ſeveral Societies of Men. <hi>He is</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Magiſtrate) <hi>the Miniſter of GOD to thee for Good.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 13 4.</note> He is ſo, by the Deſign of his Inſtitution, being ordain'd of GOD, to take Care of the publick Good, in which every Man's particular Welfare
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004350_0014_10044751DD26F3A0"/>
is involv'd. And theſe are the Ends of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Government: The ſupream Lord and Ruler of Heaven and Earth, hath a conſtant and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Regard to his own Glory, and the Good of his Creatures, in all his Adminiſtrations. 'Tis his Prerogative to rule for his own End. This Right inconteſtably belongs to him, who being an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Sovereign, has none above him to give him the Charge of the World, or take an Account of his Adminiſtration: and as he is a Being moſt excellent, infinitely and invariably perfect, can have no other Deſigns but what are great, and wiſe, and good, becoming himſelf; and, being the univerſal firſt Cauſe, muſt needs have an unalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Dominion over the Creatures, and a Right to order and govern all for his own Glory. And this his Right is confeſs'd and proclaim'd in the Adorations of the heavenly Church; the twenty four Elders caſting <hi>their Crowns before the Throne,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, Honour, and Power for thou haſt created all Things, and for thy Pleaſure,</hi> or thy Will, <hi>they are and were created.</hi>

'Twill therefore be a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Ambition in Rulers to approve themſelves Fathers and Benefactors of their Country, laying aſide all ſuch private Views, as interfere with the common Good, which their Office binds them to endeavour the Advancement of, to their power, to mend what is amiſs among their People, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Rights and Properties, and promote their true Intereſt and Proſperity, and eſpecially to ſeek the Good of the Church of GOD under

their Dominion. Thus while they anſwer the Ends of Government, and conſpire with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Ruler, in his wiſe and good Deſigns, they may be truly ſaid to rule with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they ſeek the divine Direction and govern themſelves by the Rules of GOD'S Word in the Exerciſe of their Authority. A Perſon or People is ſaid in Scripture to <hi>be with GOD</hi> while they <hi>ſeek him.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Chron. 15. 2.</note> And then may the Rulers of a People be ſaid to rule with GOD, when they are much with him in Prayer, not only on their own Account in common with all devout Chriſtians, but on the publick Account, ſeeking the divine Guidance and Bleſſing on their Counſels and Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as thoſe that acknowledge and firmly believe the Superintendency of a divine Providence over humane Affairs; and that the good or ill Succeſs of all their Enterprizes depends entirely on its Smiles or Frowns. The Weight of Government and Cares of the Publick that lie upon them, call for the united Prayers of their People. And all pious Chriſtians will think it their Duty, as they are bound by the Rules of the Goſpel, to be often &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly addreſſing Heaven on their Behalf, that they may be repleniſh'd with a Spirit of Wiſdom and Counſel, and mightily aſſiſted and ſucceeded in the Conduct of publick Affairs. Much leſs will pious Rulers, ſenſible of their Dependence on GOD, be wanting in this Duty, in which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſo immediately concern'd, and which is ſo neceſſary to engage the Divine Preſence with them, and to bring down a Divine Bleſſing on their Government, and on the People under their Care, ſo whom they ſhould be compaſſionate Interceſſors.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004350_0018_1004475D1F0953E8"/>
Such were <hi>Moſes, Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Samuel, David, Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and other pious Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> who are ſet forth as glorious Examples to all Rulers who have the Welfare of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on their Hearts. And the Prayers of pious Rulers have a mighty Power with God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure publick Bleſſings: And when they ſpirited like <hi>Moſes ſtand in the Breach,</hi> to avert the Divine Wrath, God's Hands ſeem ty'd up by their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, from executing juſt Vengeance on a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking People, as his Words to <hi>Moſes</hi> to divert him from pleading for ſinful Iſrael, <hi>Let me alone,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. 32. 10.</note> ſeem to import. When Rulers do thus approve themſelves Men of Prayer, and Interceſſors for the Publick, then do they Rule with God in the beſt Manner, as thoſe that have a powerful Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, yea, as <hi>Princes with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to maintain this Character of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are obliged not only to ſeek the divine Direction and Bleſſing, but alſo to endeavour Conformity to the Rules of Religion, the Rules of God's holy Word in the Exerciſe of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: to take the Will of GOD for their Rule, and govern themſelves in all their Counſels, and Actions, by thoſe Principles of Juſtice, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, Wiſdom and Prudence, Meekneſs, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, which the Law of Nature, and eſpecially the holy Scriptures recommend, and require in Rulers. The Kings of Iſrael were commanded by GOD to <hi>write a Copy of the Law,</hi> and to <hi>read therein</hi> all the Days of their Lives, that they might <hi>learn to fear the Lord their GOD, and to keep all the Words of his Law.</hi>

            <p>However, there is notwithſtanding ſufficient Room, &amp; Scope for the Exerciſe of the Magiſtrates Authority in, and about Matters of Religion.

            <p>And earthly Rulers, who bear the Image of his Authority in their Office, and ſuſtain the Character of his Vicegerents, are, as ſuch, under peculiar Obligations to imitate the ſupream Governour in his moral Perfections, eſpecially to endeavour a Reſemblance of him in his Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Clemency, in the Exerciſe of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and then will they give the cleareſt Proof of their ruling with him.

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Sam. 23. 2.</note> And natural Reaſon readily ſubſcribes to that divine Oracle, that ſuch as are veſted with Magiſtratical Authority over Men muſt be juſt, and neither do wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffer it to be done by others, and take Care that Juſtice may have its free Courſe in the common Wealth, by enacting righteous Laws and Rules of Government, and by a righteous and impartial Execution of them, always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an unbrib'd and unbiaſſed Diſpoſition to do Juſtice to all, without Reſpect of Perſons, in Imitation of the ſupream Judge.</p>

Now when theſe amiable divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I have mentioned, do meet in Rulers, and are carried thro' their Adminiſtration, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that God himſelf rules in, and by them, and they with him. I ſhall only add,</p>
            <p n="6">6. When they approve themſelves Perſons of ſtrict Religion and Vertue. When all their other Accompliſhments for Rule and Government, are crown'd with real and exemplary Piety. This alone, 'tis true, will not qualify a Man for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor is every ſincerely pious Man fit to be made a Magiſtrate; yet it will add a Luſtre, and give Life to a Man's other intellectual and moral Endowments, and qualify him for ruling with GOD in the forementioned Reſpects, not only as a ſubſervient Inſtrument of his Providence, as others may be, who are deſtitute of real Piety, but as one who is animated and conducted by a divine Spirit, impreſs'd with the Image of GOD, living in Communion with him, and devoted to his Service and Honour, and as ſuch, more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently (as it may be expected) aſſiſted, owned, and bleſſed of GOD in his publick Station.

Piety and Devotion towards GOD, of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Charity towards Men, and of exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Sobriety and Temperance; for how unfit are they to Rule over others, who have not yet learnt to govern themſelves, or to rule their own Appetites and Paſſions by the Laws of Reaſon and Religion? How unfit are they to puniſh: Vice and Irreligion in others, who cheriſh it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whoſe Examples will have a greater Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to corrupt the Morals of their People, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n the Puniſhments they inflict, to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them? But when Rulers diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by real Perſonal Vertue and Piety, they will not then <hi>bear the Sword in vain,</hi> but may with greater Decency and Authority, with greater Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Confidence, and hope of Succeſs, exert it for the Correction and Puniſhment of Vice and Prophaneſs, and for promoting the Reformation of Manners. Thus much may be ſignified by the Phraſe of <hi>ruling with GOD,</hi> as it ſpeaks the Duty of Rulers. I come now</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider it as it ſpeaks their <hi>Dignity,</hi> Honour, and Advantage. The Office and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Rulers among Men, in it ſelf conſider'd, is high and honourable; but when they that rule others do ſerve the Great GOD with their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in ſo doing (it may be truly ſaid, without a Paradox) they <hi>rule with him,</hi> in the loftieſt Senſe of the Phraſe, and ſhare in a ſubordinate Degree, ſome of the Dignity and Honour of the ſupream Ruler, and ſtand high in his Favour, which is the greateſt Honour that mortal Men are capable of. Two Things ſeem plainly implied in it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to the Honour and Intereſt of Rulers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That GOD will honour them with his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Preſence and Favour. Thoſe that rule with

And this Connection (in the Reaſon of the Thing) between their Duty and Privilege, is confirm'd by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſe. <hi>The Lord is with you, while you are with him.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Their Authority is, hereby, beſt eſtabliſhed and ſecured. They that rule with GOD, ſhall rule, i. e. they ſhall be confirm'd and proſper'd in the Exerciſe of their Authority, being ſupported by the Power and Preſence of the Almighty: They ſhall have the Dominion, according to GOD's Promiſe to his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they kept cloſe to him, <hi>they ſhall be above only, and ſhall not be beneath</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Deut. 28. 13.</note> The improving their Power for the Defence &amp; Maintenance of the Cauſe of GOD, Religion and Vertue, is the moſt effectual Courſe they can take for the ſtrengthning their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;

for the Cauſe of GOD has always the greateſt Strength on its Side, and ſhall ſurely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail at laſt. And their giving Encouragement and Protection to Religion, and religious People,(which is one eminent Inſtance of their ruling with GOD) will be found the beſt Support of their own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, according to that of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah, The Governors of Judah ſhall ſay in their Hearts, the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall be my Strength, in the Lord of Hoſts, their GOD.</hi> Chap. 12. 5. which as it ſeems to relate to the Times of the Goſpel, may be thus paraphras'd in the Language of the new Teſtament; <hi>The Magiſtrates of a Chriſtian People, ſhall account the true Members of the Church of Chriſt, the Citizens of the heavenly Jeruſalem, that is, pious and good Men, the Strength of their Country, and of their Government, becauſe of their Relation to, and Intereſt in GOD, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And happy are thoſe Rulers, and that People, who can thus diſcern wherein their true Intereſt lies.</p>
            <p>The Authority of Rulers thus improved for the Honour of GOD, and the publick Good, can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail of being eſtabliſh'd in the Hearts of a willing People. This will diſpoſe them to pay all due Subjection, Honour, and Tribute to them, not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake, and not only ſo, but from Intereſt, Inclination, and Choice. This will make them the Joy of their Subjects, and the Envy and Terror of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for ſaith <hi>Solomon, When the Righteous are in Authority, the People rejoyce.</hi>

Moreover, This above all Things, will make them eaſy in their poſts, as the Conſciouſneſs of their Integrity will furniſh them with a ſure Store of Confidence, that they may venture themſelves open to the Light, and need not fear the exacteſt Scrutiny and Survey of their Conduct, and will raiſe them above thoſe troubleſome Suſpicions, and Jealouſies of a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which the dark Deſigns, and corrupt Views of carnal Politicians perpetually expoſe them to. But above all this, will make them eaſy under the Proſpect of their final Account to the Judge of all, and adminiſter Peace and Comfort in a dying Hour, when having ruled with GOD as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, they may reflect with him, and ſay, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber now, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is Good in thy Sight.</hi>

Col. 1. 2.</note> And ſo we may be ſaid to be faithful with the Saints in theſe two or three Reſpects, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. When we receive, and faithfully and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably retain the true Religion, Faith, and Worſhip, as it is delivered to us in the inſpired Writings of holy Men of GOD, the Prophets and Apoſtles. As the Jewiſh Church was faithful with the Saints in adhering to the Religion tranſmitted to them by their pious Anceſtors, and to the Preſcriptions and Ordinances of the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo may Chriſtians, in a ſpecial Manner, be ſaid to be, when they adhere faithfully to the Doctrines and Inſtitutions of the new Teſtament, deliver'd to them in the ſacred Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. <hi>This is the Faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> and which all the Saints have been moſt careful to preſerve, not only for their own Uſe and Benefit, but as a ſacred De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum to be handed down to ſucceeding Ages. And this will be the beſt Evidence to Miniſters and Churches at this Day, of their being truly apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, the true and approv'd Succeſſors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, without which, all other Reaſons and Pleas
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004350_0034_10044792EB62BC38"/>
to ſupport ſuch a Claim, will plainly appear far fetch'd and inconcluſive; This, I ſay, will be the only ſure Evidence, namely, Their retaining the true Faith, the true Worſhip, and the true Piety which the Apoſtles taught and recommended by their Preaching and Example, and have tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us in their Writings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we carefully imitate the Saints that have gone before us in their Faith and Piety; not only in the Profeſſion of the true Religion, but in the Vertues of an holy Life. When we follow the Foot-ſteps of the Flock of Chriſt, and tread in the Steps of good Men, whether of ſuch as have been of our ſpecial Acquaintance, or our pious Fore-fathers, who were ſhining Patterns of Faith, Zeal, Self-denial, Charity, Humility, and other Chriſtian Vertues; or of the Saints in former Ages, whoſe pious Example is left on Record for our Imitation; as we are required to walk in the Steps of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be <hi>Followers of thoſe who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. 4. 12. Heb. 6. 12.</note> This will be the ſureſt Proof of our Faithfulneſs with the Saints, as it evidences our Fellowſhip with them in the ſame Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we faithfully adhere to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of living Saints, eſpecially thoſe of the ſacred Order, and under the Conduct of a pious and faithful Miniſtry, obſerve all the Ordinances and Commandments of GOD our Saviour, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church Fellowſhip, and duely attend the Duties that ſuch a Relation binds us to; approving our Faithfulneſs to GOD in keeping the Charge of his Covenant, in the ſeveral Inſtances I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004350_0035_10044543126C2020"/>
and maintaining a firm Conſtancy in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Truth, and in the Duties of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profeſſion, whatever Temptations ſurround us to move us from our own Stedfaſtneſs. Theſe, I take to be the principal Things intended by being <hi>faithful with the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When may this Character be applied to a People in general? Particular Perſons may be found faithful to GOD in Times of general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy and prevailing Corruption; but when may it be ſaid of a People in general, as here, they are <hi>faithful with the Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer in a Word, When not only an outward Face of Religion, or Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is kept up by a profeſſing People, but the Power and Practice of Piety, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs is found in a prevailing Degree among them; when the Body of Profeſſors keep cloſe to GOD's Inſtitutions, tho' ſome, yea many Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and wicked People may be intermix'd with them, which muſt be expected in the pureſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, 'till the great Day of Seperation; yet when Religion has the viſible Aſcendant, and no open Iniquity or Impiety is tolerated, when thoſe that bear Authority in Families, Churches, or in the State, faithfully exert their Endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Sin, and promote Religion and Vertue: When this is the Caſe of a People in general, tho' there may be yet much amiſs in them (as there was in <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Time) that calls for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet according to the Mitigations and Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Mercies of GOD are wont to allow, they may be denominated a religious faithful People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:004350_0036_1004479474BD4050"/>
So I proceed</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſhew the Connection between <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with GOD,</hi> and being <hi>faithful with the Saints.</hi> And this appears neceſſary, with Reſpect to the Perſons of Rulers, and the People under their Charge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With reſpect to the Perſons of Rulers, it is evidently ſuppos'd in their <hi>ruling with</hi> GOD, that they are alſo faithful with the Saints; that they profeſs and practice the true Faith and Religon in common with all the Saints, and uſe their Power to encourage, protect, and promote it, as I have ſhewed already. And on the other Hand, ſuppoſing Power and Dominion given to the Saints of the Moſt High, or, which is the ſame Thing, to thoſe that are faithful in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, it is quite out of Character for them to uſe their Authority for any other Ends than thoſe of GOD's Glory, the Intereſt of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Good of their People; and theſe are inſeperably link'd together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With reſpect to the People under their Charge, we may obſerve, That a People's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for Religion and Virtue will very much follow the Character of their Rulers. If they are vicious and corrupt, no Wonder Iniquity abounds in a Land, and Corruption of Manners every where prevails; when thoſe that ſhou'd be a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to evil Works and evil Workers, do rather countenance and promote them: When vile Men are exalted to Places of power and Truſt, no other can be expected but that the Wicked will walk on every Side.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 12. 8.</note> On the contrary, when Rulers
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004350_0037_1004503867B93C38"/>
are pious and faithful, and employ their Power on GOD's Side, for the Advancement of pure Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Example and Authority will go far to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage a People to Faithfulneſs in their Duty to GOD in the obſervance of his Ordinances, and will have a marvellous Influence on their Religion and Morals.</p>
            <p>And if we look over the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> we ſhall find this Obſervation commonly verifyed, That as their Rulers were well, or ill-affected to Religion, and the Worſhip of GOD, ſuch were for the moſt Part the Body of the People, who generally follow'd their Leaders. When thoſe that are in Authority are endow'd with Grace and Wiſdom from above, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their People in an Example of Piety, and uſe their Authority for its right Ends, in the Suppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vice, and Reformation of Manners, it may reaſonably be hop'd that the People under their Charge, will <hi>lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs &amp; Honeſtly.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> They have it much in their Power by the Sword of Juſtice that is put into their Hands to reſtrain and ſuppreſs the open Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of every Thing that is impious and vicious, that the criminal Actors of it ſhall be forc'd to lurk in Corners, and the Guilt lye on themſelves alone, and not on the Publick. And from the publick Countenance given to Religion, all that look for Preferment in the State, will readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what muſt be the neceſſary Qualification. And their pious Example in theſe honourable Stations will have an attractive and engaging In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on all about them, and ſerve to bring Vice and vicious Perſons into Contempt, and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004350_0038_1004479903047600"/>
Religion and Virtue into Reputation, and ſo take off much of the Prejudice that lies on the carnal Hearts of Men againſt it. We all know what an happy Influence that zealous Reſolution of <hi>Joſhua</hi> had on the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſo bravely declar'd to them, that tho' every Man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould forſake GOD and his Service, <hi>as for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord;</hi> upon which all the Motives of Honour and Conſcience conſpir'd to bring them on to join with him in the ſame noble Reſolution, <hi>We alſo will ſerve the Lord, for he is our GOD.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Joſh. 24. 15, 18.</note> And they were as good as their Word, while this zealous Magiſtrate liv'd, <hi>the People ſerv'd the Lord all the Days of Joſhua.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Judg 2. 7.</note> And thus may it be expected that a People will be found faithful with the Saints, when their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Leaders rule with GOD.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I add in the laſt Place,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it will be highly for the Intereſt and Reputation of a profeſſing People, eſpecially in Times of Degeneracy, to abide <hi>faithful with the Saints.</hi> I need not inſiſt here, the Evidences and Proofs of this are obvious to the leaſt Reflection. Thus when good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> (to whoſe Reign, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Prophet's Words to refer,) had purg'd out Corruptions of Worſhip, reſtor'd Religion to its Purity, the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> began to lift up its Head, and recover its ſinking Reputation, and GOD magnifyed him in the Sight of the Nations, and bleſs'd him with Succeſs, Victory, Wealth, and Honour. Nothing can contribute more to the Reputation of a People, than their Fidelity to GOD in keeping his Covenant, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004350_0039_1004503A695E4560"/>
This will make them <hi>high above all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Praiſe, in Name, and in Honour;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 26 19.</note> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them Eſteem and Admiration among their Neighbours. So long as there remains in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men a Senſe of the real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween moral Good and Evil, and a Conviction of the Wiſdom and Excellency of Holineſs and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and of the Turpitude of Vice, which is not wholly effaced in the moſt degenerate of Mankind; ſo long virtuous and religious People muſt be had in Honour and Eſteem.</p>
            <p>And when a People, a Church, or Community, preſerve an uncorrupted Integrity, while other Nations, and Churches, fall away from the purity of Religion; this will add the Praiſe of Conſtancy to their other Vertues, and render them more bright and illuſtrious, and recommend them to the diſtinguiſhing Regard of Heaven. And whatever may be ſuppoſed, the true <hi>Intereſt</hi> of a People de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends intirely upon this. Their moſt valuable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal Intereſts, are unqueſtionably ſecur'd hereby, and their temporal Happineſs moſt effectually provided for; which indeed is the natural Reſult of thoſe Duties GOD requires of a People, as link'd together in Society, Juſtice, Sobriety, Humility, Charity, Meekneſs, Frugality, and Diligence: theſe have a natural Influence on People's Safety, Honour, and Proſperity. But beſides this, the GOD of Heaven and Earth, will be faithful in keeping Mercy and Truth for them that are faithful and ſtedfaſt in his Covenant. GOD Almighty ſhall bleſs them, as he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, on whoſe Smiles their whole Felicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. When <hi>

For tho' theſe Things are but additional to the main Bleſſings of the Covenant, yet are they commonly beſtow'd as the Rewards of Publick Vertue: For (as has been often, and I think juſtly obſerv'd) <q>tho' par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons are capable of future Rewards and Puniſhments, which are therefore moſt uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deferr'd to another Life, yet publick Societies, as ſuch, are not; they will all be disbanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Great Day of Retribution: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they be rewarded, or puniſhed at all, as Communities, or collective Bodies, (as it is highly congruous to the Wiſdom and Juſtice of the divine Government they ſhould) it muſt be in this Life, and accordingly they uſually are either proſperous or miſerable, as either Piety and Vertue, or Irreligion and Vice abound in them, and meet with publick Countenance and Encouragement.</q>

Nevertheleſs, let it be alſo obſerv'd, that thoſe particular Perſons that abide faithful with GOD in the midſt of a degenerate People, whether in an higher or lower Station, ſhall be honour'd with ſpecial Marks of divine Approbation: And tho' they may be trampled on, and deſpiſed by the ungodly Multitude, and tho' they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in publick Judgments on a ſinful People, yet their Conſtancy and Fidelity in the Cauſe of GOD and Religion will be had in great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven, and they ſhall be ſafe in all their moſt valuable Intereſts, and a glorious Crown is reſerv'd for them. <hi>Be thou faithful unto Death,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I come now to make ſome <hi>Application</hi> of what has been diſcours'd. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of all; It might well deſerve a ſerious Inquiry, Whether, or how far, the Character which hath been open'd, may be apply'd to the preſent Incumbents of this Land? The Examination here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I ſhall leave to be purſued by all concerned, both Rulers and People; and ſhall only obſerve,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004350_0042_10044FFA99E2A1F8"/>
that as the firſt Settlement of this Country was enterpriz'd on a religious Account, ſo when it is conſider'd what an uncommon Spirit of Zeal, and Self-denial animated our pious Fore-Fathers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in ſo hazardous and expenſive an Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in tranſporting themſelves and their Families into this remote Wilderneſs for the Sake of a purer Reformation, which they had long contended for in vain, eſpecially for the Purity of Goſpel Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, a pure ſcriptural Worſhip and Diſcipline, which, thro' the Iniquity of the Times, they were not allow'd the peaceable Enjoyment of in their native Land: And when it is conſider'd how much it was their Concern to lay Religion in the Foundation of their Settlement, and to erect Churches to our Lord Jeſus according to Scripture Pattern, and ſo to ſet up his Kingdom in theſe Ends of the Earth, to aſſert and vindicate his ſole Authority as King and Head of the Church, to Rule in it by his own Laws and Ordinances, that they might obſerve all, and only the Things that he has commanded, and not only enjoy for themſelves, but tranſmit and ſecure to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Poſterity, the Covenant Enjoyment of all the Ordinances and precious Things of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo to order their civil Conſtitution and Adminiſtration, as might beſt ſerve the Purpoſes of Religion and Reformation: And what emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Examples they generally were of true practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Religion, of Chriſtian Piety, Charity, Juſtice, Self-denial, and Sobriety: When theſe Things, I ſay, are conſidered, little doubt remains, but that it might be juſtly and truly ſaid of them that they <hi>ruled with GOD, and were faithful with his Saints.</hi> And GOD was ſignally preſent with them, and own'd them by the remarkable Appearances of his Providence for them; in protecting and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering them. But alas! how viſible and ſad are
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:004350_0043_10045044E31F8BF0"/>
our Degeneracies at this Day? We have been <hi>going away from GOD's Ordinances from the Days of our Fathers, and have not kept them.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint began in their Day, and the Grounds of it have been increaſing ſince. I am loth to take up the Lamentation of the Prophet, and ſay, <hi>How is the faithful City become an Harlot?</hi> Iſai. 1 21. I wou'd hope Things are not yet come to this paſs among us: Nay, I am perſwaded, that notwithſtanding our Degeneracies, there is yet, to the Praiſe of divine Grace, a very conſiderable Number, among all Ranks, of ſerious devout Chriſtians, who are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of undiſſembled Piety; and doubt not but the Son of GOD, our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who ſtill walks in the midſt of his Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, yet obſerves many Things commendable in theſe Churches, which he beholds from Heaven with a well pleaſed Eye. But at the ſame Time we may as little doubt, that he has Cauſe enough to ſay to the <hi>New England</hi> Churches, as he did to the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Nevertheleſs, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt you, becauſe you have left your firſt Love.</hi> The former Strictneſs in Religion, that Brotherly-Love, that Publick Spirit, and Zeal for the Order and Ordinances of the Goſpel, which was ſo much the Glory of our Fathers, is very much abated, yea diſreliſhed by too many: and a Spirit of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, and Neutrality in Religion, of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs and Contention, Pride &amp; Senſuality, and other corrupt Manners and Practices of a World that lies in Wickedneſs, ſo oppoſite to the Ways of GOD's People, do exceedingly prevail in the midſt of us.</p>
            <p>We have, its true, the outward Symbols of true Chriſtianity among us; the Oracles of GOD, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, an inſtituted Miniſtry, Ordinations to that ſacred Office, ordinarily managed with
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004350_0044_10044FFF8A9FF0B0"/>
great Solemnity, Goſpel-Truths in their Purity gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taught in our Churches, &amp; ſolemn Covenantings with GOD: We have our Sabbaths, our Sacraments, and religious Aſſemblies, Days of Faſting, and Thankſgiving: Yet all this amounts to no more than a Form of Godlineſs, while in the mean Time, that real vital Piety, which ſhould diffuſe a Life and Beauty into this external Face of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is greatly under Decays, as it has been long obſerved and lamented by the pious and faithful in our Iſrael. And tho' we appear together on theſe Anniverſaries, from all Quarters of the Land, with the Heads of our People, to pay our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acknowledgments to the GOD of our Fathers, and our GOD, and to inquire in his Temple, and to uſher in our civil Tranſactions with ſolemn Prayer, and conſult the Oracles of GOD, and ſo far we are doubtleſs in the Way of our Duty; yet if after all we will not be guided by this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, what do we more than the <hi>Jews</hi> in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and degenerate Times? <hi>They ſeek me daily,</hi> ſaith God by the Prophet, <hi>and delight to know my Ways, as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook not the Ordinances of their GOD, they ask of me the Ordinance of Juſtice, &amp;c.</hi> When at the ſame Time, GOD bids his Prophet, <hi>Cry aloud, &amp; ſpare not, lift up his Voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew his People their Tranſgreſſions, and the Houſe of Jacob their Sins.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. 58 1, 2.</note> Our religious Formalities without the Life and Power of Religion, inſtead of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending us to the Favour of GOD, will but add new Matter of Provocation to him.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Divine Rebukes on the Land in a variety of judicial Diſpenſations, tho' intermixt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004350_0045_1004455ADFF2DD10"/>
with abundance of Mercy, are a plain Intimation that GOD has a Controverſy with us for our Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, and Unfaithfulneſs in his Covenant. For all his Judgments on a profeſſing People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to <hi>avenge the Quarrel of his Covenant.</hi> But that which is the moſt lamentable Symptom of all is our Security under the Rebukes of Heaven, and Inſenſibleneſs of the Anger of GOD manifeſted therein againſt us, (while we are apt to terminate our Views and Complaints on ſecond Cauſes of our Troubles and Grievances) and (as the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof) our Incorrigibleneſs, and walking contrary to GOD in the Ways of his Judgments, and neglecting a practical Compliance with the Deſign of them, which is to humble and reform us. And if we go on in our Departures from GOD, without being reclaim'd by more gentle Corrections, we may juſtly fear that the Wrath of GOD which has been ſo long impending over us, will break out upon us in more awful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Inſtances of Severity, than have been yet ſeen, or known. For what elſe can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected according to GOD's ordinary Methods, as the Conſequence of the Apoſtacies of a People ſo highly favour'd on religious Accounts as we have been?

            <p>And whatever Temptations and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments our Miniſtry may be attended with, if we can but obtain Mercy to be faithful, whatever our Succeſs be, the Conſciouſneſs of our Fidelity and Integrity will afford Matter of inexpreſſible Joy; and we may be aſſured of our Maſter's Approbation in that bleſſed <hi>Euge,</hi> than which we can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater in our Aim and Deſire, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant.</hi>

in which we muſt manifeſt our Obedience to GOD. Conſider it therefore, as that which is of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance to your ſpiritual and temporal Welfare, to be faithful to GOD in the Obſervance of his Covenant and Commandments.</p>

And were we as faithful to our ſolemn covenant Engagements, it might reaſonably be hop'd that GOD would as remarkably diſtinguiſh us with his Favours. As when he came upon Terms with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and undertook their Protection, <hi>He ſaid, ſurely they are my People, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will not lie:</hi> That will not deal falſely and perfidiouſly with him, to whom they had vowed Fealty and Allegiance, <hi>ſo he was their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>

The free, and unmoleſted Enjoyment of ſuch Goſpel Inſtitutions was the known Deſign of our Fathers in coming hither. Theſe Things indeed do belong to the Form of Godlineſs; yet have they a vital Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the Power thereof, inſomuch that where this is wanting, they will be either wholly neglected, or but careleſly and ſuperficially at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.

of theſe divine Inſtitutions, which are deſign'd for the Honour of GOD in the World, and a publick Teſtimony of his People's Loyalty and Subjection to him, which have ever been had in precious Eſteem with all real Saints, as the Means of maintaining and improving their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life in Communion with GOD, till they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to immediate Viſion in the Life of Heaven, and alſo as the Means of reviving the Power of Godlineſs when it is fallen into Decay. When it pleaſes GOD to ſend down his quickening Spirit upon a People, who have very much loſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Life of Religion, and have degenerated into Lukewarmneſs and Formality, he ordinarily makes Uſe of the Inſtituted Forms of Religion among them, as the Vehicles of thoſe heavenly Influences, particularly the Word preached and heard, Faſting and Prayer. And by this Means, Religion is propagated from Parents to Children, from one Generation to another. Wherefore</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Article which demands your moſt ſerious Regards is the keeping up <hi>Family Religion,</hi> Family Inſtruction, Worſhip and Government. 'Tis not to be doubted, but that the Licentiouſneſs of Youth, and moſt of the Iniquities that abound in the Land, are mainly owing to the criminal Remiſsneſs of Governours of Families, or of thoſe that ought to be ſo, with reſpect to the religious Education of thoſe under their Charge. And all that Magiſtrates or Miniſters can do to reform them, will be to little Purpoſe, unleſs Heads of Families faithfully do their Part: And if there be any Hope of a more general Reformation and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is amiſs among us, it muſt chiefly be done by a more ſtrict Care of Family Religion, and of the virtuous and pious Education of Youth.

            <p>Thus having, as the Time and my Talent would admit (tho', I fear, very imperfectly) preſented to your View the Things, which I apprehend, are of greateſt Importance at this Day, to the ſeveral Ranks and Orders to whom my Diſcourſe has been applied: Suffer me now to make Uſe of the Words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that moving Addreſs to <hi>Iſrael, Set your Hearts unto all the Words which I teſtify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you this Day—for it is not a vain Thing for you, becauſe it is your Life, and thro' this Thing ye ſhall prolong your Days in the Land.</hi>
