            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>DEUTERONOMY IV. 5, 6.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Behold, I have taught you ſtatutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye ſhould do ſo in the land whether ye go to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it.</p>
                  <p>Keep therefore, and do them; for this is your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and your underſtanding in the ſight of the nations, which ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, Surely this great nation is a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding people.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE are not left in doubt, concerning the wiſdom and ſalutary nature of that conſtitution under which the Hebrews were placed, as it proceeded immediately from GOD; and, in reference to the particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that people, was the reſult of unerring perfection. It was a free conſtitution, in which,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024820_0005_0FC965669857E730"/>
all the valuable rights of the community were moſt happily ſecured. The public good, was the great object in view, and, the moſt effectual care was taken to preſerve the rights of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals. Proper rewards were promiſed to the obedient, and righteous puniſhments allotted for the diſobedient. GOD deſigned, for ſpecial reaſons, that the ſeed of Abraham, ſhould be diſtinguiſhed in a peculiar manner from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations; he therefore undertook the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of them himſelf, in all matters reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting religion, civil policy, and that military eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment, which he ſaw to be neceſſary for their happineſs and defence. We find Moſes, who received this conſtitution from GOD, and delivered it to his people, frequently exhorting them, to maintain a ſacred regard for this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, and to pay a conſcientious obedience to all its laws: in doing of which, they might ſecure to themſelves national proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and enjoy, the unfailing protection of Almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>To deter them from diſobedience, he called up their attention to that ſolemn ſcene which opened to their view, when they ſtood before the LORD their GOD in Horeb: when there were thunders, and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; ſo that all the people that was in the camp trembled. And the LORD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, ſaying, <hi>gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they ſhall live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and that they may teach their children.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:024820_0006_0FC9656CC2E6D028"/>
               <hi>For the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD, <hi>is a conſuming fire, even a jealous</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>THE argument made uſe of in the text, to excite in that people, a ſpirit of obedience to their conſtitution and laws, was this, that it would raiſe their character in the ſight of the nations: who from thence would be led, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a veneration for them, as a great nation, a wiſe and underſtanding people. This ſacred paſſage, in connection with the important oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, which hath called us to the houſe of GOD, this morning, may direct our attention to the following enquiry.</p>
            <p>IN what, doth the true wiſdom of a people, a civil community, conſiſt?</p>
            <p>THE general anſwer to this queſtion, may not be difficult; it will no doubt, be readily admitted, that the higheſt wiſdom of a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of intelligent beings, muſt conſiſt, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing that line of conduct, which ſhall have the moſt direct and ſure tendency to promote the beſt good of the whole, both in time, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. What ever creatures, may conceive to be a good, either, through imperfection of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or degeneracy of heart; yet, if that which they call good, is inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with more pain than pleaſure, taking in the whole of their exiſtence; then it cannot with propriety be ſtyled good, certainly not the beſt good, conſequently wiſdom will not chooſe it. The province of wiſdom, is, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and elect the moſt valuable objects; and, to adopt the beſt means to obtain them. Theſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024820_0007_0FC9656E19369700"/>
obſervations, apply with equal force, to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, and communities; to all claſſes of men, whether in the higher, or, lower walks of life. Communities, moſt certainly, as well as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, under the guidance of wiſdom, will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue that conduct which ſhall be productive of their higheſt happineſs, in every period of their exiſtence. But the queſtion returns, what is that conduct, which ſhall have the deſired ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and will effect the higheſt good? This queſtion, as it reſpects mankind at large in their preſent ſtate, might admit, a great variety of anſwers: ſome of which, may demand parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice on the preſent occaſion. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WISDOM will direct a community, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh a good ſyſtem of government. It may be a queſtion, whether the all wiſe GOD ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, that any of his intelligent creatures, even in a ſtate of perfection, ſhould exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome kind of government, and ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt themſelves. All creatures, have not the ſame capacities; neither are they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under equal advantages; and, if thoſe may be found, whoſe capacities are equally exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſtill they are different; and ſeem to be deſigned for different purpoſes, and ſtations, in the great ſyſtem. We read, of thrones, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, principalities, and powers amongſt the angelic hoſts: which titles, denote various ſtations among thoſe ſinleſs beings, that they are differently employed, in degrees of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to each other, in the government of that holy family of which, GOD, is the father. But, however this may be, as our acquaintance with that world of glory, is very imperfect—
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024820_0008_0FC9656F8D1574F0"/>
yet it is beyond a doubt, that government was deſigned, and is abſolutely neceſſary for men on earth, in their preſent ſtate of degeneracy.</p>
            <p>CREATURES, who have riſen in rebellion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy and perfect government of JEHOVAH; have partial connections, ſelfiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, paſſions and luſts, which often interfere with each other, and which, will not always be controlled by reaſon, and the mild influence of moral motives, however great: but theſe in their external expreſſions, muſt be under the reſtraint of law, or there can be no peace, no ſafety among men. Some kind of government, is therefore indiſpenſibly neceſſary for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind, that they may partake of the ſecurity, and other important bleſſings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from ſociety; which cannot be enjoyed in a ſtate of nature. Without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the various forms of government which have been adopted, in different ages and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; that, may be the beſt for a particular people, which in the view of all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, affords the faireſt proſpect of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs, and of ſecuring the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable privileges of the community, in its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
            <p>CIVIL liberty is one of the moſt important bleſſings which men poſſeſs of a temporal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the moſt valuable inheritance on this ſide heaven. That conſtitution may therefore be eſteemed the beſt, which doth moſt effectually ſecure this treaſure to a community. That liberty conſiſts in freedom from reſtraint, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il liberty, conſiſts in the being and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a ſyſtem of laws, as doth bind all claſſes of men, rulers and ſubjects, to unite their exertions for the promotion of virtue and public happineſs. That happy conſtitution enjoyed by the Hebrews, of which, the Supreme Law giver was the immediate author, was no other, than a ſyſtem of good laws, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtatutes: which limited the powers and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of magiſtrates, deſignated the duties of ſubjects, and obliged each to that obedience to law, and exchange of ſervices, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to mutual benefit.<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. iv. 8.</note> "And what nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgments ſo righteous, as all this law which I ſet before you this day."

The laws of a ſtate, ſhould equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bind every member, whether his ſtation be the moſt conſpicuous, or, the moſt obſcure.

A conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, founded upon the general and immutable laws of righteouſneſs and benevolence, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to their particular circumſtances, will therefore become a primary object with a wiſe and underſtanding people.</p>

and if there be any other thing that is contrary to ſound doctrine." It is unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the vices of man which are inimical to ſociety, will be reſtrained by ſilent laws ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting upon paper: they muſt be carried into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and be known to have an active exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſuch as contemn the law, may not only read, but feel the reſentment of the community.</p>
            <p>IT is not within the reach of human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to look with preciſion into futurity, to diſcover all the circumſtances and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies which may take place among a people: neither is it certain, that every perſon who may poſſeſs a fair character for ability and integrity, and who may be called into public life, will be governed in all his actions, by public and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted motives. Through neceſſary imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or corrupt deſign, ſtatutes may be enacted, which may not prove ſalutary in their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but greatly prejudicial to the common good: hence ariſeth the neceſſity of alterations and amendments, in all human ſyſtems.</p>
            <p>CHANGES however, ſhould be few as poſſible; for the ſtrength and reputation of government, doth not a little depend upon the uniformity and ſtability obſerved in its adminiſtration. Laws while they remain ſuch, ought to be executed, when found to be uſeleſs or hurtful, they may be repealed: to have laws in force and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, or to obſtruct the natural courſe of law in a free ſtate, muſt be dangerous; will have many hurtful tendencies, will greatly weaken government, and render all the intereſts of the community inſecure. Liberty, property and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024820_0012_0FC9657D2D4BCF58"/>
life, are all precarious, in a ſtate where laws ceaſe in their execution. When known breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of law paſs with impunity, and open tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors go unpuniſhed; when executive offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers grow remiſs in their duty, eſpecially, when they connive at diſobedience: all diſtinctions betwixt virtue and vice will vaniſh, authority will ſink into diſrepute, and government will be trampled in the duſt—for which reaſons, with others that might be named, it muſt be the wiſdom, the indiſpenſible duty of all characters in ſociety, to unite their exertions, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of righteous laws, in their regular admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration. As it would be exceedingly unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect, that any people, can ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize the benefits of good government, under a weak, or a wicked adminiſtration—in which, perſons deſtitute of abilities, or, of ſtable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of righteouſneſs and goodneſs, fill the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious departments of the ſtate. Hence,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE wiſdom of a people will appear in the election of good rulers.</p>
            <p>THE peace and happineſs of communities, have a neceſſary dependance, under GOD, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the character and conduct of thoſe who are called to the adminiſtration of government. A bad conſtitution, under the direction of wiſe and pious rulers, who have capacity to diſcern, diſpoſition and reſolution to purſue the public good, may become a bleſſing; being made to ſubſerve many valuable purpoſes. But the beſt conſtitution, committed to rulers of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary deſcription, may be ſubverted; or ſo abuſed, as to become a curſe: and be rendered
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024820_0013_0FC9657E9EE8D780"/>
productive of the moſt miſchievous conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The underſtanding, or folly, of a people in reference to their temporal intereſts, is in nothing more conſpicuous, than in the choice of civil rulers. In free ſtates the body of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have it in their power to be governed well; if faithful to themſelves and the public, in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe to offices of truſt and importance, who are poſſeſſed of abilities and have merited their confidence by former good ſervices.</p>
            <p>KNOWLEDGE and fidelity, are qualifications indiſpenſibly neceſſary to form the character of good magiſtrates. No man, ever poſſeſſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or acquired abilities, too great for the diſcharge of the duties conſtantly incumbent upon thoſe, who act as the repreſentatives of the Moſt High GOD, in the government of their fellow creatures: multitudes however well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, are totally incapable of ſuch truſt. The intereſts of ſociety are always important, they are many times involved in extreme difficulty, through the weakneſs of ſome, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of others; and there is need of the moſt extenſive knowledge, wiſdom and prudence, to direct the various oppoſing intereſts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals into one channel, and guide them all to a ſingle object, the public good. Wo to that people, to whom GOD by his providence in judgment ſhall ſay; "I will give children to be their princes, and babes ſhall rule over them. And the people ſhall be oppreſſed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the antient, and the baſe againſt the honourable. And judgment is turned away backward, and juſtice ſtandeth afar off: for truth is fallen in

            <p>IT is the intereſt and privilege of an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened free people, to be acquainted with the characters of their moſt worthy citizens, who are candidates for public offices in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and, it is equally their intereſt and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, to make choice of thoſe only to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who are known among their tribes, for wiſdom and piety. Following the ſalutary counſel of the prince of Midian, they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear GOD, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>FREE republicans, as obſerved above, have it in their power to be governed well: but they are in the utmoſt danger through a wanton abuſe of this power. Actuated, by noble pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirited motives, and a primary regard to real merit in their elections; they will have the heads of their tribes, as fathers to lead them in paths of ſafety and peace: under the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch rulers, who conſider their ſubjects as brethren, and children, and all the intereſts of the community as their own; a people can hardly fail of all that happineſs of which ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties are capable in this degenerate ſtate.</p>
            <p>BUT when party ſpirit, local views, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted motives, direct their ſuffrages, when
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024820_0016_0FC9658965DBA298"/>
they looſe ſight of the great end of government the public good, and give themſelves up, to the baneful influence of paraſitical demagogues, they may well expect to reap the bitter fruits of their own folly, in a partial wavering ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Through the neglect, or abuſe of their privileges, moſt ſtates have loſt their liberties; and have fallen a prey to the avarice and ambition of deſigning and wicked men. "When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn." This joy, or mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, among a people, greatly depends on their own conduct in elections—bribery here, is the bane of ſociety—the man who will give or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reward in this caſe, muſt be extremely ignorant, not to deſerve the ſtigma of an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the ſtate—and ſhould he have addreſs to avoid diſcovery, he muſt be deſtitute of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, not to feel himſelf to be deſpicable.

4. WISDOM will lead a people to maintain a ſacred regard to righteouſneſs, in reference to the public, and individuals.</p>
            <p>MORAL righteouſneſs is one of thoſe ſtrong bonds by which all public ſocieties are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Heathen nations ignorant of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and the particular duties and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are enlightened and inforced by the word and authority of GOD; have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs been ſenſible, of the great importance of moral righteouſneſs. Greece and Rome, in the beginning of their greatneſs, before they ſunk into effeminacy and corruption, were careful to encourage and maintain public and private juſtice: they laboured to diffuſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of righteouſneſs among all ranks of their citizens. Many of their writings on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, deſerve attention ſo far as the obſervance of moral duties reſpect civil communities, and the well-being of mankind in the preſent world. As all civil communities have their foundation in compacts, by which individuals immerge out of a ſtate of nature, and become one great whole, cemented together by voluntary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; covenanting with each other, to obſerve ſuch regulations, and perform ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as may tend to mutual advantage: hence ariſeth the neceſſity of righteouſneſs, this being the baſis on which all muſt depend. When this fails, compacts will be diſregarded, men will looſe a ſenſe of their obligations to each other, inſtead of confidence and harmony, will be a ſpirit of diſtruſt and fear, every man will be afraid of his neighbour; jealouſies will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt betwixt rulers and ſubjects, the ſtrength of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024820_0018_0FC9658D956D5230"/>
the community will be loſt in animoſity and diviſion, all ability for united exertion will be deſtroyed, and, the bonds of ſociety being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it muſt be diſſolved. It was long ſince obſerved, by one of the greateſt and wiſeſt of kings, and will for ever remain true; "That righteouſneſs exalteth a nation: but ſin is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any people." The truth of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine maxim doth not depend upon any arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtitution, or, poſitive ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but flows from the reaſon and nature of things.</p>
            <p>THERE is in the conſtitution of heaven, an eſtabliſhed connection, between the practice of righteouſneſs and the happineſs of moral be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings united in ſociety. Public faith, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate juſtice, lay a foundation, for public ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it and vigorous exertion to reſt upon; in ſuch a ſtate, every one will receive a proper reward for his ſervice, let his ſtation be what it may: and every delinquent, will realize ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as his offence, or neglect of duty may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. In a fixed regular courſe of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative and diſtributive juſtice, all may know before hand, what the reward of their conduct will be. What the apoſtle hath ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural body, and applied to the church of CHRIST: may with equal propriety and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle variation, be applied to political ſocieties. Theſe bodies are compoſed of various members, the members have various offices, but all of them are neceſſary, for the well being of the whole; there is ſomething due from the body to every member, and from every member to the body: every part is to be regarded,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024820_0019_0FC9658F154A5910"/>
and righteouſneſs maintained throughout the whole.</p>
            <p>THE members of a well organized civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, under an equal and juſt adminiſtration, have no more reaſon to complain of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alloted to them in providence; than the members of the natural body, have of the place, by GOD aſſigned them in that. "The eye cannot ſay unto the head, I have no need of thee; nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the head to to the feet, I have no need of you. But that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another. And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it: or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it." No member of the natural body, of a civil community, or of GOD's moral kingdom, can be required to do more, than ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the proper duty of its own ſtation: when this is performed, all is done which can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be demanded, it hath done well, and may expect the approbation and protection of the whole body.</p>
            <p>MEN may indeed complain, becauſe they are not angels; and do it with as much propriety, as to feel diſcontented, becauſe they are not all placed at the head of civil communities. The allwiſe GOD, hath given us our capacities, and fixed our ſtations, and when righteouſneſs is obſerved by us, and the community of which we are members, we ſhall then do, and receive, what belongs to us, and this is all we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably deſire.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE wiſdom of a people eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, in paying an unfeigned obedience to the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024820_0020_0FC9659487272570"/>
inſtitutions of that religion, which the Supreme Lawgiver hath eſtabliſhed in his church on earth.</p>
            <p>THAT religion, which GOD hath enjoined upon rational beings, is not only neceſſary for his glory, but eſſential to their happineſs. To eſtabliſh a character as being truly religious, under the light of divine revelation, it is by no means ſufficient, that men ſhould barely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the exiſtence and general provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one ſupreme DEITY. From this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light, we obtain decided evidence, that the Almighty Father, hath ſet his well beloved Son the bleſſed IMMANUEL, as King upon his holy hill of Zion. This DIVINE perſon, in his mediatorial character, "is exalted, far above all principality, and power, and might, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo, in that which is to come. And all things are put under his feet. That at the name of JESUS, every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs, that JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST is LORD, to the glory of GOD the Father."</p>
            <p>IN vain, do guilty mortals worſhip the great Jehovah, and preſent their ſervices before him, but, in the name, and for the ſake of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mediator. For it is his will "that all men ſhould honor the Son, even as they honor the Father."</p>
            <p>COMMUNITIES, have their exiſtence in, and from, this glorious perſonage. The kingdom is his, and he ruleth among the nations.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024820_0021_0FC96596D9DC0A78"/>
Through his bounty, and ſpecial providence, it is, that a people enjoy the ineſtimable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and numerous advantages of a well regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted civil ſociety: through his influence, they are inſpired with underſtanding to adopt, with ſtrength and public ſpirit to maintain, a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous conſtitution: HE gives able impartial rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to guide in paths of virtue and peace; or ſets up over them the baſeſt of men. By his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible hand, ſtates are preſerved from internal convulſions, and ſhielded by his Almighty arm from external violence: or, through his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential diſpleaſure, they are given as a prey to their own vices; or to the luſts and paſſions of other ſtates, to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>THUS abſolutely dependant, are temporal communities, and all human things, upon HIM who reigneth King in Zion. "Be wiſe now therefore, O ye kings; be inſtructed, ye judges of the earth. Kiſs the Son leſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him."</p>
            <p>THE holy religion of the Son of GOD, hath a moſt powerful and benign influence upon moral beings in ſociety. It not only reſtrains malicious revengeful paſſions, and curbs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly luſts; but will in event, eradicate them all from the human breaſt—it implants all the divine graces and ſocial virtues in the heart—it ſweetens the diſpoſitions of men, and fits them for all the pleaſing ſatisfactions, of rational friendſhip—teaches them ſelf denial—inſpires them with a generous public ſpirit—fills them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024820_0022_0FC96598F67B6B10"/>
with love to others, to righteouſneſs and mercy—makes them careful to diſcharge the duties of their ſtations—diligent and contented in their callings—this, beyond any other conſideration, will increaſe the real dignity of rulers—will give quiet and ſubmiſſion to ſubjects—this is the only true and genuine ſpirit of liberty, which can give abiding union and energy to ſtates—and will enable them to bear proſperity without pride—and ſupport them in adverſity without dejection—this will afford all claſſes of men conſolation in death, and render them happy in GOD, their full eternal portion, in the coming world.</p>
            <p>RELIGION, therefore is the glory of all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent beings, from the higheſt angel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IF the preceding obſervations, have their foundation in reaſon, and the word of GOD: we ſee the happy connection between religion and good government. The idea that there is, and ought to be, no connection between reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and civil policy, appears to reſt upon this abſurd ſuppoſition; that men by entering into ſociety for mutual advantage, become quite a different claſs of beings from what they were before, that they ceaſe to be moral beings; and conſequently, looſe their relation and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024820_0023_0FC9659BB024E3E0"/>
to GOD, as his creatures and ſubjects: and alſo their relations to each other as rational ſocial creatures. If theſe are the real conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of civil connections, they are unhappy indeed, as they muſt exceedingly debaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade human nature: and it is readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, theſe things being true, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can have no further demands upon them. But, if none of the relations or obligations of men to their Creator, and each other are loſt by entering into ſociety; if they ſtill remain moral and accountable beings, and, if religion is the glory and perfection of moral beings, then the connection, between religion and good government is evident—and all attempts to ſeparate them are unfriendly to ſociety, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imical to good government, and muſt originate in ignorance or bad deſign.</p>
            <p>RELIGION eſſentially conſiſts in friendly affection to GOD, and his rational offspring; and ſuch affection, can never injure that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which hath public happineſs for its object.</p>
            <p>ATTEMPTS have been made to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween moral and political wiſdom—moral and political righteouſneſs—as tho there were two kinds of wiſdom and righteouſneſs, diſtinct in their nature, and applicable only to different ſubjects: that which is moral, belonging to the government of men as ſubjects of GOD's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and that which is political, to men as jubjects of civil rule—But, if wiſdom and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, are the ſame in the fountain, as in the ſtreams, in GOD, as in his creatures; differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024820_0024_0FC9659DC4615680"/>
not in nature and kind, but only in degree, then all ſuch diſtinctions are manifeſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foundation. We read it is true, of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kind of wiſdom, the fruit of which is "bitter envying and ſtrife and every evil work: and that this wiſdom, is earthly, ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and deviliſh." But, until it is made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that this is more friendly to civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the wiſdom "from above, which is pure and peaceable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy:"<note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. xiv.—18</note> the ſuppoſed diſtinction, will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to human governments with advantage—nor, deſtroy the connection between religion and good government.</p>
            <p>RELIGION and civil government, are not one and the ſame thing: tho' both may, and are deſigned to embrace ſome of the ſame objects, yet the former, extends its obligations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns immenſely beyond what the latter can pretend too: and it hath rights and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, with which the latter may not intermeddle. Still, there are many ways, in which civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il government may give countenance, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and even ſupport to religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out invading the prerogatives of the Moſt High; or, touching the inferior, tho ſacred rights of conſcience: and in doing of which, it may not only ſhew its friendly regard to chriſtianity, but derive important advantages to itſelf.</p>
            <p>THE friends of true happineſs, whether min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters of ſtate, or miniſters of religion, or, in what ever character they may act, will therefore

exert themſelves to promote that cauſe, which aims at no leſs an object, than the glory of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH, and the higheſt felicity of his unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eternal kingdom.</p>
            <p>A CIVIL community, formed, organized, and adminiſtered, agreeably to the principles which have been ſuggeſted, will poſſeſs internal peace and energy; its ſtrength and wealth may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be collected for neceſſary defence, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will ever be prepared to repel foreign injuries: it will enjoy proſperity within itſelf, and become reſpectable amongſt the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>COULD this, and the other ſtates in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Republic in their ſeparate and united capacities, be eſtabliſhed upon the principles of true wiſdom, that righteouſneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which have their foundation in the nature of things, and are eſſential parts, of the chriſtian ſyſtem—could we build upon this foundation, we might ſet forth a good example, and become a bleſſing to mankind—in this way we might eſtabliſh our character as a wiſe and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people—become<note n="*" place="bottom">Solomons Song vi. 4. and 10.</note> "beautiful as Tirzah, comely as Jeruſalem"—we ſhould "look forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the ſun, and terrible as an army with banners."</p>

THESE thoughts, may call our grateful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to the honourable and venerable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, collected this morning in the houſe of GOD. Some reſpectful, ſerious addreſſes, to the different characters here preſent may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,</p>
            <p>SEATS of dignity in free republics are truly honorable, where merit, and the voice of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted citizens are the only cauſes of eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt Magiſtrate in ſuch a ſtate, is more reſpectable than the moſt powerful Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, who obtains his throne, either by arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſurpation, the arts of venality, or even the fortunate circumſtance of hereditary ſucceſſion. In either of the inſtances ſuppoſed, the throne may be filled without perſonal worth, may be ſupported by the ſame means by which it was at firſt obtained, and may be improved for the purpoſes of idleneſs and diſſipation: or what is worſe, to conſume the wealth, deſtroy the liberties, and even ſport with the lives of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. By means of ſuch abuſe of power, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be rendered vaſtly more wretched, than they would have been in a ſtate of nature; and yet find it extremely difficult, to extricate themſelves from theſe complicated evils. But ſuch abuſe of power cannot ſo eaſily take place, or be continued, in free republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: where places of honor are inſeparably connected with important duties; duties which muſt be performed, otherwiſe ſuch places will not long be ſupported, under the jealous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of a people, poſſeſſed of the knowledge,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024820_0027_0FC965A28904E238"/>
and love of liberty, together with the means of its preſervation.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations, add to the merit, and increaſe the luſtre of thoſe worthy characters, which have been repeatedly called by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted voice of their brethren to preſide in this State. The underſtanding of this people and their knowledge of worth, have been conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, in the attention generally paid, to deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perſonages in the election of their rulers: eſpecially in the long ſucceſſion of wiſe religious governors, whoſe eminent talents, and pious examples, have been ſo extenſively beneficial to this community. May your Excellency's name, in this honourable catalogue, remain a laſting memorial, of the many ſervices which you have rendered to this people, as a public teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the reſpect of your enlightened fellow citizens: and may your unremitted exertions for their proſperity be continued, and all your benevolent endeavours to promote their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal intereſts, meet the divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing—may you never bear that ſword in vain, which the exalted MEDIATOR, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of men, hath put into your hand; let this be a ſhield to the innocent, the widow, and the orphan, in their oppreſſions; while it remains a terror, to all ſuch as do evil: you will if poſſible, ſcatter the wicked with your eyes, but when coercion becomes neceſſary, you will bring the wheel over them. Senſible of the weighty cares, and ſtrong temptations of your exalted ſtation, may your dependance, be increaſingly fixed on that glorious and gracious Being, who hath called you to office; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his approbation infinitely ſuperior to the applauſe of mortals. By the weight of your example, and the influence of that authority with which you are clothed, may you, ſir, do much for the honor of GOD the Redeemer, for the advancement of his holy religion among men—for the promotion of righteouſneſs and peace, in this, and the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca—for the abolition of ſlavery and every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of oppreſſion—for the increaſe of civil and religious liberty, in the earth—And when, by the Supreme Diſpoſer of all events, you may be called, to relinquiſh the honors, and cares of this mortal life, our prayer to Almighty GOD, is, that in that ſolemn hour, you may enjoy the ſupports of conſcious integrity, meet with the approbation of your Judge, and be graciouſly received to the ſociety of the bleſſed.</p>
            <p>THE public addreſs, may now, be reſpectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented, to his Honor the Lieutenant-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, the Council, and Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>HONORED GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>THE truſt, which GOD, and this reſpectable commonwealth, have repoſed in you is truly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. All the temporal intereſts of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in a ſenſe, are put into your hands and committed to your management, for the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral good. Children place ſtrong confidence, in the wiſdom and tender care of their natural parents; ſo, do this people in you, gentlemen, as their civil fathers: this confidence is not only implied, but expreſſed, in the deſignation
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024820_0029_0FC965AAD3475168"/>
of your perſons to thoſe offices which you hold, in the government of your fellow citizens. Civil liberty, is an inheritance deſcending from the Father of Lights, a talent which, individuals may not deſpiſe, or miſimprove without guilt: how vaſtly important then, muſt this, with its connected bleſſings in ſociety, be, to a large community? The extenſive views, and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic feelings, of wiſe and virtuous magiſtrates, cannot fail, deeply to impreſs their minds with the weight and ſolemnity of the truſt repoſed in them. Great anxiety for preferment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays a weak mind, or a vicious heart. Thoſe only, deſerve the honors of an elevated ſtation, who are willing to bear the burdens, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties which belong to it: and to reap the rewards which righteouſneſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence will beſtow: and who, in the ways of well doing, can meet with calmneſs, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ingratitude, of a miſguided misjudging people. Not that the preacher would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean, that great eſteem, with an ample pecuniary recompenſe, are not due, to thoſe, whoſe time, and ſuperior talents are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in promoting the happineſs of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men.</p>
            <p>You, gentlemen, are veſted with an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which men of wiſdom and virtue will ever revere; which properly exerciſed, none can reſiſt, without reſiſting the ordinance of GOD: and perſevering in their reſiſtance "muſt receive to themſelves damnation." May you ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſuch authority, in the meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the beſt good of your brethren: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to thoſe unchangeable laws of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024820_0030_0FC965AC498E1B20"/>
and goodneſs, which the Supreme Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver hath eſtabliſhed in his moral kingdom.<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccl. iii. 16—Pſ ci. 6.</note> "That no iniquity, be found in the place of righteouſneſs, or, wickedneſs, in the place of judgment; your eyes will be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with you: theſe who walk in a perfect way," will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignated by you for all important executive truſts. Viewing yourſelves, in the light of truth, as the miniſters of GOD, to this people for good, you will realize the important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between the moral government of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH, and thoſe inferior governments which he hath ordained to exiſt among men. In this light, you will eſteem it your higheſt glory, to manifeſt a perſonal, ſupreme regard, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent inſtitutions of the Son of GOD: by the weight of your example, and the force of all that influence you poſſeſs, you will ſtudy to commend his holy religion to all men; that you may be inſtrumental, in promoting the temporal peace and eternal happineſs of this people. Public ſentiments have a vaſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the conduct of mankind; public ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents receive their complexion from public men; the rulers of a people can do more than ſome may imagine, to promote real godlineſs: if this, is recommended in their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and exemplified in their lives, it will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the attention of multitudes; it may lead ſome to a happy imitation, and will not fail, to give ſtrong ſupport, to all the friends of GOD. But men, ſufficiently diſpoſed at all times to caſt off the fear of GOD, need ſlender aid, from public influential characters, to become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024820_0031_0FC965B49FC47628"/>
advocates, for infidelity and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How exceedingly intereſting, gentlemen, to yourſelves and the community, is the ſtation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned you in providence? May unerring wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom guide all your ſteps, and the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham be your ſhield, and exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>THE Miniſters of GOD's ſanctuary, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome thoughts addreſſed to them, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for their inſtruction, but, to "ſtir up their pure minds by way of remembrance."</p>
            <p>REVEREND FATHERS and BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>OUR character as chriſtians, obligeth us to be righteous before GOD, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs: not forgetting that, of civil magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, as one of the wiſe and gracious appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven, which, rightly improved, will extend its happy influence beyond the preſent life. And, our office as miniſters, calleth us to exhort all the diſciples of Jeſus, that they "ſubmit themſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake: unto kings and governors as unto them that are ſent by him for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the will of GOD, that with well doing ye may put to ſilence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of fooliſh men." The ignorance and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that principle, that there is no connection between religion and civil policy, is moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily refuted, when the followers of JESUS act in character, and demonſtrate to the world, that real chriſtians are the beſt members of ſociety in every ſtation. We are not then acting out
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024820_0032_0FC965B60C7D4018"/>
of character, when pointing out the advantages of a righteous government, and the neceſſity of ſubjection to magiſtrates. This however, is not the principal object of our miniſtry: our wiſdom and underſtanding will eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in converting ſinners from the error of their ways—in winning ſouls to CHRIST. To effect which our ſpeech and our preaching muſt not be with enticing words of man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power.</p>
            <p>CONFIDING, in the unerring wiſdom, and boundleſs goodneſs, of GOD, we need not be aſhamed, nor afraid, to declare all his counſel—being well aſſured, that no doctrine, or duty, can be found in his revealed will, but ſuch as are profitable for men to believe and practice. The great comprehenſive deſign of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian miniſtry, is the glory of GOD, in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinners, through JESUS CHRIST. In purſuing this noble all important deſign, we ſhall labor to exhibit, the divine excellency of the chriſtian religion, in the holineſs of our lives and converſation, as well, as in the ſimplicity, and uncorruptneſs of our doctrines: that our example and our preaching, may unite in their tendency, to perſuade ſinners, to become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to GOD. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publiſheth peace, that ſaith unto Zion, thy GOD reigneth!" and how is this beauty increaſed? when the ſpiritual watchmen upon the walls of Zion, "ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the voice, and ſee eye to eye."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lii. 7. 8.</note>

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:024820_0033_0FC965B792133A50"/>
THAT this beauty may appear and ſhine, in all the miniſters and churches of CHRIST; let us become more fervent, and united, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, to our Father in Heaven, that he may ſhed forth plentiful effuſions of that ſpirit of love, and of a ſound mind, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abiding principle of union, between moral beings. Under the influence of this holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, awakened to activity and renewed dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by the repeated inſtances of mortality, among the miniſtering ſervants of GOD, in the paſt year; may we all purſue the ſacred work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>gned us, with increaſing joy, and ſucceſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til called from our labors, to receive the free rewards of faithful ſervants, in the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>A brief addreſs, to the numerous audience preſent on this joyful anniverſary, will cloſe this diſcourſe.—</p>
            <p>BRETHREN AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>LET us not vainly boaſt, in our truly happy conſtitution—nor in the number of wiſe, and pious perſonages, whom GOD hath called to preſide in its adminiſtration. We have abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant occaſion indeed, to bleſs, and praiſe, the GOD of Heaven; for all our diſtinguiſting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, both civil and religious—few of our lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed race, enjoy immunities, equal to thoſe which we poſſeſs: but we do well to remember, that profaneneſs and irreligion, infidelity and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, when connected with ſuch advantages, will exceedingly enhance the guilt of men, and without repentance will awfully increaſe the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024820_0034_0FC965B938020EF8"/>
pains of damnation. Would we become a wiſe underſtanding people, we muſt learn the ſtatutes, and judgments, which the LORD our GOD, hath commanded, and obey them—we muſt be a religious, holy people, "for without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the LORD." Let all be exhorted, to become wiſe to ſalvation, through ſaith, which is in CHRIST JESUS.—AMEN.</p>
