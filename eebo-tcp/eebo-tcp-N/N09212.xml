            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Committee having maturely conſidered the two petitions to the Honorable Board from the Secretary, <hi>Andrew Oliver,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> together with his Affidavit concerning the Proceedings at Council on the 6th and 7th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, annexed to a pamphlet publiſhed in London, and the ſeveral depoſitions on the ſubject matter of the ſaid Affidavit, take occaſion to make a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from and upon them.</p>
               <p>With regard to the ſaid Affidavit ſeveral things are obſervable from it.</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> That what is there declared to have been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> in Council, is expreſſed in ſuch a manner as to be generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to repreſent, that antecedent to the unhappy affair of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there had been a plan formed by people of the beſt character among us to remove the troops out of the town of Boſton, and after that, the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That divers Gentlemen of the Council adopted what had been ſo ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That the Secretary had in his draft expreſſed what had been ſaid in debate at Council in the terms in the ſaid Affidavit recited; and that this form or draft of his "was allowed (by the Council) ſtrictly to expreſs the truth, but that it would not ſtand well on the Council Records": whereupon "one of the Gentlemen of the Board prepared an amendment" which "was ſubſtituted."</p>
               <p>As to the 1ſt article, the plan therein mentioned was, according to the ſaid Affidavit, intended to effect the removal of the troops, and the removal of the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>With regard to the removal of the troops, Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the ſaid plan in Council on the 6th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, declares in his depoſition,<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 11 in the Appendix.</note> "that he uttered nothing in ſaid Council purport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any plan had been formed to remove the troops previous
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011737_0005_0F8870D521230840"/>
to their firing on the inhabitants; that he had no idea of a plan formed for the removal of ſaid troops until the day after the ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene on the evening of the 5th of <hi>March</hi> laſt; and that he then meant to be underſtood that the diſpoſition of the people to remove the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ops was occaſioned by the killing and wounding of divers inhabitants of the town, and by the people's apprehenſions that the troops ſtill had an unfriendly deſign againſt them."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Erving,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pitts</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi> in their depoſitions<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 10 Appendix.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, "that they cannot recollect, neither do they believe, that any thing was ſaid in Council by Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> purporting, that any plan had been formed to remove the troops, previous to their firing on the inhabitants, but that they underſtood Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> to mean that the people were excited to ſuch a meaſure by the killing and wounding of ſome of the inhabitants of the town on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately preceding."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danforth</hi> and the other members of the Board, then preſent in Council, have made in ſubſtance the ſame declaration in their reſpective depoſitions. Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> the Secretary's deputy, and his aſſiſtant <hi>Francis Skinner,</hi> by their depoſitions,<note n="†" place="bottom">No. 5 and 6.</note> taken at the deſire of the Secretary, on being aſked, declared, that when Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the plan aforeſaid they did not apprehend him to mean a plan concerted previous to the ſixth of <hi>March</hi> laſt; and the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary himſelf has lately declared before the Board, that he did not conceive Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> to mean ſuch a preconcerted plan; and that he never believed any ſuch plan had been formed. All which declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amount to a ſatisfactory proof, that what Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> ſaid in Council did not convey the idea that a plan had been formed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the troops previous to their killing a number of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>With regard to a plan for the removal of the Commiſſioners, Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">No. 5 and 6.</note> declares "he heard Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> ſay, that there was a plan formed to remove the troops from the town, and that they would not ſtop there but would remove the Commiſſioners alſo." <hi>Francis Skinner</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">No. 5 and 6.</note> declares in ſubſtance the ſame: as does alſo Capt. Caldwell: <note n="‡" place="bottom">No. 3.</note> the two firſt however ſay, that they did not apprehend Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> meant a plan concerted previous to the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th of <hi>March</hi> laſt. With regard to this circumſtance Capt. <hi>Caldwell</hi> is not explicit, and it does not appear that any queſtion was aſked him concerning it.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Dalrymple</hi> in the body of his depoſition <note n="‖" place="bottom">No. 4.</note> ſays nothing concerning the Commiſſioners: but after he had ſigned and delivered it, being aſked whether he remembered that Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> ſaid, that part of the plan was to remove the Commiſſioners out of town? He anſwered, "that ſomething of that kind was mentioned by ſome gentleman of the Council during the debates, but he cannot ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Mr. <hi>Tyler.</hi>"</p>
               <p>This is the whole of what is declared on the poſitive ſide relative to the Commiſſioners.—Two of the declarants, viz. Meſſrs <hi>Cotton</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011737_0006_0F8870D5E11B20D0"/>
                  <hi>Skinner</hi> ſay they were called out divers times while the Council was ſitting and in the courſe of the proceedings and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> infers from it, "that he cannot declare ſo fully as thoſe who attended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption."—Capt. <hi>Caldwell</hi> did not go to the Council till 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of <hi>March,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of what paſſed at Council ſo well as thoſe who attended both parts of the day: and Colonel <hi>Dalrymple,</hi> who did attend both parts of the day, did not recollect when he delivered his depoſition, that any thing had been ſaid concerning the Commiſſioners; and his anſwer, when aſked as above, ſhews he had only a general remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſomething ſaid about the Commiſſioners; but what it was, does not clearly appear by his anſwer. It is very likely that what paſſed between the Lieutenant Governor and ſeveral of the Council relative to the protection of the Commiſſioners, as below mentioned, was the thing that lay in his mind.</p>
               <p>It is not doubted that theſe Declarants underſtood Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> in the ſenſe they have declared, but it is probable they might miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him. It appears by Mr. <hi>Gray</hi>'s<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 8.</note> and other depoſitions, that the Lieutenant Governor aſked the Board, what protection there would be for the Commiſſioners if both regiments were order'd to the Caſtle: and this, very probably, gave the occaſion for mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commiſſioners at all.—Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> upon that queſtion, might expreſs his ſentiments on that head; and having ſo fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, might alſo expreſs his ſentiments concerning the Commiſſioners themſelves, and the low eſtimation in which they are held by people in general, not only here but throughout the continent: and this being intermixed with the ſubject of the day, viz. the removal of the troops, might occaſion what he meant to ſay relative to the troops only, to be underſtood by ſome as relative to them and the Commiſſioners alſo It is certain that all the Gentlemen of the Council then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, have declared on oath, they have no remembrance that Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> ſaid there was a plan laid for the removal of the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> adds to this declaration, that he took particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notice of what Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> did ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> himſelf,<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 8.</note> upon the moſt ſerious recollection, declares on oath, "that the aſſertion, that he ſaid there was a plan formed to remove the Commiſſioners, or that it was any part of a plan to remove them, is a groſs miſrepreſentations; and that in his beſt judgment and firm belief no plan to remove the troops, before their firing on the inhabitants of Boſton, or at any time whatever to remove the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, ever was formed or forming by the people, or any number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatever." He further declares "that on the Lieut. Governor's aſking in ſaid Council, what will become of the Commiſſioners, if the troops ſhould be removed, ſeveral of the Council gave it as their opinion, that they would be ſafe, and that they always had been ſafe: And he verily believes nothing was ſaid to the contrary by any one of the Council preſent."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> declares,<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 8.</note> that upon the Lieut. Governor's aſking the ſaid queſtion, he anſwered, "that the Commiſſioners would be as

                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011737_0007_0F8870D6A11A80A8"/>
ſafe without the troops as with them: for that the people would never be ſo mad as to offer them the leaſt violence when the troops could ſo eaſily be recalled for their protection." He further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares "that one Gentleman at the Board immediately ſeconded him, and aſſured his Honor of their ſafety, and added, that he would pawn his life they ſhould receive no injury."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danforth</hi> declares,<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 7.</note> "he well remembers that divers of the Council then declared, that in their opinion the Commiſſioners might continue in town in all ſafety after the troops were removed thence; and that no one of the Council preſent diſcovered an opinion diverſe therefrom."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Erving</hi> declares,<note n="†" place="bottom">No. 10.</note> that "he ſaid at the Board, in the hearing of the Lieut. Governor, on the 6th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, that in his opinion the Commiſſioners were ſafe in town, and never had been in danger; and that he would pawn his life they would remain ſafe, or words of the ſame import."</p>
               <p>If the foregoing circumſtances and declarations be duly remarked, it will appear highly probable that if Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> ſaid any thing about the Commiſſioners it was miſunderſtood: and this will appear ſtill more ſo, if it be further remarked, that, on the contrary ſuppoſition, it muſt have been conſidered as a reaſon for the troops remaining in town, if the Commiſſioners had been ſuppoſed to be in danger; as has been obſerved by ſeveral of the deponents; and "the ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents are perſuaded it would have been ſo conſidered by the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor, and the commanding officer of the troops, and conſequently tended to defeat the very end, which the ſeveral mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council, and Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> in particular, are repreſented as aiming at. And they further obſerve, that had he mentioned it as his opinion, that there was a deſign of the people to remove the Commiſſioners, it would have been ſo utterly contrary to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe deponents, and they doubt not of every other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Council preſent, except himſelf, that they verily believe it muſt have produced ſuch a diſpute, and oppoſition, as could not ſo ſoon have been forgot."</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing obſervable from the Secretaty's Affidavit<note n="‡" place="bottom">No. 1.</note> is, that divers Gentlemen of the Council, by referring expreſsly to it, adopted what Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> had ſaid, viz. That people of the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters among us had formed a plan not only to remove the troops but the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>In contradiction to this, every Gentleman of the Council then preſent, deny that they adopted any ſuch declaration. So far are they from adopting what is repreſented to have been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> about a plan for the removal of the Commiſſioners, that there is not one of them has the leaſt remembrance of any thing ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a plan to remove the Commiſſioners: and therefore they could not refer to it, or in any ſenſe whatever adopt it.—Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011737_0008_0F8870D7611CB328"/>
and Mr. <hi>Ruſſell</hi> declare,<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 9.</note> "that they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> of any intention to remove the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, ſo neither could they have adopted ſuch a ſtrange opinion, had it been advanced by any perſon whatever."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Erving,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pitts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dexter</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">10.</note> declare the ſame; and add, "that, according to their beſt remembrance, what was <hi>really</hi> ſaid in Council by Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> was not referred to by any other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber preſent in ſuch manner, as that it could with the leaſt degree of propriety be affirmed in general terms, as it is in the depoſition of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Oliver,</hi> that they adopted what Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> had ſaid."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danforth</hi> in his depoſition recites,<note n="‡" place="bottom">No. 7.</note> "that whereas in Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s aforementioned affidavit, it is aſſerted that divers members of the Council adopted what Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> had ſaid, by referring to it, and thereby excuſing themſelves from enlarging (which aſſertion plainly imports that divers members of the Council aſſented to and adopted all that Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> in his affidavit had repreſented to have been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Tyler,</hi> relative to a plan formed to remove the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners as well as the troops) He the deponent declares, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he had the like apprehenſions Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> had of the danger of further bloodſhed, in caſe the troops ſhould continue in the town, yet that he never adopted any ſentiment, that a plan had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed for removing the Commiſſioners (or even the troops by way of compulſion) and, ſo far at leaſt as relates to the Commiſſioners, this deponent is fully perſuaded, that no member of the Council then preſent, did adopt the ſame: inaſmuch as he well remembers that divers of them then declared, that in their opinion the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners might continue in town with all ſafety after the troops were removed thence; and no one of the Council then preſent diſcovered an opinion diverſe therefrom."</p>
               <p>From theſe depoſitions and what went before, it appears that the ſaid Gentlemen of the Council were ſo far from adopting what the Secretary repreſents to have been ſaid by Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> concerning a plan for the removal of the Commiſſioners, that there is not one of them has the leaſt remembrance of any thing ſaid about ſuch a plan; and therefore they could not refer to it, or in any ſenſe whatever adopt it.</p>
               <p>The third thing obſervable in the Secretary's Affidavit<note n="§" place="bottom">No. 1.</note> is, what he declares about his draft expreſſing what had been ſaid in debate at Council, that it was allowed by the Council ſtrictly to expreſs the truth, but that it would not ſtand well on the council records. This declaration repreſents the Council in a very odious light. It conveys to the world this idea, that they rejected his draft becauſe it was true; and that the truth of it made it unfit to be recorded in the Council books: Whereupon an amendment was ſubſtituted. To ſubſtitute an amendment, that alters the truth, is to ſubſtitute a falſehood; and as the ſaid declaration ſuggeſts ſuch a ſubſtitution, is implies a charge of falſehood upon the Gentlemen that were preſent
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011737_0009_0F8870D821152D60"/>
at that Council. But although the Committee apprehend the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary did not intend any ſuch charge, yet his words may probably be conſtrued to imply it.</p>
               <p>With regard to the ſaid amendment, moſt of the ſaid Gentlemen have expreſſed their ſentiments in their reſpective depoſitions. Five of them<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 9 and 10.</note> declare, "that the words made uſe of in the amendment, as recited by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> in his depoſition, which were the next morning propoſed in Council to be ſubſtituted inſtead of the terms the Secretary had uſed in the minutes the day before, theſe deponents then verily thought leſs liable to be miſconſtrued; and that by this alteration the true meaning and intent of the ſeveral members of the Council, in what they had on the preceeding day ſaid to the Lieutenant Governor, of the diſpoſition of the people, would fully and fairly appear."</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Danforth</hi> declares,<note n="†" place="bottom">No. 7.</note> "that the ſaid amendment was unanimouſly agreed to by the members of the Council then preſent, and contains the whole of what, after full debate and mature conſideration, was by them adopted, and (together with the advice given to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Governor, to uſe his influence that the troops might be removed) was, as this deponent apprehends, the whole that could regularly be certified by the Secretary, as they were the only Votes of Council that had paſſed upon that occaſion."</p>
               <p>The Committee next proceed to conſider the Secretary's two Petitions<note n="‡" place="bottom">No. 2 and 12.</note> to the Board, and to make ſome obſervations on them.</p>
               <p>In one of them he repreſents, "that his Depoſition or Affidavit above-mentioned appears by the tenor of it to have been made meerly to vindicate the Lieutenant-Governor, in deſiring that his Majeſty's troops might be removed to Caſtle William, after the fatal cataſtrophe of the 5th of <hi>March:</hi> he having been called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that affair."—If the Lieutenant-Governor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the ſaid depoſition for his vindication, could he not have been vindicated without the Secretary's traducing the Council, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into queſtion the loyalty of the Town of Boſton, or Province? Was it not traducing the Council, to ſuggeſt that they rejected his draft becauſe it ſtrictly expreſſed the truth? And was it not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into queſtion the loyalty of the Town or Province, to ſuggeſt that a plan had been formed by people of the beſt characters among us to remove the Troops and Commiſſioners, and that divers of the Council adopted or allowed it to be true that there was ſuch a plan? Do theſe ſuggeſtions, and the declarations contained in the Secretary's depoſition, in which he wholly omits what was ſaid about the ſafety of the Commiſſioners, comport with a true relation of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings had in Council on the above-mentioned affair; which relation the Lieutenant-Governor called upon him for?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:011737_0010_0F8870D8E1150650"/>The Secretary further repreſents, that "as holding his commiſſion immediately from the King, who therein expreſſes his confidence in his fidelity, he could not conſider himſelf as acting in breach of truſt, in making ſaid depoſition, as he was called upon by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, who is the King's repreſentative, to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that day."</p>
               <p>Though the Secretary holds his commiſſion immediately from the King, the commiſſion conſtitutes him an officer of the Province, to do the buſineſs appertaining to the office of Secretary but does not give the Commander in Chief, notwithſtanding he is the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative in the Province, any authority over him.—By virtue of his commiſſion, he is to do the proper buſineſs of Secretary. But could it be a part of ſuch buſineſs to take minutes at Council of what all or any of the members ſaid in their debates? and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to give a depoſition of it, when called upon by the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Chief? If it was not a part of ſuch buſineſs, for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe could he want to aſſiſt his memory by the ſaid minutes? Could this be any proof of fidelity to the King? or could it not be conſidered as a breach of truſt? Would not ſuch an idea of the buſineſs of a Secretary degrade him into the character of a ſpy and an informer? Would it not be inconſiſtent with freedom of conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and debate, and conſequently with one of the moſt eſſential privileges and rights of Council? and would it not therefore be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of every principle, which diſtinguiſhes a free government from deſpotiſm? But admitting that the Secretary, as the King's officer, is under obligation to take ſuch minutes at Council and reduce them to a depoſition if deſired by the King's repreſentative (which is utterly denied) yet it appears by one of the Secretary's petitions to the Board, that he officiouſly, without the privity of any one, took the minutes of what was ſaid in the debates of Council on the 5th of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Secretary could think himſelf authorized to take ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and give ſuch a depoſition, was he not under the obligation of honor, and did not juſtice require him, to communicate it to the Council before he had compleated and delivered it? Had he done ſo, the miſtakes and partial repreſentations contained in it might have been corrected, and his own honor and juſtice remained unimpeached.</p>
               <p>It has been for ſome time juſtly complained of, that depoſitions, memorials, and every ſpecies of information, have been taken and ſent to England in a ſecret manner; and there made uſe of to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent his Majeſty's ſubjects here in an odious light: which has occaſioned troops and naval armaments to be ſent hither, to the great and unjuſt annoyance and diſtreſs of his Majeſty's ſubjects of this Province. It was therefore the more extraordinary that the Secretary, in the affair of his depoſition, ſhould act in the ſame ſecret manner, eſpecially as it reſpected what had been ſaid in Council; about which he could eaſily have informed himſelf from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, who at the ſame time had a right to know what he had
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011737_0011_0F8870D9A1240DF8"/>
repreſented concerning them.—Whatever may have been deſigned with regard to the operation of this depoſition, the manifeſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of it is to give a moſt unfavorable, and at the ſame time a moſt unjuſt idea of the people here, and of the Council in particular.</p>
               <p>As the ſaid depoſition repreſents the Council in an ill light, it could be no diſagreeable preſent to Governor <hi>Bernard,</hi> to whom it was ſent by the Lieutenant-Governor, as he informed the Board. His Honor at the ſame time informed them, that he deſired Governor <hi>Bernard</hi> to keep it to himſelf, unleſs his conduct with regard to the removing the troops ſhould be faulted, in which caſe it was to be made uſe of for his Honor's vindication. Whether it was uſed or not for that purpoſe is uncertain: but this is certain, that it has been publiſhed in London, annexed with other depoſitions to a printed pamphlet, intitled "A fair account of the late unhappy diſturbance at Boſton, in New-England": in which pamphlet and depoſitions is given a very unfair, and, in all material circumſtances, a very falſe account of what it therein called the late unhappy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance. The moſt material thing aimed at in the ſaid pamphlet, is to obtrude as truth on the public this falſehood, viz. that a plan was here laid for the expulſion of the troops, prior to their firing on and killing a number of the inhabitants of the town: and the principal if not the only depoſition that in any meaſure tends to ſupport ſuch a charge is the Secretary's above mentioned.</p>
               <p>This depoſition has in ſome degree anſwered the purpoſe of the Pamphlet writer or procurer; and is well calculated <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> anſwer the further purpoſe of Governor <hi>Bernard,</hi> to effect a change in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Council, by giving of the laſt year's Council a very diſadvantageous idea; from which will be formed the idea of the preſent Council, which include the ſame members as the laſt.</p>
               <p>This depoſition has been attended with circumſtances that appear in ſome degree remarkable. It was taken on the ſame day on which the other depoſitions (or moſt of them) annexed to the ſame pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, were taken, viz. the 13th of <hi>March.</hi> They all went (as ſeems probable) by Mr. Commiſſioner <hi>Robinſon,</hi> who ſailed for England the 16th of <hi>March</hi>; and they are all publiſhed together in the ſame pamphlet. Whether theſe circumſtances are caſual, or whether they indicate a mutual correſpondence and communication between perſons here, with regard to the ſaid depoſitions, there do not appear any ſufficient means preciſely to determine.</p>
               <p>The Secretary further repreſents "how cautious he was in fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his depoſition; and that he is confident he has been preciſe in ſetting down the very words uſed on the occaſion, without adding any conſtruction of his own."</p>
               <p>How cautious and preciſe the Secretary has been, eſpecially in repreſenting what was ſaid about the Commiſſioners, has fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared above, under the article relative to them. He not only gives an imperfect account of what he has repreſented, but has wholly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011737_0012_0F8870DA6112DBA0"/>
omitted all the declarations made at Council, relative to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, that they would be ſafe, notwithſtanding the troops ſhould be removed: which has already ſufficiently appeared.</p>
               <p>The Secretary goes on to obſerve, that "the principal matter, wherein the teſtimony of divers [or rather of all] of ſaid Gentlemen differs from his own, appears to him to be concerning what relates to the Commiſſioners: with regard to which he apprehends his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is fully ſupported by the teſtimony of <hi>diſintereſted</hi> witneſſes then preſent."</p>
               <p>The Secretary here ſuggeſts that the Gentlemen of the Council are intereſted; and therefore that their teſtimony, wherein it differs from that of his witneſſes, whom he repreſents as diſintereſted, muſt be invalidated.</p>
               <p>Seven Gentlemen of the Council have given teſtimony about what Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> is repreſented to have ſaid in Council, concerning the Troops and Commiſſioners. In this matter, it is evident, they are wholly diſintereſted. What inducement then could they have to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the truth? How is their teſtimony in this matter invalidated?— They may be ſtiled diſintereſted witneſſes, as properly as thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Secretary; and much more ſo than two of them, who act under, and are dependant on the Secretary for their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in office.</p>
               <p>The Committee have been thus particular in this matter, that the true ſtate of it might appear; and that thereby the pernicious conſequences to the Province, which the Honorable Board appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Secretary's depoſition may be attended with, may be prevented.</p>
               <p>So far as this matter ſtands related to the Council, it appears that the Secretary's depoſition exhibits to the world a very diſhonorable and injurious idea of them, by ſuggeſting, that becauſe his draft was allowed ſtrictly to expreſs the truth, it would not ſtand well on the Council records, and was therefore rejected by the Council. —It appears alſo that the Secretary, in a ſecret manner, has taken minutes at Council of what was ſaid by the members of the Council in their debates.—That he has ſubſcribed his name to a paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe minutes, and has taken his depoſition before <hi>Foſter Hutchinſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the truth of it; alſo, that the ſaid paper and depoſition have been ſent by the Lieutenant-Governor to Governor <hi>Bernard,</hi> and that they have been ſince publiſhed, with other depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, annexed to a printed pamphlet deſigned to defame the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, with regard to the unhappy affair of the 5th of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conduct of the Secretary in this affair is not only a breach of truſt in him, and injurious to the character and honor of the Council, but is deſtructive of all freedom of ſpeech and debate, and conſequently a breach of privilege—the moſt eſſential privilege belonging to the Council, or that can belong to a deliberative body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011737_0013_0F8870DB21134900"/>The Committee therefore are humbly of opinion, that the honor of the Council requires that the Board ſhould come into the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſolutions.</p>

                  <salute>To the Honorable his Majeſty's Council for the ſaid Province,</salute>
Humbly ſhews <hi>Andrew Oliver,</hi>
               </opener>
               <p>THAT it ſo happened he had no opportunity to ſee the Report of your Committee and your Honor's Reſolutions thereon until ſome time after they had paſſed the Board. That he did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon obſerve to your Honors upon two paragraphs in ſaid Report relating to facts only; and pray an alteration; but as your Honors were then of opinion that the clauſes to which he excepted, might as well be ſet right by his explaining himſelf in a written Addreſs to the Board, he now begs leave to obſerve upon the ſaid clauſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them runs thus— "The Secretary himſelf has lately declared before the Board that he did not conceive Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> to mean ſuch a preconcerted plan, and that he never believed any ſuch plan had been formed."—Your petitioner upon reading the Report, declared to your Honors that he well remembered that he expreſſed himſelf in theſe terms—"I <hi>do not</hi> believe any <hi>ſuch</hi> plan <hi>ever</hi> had been formed"—and no one Gentleman at the Board would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſay the expreſſion was—"I <hi>never did</hi> believe any <hi>ſuch</hi> plan had been formed"—Theſe ſeveral modes of expreſſion he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends do convey ideas very eſſentially different. And when your Honors recollect that this was not declared in an addreſs to the Honorable Board, but rather ſaid in converſation with ſome of the members near whom he ſat, it will not be thought ſtrange that the expreſſion can be no better aſcertained by the Board.</p>
               <p>As to the other part of this declaration, viz. "That he did not conceive Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> to mean <hi>ſuch</hi> a preconcerted plan"—he humbly conceives he muſt have been miſunderſtood; becauſe he has been all along ſtudiouſly careful to give no opinion about it, and has always wiſhed he might never be brought to a public declaration upon that matter. He thinks it very probable ſuch an opinion might be taken up by the Board, from his repeatedly declaring "that he had not in his depoſition ſet forth that Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> had ſaid there was a preconcerted plan"; and would by no means be underſtood even to inſinuate that the honorable Board meant to put any unjuſt colouring upon the declarations made by your petitioner before them. After all, as the thing in queſtion is a matter of mere opinion (and opinions vary as new circumſtances ariſe) he cannot conceive that his opinion upon the force of words can be of much conſequence; and inaſmuch as the preciſe words of the ſaid decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot be aſcertained by the Board, he humbly moves to the conſideration of the honorable Board—Whether the Report aforeſaid would not ſtand as well without the whole clauſe.</p>
               <p>Another paragraph in the Report which your petitioner aſked leave to explain himſelf upon, is that, wherein it is ſuggeſted, that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011737_0015_0F8870DCA10A9288"/>
there might be a mutual correſpondence and communication between perſons here, with regard to the ſeveral depoſitions publiſhed in the ſame pamphlet.—With regard to which your petitioner can with the greateſt ſolemnity declare, that he never ſaw or knew any thing concerning either one of the other depoſitions contained in the ſaid pamphlet, until he ſaw them in the pamphlet itſelf a few weeks ago; nor did your petitioner know that his own depoſition was ever ſent to England, until he ſaw it in the ſaid pamphlet. He gave his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor a copy of it; nor did he ever give out any other copy of the ſame. His Honor has declared at the Board that he ſent it home, and has given his reaſons for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, your petitioner humbly moves to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Board—Whether the Report of the Committee would not ſtand better without this clauſe, as well as the other? And prays that your Honors would take ſuch order in the premiſes as you ſhall judge meet.</p>
               <p>If your Honors ſhould think fit to expunge the ſaid two clauſes, your petitioner ſhould aſk leave to withdraw this his repreſentation of the matters in queſtion.</p>
               <p>As the honorable Board expected him to obſerve upon theſe two points only, he will add nothing with regard to the other parts of the Report or the Reſolves of the Board in conſequence of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that he is not convinced that he has done any thing inconſiſtent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of truſt: upon which points he explained himſelf in his petition of the 5th inſtant. But inaſmuch as your Honors have reſolved that the proceedings in this buſineſs
<q>be ſent to Mr. <hi>Bollan,</hi> in order that he may make the beſt uſe thereof he can for the benefit of this Province</q>
—your petitioner will, in his contracted ſphere, chearfully co-operate in every reaſonable meaſure for that end, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the juſt regard that every honeſt man ought to have for his own character: And ſhall as in duty bound ever pray, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>The Committee on the Secretary's Petition of the 29th of <hi>October</hi> laſt have taken the ſame into Conſideration and made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Obſervations thereon, which are ſubmitted to the Honorable Board. WM. BRATTLE, by Order.</head>
               <p>THE Secretary's laſt Petition to the honorable Board begins with ſhewing "that it ſo happened he had no opportunity to ſee the report of your Committee, and your Honor's Reſolutions thereon, until ſometime after they had paſſed the Board."</p>
               <p>On which your Committee would obſerve, that if the Secretary had thought proper he might have been preſent, as his Deputy was, at the time the ſaid report was made, and whilſt it was under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which would have given him a full knowledge of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: But that his knowing it, was in no wiſe neceſſary to the Board's paſſing upon it, as the examination of the evidence on both ſides, and in his preſence, had been had ſome time before, agreeable to his petition; and as the ſaid report, beſides a ſummary of the evidence, and one or two incidental circumſtances, contained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Committee's obſervations on that evidence, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions they recommended to the conſideration of the Board. They would further obſerve, that the Board make no ſecret of any of their proceedings: which however in this caſe they might have juſtly done, as the Secretary in a ſecret manner took minutes of what he repreſents had been ſaid in Council, and in a ſecret manner gave his depoſition concerning it, and will doubtleſs in a ſecret man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, at leaſt without the knowledge of the Board, make repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the ſubject of their proceedings in this affair; which if right or wrong, the Board for that reaſon, can neither acquieſce in, or detect.</p>
               <p>On this occaſion the Committee cannot omit taking notice of what his Honor the Lieutenant Governor obſerved in Council upon the ſaid report, a few days after its acceptance by the Board, viz. That the King had a right to know all that is at any time ſaid or done in the privy Council, conſidered either as a body or as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; that the calling in queſtion this right would operate to the prejudice of the Province, more than any thing that had been yet done; and that the Secretary did his duty in taking minutes, and conducting as he did.</p>
               <p>As to the former part of this declaration, that the King had a right to know what paſſed at the Privy Council, is granted, and has never been called in queſtion by the Council, either in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port aforeſaid, or in any of their proceedings. The King has not only a right to know, but in fact may be ſaid to know whatever paſſes in Privy Council, even at the time of its paſſing: His Majeſty being a conſtituent part of every Privy Council, and always preſent by his repreſentative. There is nothing in the ſaid report, which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011737_0017_0F8870DE210B07B8"/>
juſtly be conſtrued to call in queſtion that right. If ſuch a conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been given to any part of it, it is forced and unnatural, and which the Board wholly diſavow. They do not therefore appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that it can in the leaſt degree operate to the prejudice of the Province in any reſpect whatever; and they humbly rely on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's juſtice and goodneſs, that no ſuch operation will be the effect of it. If his Honor had pointed out the clauſe capable of ſuch a conſtruction, they would have received it as an inſtance of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Province, and to them.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt part of the declaration, that the Secretary did his duty in taking minutes and conducting as he did, the Committee think it needleſs to ſay any thing on this head, as the contrary is fully proved in the report aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The Secretary in the ſaid Petition takes exception to two clauſes of the ſaid report: the firſt only of which needs to be noticed. It runs thus, "The Secretary himſelf has lately declared before the Board, that he did not conceive Mr. <hi>Tyler</hi> to mean ſuch a preconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed plan, and that he never believed any ſuch plan had been formed."</p>
               <p>The Secretary divides this clauſe into two parts, and makes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on each. One of the obſervations is, "that no one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman at the Board would undertake to ſay, that the expreſſion was preciſely as above-mentioned:" and another is, "that he would by no means be underſtood even to inſinuate that the honorable Board meant to put any unjuſt colouring upon his declarations."—The words, whatever they were, were ſpoken by the Secretary before the Board, not in converſation with any of the members, but by way of obſervation on one of the papers in his affair, that had been juſt read to the Board.</p>
               <p>Now although no one Gentleman at the Board would undertake to give the preciſe words uſed by the Secretary on that occaſion, yet divers of them at the time he firſt mentioned this matter to the Board, and many of them ſince have declared, and they do declare, that what he ſaid conveyed to them the ſame idea as the words made uſe of in the report, and above quoted, do convey. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Secretary inſinuates what he ſays he would by no means inſinuate, "that the Board meant to put an unjuſt colouring on his declarations," yet the Board are wholly clear of that charge, and meant to repreſent truly what the Secretary ſaid, which they ſtill think they have done, although it may not be in the preciſe words ſpoken by him. But it is of ſo little importance, whether the declaration above quoted was made or not, that the Board would have ſuffered the Secretary's explanation of himſelf, to have paſſed unremarked on, if it had not been attended with an implied reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon their veracity.</p>
               <p>The Secretary's Petition mentions further, "that he did not know that his own depoſition (containing his ſecret minutes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) was ever ſent to England until he ſaw it in the pamphlet" he refers to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011737_0018_0F8870DEE10CA1E0"/>Though the Secretary did not (ſtrictly ſpeaking) know, that his ſaid depoſition had been ſent to England, he could have no ſufficient reaſon to doubt it. At the time he delivered his depoſition to the Lieutenant Governor, and alſo when his Honor applied to him for it, it is probable he was informed for what purpoſe it was wanted. But admitting he was not, it would be a reflection upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to ſuppoſe he could have any doubt, that the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was intended to be ſent to England. His ſaying therefore he did not know it had been ſent, is neither a proof, that he did not know it was intended to be ſent, nor any juſtification of himſelf for delivering it: eſpecially as it was done without giving the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom it reſpected, and whoſe character, as well as that of the Province, was eſſentially affected thereby, the leaſt notice of it.</p>
               <p>The Secretary's Petition further mentions, that "as the Board expected him to obſerve upon theſe two points only (contained in the two clauſes above refered to) he will add nothing with regard to the other parts of the report, or the reſolves of the Board in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it, except that he is not convinced, that he has done any thing inconſiſtent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of truſt."</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved here, that when the Secretary mentioned to the Board the ſaid two clauſes, he excepted to no other part of the report; and when the Board conſented he ſhould explain himſelf by ſomething written upon them; he ſaid he ſhould confine himſelf to thoſe clauſes only: which was acquieſced in. He was not limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them by the Board, and the ſuggeſtion, that he was ſo limited, is without foundation.</p>
               <p>As to what the Secretary ſays, that he is not convinced he has done any thing inconſiſtent with the character of a man of honor, or been guilty of any breach of truſt, the Committee would only remark, that altho' the Secretary's general character may be conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the character of a man of honor, yet what he has done with regard to his minutes and depoſition aforeſaid, is in the whole of it inconſiſtent with that character, and clearly involves in it a breach of truſt: all which is ſufficiently manifeſt by the report aforeſaid.</p>

                  <p>THE Lieutenant-Governor having ſummoned a Council to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what was proper to be done in the ſtate of diſorder and confuſion the people are at preſent in, occaſioned by the troops firing upon the inhabitants the laſt evening, thereby killing three or four perſons and wounding others: Previous to the debate, moved, That Lieut. Colonel Dalrymple and Lieut. Colonel Carr, might have notice to attend in Council if they ſaw fit. They attended accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when the matter was largely diſcuſſed in Council; and while this was doing, a Committee of the Town deſired to be admitted, who came in and delivered a meſſage, declaring it to be the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinion of the meeting, that nothing can rationally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to reſtore the peace of the Town, and prevent blood and carnage, but the immediate removal of the troops. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee withdrew while the matter was debated in Council; and Colonel Dalrymple having ſignified to the Lieutenant Governor, that he was willing the 29th regiment, who had rendered themſelves in a ſpecial manner obnoxious to the people by the concern they had in this unhappy affair, ſhould be placed at the barracks at the Caſtle, till he could receive orders from the General; the Lieutenant-Governor acquainted the Committee accordingly, and the Council was adjourned to the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor received another meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Town, acquainting him that it was the opinion of the meeting, conſiſting of near 3000 people, that nothing but a total and immediate removal of the Troops would ſatisfy the Town; Mr. Adams, one of the Committee, told Colonel Dalrymple, that if he could remove the 29th regiment, he could alſo remove the 14th, and that it was at his peril if he did not. The Lieutenant-Governor laid the anſwer of the town before the Board, who, after fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the matter, unanimouſly adviſed him to pray Colonel Dalrym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to order the Troops down to Caſtle William.</p>
                  <p>Previous to this advice, Mr. Tyler had ſaid, "That it was not ſuch people as had formerly pulled down the Lieutenant-Governor's houſe which conducted the preſent meaſures, but that they were people of the beſt characters among us—men of eſtates, and men of religion: That they had formed their plan, and that this was a part
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011737_0020_0F8870E0610C5F78"/>
of it to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners: That it was impoſſible the Troops ſhould remain in town; that the people would come in from the neighbouring towns, and that there would be 10,000 men to effect the removal of the Troops, and that they would probably be deſtroyed by the people—ſhould it be called rebellion—ſhould it incur the loſs of our charter, or be the conſequence what it would." Divers other gentlemen adopted what Mr. Tyler had ſaid, by referring expreſly to it, and thereupon excuſing themſelves from enlarging. Mr. Ruſſell of Charleſtown and Mr. Dexter of Dedham, confirmed what he ſaid reſpecting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper and diſpoſition of the neighbouring towns; every gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſpoke on the occaſion, and unanimouſly expreſſed their ſenſe of the neceſſity of the immediate removal of the Troops from the town, and adviſed his Honor to pray that Colonel Dalrymple would order the Troops down to Caſtle William; one gentleman,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Gray.</note> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, ſaid, "That the Lieutenant-Governor had aſked the advice of the Council, and they had unanimouſly adviſed him to a meaſure; which advice, in his opinion, laid the Lieutenant-Governor under an obligation to act agreeably thereto." Another Gentleman<note n="†" place="bottom">Capt. Erving.</note> preſſed his compliance with greater earneſtneſs, and told him, "That if after this any miſchief ſhould enſue, by means of his declining to join with them, the whole blame muſt fall upon him; but that if he joined with them, and Colonel Dalrymple, after that, ſhould refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Troops, the blame would then lie at his door." The Lieutenant-Governor all along declared, that he had no authority over the Troops; yet as the Council knew, by what had paſſed, that upon this deſire Colonel Dalrymple would conſent to remove them, He, on this emergency, told the Council, he would comply with their advice, and would deſire it of him accordingly; and the Colonel declared, "That upon receiving a letter from the Lieutenant-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to that purpoſe, he would do it." Theſe declarations were made to the towns-committee, and were by them ſaid to be reported to the town, ſtill aſſembled in town-meeting; whereupon the minds of the people appeared to be quieted.</p>
                  <p>The Council was adjourned to the next Morning, to ſee the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes made by the Secretary of this day's proceedings ſet in order, as well as to do ſome other buſineſs that had been aſſigned over to that time.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary, in his draft, expreſſed what had been ſaid in debate, in theſe terms.—"Divers Gentlemen of the Council informed his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, They were of opinion, that it was the determination of the people to have the Troops removed from the town; and that this was not the ſenſe of the inhabitants of the town of Boſton only, but of other towns in the neighbourhood, who ſtood ready to come in, in order to effect this purpoſe, be the conſequence of it what it may; unleſs they ſhall be withdrawn by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers, which, in their opinion, was the only method to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the effuſion of blood, and, in all probability, the deſtruction of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011737_0021_0F8870E1211085F8"/>
his Majeſty's Troops, who muſt be overpowered by numbers, which would not be leſs than ten to one.</p>
                  <p>This form was allowed ſtrictly to expreſs the truth, but that it would not ſtand well on the Council Records. One of the Gentlemen on the Board prepared an amendment, as in the words following,— "That the people of this, and ſome of the neighbouring towns, were ſo exaſperated and incenſed, on account of the inhuman and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſtruction of a number of the inhabitants by the Troops, that they apprehended imminent danger of further bloodſhed, unleſs the Troops were forthwith removed from the body of the town, which, in their opinion, was the only method to prevent it."—This amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſubſtituted, and the minutes of the whole proceedings ſet in order and agreed to.</p>

                  <p>THAT your Petitioner while attending his duty yeſterday in the Council-Chamber at Cambridge, took notice of a Vote of Council paſſed in conſequence of a depoſition ſigned Andrew Oliver, ſaid to have been publiſhed in England relative to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy affair in Boſton the 5th of March laſt; in which Vote eight
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011737_0022_0F8870E1E10E72B8"/>
Gentlemen of the Board who were of the Council laſt year were deſired to draw up the ſtate of the affair to which the ſaid depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition relates.</p>
                  <p>Your Petitioner begs leave to repreſent that the ſaid depoſition appears by the tenor of it to have been made merely to vindicate the Lieutenant-Governor in deſiring that his Majeſty's Troops might be removed to Caſtle William after the fatal cataſtrophe of that day, by ſhewing the neceſſity he was under of conceding to it, ariſing from the forcible reaſons urged by the Council on that occaſion, which reaſons may equally ſerve to juſtify the Council in adviſing his Honor to that meaſure.</p>
                  <p>That your Petitioner as holding his Commiſſion immediately from the King, who therein expreſſes his confidence in his fidelity could not conſider himſelf as acting in breach of truſt in making ſaid depoſition, as he was called upon by the Commander in Chief who is the King's Repreſentative in the Province to give a true relation of the proceedings had in Council on that day, which his Honor has ſince declared in Council: and your Petitioner could have no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his betraying any of the ſecrets of Government, as moſt if not all the proceedings of the day were had in a more public manner than uſual, divers of the King's Officers having been then preſent at the deſire of the Governor and Council at their debates and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Council.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore your Petitioner humbly prays, that before the report of the ſaid Gentlemen is acted upon in Council, as his character may be eſſentially affected thereby, he may be allowed to put in a reply, produce his witneſſes, and be heard upon the ſubject. And your petitioner ſhall as in duty bound ever pray, &amp;c,</p>

Dalrymple, and in the debates there, heard Mr. Tyler ſay to the following effect—That the people in the town were ſo exaſperated againſt the King's Troops, that nothing but a total and immediate removal of them would be ſatisfactory—that there was then in town meeting upwards of 3000 people—that there would be before next evening ten thouſand more from the country—that the Troops could by no means remain in town with any degree of ſafety, and if they were not immediately removed, the people would take to their arms and deſtroy them, ſhould it be deemed Rebellion or occaſion the loſs of the Charter— that a plan was fixed to have them and the Commiſſioners removed, and that the plan was not formed by ſuch people as formerly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lieutenant-Governor's houſe, but by perſons of the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and eſtates in the country and men of religion. The ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Gentlemen of the Council adopted what Mr. Tyler had ſaid and excuſed themſelves from enlarging. And further ſaith not.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DALRYMPLE, of lawful age, depoſeth, That being required, he attended the Council on the 6th March laſt. On his arrival in the Council room, the Lieut. Governor informed him, that he was ſent for in conſequence of the diſturbances then prevailing in the town, and deſired the members of the Council to recapitulate what they had ſaid on that ſubject before his, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent's, arrival, if they thought proper.—Mr. Tyler aroſe and ſpoke to the following purpoſe. That the people in general were reſolved to have the Troops removed, without which they would not be ſatisfied—that failing of other means, they were determined to effect their removal by force, let the act be deemed rebellion or otherwiſe—that thoſe who were now ſo reſolved were not ſuch a mean mob as had attack'd the Lieut. Governor's houſe, but were people of the beſt characters and fortunes in the Province, and men of religion—He afterwards added, that the preſent diſturbances were not to be coſidered as caſual, but part of a plan that the people were fixed in the execution of. He concluded with declaring, that the ſame ſentiments were adopted in the towns adjacent—that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore next morning 10,000 men would be aſſembled on the Common of Boſton—He then appealed to two members of the, Council juſt arrived from different parts of the country, who the deponent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves

were Meſſi'rs Ruſſell and Dexter, for a confirmation relative to the ſtate of the towns from whence they came—they fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed what he had aſſerted. The other members agreed with Mr. Tyler in ſentiment, obſerving that he had left little to them to ſay in addition.</p>

               <p>JOHN COTTON, of lawful age, teſtifies, that on the ſixth day of March 1770, his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor ſummoned a Council, to conſider what was proper to be done in conſequence of the great confuſion the people of the town were in, occaſioned by a number of Soldiers firing on the inhabitants, killing ſome and wounding others the evening before. That the Deponent being in Council while this matter was debating, heard the Honorable Royall Tyler, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſay that the people who conducted affairs at this time, were not ſuch kind of people as Magnis Mode and others who were concerned in pulling down the Lieutenant-Governor's houſe, but that they were people of good characters, men of eſtates and religion, and men who prayed over what they did; that there was a plan formed to remove the Troops from the town, and that they would not ſtop there, but would remove the Commiſſioners alſo, that it was impoſſible the Troops ſhould continue in the town, that 10,000 men would come from the neighbouring towns to aſſiſt in removing them, that this would be done, ſhould it be called Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, incur the loſs of the Charter, or let the conſequence be what it may.

               <p>WHEREAS in one of the publick news-papers for the laſt week printed in Boſton, there appeared an Affidavit ſigned <hi>Andrew Oliver,</hi> taken before Foſter Hutchinſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Juſtice of the Peace, and ſaid to be extracted from a pamphlet lately publiſhed in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy diſturbance at Boſton in New-England," in which affidavit, after mention made of a Council convened by order of the Lieutenant Governor and held on the fifth (in reality on the ſixth) day of March laſt (it being the next day after a number of perſons had been killed and wounded by the troops firing upon them) it is, among other things, declared that Mr. Tyler, in Council, ſaid <hi>that they, the people, had formed their plan and that this was apart of it, to remove the Troops out of Town and after that the Commiſſioners, and that what Mr. Tyler had ſaid was adopted by divers members of the Council, who, by referring to what Mr. Tyler had ſaid, excuſed themſelves from enlarging.</hi> And whereas the ſeveral members of the Council Board, who were preſent in Council on the ſixth and ſeventh days of March laſt, have been called upon to relate to that Board what foundation there was for ſuch a repreſentation as was made in the affidavit afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, this deponent, who was one of the eight Councellors then preſent, teſtifies and ſays, that although he remembers that Mr. Tyler, on that unhappy occaſion, did in ſtrong terms expreſs his apprehenſion of imminent danger of further bloodſhed in caſe the troops ſhould continue in the town (which appeared to this
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011737_0027_0F8870E5A10673D8"/>
deponent to be likewiſe the apprehenſion of every other member of the Council then preſent) and that mention was made by Mr. Tyler of a plan formed to remove the troops, yet this deponent cannot recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that Mr. Tyler aſſerted that it was a part of the plan to remove the Commisſioners alſo, as ſet forth in ſaid affidavit: And whereas the mention made by Mr. Tyler of a plan that had been formed, (conſidering that the interval of time between thoſe outrages and Mr. Tyler's narration was ſcarce ſufficient wherein to form ſuch a plan and the knowledge of it to reach Mr. Tyler) may by ſome be underſtood to refer to a plan formed before thoſe outrages were committed, this deponent teſtifies that nothing ſaid by Mr. Tyler, in his hearing, did convey to him any idea of ſuch a plan formed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to thoſe outrages; and how incautiouſly and madly ſo ever ſome individuals highly incenſed, might have expreſſed themſelves, and what apprehenſions ſo ever Mr. Tyler (thro' miſinformation or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) might then have of a plan formed for removing the troops from the town, in any other way than by prevailing with their officers to remove them, this deponent verily believes that no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination had ever been formed, or plan concerted for the purpoſe of removing the troops, either in the town of Boſton or elſewhere; having never heard it ſuggeſted by any other perſon then Mr. Tyler either then or at any time ſince: And whereas in the aforementioned affidavit it is aſſerted that divers members of the Council adopted what Mr. Tyler had ſaid by referring to it, and thereby excuſing themſelves from enlarging; (which aſſertion plainly imports that divers members of the Council aſſented to and adopted all that Mr. Oliver in his affidavit had repreſented to have been ſaid by Mr. Tyler relative to a plan formed to remove the Commiſſioners as well as the Troops) this Deponent declares that altho' he had the like apprehenſions as Mr. Tyler had of the danger of further blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in caſe the troops ſhould continue in the town; yet that he never adopted any ſentiment that a plan had been concerted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Commisſioners, or even the troops in way of compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and, ſo far at leaſt, as relates to the Commisſioners, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent is fully perſuaded that no member of the Council then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent did adopt the ſame, inaſmuch as he well remembers that divers of them then declared that in their opinion the Commisſioners might continue in town with all ſafety after the troops were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thence: and no one of the Council then preſent diſcovered an opinion diverſe therefrom.</p>
               <p>And this deponent further ſays, that the amendment made of the minutes of Council which had before been taken by the Secretary (as ſaid amendment is recited in his affidavit, and which was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly agreed to by the members of Council then preſent) contains the whole of what, after full debate and mature conſideration had, was by them adopted, and (together with the advice given to the Lieutenant-Governor, to uſe his influence that the troops might be removed) was, as this deponent apprehends, the whole that could regularly be certified by the proper officer of that Board, as they were the only Votes of Council that had paſs'd upon that occaſion.</p>

               <p>HARRISON GRAY, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the members of the preſent and of the laſt year's Council, having ſeen and read a depoſition. ſigned Andrew Oliver, annexed to a pamphlet printed in London, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to the advice given by the Council to his Honor the Lieutenant Governor on the 6th of March laſt, when they adviſed his Honor to deſire Colonel Dalrymple to remove the troops from Boſton to Caſtle William—depoſes and ſays, that he being preſent at that Council, after the moſt careful recollection, he has not the leaſt remembrance that Mr. Tyler ſaid in the debate there was a plan laid for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Commiſſioners, tho' he took particular notice of what he did ſay. And this deponent further ſays, that upon the Lieut. Governor's aſking the Board, what protection there would be for the Commiſſioners if both regiments were ordered to the Caſtle, or words of the ſame import, he the deponent anſwered, that they would be as ſafe without them, as with them; for that the people would never be ſo mad as to offer them the leaſt violence, when the troops could be ſo eaſily recalled for their protection, or words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the ſame ſenſe. One Gentleman at the Board immediately ſeconded the deponent and aſſured his Honor of their ſafety, and added, that he would pawn his life that they ſhould receive no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or words that conveyed the ſame ſenſe. The deponent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, that when Mr. Tyler ſaid, "the people of the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters among us, men of eſtates, and men of religion, had formed a plan to remove the troops out of Boſton, ſhould it be called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, ſhould it incur the loſs of the charter, or be the conſequence what it would," he the deponent did not underſtand that Mr. Tyler meant that ſuch a plan was laid previous to the killing of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants by the ſoldiery, but that it was in conſequence of the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſactions of the evening of the fifth of March. And further that Mr. Tyler rather expreſſed his opinion of the meaſures the people (being thus exaſperated) would take, than his approbation of ſuch meaſures.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:011737_0029_0F8870E721014B88"/>That theſe Deponents, when in Council, told the Lieutenant- Governor, in the following words, or in words of the like import, "That the reſentment of the people in Boſton, and ſome of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towns was ſo raiſed, on account of the deſtruction of the lives of their countrymen by the Troops, who were alſo in ſuch temper with reſpect to the inhabitants, that there was reaſon to apprehend, if the Troops were not removed from the town, there would be further bloodſhed, and the people in the vicinity would in their opinion, come in to aſſiſt the inhabitants of the town in removing the Troops, unleſs they ſhould be withdrawn by the commanding Officer."</p>
               <p>This diſpoſition of the people towards the Troops, theſe deponents ſay, was, as they did then, and do now verily believe, occaſioned by the deſtruction of their countrymen as aforeſaid; and theſe depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents then intended that the Lieutenant-Governor ſhould underſtand them to mean that the people ſtill conceived of the Troops as having a hoſtile deſign againſt them: And theſe deponents animated with a ſincere deſire to preſerve, as well the lives of the King's Troops, as of the inhabitants, did thereupon expreſs their ſenſe of the neceſſity of the immediate removal of the Troops, and preſſed the matter with great earneſtneſs on the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>
               <p>Theſe Deponents further ſay, they have very lately ſeen a depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſigned Andrew Oliver, and dated, as they ſuppoſe, thro' a miſtake, March 5, 1770, reſpecting the proceedings of ſaid Council on the 6th and 7th of March laſt, which is printed in the Appendix to a Pamphlet lately publiſhed in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy Diſturbance at Boſton in New-England," which depoſition was taken before Foſter Hutchinſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Juſtices for the County of Suffolk, (without notice thereof previouſly given to theſe Deponents) in which depoſition it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that Mr. Tyler, one of the eight members of the Council then preſent, among other things ſaid, "that they (the people) had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it to remove the Troops out of town, and after that the Commiſſioners," Now theſe Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents declare, that they cannot recollect that any thing was ſaid in Council by Mr. Tyler purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants (in which ſenſe theſe Deponents apprehend the depoſition of Mr. Oliver aforeſaid may be taken; but theſe Deponents underſtood Mr.Tyler to mean, that the people were excited to ſuch a meaſure by the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and wounding of ſome of the inhabitants of the town on the evening following the 5th of March.

               <p>JOHN ERVING, JAMES PITTS and SAMUEL DEXTER, Eſquires, members of his Majeſty's Council for the Province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and who were members of ſaid Council the laſt year, do make ſolemn oath, and each ſpeaking for himſelf, in the fear of God, ſeverally ſay, that they were by order of his Honor Thomas Hutchinſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Lieutenant-Governor of the Province, notified to attend in Council on Tueſday the ſixth day of March laſt, being the day after the Troops, then in the town of Boſton, had fired upon the inhabitants of ſaid town, thereby killing and wounding divers perſons, which had occaſioned great diſorder and confuſion, and had much exaſperated the people, not only of that but of ſuch other towns as had been made acquainted with the unhappy affair.</p>
               <p>That ſeveral members of the Council convened on ſaid occaſion expreſſed their minds to the Lieutenant-Governor, in terms import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the reſentment of the people in Boſton, and ſome of the adjacent towns, was ſo raiſed on account of the deſtruction of the lives of their countrymen by the troops, who were alſo in ſuch temper with reſpect to the inhabitants, that there was reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, if the troops were not removed from the town, there would be further bloodſhed; and that the people in the vicinity

would, in their opinion, come in to aſſiſt the inhabitants of the town in removing the Troops, unleſs they ſhould be withdrawn by the commanding officer. This diſpoſition of the people towards the Troops, theſe deponents ſay, was, as they did then, and do now verily believe, occaſioned by the deſtruction of their countrymen as aforeſaid, and an apprehenſion that the Troops had ſtill a hoſtile deſign againſt them; and theſe deponents, animated with a ſincere deſire to preſerve as well the lives of the King's Troops as of the inhabitants, did with much earneſtneſs expreſs to the Lieutenant-Governor their ſenſe of the neceſſity of the immediate removal of the Troops from the town.</p>
               <p>Theſe deponents further ſay, they have very lately ſeen a depoſition ſigned Andrew Oliver, and dated, as they ſuppoſe thro' a miſtake, March 5th, 1770, reſpecting the proceedings of ſaid Council on the ſixth and ſeventh of March laſt, which is printed in the Appendix to a Pamphlet lately publiſhed in London, intitled, "A fair account of the late unhappy diſturbance at Boſton in New-England," and was taken before Foſter Hutchinſon, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> without notice thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly given to theſe deponents, in which depoſition it is aſſerted, that Mr. Tyler, one of the eight members of the Council then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, among other things, ſaid, "that they (the people) had formed their plan, and that this was a part of it, to remove the troops out of town, and after that the Commiſſioners." Now theſe deponents declare, that they cannot recollect, neither do they believe that any thing was ſaid in Council by Mr. Tyler, purporting that any plan had been formed to remove the Troops previous to their firing on the inhabitants, in which ſenſe theſe deponents apprehend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſaid Mr. Oliver will generally be taken; but theſe deponents underſtood Mr. Tyler to mean, that the people were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to ſuch a meaſure by the killing and wounding of ſome of the inhabitants of the town, on the evening immediately preceeding. Nor do theſe deponents remember that he mentioned any thing of a deſign to remove the Commiſſioners; and theſe deponents appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it altogether improbable that he ſhould have delivered ſuch an opinion, as they conceive it muſt have been conſidered as a reaſon for the Troops remaining in town, if the Commiſſioners had been ſuppoſed to be in danger; and theſe deponents are perſuaded it would have been ſo conſidered by the Lieutenant-Governor and the Commanding Officer of the Troops, and conſequently have tended to defeat the very end which the ſeveral members of the Council, and Mr. Tyler in particular, are repreſented as aiming at. And had he mentioned it as his opinion, that there was a deſign of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to remove the Commiſſioners, it would have been ſo utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſentiments of theſe deponents, and they doubt not of every other member of the Council preſent, except himſelf, that theſe deponents verily believe it muſt have produced ſuch a diſpute and oppoſition as could not ſo ſoon have been forgot. And theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents ſay, as they cannot recollect that they heard a word from Mr. Tyler of any intention to remove the Commiſſioners, ſo neither could they have adopted ſuch a ſtrange opinion, had it been advanced
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011737_0032_0F8870E960FDD4D0"/>
by any perſon whatever. And according to the beſt remembrance of theſe deponents, what was really ſaid in Council by Mr. Tyler was not referred to by any other members preſent, in ſuch manner as that it could with the leaſt degree of propriety be affirmed in general terms, as it is in the depoſition of the ſaid Mr. Oliver, that they adopted what Mr. Tyler had ſaid.</p>
               <p>Theſe deponents further declare, that the words made uſe of in the amendment, as recited by the ſaid Mr. Oliver in his ſaid depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which were the next morning propoſed in Council to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted inſtead of the terms the Secretary had uſed in the minutes of Council taken the day before; theſe deponents then verliy thought leſs liable to be miſconſtrued; and that by this alteration the true meaning and intent of the ſeveral members of the Council in what they had on the preceeding day ſaid to the Lieutenant-Governor, of the diſpoſition of the people, would fully and fairly appear.</p>
               <p>And theſe deponents further declare, that if any other perſon or perſons have repreſented theſe deponents as ſaying in ſaid Council, or at any other time, that there was an intention of the people to effect by force the removal of the Troops, before their firing on the inhabitants as aforeſaid, or any purpoſe, either prior or poſterior to the fifth of March laſt, of removing the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, or words of the like import, or as adopting ſuch ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after having been advanced by any perſon whatever, ſuch repreſentation is not only contrary to fact, but utterly void of all foundation.</p>
               <p>And furthermore theſe deponents declare, that, in their beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and firm belief, no ſuch intention or purpoſe of the people, or of the inhabitants of the town of Boſton, or of any other town or place in the Province, ever exiſted, either with reſpect to the Troops or the Commmiſſioners.</p>

               <p>THAT your Petitioner obſerves in the Votes of Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in his Petition preferred the 5th inſtant to this honorable Board as a branch of the Legiſlature, that he is charged with <hi>repreſenting</hi> divers Gentlemen of the Council of the laſt year, in a certain depoſition publiſhed in England,
<q>as having made ſuch a declaration to his Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, reſpecting a plan formed by the people to remove the King's Troops and the Commiſſioners <hi>of the Cuſtoms</hi> from the town of Boſton, as was likely to be attended with the moſt pernicious conſequences to this Province.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Your Petitioner hereupon begs leave to obſerve to your Honors that he hath repreſented Mr. Tyler <hi>only,</hi> as having made a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kind; and divers other Gentlemen as only
<q>adopting what Mr. Tyler had ſaid, by referring expreſsly to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon excuſing themſelves from enlarging.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before your Petitioner attempts to explain his ſaid depoſition, he hopes he may without offence be allowed to take notice, that he hath not uſed the words—Commiſſioners <hi>of the Cuſtoms,</hi> as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Vote of Council, but—the Commiſſioners <hi>only:</hi> and he the rather takes notice of this variation, becauſe it brings freſh to his mind, how cautious he was in framing his depoſition. He perfectly remembers that Mr. Tyler mentioned the Commiſſioners, but not the Commiſſioners <hi>of the Cuſtoms;</hi> your Petitioner therefore did not inſert thoſe deſcriptive words in his depoſition.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner apprehends that the ſeveral poſitive witneſſes which he hath produced to prove that Mr. Tyler ſaid the words abovementioned, muſt be conſidered as undoubted evidence of the fact: but he never once pretended to ſay that divers other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made ſuch a declaration, otherwiſe than by adopting what Mr. Tyler had ſaid, i. e. by referring to it and thereupon deſiring to be excuſed from enlarging.</p>
               <p>He thinks he has not miſunderſtood the meaning of the word <hi>adopt.</hi> The word, as he conceives, in its primary ſignification intends—a perſon's taking another's child as his own. From hence, when one relates a ſtory or an hiſtorical account of facts upon the credit of another, without ſhewing any doubt of the truth of them, he is ſaid to adopt the ſtory or account related by him; and in like manner he may be ſaid to adopt the opinion of another, when he expreſsly refers to it without betraying a doubt about it: he does ſo in a more eſpecial manner, when he refers to ſuch opinion for his own government, or the government of others in point of practice. In this ſenſe your Petitioner underſtood the word <hi>adopt</hi>: Had he ſaid that divers other Gentlemen <hi>confirmed</hi> what Mr. Tyler had ſaid, it might have been then alledged, that they were charged with vouching for the truth of facts themſelves, whereas the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011737_0035_0F8870EBA0F800A0"/>
word <hi>adopt</hi> ſtrictly and literally implies no more than that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed the truth of facts on the credit of the relator; nor did your Petitioner ever intend any thing more by it; and that upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of the facts related, they might found their opinion.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner therefore hopes his depoſition cannot be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as containing any unjuſt charge againſt any of the Gentlemen of the Council who referred to what had been ſaid by another Gentleman as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Nor did your Petitioner ever apprehend that the good people of the Province in general were at all chargeable with forming any unjuſtifiable plan. If the plan ſaid to have been formed to remove the Troops and Commiſſioners was to have been executed in a legal and conſtitutional way, they would doubtleſs be ready to avow it themſelves. If it was to have been executed by violence, ſuch plans are uſually formed by a few; and if it was formed after the evening of the 5th and before noon of the 6th of March, it may well be ſuppoſed that there were very few concerned in the forming of it.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner never intended to convey any idea of the plan's being formed prior to the 6th of March rather than after it: He is confident that he has been preciſe in ſetting down the very words uſed on the occaſion, without adding any conſtruction of his own.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner will not preſume to make any other obſervations on the depoſitions of the Gentlemen of the Council who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this buſineſs, ſave that they are generally negative teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ſome of them principally argumentative. The principal matter wherein the teſtimony of divers of ſaid Gentlemen differs from that of your Petitioner, appears to him to be concerning what relates to the Commiſſioners; with regard to which, he apprehends, his depoſition is fully ſupported by the teſtimony of diſintereſted witneſſes then preſent.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioner drew up a memorandum of that day's proceedings, without the privity of any one, merely to aſſiſt his memory in future. When he was afterwards called upon by the Lieutenant-Governor for his teſtimony concerning thoſe matters, he had this memorandum or narrative copied without any alteration. It does not appear to have had any influence on the meaſures of government at home, as the proceedings relative to the Troops are not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Reſolves of the King in Council in July laſt: Nor has he heard of any private letter from London mentioning the ſaid depoſition as like to be attended with any pernicious conſequences. He therefore prays that for the reaſons herein mentioned, and thoſe in his Petition of the 5th inſtant, this honorable Board will, in juſtice to his character, order the ſame, together with the depoſitions he has adduced, to be lodged on the files of this Court, and take ſuch further order for preventing any prejudice to his character on this occaſion, as in equity ſhall ſeem meet. And your Petitioner ſhall, as in duty bound, ever pray, &amp;c.</p>
