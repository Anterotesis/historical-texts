            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOB IX. v, vi.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Which removeth the Mountains, and they know not; which overturneth the Earth in his Anger; which ſhaketh the Earth out of her Place, and the Pillars thereof tremble.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE ſhaking of the earth, when it ariſes to any great degree, is one of the moſt awful events in all nature. It is attended with danger, which none can either withſtand, avoid, or make their eſcape from: And the deſtruction it threatens is ſudden, and dreadful, and equally extends to all the various ranks, conditions, and ages of men; whether high or low, rich or poor, bond or free, old or young. It is therefore an occurrence that is ſingularly fitted to ſtrike the mind with ſurprize; and whether we will or no, it alarms our fears, and awakens in us a quick and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007380_0004_102B8C8278712C48"/>
pungent ſenſe of the power and greatneſs of God. The moſt hardened ſinners, thoſe who have mock't at fear, and laugh't at deſtruction, are hereby rouſed into aſtoniſhment. Even the dumb creatures are affected with a kind of horror, and very ſignificantly expreſs it by their dolorous roars, tho' not modulated into articulate ſounds.</p>
            <p>Of this we had a very lively illuſtration the laſt week, when God aroſe, and ſuddenly awoke us out of our ſleep, by terribly ſhaking the earth. We were all thrown into a ſtate of trembling. Horror took hold of us, and we were afraid of this tremendous judgment of God; not knowing but we ſhould ſink down quick into ſome deep cavern below, or be buried in the ruins of our own habitations. May we never forget the diſtreſs of that awful morning, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of it!</p>
            <p>It is with a view to aſſiſt both you, and myſelf, in making a wiſe and religious improvement of ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary a providence, that I have ſelected this text to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our preſent meditations. It obviouſly contains two things well worthy of our ſpecial notice, namely,
<list>
                  <item>I. That 'tis GOD who maketh the <hi>earth to ſhake,</hi> and <hi>the pillars thereof to tremble.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. That he <hi>ordinarily</hi> does this in <hi>teſtimony</hi> of his <hi>righteous anger.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. 'Tis GOD who maketh the <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>ſhake</hi> and <hi>tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this he does, either by an <hi>immediate</hi> exertment of his almighty power, or by concurring with ſuch <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> as are fitted, in the natural courſe of their operation, to produce ſo wonderful an effect.</p>
            <p>There may have been <hi>miraculous</hi> earthquakes, earthquakes that took riſe from the <hi>immediate</hi> hand of God. The earthquakes which accompanied <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007380_0005_102B8459987E9D58"/>
paſſage thro' the <hi>red ſea,</hi> and the river <hi>Jordan,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated by the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſalm.</hi> 114, might be of this ſort. The earthquake, which ſwallow'd up <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and <hi>company,</hi> recorded <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 30—33, might be another inſtance of the ſame kind. So, when the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſcended on <hi>Sinai,</hi> and publiſhed his law from thence, it might be <hi>miraculouſly,</hi> that <hi>the whole mount quaked greatly, Exod.</hi> 19. 18. In alluſion to this wonderful event the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, Pſal. 68. 7, <hi>The earth ſhook, the heavens alſo dropped at the preſence of God: even</hi> Sinai <hi>itſelf was moved at the preſence of God, the God of Iſrael.</hi> And of the ſame kind ſtill might be the earthquake which happened at the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of our Lord, ſpoken of in that language, <hi>Matt.</hi> 29. 51. <hi>And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom; and the Earth did quake, and the rocks rent:</hi> And that alſo which was felt at his reſurrection, recorded in thoſe words, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 2, <hi>And behold, there was a great earthquake!</hi> Theſe earthquakes, 'tis obſervable, were all produced in an <hi>age of miracles,</hi> at a time when the great God, in other inſtances, exerted his <hi>immediate</hi> almighty power; for which reaſon it may probably eno' be ſuppoſed, that <hi>theſe</hi> alſo were effected by a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> operation.</p>
            <p>But more commonly the great God makes uſe of <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> in the production of earthquakes; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting his power, not <hi>immediately,</hi> but by <hi>concurring with theſe Cauſes.</hi> There are ſtores of them, no doubt, in the bowels of the earth: But knoweſt thou, O man, what they are, or how they operate to the production of theſe amazing events? Much has been ſaid, upon the origin of earthquakes, by men of learning; but, after all that yet has been ſaid, and by the greateſt Philoſophers too, perhaps, this work of God may juſtly be ranked among thoſe marvellous ones, which cannot be comprehended; and in contemplation on which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007380_0006_102B8C8675AC43D0"/>
we may take to ourſelves words, and ſay, <hi>Behold, God is great, and we know him not!</hi> The noiſe of his voice, in the deep caverns of the earth, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain! That amazing power, which cauſes the earth, in a circle of hundreds of miles, to quiver and tremble, or undulate in waves like thoſe of the ſea, who can underſtand! But tho' we can't penetrate into the ſecret ſprings of an extenſive terrible earthquake; yet we have no reaſon to think, but that it takes riſe from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>ſecond Cauſes,</hi> in common with the other phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of nature: Only theſe cauſes muſt always be conſidered as having the firſt Cauſe of all things for their director and Governor. The ſhaking of the earth, in every inſtance, is bro't to paſs under the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending guidance, and almighty concurrence, of the ſupreme regent of nature. <hi>Second Cauſes</hi> may, while working in a natural way, produce this effect; but ſtill God is more a great deal the cauſe of them than they. 'Twas he who at firſt eſtabliſh'd the laws of nature, giving to all ſecond cauſes their reſpective powers of operation, and aſſigning to them their ſeveral ſpheres of acting.—Tis he who upholds them all in being and operation; for by him do all things conſiſt.—Tis he who concurs with them in their influence, ſo as that without him they could not act at all.—Tis he who directs and governs all their motions and ſprings of action; and ſo over-rules them, as that they ſhall exert their force in this, or that place, to this or that degree, juſt as he pleaſes, and as may beſt ſerve his deſigns in the kingdom of providence.</p>
            <p>So that tho' earthquakes are <hi>ordinarily</hi> produced, in a natural way, by a concurrence of ſuitable and ſufficient ſecond cauſes; yet it is God who produces them: He is more properly their <hi>Cauſe,</hi> than any <hi>ſecondary</hi> one, or than all ſecondary ones together: For they are all his; he made them; he upholds
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007380_0007_102B8C889CAAE1E8"/>
them; he commands them; he controuls and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules them: They act by him, and for him; and can do nothing without him.</p>
            <p>And tis on ſuch accounts as theſe, that the ſcripture ſo frequently ſpeaks of Earthquakes as the <hi>work of God;</hi> repreſenting him as that glorious being, who <hi>ſhaketh the earth, and overturneth the mountains.</hi> That is the language, in which the pious <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> has taught us to ſpeak of an earthquake, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 60. 1, 2, <hi>O God, thou haſt made the earth to tremble.</hi> So, when he would deſcribe an earthquake, tis in ſuch words as thoſe, Pſalm. 104. 32, <hi>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth; he toucheth the hills, and they ſmoke.</hi> In like manner, holy <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking in my text, of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, carries our tho'ts beyond all <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> to the glorious <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> of all things: <hi>Which removeth the mountains; which overturneth them in his anger; which ſhaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</hi> Agreable whereto is that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 5, <hi>And the Lord of hoſts is he that toucheth the land, and it ſhall melt; and it ſhall riſe up wholly like a flood;</hi> that is, it ſhall appear with a motion like that of the waves in a flood.—But it would be needleſs to enlarge here. You are all, I believe, convinced not only of the being and perfections, but of the providential government of God; that his throne is prepared in the heavens, and that his kingdom ruleth over all, extending even to the motion of a <hi>ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and the falling of a <hi>hair</hi> from off our heads; much more to thoſe violent concuſſions in the deep caverns of the earth, which make it to tremble.</p>
            <p>Only, let me, as the proper improvement of this part of my ſubject, put you upon attending to this truth, and exerciſing an affectionate awaken'd faith in it, with reſpect to the great event of the other morning. Seriouſly carry your tho'ts beyond all <hi>ſecond Cauſes,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:007380_0008_102B8C8A99D8BAD0"/>
and fix your eye on <hi>God</hi> as the ſupreme author of the dreadful earthquake that then fill'd you with diſtreſs; and encourage in your minds the moſt lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions both of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodneſs,</hi> which were eminently diſplayed at that time, taking care to pay him thoſe <hi>religious</hi> acknowledgments that are his due.</p>
            <p>There is, perhaps, no work in the kingdom of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that renders the great God more awfully glorious, than this of his terribly ſhaking the earth under us, and our houſes over us. A moſt marvellous diſplay is hereby made of his <hi>almighty power.</hi> How weak and feeble do all creatures appear in compariſon with him! If he does but touch the mountains, they tremble; the hills, and they are moved at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence! One of the firſt tho'ts that ariſes in the mind, upon the ſhock of an earthquake, is that, "the Lord is a mighty God; what God is there in the heaven, or in the earth, that can do according to his works, and according to his might"? Let us, from what we ſaw, and felt, in the late earthquake, entertain in our hearts an awakened apprehenſion of him as clothed with power; and be in a diſpoſition to fall down before him with ſuch religious acknowledgments in our mouths as thoſe, "Thou art great, O Lord; there is none like thee, neither is there any God beſides thee: Thou haſt a mighty arm, and ſtrength is in thy right hand: Thou art the Lord God omnipotent." And let us fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this great and holy Lord God, whoſe is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the greatneſs, and the majeſty; who can do whatſoever he pleaſes in heaven, and earth, and all deep places, and in a moment, at any time, deſtroy our <hi>Souls</hi> as well as bodies, and this in <hi>hell.</hi>—</p>
            <p>The <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God has likewiſe been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully manifeſted in this event of providence. To what elſe can it be aſcribed, that, when he ſo awfully ſhook our houſes, he ſo proportion'd the force with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007380_0009_102B8C8C72B8AE20"/>

               </hi> which cauſed the earth to ſhake, which if he had done but a few degrees more, the effect would inevitably have been our ſudden and general deſtruction? And to what can we attribute it, but to his unmerited goodneſs, that he thus reſtrained his wrath, and did not ſuffer it to involve us in common ruin? O how infinitely indebted are we to the mercy of a good God?—How ſhould we call upon our Souls, and all that is within us to bleſs his holy name!—O let us never be unmindful of this marvellous mercy of God, to which alone it is owing we were not conſumed. How ſhould Sinners, ſuch in ſpecial who are conſcious to themſelves that they are heinouſly ſo, acknowledge and adore this rich pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God towards them, which has lengthened out their lives, and their ſpace for repentance? Had the earth, in its late agitation, inſtantaneouſly ſwallowed you up in ſome wide chaſin, or put an end to your lives by the cruſh of your falling houſes, where had you been now? Whither would your Souls have gone? O moſt important enquiry!—Oh be thankful to a good God, that you are yet alive, and yet within the reach of mercy! And be inſtant in your care to make your peace with him, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, and to get into a ſtate of ſafety, with reſpect to another world; and it will now be well with you, ſhould God ever ſo ſuddenly, or awfully, call you hence to be here no more.—But I muſt now go on to the other obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely,</p>
            <p>II. That when God maketh the earth to ſhake and tremble, tis <hi>ordinarily</hi> in teſtimony of his <hi>anger.</hi> I ſay <hi>ordinarily,</hi> becauſe the <hi>anger</hi> of God has not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> been the <hi>more ſpecial reaſon</hi> of his cauſing an earthquake. He has ſometimes deſigned this to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007380_0010_102B8C8E032AE5D8"/>
other ends beſides teſtifying his diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he may have had it in view to declare his own infinite <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>majeſty.</hi> This ſeems to have been the <hi>more ſpecial reaſon</hi> of his making the earth terribly to ſhake, when he publiſh'd the law from the top of <hi>Sinai.</hi> It was not becauſe he was now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation; for he was <hi>ſhewing his word unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and his ſtatutes and his judgments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Iſrael; and dealing with them, in a way of favour, beyond what he had ever before done to any other people. But it became the divine being to appear with the enſigns of <hi>majeſty;</hi> and it was, that he might gloriouſly diſplay his <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> that he made the <hi>mount to quake ſo terribly,</hi> when he came down upon it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes his <hi>more immediate</hi> intention has been the <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>deliverance</hi> of his people, and to give proof of his <hi>ſignal preſence</hi> with them to <hi>protect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,</hi> and <hi>bleſs</hi> them. So, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> went forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord appeared marvellouſly for them, and their <hi>deliverance</hi> was very much owing to the dreadful earthquake, which ſwallow'd up <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his <hi>hoſt.</hi> For that their deſtruction was bro't about by an earthquake is very plain from thoſe words, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 12, <hi>Thou ſtretchedſt out thy right hand, and the earth ſwallowed them.</hi> Tis true, there might be a double inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the production of this earthquake. If it was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a teſtimony of God's anger againſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and ſent in judgment to deſtroy them; it was intended alſo, and this primarily, for the ſalvation of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So, when this ſame people had entered into <hi>Canaan,</hi> it was by earthquakes that God ſometimes diſplay'd his power in favour of them, to defend and protect them. In alluſion to this is that acknowledgment to the ſupreme majeſty, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 4. 5. <hi>Lord, when thou wenteſt out of</hi> Seir, <hi>when thou marchedſt out of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007380_0011_102B8C8FB4C34748"/>
field of</hi> Edom, <hi>the earth trembled, the mount melted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi> It was probably by an earthquake, that God threw down the walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and delivered that city into the hands of the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> the ſtory of which we have at large in the 6th Chapter of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> And the earthquake which ſhook open the door of the priſon, were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were confined, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd in mercy to thoſe <hi>Servants of the moſt high God;</hi> to vindicate their character, and make way for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and the furtherance of the Goſpel thereby. In all theſe earthquakes, there might be an exhibition of the divine anger againſt the enemies of religion; but ſtill the <hi>principal</hi> intention ſeems to have been to give proof of the preſence of God with his ſervants to make way for their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>In fine, ſometimes God has tho't fit to accompany an extraordinary <hi>out-pouring of his ſpirit</hi> with the ſhock of an earthquake. So, when the Apoſtles were united in ſolemn prayer, there was the noiſe as of a <hi>mighty ruſhing wind,</hi> which <hi>ſhook the place where they were aſſembled together:</hi> Upon which it follows, Acts 4. 31. <hi>they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe things notwithſtanding, earthquakes more commonly are ſent in judgment, and becauſe <hi>God is angry.</hi> This is very plainly intimated in my text; and there are numerous other ſcriptures which ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Pſalm</hi> xvi. 7. <hi>The earth ſhook and trembled; the foundations alſo of the hills moved, and were ſhaken, becauſe he was wroth.</hi> Ezek. xxxviii. 19, 20, compared with <hi>Nahum</hi> i. 5, 6. <hi>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his preſence; yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. Who can ſtand before his indignation? And who can abide in the fierceneſs of his wrath? His fury is poured out like fire; and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007380_0012_102B8C9257EF3668"/>
But had the ſcripture been ſilent upon this head, we might eaſily have known, that earthquakes are a token of the <hi>divine anger.</hi> They are, in their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt fearful events, and carry with them the moſt lively ſignatures of <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi> How can we do any other than conclude, that the majeſty of heaven is <hi>angry,</hi> when we behold him throwing the earth into ſuch a ſtate, as that it ſtruggles and heaves, as though all over convulſed? This indeed is the ſentiment of all hearts, at ſuch an awful time. Who is there that is not filled with concern, from an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the great God as <hi>angry?</hi> How do our ſins now fly in our faces? How conſcious are we of guilt? How diſtreſt leſt God ſhould be about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute upon us the fierceneſs of his wrath? There is ſcarce a ſinner ſo profligate and abandoned, but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs now takes hold of him; and however thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was before of God, he now realiſes his being and providence, has awakened in him a ſenſe of his obligations to him, and cant help trembling at the thought that he is angry, and may now be about to take vengeance on him.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, when the ſhaking of the earth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively light, and attended with no bad effects, men may not look upon it, at leaſt not conſider it, as an evidence of God's diſpleaſure; but its agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſometimes ſo violent, and the effects follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon ſo diſmal, as to convince all, even the moſt obdurate, that God is, and that he is diſpleaſed; yea, filled with indignation. Bleſſed be God, we, in this land, have not as yet been viſited with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes that have done any more than ſolemnly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us; though they have often been ſent upon other places, not only to the filling men's minds with horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſternation, not only to the throwing down here and there a houſe, and taking away here and there a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007380_0013_102B8C95B8EB0F68"/>
life; but to the ingulſing large cities, and numerous villages, in one common deſolation. The rocks have been rent, the hills moved, the mountains overturned, and the earth ſo opened as to take down her inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants by hundreds and thouſands. No leſs than an hundred thouſand ſouls have been deſtroyed, in a few moments, by one dreadful earthquake. And can this be, and God at the ſame time not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ched with anger? Wherein could the holy righteous God more awfully make it evident, that he is diſpleaſed? War, famines, peſtilences are ſpoken of in ſcripture as the <hi>great judgments</hi> of God; but they are neither of them to be compared with <hi>earthquakes.</hi> Theſe, of all God's judicial diſpenſations, are the moſt terrible; and the ſureſt indication of his righteous anger.</p>
            <p>But you will aſk, it may be, what is the reaſon of this <hi>anger</hi> of God? From whence is it excited? Why is it ſtirred up?</p>
            <p>To this I would ſay, when the prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> ſaw the tents of <hi>Cuſhan in affliction,</hi> and the land of <hi>Midian</hi> in a ſtate of <hi>trembling,</hi> he at once concluded, that God was <hi>angry;</hi> but, at the ſame time, was far from imagining, that it was at the inanimate <hi>earth.</hi> Says he, <hi>chapter</hi> iii. ver. 8. <hi>Was the Lord diſpleaſed againſt the rivers? Was thine anger againſt the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? Was thy wrath againſt the ſea?</hi> Far be it from the all-wiſe God to be angry at the <hi>rivers,</hi> or <hi>earth,</hi> or <hi>ſea!</hi> He is capable of anger, in the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe it is applied to him, with <hi>man</hi> only on this earth, and with nothing in man but <hi>ſin.</hi> Sin is the ground, and the only moral ground, of the anger of God, that anger of his, which cauſeth the earth to ſhake and tremble. 'Tis <hi>this</hi> that tranſgreſſeth his law, oppoſes his will, affronts his ſovereignty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects contempt upon his government, and brings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion into the <hi>moral</hi> world: 'Tis <hi>this</hi> therefore
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007380_0014_102B8C97F2F86E70"/>
that excites his diſpleaſure, and to ſuch a degree ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as that he is provoked to bring on the ſhock of an earthquake to warn, or puniſh, the ſinful ſons of men. To this purpoſe are thoſe words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> v. 24, 25. <hi>Becauſe they have caſt away the law of the Lord of hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> THEREFORE <hi>is the anger of the Lord kind<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> againſt his people, and he hath ſtretched forth his hand againſt them;—and the</hi> HILLS DID TREMBLE.</p>
            <p>But as the ſcripture takes notice of <hi>ſome ſins in ſpecial,</hi> which have excited the <hi>anger</hi> of God, and been the occaſion of earthquakes, either in his <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> or the <hi>execution</hi> of them; I ſhall not think it unſeaſonable to point them out to you at this time, as particularly worthy of your moſt ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>The ſins included in the term, <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> have ſo offended God, as that he has teſtified his <hi>anger</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by an <hi>earthquake.</hi> I mention theſe ſins firſt, becauſe they are the ſins in <hi>ſpecial,</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the firſt earthquake, we have an account of, in the bible; and a very tremendous one it was. You all know, what the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> were; and you know alſo, what ſudden and terrible deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was brought on them herefor. Beſides the fire and brimſtone, which God rained on them from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The manner in which the ſcripture deſcribes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of theſe cities, with their inhabitants, ſeems to point out an <hi>earthquake,</hi> as well as an horrible <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of fire;</hi> for it is ſaid, Gen. 29. 25, <hi>The Lord overthrew theſe cities, and their inhabitants.</hi> And tis obſervable, the prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſpeaking of this

event, ſays, <hi>Lament.</hi> 4. 6, <hi>They were overthrown as in a moment;</hi> which perfectly agrees with the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an <hi>earthquake.</hi> And tis certain, that theſe cities, with the country round about, for many miles in breadth, and more in length, were not only <hi>burnt,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſunk down;</hi> and in the place where they ſtood, there is now a nauſeous lake, called the <hi>dead,</hi> or <hi>ſalt ſea:</hi> And it remains to this day.</p>
            <p>I will not preſume to determine, that it was for the ſins comprehended in <hi>uncleaneſs,</hi> in diſtinction from others, that God was provoked the laſt week terribly to ſhake the earth; but this I will venture to ſay, that as theſe ſins are ſhamefully prevalent all over the land, and emphatically in this town, we might do well to eſteem ourſelves warned of God againſt <hi>uncleanneſs,</hi> in all its various branches, and call'd upon to flee theſe filthy luſts, leſt, after the manner of <hi>Sodom,</hi> we alſo ſhould be ſet forth as an example, for giving our ſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sabbath-breaking</hi> is likewiſe a ſin, God has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to teſtify againſt by ſhaking the earth. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet brings in the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that language, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5, <hi>When will the new moon be gone, that we may ſell corn? and the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that we may ſet forth wheat?</hi> And then follows an awful denunciation from God, v. 7. 8, <hi>The Lord hath ſworn by the excellency of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Surely I will not forget any of their works: ſhall not the land trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tis no wonder he has been ſo ſevere in ſignifying his diſpleaſure at the violation of his <hi>Sabbath.</hi> For tis one of the laws he publiſh'd from <hi>Sinai,</hi> and with more awful pomp than he ever before, or ſince, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed any of his laws. And tis a law, the due ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation whereof has a near connection with the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obſervation of the other divine precepts. If
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007380_0016_102B8C9C69C1B280"/>
men are ſacredly careful to ſanctify the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in their hearts, cloſets, and families, as well as in the place of public worſhip, it will have an happy influence on their general temper and conduct, to render them amiable and lovely: Whereas, if they have upon their minds no ſerious ſenſe of <hi>Sabbath-ſanctification,</hi> and make little or no difference between <hi>Lord's-'Days,</hi> and other days, neglecting religion in themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as well as in the ſanctuary; or attending on ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-duties in a formal ſuperficial manner, the ſame unhallow'd ſpirit will be likely to run thro' their whole behaviour in the world. And it ſeldom happens, but men are looſe and prophane in other regards, if they are ſo with reſpect to the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> This therefore of remembring the ſabbath-day to keep it holy, is a duty of greater importance, than many may be ready to imagine; and the neglecting, or prophaning, the day by idleneſs, recreation, or unneceſſary worldly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is highly diſpleaſing to God: And we may the rather think ſo, becauſe he has threatned this ſin with ſo awful a judgment.</p>
            <p>And ſuffer me to remind you here, it was on the evening of the ſabbath, about eight and twenty years ago, that we were ſurprized with the moſt fearful earthquake that was ever before known in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; it was on a ſabbath-day alſo, and while in the place of worſhip, that we were again ſurprized, about ten years ſince, with a like, tho' more moderate, ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the earth; and the laſt evening, which we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem a part of the ſabbath, we were yet again alarmed with an agitated earth. Ought we not to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from hence to reflect upon our <hi>Sabbath-ſins</hi> as particularly provoking to God? May we not learn the meaning of the threatning in providence by the <hi>timeing</hi> of it? Are not our tho'ts naturally pointed to the diſhonor we have done God, by diſregarding that law of his which binds us to ſanctify the ſabbath?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007380_0017_102B8C9DFACEFE20"/>
It cannot be pretended, that the <hi>ſabbath</hi> is obſerved among us with that conſcience and care, which might reaſonably be expected, conſidering our high profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to regard it as a day to the Lord.—Are not many too ready to ſay with the Jews, in the text we juſt now mentioned, <hi>when will the ſabbath be gone,</hi> that we may go about our worldly buſineſs? Are not many as free to take their diverſions on this day, as on any other? Do not many neglect the public worſhip on this day, and take as little care to cultivate religion in their families, or in their own ſouls? We have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reaſon, we eſpecially of this town, to call our ſelves to account for our breaches of the holy ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, to conſider of our paſt omiſſions of duty, and commiſſions of ſin, and to humble ourſelves herefor before God: Nor would this be a miſimprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent diſpenſation of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride</hi> is another ſin God has teſtified his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by earthquakes. To this purpoſe is that of the prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> ii. 12, 17, 21. <hi>For the day of the Lord of hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud, and lofty; and upon every one that is lifted up: And he ſhall be brought low. And the loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughtineſs of man ſhall be made low; and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day,</hi>—<hi>when he ſhall ariſe to ſhake terribly the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis no more than might be expected, that God ſhould thus ſignify his diſpleaſure againſt the ſin of <hi>pride.</hi> For 'tis a ſin that God has mentioned by name, and ſpoken of as an <hi>abomination</hi> to him. And 'tis the ſource of moſt other ſins. 'Tis this that gives riſe to that extravagance of dreſs, and thoſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, not to ſay indecent faſhions, which the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion ſo generally run into: 'Tis this that puts ſo many upon exceeding their ability, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007380_0018_102B8D8684CDF718"/>
ſtation, in expenſive living; the end whereof muſt be their reduction to poverty in a little time, if they don't grow more humble: 'Tis this that leads men to think more highly of themſelves than they deſerve, and to treat their neighbours with ſuch inſolence and contempt: In a word, 'tis this that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes men to imagine, that even God himſelf has as great a regard for them, as they have for themſelves, by which means they are diſcontented and unthankful. We might properly take occaſion to conſider wherein, we may have been chargeable with this vice, in any of its branches, that we may humble our ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, repent, and no more, in this way, excite the anger of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> is another ſin ſtill, which God has threatened with an earthquake; however it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whether by downright oppreſſion and violence, or the more ſecret arts of fraud and knavery. Theſe ways of diſhoneſt dealing are particularly mentioned as the moral ground of God's cauſing the earth to tremble, by the prophet <hi>Amos.</hi> He ſpeaks, in the third chapter of his propheſy, ver. 4. 6, of thoſe who <hi>ſwallowed up the needy,</hi> and <hi>bought the poor for ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> Here is cruel extortion, downright oppreſſion. In the 6th ver. he ſpeaks of thoſe who <hi>made the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah ſmall, and the ſhekel great; falſifying the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance by deceit:</hi> Here is the more ſly and artful way of tricking and cheating in commerce. And now follows the threatning, in the 8th verſe, <hi>ſhall not the land tremble for this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may poſſibly think it a matter of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, whether we are honeſt, or not. We may eſteem honeſty nothing more than a pagan virtue. But we ought to know, that a real principle of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is a chriſtian grace, and of abſolute and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible neceſſity. Our Saviour has ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007380_0019_102B846B681CD068"/>
ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye the ſame to them:</hi> Nor unleſs we are, in ſome good meaſure, formed to ſuch a temper as this, are we worthy the name of chriſtians? Righteouſneſs, in all its branches towards our neighbour, as well as towards God, is what we muſt practiſe; or we ſhall certainly expoſe ourſelves to that anger of heaven, which may cauſe the earth to tremble and ſink under us. This may be eſpecially worthy of our conſideration, in ſuch a day of awful rebuke as this is; and the rather, becauſe it may be feared, whether unrighteouſneſs, open or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; in the ways of violence, or under the diſguiſe of art, is not emphatically the ſin of <hi>New-England</hi> in general, and of this <hi>Town</hi> in particular. Says the prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> v. 6. <hi>Wo unto them that join houſe to houſe, and field to field!</hi> He is ſpeaking of thoſe who do it by unfair means, in the methods of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty. The reaſon of this Woe follows in the 25th verſe, <hi>The hills did tremble, and their carcaſes were torn in the midſt of the ſtreets;</hi> that is, by the falling of ſcattered pieces of the houſes upon them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is another ſin, it might be expected, God would viſit with an earthquake. Reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too and fro is the characteriſtic of one that is drunk. And 'tis obſervable, the prophet, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing an earthquake, ſpeaks of it in much the ſame language. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiv. 19, 20. <hi>The earth is moved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, the earth ſhall reel to and fro like a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and ſhall be removed like a cottage.</hi> But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of motion in an earthquake, the analogy between this judgment and <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> is not the only reaſon we have to think, that <hi>this</hi> is a ſin God would teſtify againſt. It is mentioned, by name, in ſcripture, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when committed in company, and with noiſie vain merriment, as that which will expoſe to the woe of an earthquake. <hi>Iſai.</hi> v. 11, 12. <hi>Wo unto them that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007380_0020_102B846DD2430898"/>
riſe up early in the morning, that they may follow ſtrong drink; that continue until night, till wine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them. And the harp, and the viol; the tabret, and the pipe, and wine, are in their feaſts: But they regard not the work of the Lord; neither conſider the operation of his hands.</hi> The threatning follows, in the 25th verſe, <hi>Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled againſt his people, and the hills did tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An awakening conſideration this to the people of <hi>New-England!</hi> among whom there are ſo many, of whom it may with truth be ſaid, that <hi>they follow ſtrong drink,</hi> and <hi>continue at it till they are enflamed by it.</hi> How general is the practice of <hi>drinking to</hi> exceſs? What large quantities of ſpirituous liquors are there conſumed in this land, and in this town! Do not many of our people ſpend too much of their time, and too much of their ſubſtance, in taverns! Are there none of them that walk in rioting and drunkenneſs, in addition to chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Have we never ſeen drunkards reeling to and fro in the ſtreets, as we have paſſed along? And can it be thought ſtrange, if God, in teſtimony againſt this enormous vice, ſhould cauſe the earth to reel alſo? And it were well for ſinners, in this kind, if this was all they might expect from a provoked God. But 'tis far from being ſo. They are particularly marked, in the revelations of ſcripture, as perſons that ſhall be excluded heaven; as we read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 9. <hi>Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God:</hi> Nor is this the worſt of their caſe; for unleſs they repent in time, they ſhall <hi>have their part,</hi> as it is declared, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxi. 8, <hi>in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone.</hi>

            <p>In fine, Enmity to Chriſt, and ill treatment of him, has been teſtified againſt by an earthquake. The next thing recorded after the death of our Saviour, which
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007380_0021_102B846F684ABE38"/>
was bro't about by the hatred and malice of the Jews againſt his perſon, and religion, is that, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. 51, <hi>The earth did quake, and the rocks rent.</hi> It might be to do honour to Chriſt, as the Son of God and Saviour of men, that the earth groaned, and trembled, when he gave up the ghoſt; but his deſign alſo, in this event, at this particular time, no doubt, was, to ſignify his high diſpleaſure at the Jews, who, by wicked hands, had crucified and ſlew the Lord of glory. And if we juſtify their conduct by our hatred of him; if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his great ſalvation; if we refuſe him who has ſpoken to us from heaven; if we reject his perſon and counſel; and if, by obſtinately continuing in thoſe ſins for the expiation of which he died, we virtually crucify him afreſh, and put him to open ſhame:—ſhall not we alſo be juſtly liable to the reſentments of God? and would it be any wonder, if he ſhould teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his anger, by viſiting us with the ſhocks of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake? While we refuſe to have this man to reign over us, and expreſs our diſregard to him by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and diſobedience, we are in danger not only of judgments in this world, but of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hell. O that we had upon our minds a due ſenſe of this! And that we might herefrom be awakened to a ſpeedy flight to Chriſt, in the Goſpel way! We ſhall then be ſafe from evil here, and ſecure from the divine wrath hereafter.</p>
            <p>Enough, I believe, has now been ſaid to ſatisfy us, that the <hi>anger</hi> of God is <hi>that</hi> which excites him to ſend <hi>earthquakes;</hi> as alſo to point out thoſe <hi>ſins</hi> which may <hi>eminently</hi> be the ground of his diſpleaſure, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe judicial diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>And now, from what has been diſcourſed, may we not juſtly fear, that God is <hi>angry</hi> with his people in this <hi>town</hi> and <hi>land?</hi> When he ſhaketh the earth, tis becauſe he is <hi>angry:</hi> And why is he angry? Surely, not at the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007380_0022_102B84722EF69D10"/>
earth which trembles: no; but at the <hi>ſins</hi> of the people who dwell on it. And as we are a ſinful and degenerate people, we have all the reaſon in the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, tis becauſe God is <hi>angry</hi> with us for our <hi>ſins,</hi> that he has thus aroſe to ſhake terribly the earth under us, and our houſes over us: Nor need we be at any loſs to know what the ſins are, that have excited his diſpleaſure, and the manifeſtations of it, in this way, againſt us. The ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> are to be found, even in this land of Goſpel-light and advantages.—We are as weary of the Lord's <hi>ſabbaths,</hi> and as remiſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in our attendance on the duties proper to them, as were the Jews of old.—We are become ſhamefully defective in the government, inſtruction and religion of our houſholds. Our children and ſervants are many of them vile, and we reſtrain them not. God, the founder of our families, is not ſo generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in them, as might reaſonably be expected, conſidering the example of our fathers. There are many houſes, it may be feared, eſpecially in this town, in which the worſhip of God is not upheld; in which, perhaps, ſcarce ever a prayer was put up to almighty God.—And what ſins are there that are not committed in the land? We have riſen up, in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſtead, a generation that know not the Lord, that have done evil exceedingly in his ſight. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to an high degree of guilt, addicted to profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, worldlineſs, diſhoneſty, pride, extravagance, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, intemperance, and all other immoralities, which ought not to be ſo much as named among chriſtians.—And ſhall not God viſit us for theſe iniquities? It can't be, but he ſhould be angry with us. We may depend, our earth was terribly ſhook, becauſe he was wroth. We were, in the moral ſenſe, ripe for this awful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And tis a wonder of mercy, the force which cauſed the late trembling of our houſes, was not heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007380_0023_102B848005B3F218"/>
in its degree, ſo as to bury us in their ruins. This had certainly been the caſe, had God dealt with us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our deſerts. Bleſſed, forever bleſſed, be his name, that in wrath he remembred mercy. It was owing to this, and to this only, that we were not involved, as other places have often been, in ſudden and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſtruction.</p>
            <p>What therefore remains, but that we immediately endeavour, by <hi>repentance,</hi> to remove away the ground of God's diſpleaſure. That is the voice of the <hi>ſhaking</hi> we have heard and felt, <hi>Repent, and turn from your tranſgreſſions, that ſo iniquity may not be your ruin.</hi> And this is the voice alſo of the other threatning aſpects of divine providence at this day. To day therefore, while it is called to day, let us hear God's voice, and not hearden our hearts, nor ſuffer them to be hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin. The call is univerſal: It extends to <hi>Churches,</hi> to <hi>Courts,</hi> to <hi>Colleges,</hi> to <hi>Schools,</hi> to <hi>Families,</hi> to the <hi>whole land;</hi> and to all <hi>orders, ages,</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of perſons in it; to <hi>high</hi> and <hi>low, rich</hi> and <hi>poor, old</hi> and <hi>young;</hi> to all without exception, or diſcrimination: And it were to be wiſhed, that we would all, in our reſpective places, pay a due regard to it; that the <hi>reformation</hi> may be <hi>general.</hi> It would be well, ſhould we each one ſmite upon his own breaſt, and ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> How far am I charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the public guilt? And wherein we may, upon ſerious enquiry, be conſcious of having tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt the Lord, we ſhould immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and amend our doings which have not been right, and make it our care, for the time to come, to obey all God's precepts, whether they relate to our duty, to our Maker, our ſelves, or one another. Nothing ſhort of a <hi>general</hi> thorough change of our manners ſhould ſatisfy us; for nothing ſhort of this will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us juſt ground of hope for a change in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of God.</p>

Were none of you, the other morning, in anxiety and concern of mind, from an apprehenſion of God as angry with you? When you felt the earth ſo awfully ſhaking under you, and your houſes over you, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you with immediate deſtruction, did you not perceive alſo the agitations of an accuſing conſcience? Were none of your ſins then brought to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance? Did none of them fly in your faces? Had you in your hearts no fear of the Almighty? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe, but you were moſt of you ſtruck with an awful dread of the power and majeſty of God; and I can't but hope, that ſome of you tho't within your ſelves, that, if God ſhould ſpare you, and give you opportunity therefor, you would, without delay, ſet about the neceſſary work of repentance, and ſerving him. I cannot but hope, that one and another of you came into ſome ſuch pious reſolution as that, <hi>wherein I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> If I now ſpeak the inward ſenſe and feeling of any of your minds, in that awful hour, as I truſt I do; think it not unſeaſonable, if I urge upon you a care to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſuch good impreſſions as theſe, and to guard againſt every thing that may have a tendency to eraſe them out of your minds: Otherwiſe your goodneſs will be as <hi>the morning cloud, and the early dew, which ſoon paſs away.</hi> This was too much the caſe about eight and twenty years ago, when God aroſe, and ſhook the earth more terribly than had been known in the land before. The fears of multitudes were then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed; they called on God; made fair promiſes of a reformation; and, for a while, were externally very ſerious and devout: But they ſoon loſt the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of piety, forgot their good reſolutions, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their former folly. Some, I would hope, were thoroughly humbled, and turned from their ſins to God: But, for the generality, their goodneſs was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007380_0026_102B8CA053CBD730"/>
more than a tranſient buſineſs. As the earth grew quiet, their fears went off, and, together with them, all their concern about the one thing needful. And muſt it not be ſaid of ſome, notwithſtanding the horrible anguiſh they were then in, that they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turned out <hi>abandoned ſinners!</hi> The latter end was much worſe with them than the beginning. Let me therefore beſeech you in the bowels of Chriſt Jeſus, and in his name, to make a wiſe and good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the <hi>warning</hi> God is now giving you, and the <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>concern</hi> you may herefrom have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in you. Cultivate the ſerious ſenſe you have of God and religion on your minds.—Be earneſt in your prayers to the throne of grace, for thoſe aſſiſtances you will need.—Take care you don't grieve the good ſpirit of God.—With the <hi>Jailor,</hi> who was made to tremble by the earthquake, which ſhook the priſon he had the charge of, enquire with a becoming ſollicitude of ſoul, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> And do not reſt ſatisfied, until you have been enabled, under the influence of the divine ſpirit, to <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And, to your faith, add all other chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian graces, and live in the daily exerciſe of them; and you need not then be afraid, let what will come: For you are prepared for all events, whether of time, or eternity.</p>
            <p>Though I ſhould be thought tedious, I ſhall, upon this occaſion, addreſs a few words to thoſe, who have made God their fear, and are walking in the way of his commandments. Some ſuch, we would hope, there are among us. The good Lord increaſe their Number! To you I would ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your ſtate is happy: The ſupreme regent of nature, through Jeſus Chriſt, is your friend. His perfections are all engaged on your behalf. When you hear the noiſe, and feel the ſhock of an earthquake, you have no reaſon to be

diſmayed. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled;</hi> you <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God,</hi> you <hi>believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You ought indeed to be poſſeſſed of an holy awe and reverence of the power and majeſty of God: But you ought not to have upon your minds a ſlaviſh fear and dread. It is below your character, and hope; and will argue a low degree of faith; at leaſt, that you have not faith in exerciſe.

            <p>I conclude with ſaying, the ſhaking of the earth is a lively emblem, and will be one of the amazing fore-runners, of that <hi>awful day of God,</hi> in which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, be burnt up.

            <head>AN APPENDIX; Giving a ſummary Account of the late EARTHQUAKE.</head>
            <p>ON the morning, <hi>November</hi> 18th, about 15 minutes after 4, the air calm and the heavens bright, came on the moſt ſurprizing ſhock of an earthquake that was ever felt, ſo far as we know, in this part of the world. I did not my ſelf perceive any noiſe diſtinct from that which was occaſion'd by the crackling of the houſe where I was, and the diſturbance of the moveables in it; but many others, and, among theſe, ſuch as were awake, and had riſen from their beds to proſecute their buſineſs, ſay, that it was both preceded, and accompanied, with a conſiderable noiſe, like that of diſtant thunder, or a ſudden hard guſt of ruſhing wind. The ſhock was gradual, increaſing in its ſtrength for about a minute. It then very ſenſibly abated, giving us room to hope it was going off; when, on a ſudden, it returned with greater violence than before, ſo as that our houſes heaved, and rocked, as if they would have fallen to pieces. It continued at this height not above half a minute, gradually decreaſing till we had no more any perception of it.</p>
            <p>There are various opinions concerning the preciſe <hi>time</hi> of its continuance. Some ſay, it laſted 4, or 5, or 6 minutes. Others think it was over in one. Thoſe, as I imagine, come neareſt to the truth, who fix it at about 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>effects</hi> were very conſiderable. Not to mention the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful clattering that was made by our doors, windows, and walls; nor the damage we received by the breaking of our brittle ware, and the bruiſing of our pewter, which was thrown from the ſhelves: I ſay, paſſing over theſe ſmaller articles, many chimnies, it is tho't ſeveral ſcores, were broken off near the top of our houſes, and thrown down. A leſs number, it may be 20, were cracked thro', all round, a few feet from the top; and ſome of them ſtrangely diſlocat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turned from their former poſition. Perhaps, a 1000 or 1500
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007380_0029_102B8CA66DE1D598"/>
chimnies have been more lightly damaged in various degrees. The roofs of ſome houſes, and the gable ends of a few others as far as the caves, were broken in, either by the violence with which they were ſhook, or by the falling of the chimnies on them. It is ſaid, that many clocks and watches were ſtop'd, by the ſudden and great agitation that was given them; tho' this was not the caſe with mine. And ſome wells have not ſince yielded any water, the ſprings that fed them having been, in one way or another, ſtopped. One more effect worthy of notice, a gentleman has thus publiſhed from his perſonal view of it. "A diſtiller's ciſtern, made of plank, almoſt new, and very ſtrongly put together, was burſt to pieces by the agitation of the liquor in it; which was thrown out with ſuch force as to break down one whole ſide of the ſhed that defended the ciſtern from the water, as alſo to ſtave off a board or two from a fence, at the diſtance of 8 or 10 feet from it."</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principal effects of this great Earthquake in this town. We now know, that it was of very large extent; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Caſco-Bay</hi> northeaſtward to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſouthweſtward, a line, on the ſea-coaſt, of more than 500 miles: And it was felt alſo <hi>within land</hi> a great way. We have not had accounts as yet from the moſt diſtant <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlements; but doubtleſs they had all a very ſtrong perception of it. It does not appear to have been equally violent in all places throughout this extent; tho' it was more ſo than was ever known before. From <hi>Caſco-Bay,</hi> on the northeaſt, it is ſaid, "the ſhock was much as we had it in this town." From <hi>Philadelphia</hi> on the ſouthweſt, they write, "On Tueſday morning, <hi>Nov.</hi> 18th, we had a ſmart ſhock of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, which laſted about two minutes." And in all the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate places it aroſe to a ſurprizing height.</p>
            <p>The effects, in many of our towns, were as conſiderable as in this, if not more ſo. In <hi>Pembroke,</hi> beſides the breaking down of a number of chimnies, there were 4 or 5 chaſms, or openings, made in the earth, from whence both water and ſand were thrown out. In <hi>Scituate,</hi> near the large dwelling-houſe of Mr. <hi>Bailey,</hi> there was 7 openings of the ground, which ſtill remain percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; one of them within 20 yards of the houſe, and the whole 7 within a few rods of it. From theſe have iſſued large quantities of water, and (at the loweſt computation) 10 cart loads of a ſtrange ſort of earth, as fine as flower, and of a whiteiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection. The houſe itſelf was moſt awfully ſhook; the chimney levelled with the roof; moſt of the ceiling fractured into ſmall parts, and in many places ſeparated from the ſides of the rooms; a new caſe of drawers thr<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>

ſhatter'd: Beſides which, 70 ſquare feet of a firm cellar wall was burſt from its former poſition, and another conſiderable part of it thrown to the ground. At <hi>Newington,</hi> in <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> there was an eruption, near the houſe for publick worſhip, 60 rods long, and 2 feet wide; the moſt hideous chaſm we have yet heard of. In one place and another, the old ſprings were ſhut up, and new ones opened; and in all places the ſtone fences were, more or leſs, ſhaken down. The damage, in this article only, is ſet, moderately computing, at about fifty thouſand pounds, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way we reckon money.</p>
            <p>The agitation occaſioned by this earthquake was not confin'd to the dry-land. The veſſels in the harbour of this town, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in other harbours alſo, were made fearfully to quiver and ſhake; and it ſeemed to thoſe, who were in them, as tho' they were a-ground, and beating upon ſmall ballaſt. Some that were in the bay, coming in from ſea, tho't they had unhappily ſtruck upon the rocks or ſands. A gentleman, who came paſſenger in a veſſel from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> ſays, that, 70 leagues to the eaſt of <hi>Cape-Ann,</hi> they were ſuddenly ſurpriſed, about the time the earthquake came on here, ſuppoſing they had run foul of a wreck, or got upon a bar, till, on throwing over the lead, they found they had more than 50 fathom water. As the morning light came on, they ſaw 3 large whales on the top of the water, and by their continuing perfectly ſtill, they was ready to think, they were dead; tho' they could not reduce this to a certainty, having no bullets to fire at them. They ſaw alſo great numbers of other fiſhes, both great and ſmall; frightened, as it was tho't, from the bottom.</p>
            <p>In about an hour and 20 minutes after this great ſhock, we had another; which, tho' comparatively ſmall, was yet felt by moſt that were up. And on the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of this ſame month, at 40 minutes after 8, in the evening, we were alarmed with another ſtill; which, tho' not to be compared with the firſt, was very affecting to moſt people. Theſe are all the ſhocks we have had in this town; tho' elſewhere they have been more numerous. In ſome places they have felt 5 or 6; in others 10 or 11; &amp; in others ſtill, at leaſt 20.</p>
            <p>May we all ſing aright both of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>judgment!</hi> And while we <hi>fear</hi> before that God, who maketh the earth to ſhake and tremble, let us <hi>love</hi> him alſo for his goodneſs: And may the <hi>riches</hi> of it, as they have been diſplayed towards us in our late deliverance from ſudden and general deſtruction, lead us to repentance.</p>
