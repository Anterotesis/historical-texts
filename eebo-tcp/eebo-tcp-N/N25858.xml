            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO publiſh a Work with the Title borne by this, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by ſome, be thought preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it is recollected that Madame de Genlis has already oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the Dramatic line, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be imitated by few, and, probably, to be equalled by none.—But a compariſon of this work with the Theatre of Education, of that great Author, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair as to execution, and unjuſt as to deſign.—The Writer of this Work does not, like Madame de Genlis, intend her Dramatic Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues to be performed; well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that the length of the Scenes, in ſome places, and the ſimplicity of the Plot in all, would render them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lat and heavy in repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The motives by which ſhe was induced to throw her Stories
<pb facs="unknown:034381_0003_0FFF0B15524D4998"/>
into Dialogue, were a belief that young people are eaſily captivated and intereſted by this manner of writing, and the convenience of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding the <hi>"ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>This ſhort explanation the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoreſs thought due to herſelf, leſt ſhe ſhould be ſuſpected of endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to imitate one of the firſt Authors the Age has produces.</p>
            <p>If theſe ſimple Dialogues ſhould be conſidered as an additional bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier againſt the encroachments of Error, and an additional ſupport to the efforts of Virtue, the Writer will be moſt happy; and ſhe truſts them, tho' not without fear, yet not without hope, to the candour of a generous Public, who at leaſt will give her credit for purity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034381_0029_0FFF0B4B6A6D9280"/>
that nothing but the preſence of ſome perſon intereſted in its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement could render it half ſo valuable as it had been ſuppoſed.—She determined, therefore, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her dread of the ſea, which all her life had been extreme; to leave her friends, her ſiſter, even her child, in England, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the voyage herſelf.—This ſhe has done; has reſtored the eſtate to the moſt flouriſhing condition, and is now returned to enjoy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of her labours.</p>

                        <p>Undoubtedly yes.—Firſt we ought to conſider the education which was given to the Romans.—We ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that their country was the chief object of their love, and that they were taught to deſpiſe all conſiderations which interfered
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034381_0039_0FFF0B63F8C69B60"/>
with their duty to that.—Thus when Cato ſaw the dead body of his ſon, he did not weep, becauſe <hi>true</hi> Senſibility exalted his mind to the height of patriotiſm, which made him willingly yield his ſon a victim to Rome.—He wiſhed alſo to encourage the ſinking Romans, by making their lives leſs valuable in their eyes, when he, to whom they looked for example, could ſo chearfully par with that life which was dearer to him than his own.—What but Senſibility could have awakened this high ſenſe of duty, and heroic reſolution?</p>

                        <p>Undoubtedly.—Or rather I ſhould ſay that which is commonly dignified with that charming name, is unworthy of it; and if you will allow me to ſay ſo, by what I have ſeen of Miſs Melville's, that is the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhe poſſeſſes, though perhaps mixed and blended with the true mind. Let us refer again to the delightful Authoreſs I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted, whoſe every line contains meaning and reaſon.

                        <p>Why, I'll tell you. About a month ago, mama gave Sophia two guineas, and told her to buy whatever ſhe liked beſt with it. She gave one to Eudocia and one to me. Eudocia bought a ſmall writing deſk; and I bought a ſquirrel's cage, and ſome flower ſeeds for my garden: but Sophia ſaid ſhe would wait awhile and conſider before ſhe bought. Well, yeſterday it came into my head that ſhe had not bought any thing; and I aſked her what ſhe ſhould purchaſe with her two guineas.—

the old woman is lame, but has all her ſenſes, and when dame Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders was ſo ill, the poor old woman uſed to cry, and the little girls, thinking to comfort her, ſaid, "Don't cry grandmother, I will feed you, and put on your clean cap for you."</p>

                        <p>Harriot, that is a great fault, but it is a greater to be ſo eager to accuſe your ſiſter. My children, learn, that if you fail to conceal and excuſe the errors of each other, the world will ſtill more eagerly publiſh, and ſtill more bitterly condemn them.—Where, alas! ſhall thoſe who are faulty, look for pity and forgiveneſs, if not to thoſe kindred boſoms who, knowing their failings, know alſo their virtues.—If we ourſelves point the arrows of ſatire and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, at our ſiſters and our friends, who will hold before them the

                        <p>Certainly.—It is a duty incumbent on you to learn them, becauſe I wiſh it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ornamental parts of education, ſuited to the place you are to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>That is true,—Learn then to make allowances for differences of natural capacity, which we have no merit in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as we did not give it to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and for difference of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

which depends on thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us,—When theſe allowances are made, we ſhall ſeldom, if ever, find any thing to ridicule or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe; pity, and a wiſh to amend, will be our only ſentiments.—And when we conſider how many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities we have ourſelves loſt, how much more we might have learned, than we have learned, we may eaſily allow for thoſe who have even loſt more time than ourſelves.</p>

                  <p>IT being the ſeaſon when the Spring Vacation took place at ſchool, which interval Mrs. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> embraced for enjoying with her little family the delights of a rural retreat. The beauty of the country daily increaſed; the ſpring was mild and forward. Her little boys William and Thomas had left ſchool about ten days.</p>
                  <p>Their ſiſters and their little fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male kinsfolk were now employed for ſome hours every morning in aſſiſting to repair the children's
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:034381_0154_0FFF0FF5B83BFF00"/>
linen, or making up new againſt their return to ſchool, after the vacation.</p>
                  <p>The firſt day after their arrival, the boys amuſed themſelves by walking through the woods, which were already in leaf. The reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant oak and the timid aſh, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reſiſting the warmth of the ſun, were rapidly unfolding their freſh leaves. The hedges and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood were every where green and afforded concealment and ſhelter to an infinite number of birds, now buſy in building their neſts.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of their walk, little Thomas, who had wandered on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, came running back out of breath, without his hat, which he held in his hand, and in which, with delight ſparkling in his eyes, he ſhowed his brother a neſt of young unfledged birds.</p>

I have no other objection to your buying them, my dear Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, than as I think it encourages idle boys to continue their cruel robberies on the birds. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as theſe poor mocking birds <hi>are</hi> priſoners, I believe we may reſcue them out of worſe hands, by taking them into ours.

And alas! this is one of thoſe evils that ſatire, excellent and juſt even as this is, can do but little to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; for, as ſome periodical work, (I think the World,) in one of its eſſays, obſerves, coachmen, dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, cartmen, and drovers, do not read eſſays; yet I have often fancied that ſomething might be done to ſoften the cruel hearts of the lower claſſes of people, if any perſon of abilities would adopt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to their comprehenſion,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034381_0158_0FFF0FFE59850908"/>
and teach them to fear hereafter ſuch puniſhments as they now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, in dreadful retaliation.</p>
                     <p>They were by this time arrived at the village, whoſe few ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling houſes edged the extenſive wood, and in a neat cottage found a decently dreſſed woman, whoſe huſband was a farmer, and who was employed by Mrs. Woodfield to ſpin for her. She deſired the woman to bring out ſome flax in its raw ſtate; deſcribed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of making it into tow, fit for ſpinning, and then made each of the girls ſpin a thread. Not far from thence, in the ſame village, was a loom; they there ſaw it woven into ſheeting and other coarſe linen. Their walk home was deſignedly varied. Mrs. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field led them acroſs a ruſtic bridge, and along the banks of a rapid ſtream that turned a paper-mill,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034381_0158_0FFF0FFE59850908"/>
into which they entered, and ſaw the whole operation of making ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of paper. She then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them the materials and means by which it was made; and bade them carry their imagination back, from the ſtalk of the flax they had ſeen, bearing a blue and ſimple flower trembling on its ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſummit, through all its changes and modifications till it contributes to make a ſheet of paper.</p>
                     <p>This ſpeculation amuſed them for the reſt of their walk. On their arrival at home, Matilda and Eliza, were agreeably ſurpriſed by a card they found upon their table, from a gentleman of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inviting the whole family to one of Mr. Duport's much admired Fancy Balls.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſure danced in the eyes of Matilda, when ſhe found Mrs.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034381_0159_0FFF100093039D60"/>
Woodfield intended to return an anſwer that they would accept this invitation. Nor was Eliza much leſs delighted. An immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation was held as to the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neceſſary; and Mrs. Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, leaving them to enjoy this antepaſt of pleaſure, (all that life's deception frequently allow as to taſte, and which is at their ages ſo keenly taſted,) went to inſpect the little menagerie of the three young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er children, lately increaſed by their mocking birds, about which they were anxiouſly employed. It was more neceſſary to repreſs their ill-judged ſolicitude, than to reprove them for careleſsneſs of their little charge. But deſirous of teaching them to reflect, ſhe made uſe of the preſent opportunity; when the eldeſt of the two boys ſaid, "Mamma, I do not believe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034381_0159_0FFF100093039D60"/>
theſe little birds would be more comfortable if they were with their own mother."</p>

What I mean is, not only to induce you to take care of them, ſince they now depend on you, but to engage you, in every caſe, to put yourſelf in the place of whatever creature you are about to injure or oppreſs; that you may acquire a habit of ſaying to yourſelf, How ſhould I like to be treated thus? What ſhould I ſuffer, if I were in the place of the cat we are wantonly hunting with our terriers? of the robbins which

                     <p>But all I am afraid of is, that if one is not a little faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, one looks vulgar.</p>

                     <p>It is infinitely more vulgar to appear at ſuch an aſſembly over-dreſt. Believe me, my dear, mere dreſs contributes nothing to that look of elegance, or, if you will, of ſuperiority, that you ſeem ſo jealous of. You will be convinced of this, if you ſhould ſee to-morrow evening, as you probably will, a lady, named Scarfton, who is the firſt and fineſt at all our public balls; ſhe is the wife of a man in trade of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable credit, who is often to Great Britain, as he is engaged in buſineſs there. This woman, who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely homely, is the greateſt adept in faſhions I ever ſaw. She runs about for a week before the commencement of the public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034381_0163_0FFF100ADC24F8A8"/>
from milliner to milliner, to ſee other ladies' cloaths, and then imagines ſomething like the moſt remarkable, with which to induce ſome attention towards her. Her cloaths are made up in every vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of extravagant faſhion, and each habiliment has ſome out-land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh name that ſhe cannot even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. Without the leaſt regard to proportion or propriety, ſhe dreſſeſs out her unfortunate perſon in the wildeſt mode of the wildeſt girl of faſhion, and the effect is, that ſhe creates envy in the weak, and pity in the wiſe; and, while ſhe thinks herſelf on the very pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of politeneſs and elegance, I ſee ſome look upon her as a mad woman, and all conſider her as bordering on inſanity. Have you any ambition, Matilda, to ſhare, with ſuch a woman as Mrs. Scarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
