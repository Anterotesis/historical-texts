            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE Shewing <hi>Who</hi> is a <hi>true Paſtor</hi> of the CHURCH of CHRIST.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM fully ſatisfy'd, that the good and well-meaning People, for whoſe Sake this ſhort and plain Diſcourſe is now publiſhed, are thoroughly convinced of the great Neceſſity and Advantage of making Uſe of a <hi>Spiritual Guide;</hi> and that they are always ready to conſult Him, and to commit the Care of their Souls to him.</p>
            <p>BUT then they may juſtly ask, — WHO, WHERE is He? — <hi>Since there are ſo many</hi> falſe Teachers <hi>gone out into the World, how ſhall I know</hi> WHICH <hi>is a</hi> true One? Among ſo many different Pretenders to the Miniſtry, how ſhall I find out, WHICH <hi>are</hi> indeed <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt? Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teachers?</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 29. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> plainly determins, that they are not ſo; as alſo, Chriſt himſelf ſaith to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Thou haſt tried them, which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them Lyars.</hi> Rev. ii. 2. And if in the Days of Saint <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, there were falſe
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039804_0002_10161620AD13EAC0"/>Deceivers, who ſaid, that they were Miniſters of Chriſt, and were not, much more are there ſuch in our Days. How then ſhall I be able to know and find them out?</p>
            <p>THIS indeed is a Queſtion of grand Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for Chriſt, who hath appointed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Men to teach his People, <hi>hath forbidden them to heap to themſelves Teachers; warned us againſt thoſe who come in Sheep's Cloathing, and yet are ravenous Wolves;</hi> and aſſures us, <hi>that if the blind lead the blind, they ſhall both fall into the Ditch.</hi> It is to <hi>Them only</hi> who derive their Authority from Him, through the Hands of the Apoſtles, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and are his commiſſioned Miniſters, that He hath promiſed <hi>his Preſence and Aſſiſtance to the End of the World.</hi> So that if he confirms the Acts, and bleſſes the Miniſtry of any others, it is more than He hath promiſed in his holy Word.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' this Queſtion is of ſuch weighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, yet the ſolving of it has not ſuch Difficulty in it, but that every One might of himſelf judge what is Right, if without Partiality, and without Hypocriſie, he wou'd conſider the following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and the Texts of Scripture annexed to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT none ought to act as Miniſters of Chriſt in his Church, but they who have received a Commiſſion from him. — <hi>And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, all Power is given unto Me in Heaven and in Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,</hi> — <hi>and lo, I am with you alway even unto the End of the World.</hi> Matth. 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>And no Man taketh this Honour unto himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> Heb. v. 4. <hi>And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> Rom. x. 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT none can be ſaid to receive a divine Commiſſion from Him, but Thoſe who are either
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:039804_0003_1016162BC606CD08"/>
               <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately</hi> called and appointed by him See the Texts cited under the Letter<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom</hi> x. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> v. 4.5. <hi>Acts</hi> xiv. 23. <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT they who pretend to an immediate Call, ought, as the Apoſtles did, to prove the Truth of their Miſſion, <hi>by working of Miracles;</hi> 'till which Time no Regard is due to their Pretences.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> xvi. 20. <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 15 and ix 6 30, 31. 1 <hi>John</hi> iv. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT therefore the only ſtanding regular Way <hi>of having this Honour,</hi> is the deriving of it <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> thro' the Hands of others, from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT Chriſt himſelf, whilſt on Earth, had two Orders of Men under Him, the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the Seventy; gave the Power of ſending, or ordaining others, to the Apoſtles; and to them only, and thoſe that ſucceed them, <hi>did He give the Promiſe of his Preſence and Aſſiſtance unto the End of the World.</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 1. vi. 13. x. 1 and xxii. 29, 30. <hi>John</hi> xx. 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 16.20. <hi>Acts</hi> xxii. 17. xv. 13 and xxi. 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 9.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 19.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. THAT after Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, there were ſtill <hi>three diſtinct Orders</hi> ſet apart to the Miniſtry, <hi>viz. Deacons, Presbyters,</hi> or <hi>Elders;</hi> and a ſtill higher Order, which were ſuperiour to, and had Authority over both theſe, ſuch were, beſides the Apoſtles, <hi>Timothy, Titus,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> Sur-named the Juſt, and the <hi>Angels of the Seven Churches. (d)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. THAT therefore, in the Beginning of the Chriſtian Church, there was not a <hi>Parity,</hi> but <hi>Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality,</hi> or <hi>Prelacy</hi> in the Miniſters of it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THAT farther from the holy Scriptures it is evident, That the Power of Ordination was lodged in thoſe of the higheſt Order, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and in them <hi>alone</hi> without any others being menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with them.<note n="(e)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim</hi> v. 22. <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. THAT we have no Warrant from Scripture to conclude, that this Power was given by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to thoſe of the ſecond Order, now called Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039804_0004_1016162EA933DDE8"/>the chief Text upon which this Warrant is ſuppoſed to be grounded, being that of the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy, Neglect not the Gift that is in thee, which was given Thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Prosbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> judiciouſly obſerves, to make this Place any Thing to the Purpoſe, theſe three Things at leaſt muſt be proved. 1. That by Presbytery, is here meant a Company of Perſons. 2. That theſe Perſons were all meer Presbyters. 3. That none but ſuch gave <hi>Timothy</hi> his Ordination. The <hi>firſt</hi> of which is uncertain, the <hi>ſecond</hi> improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the <hi>third</hi> abſolutely falſe.</p>
            <p>AND here I cannot but take Notice of the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or Diſingenuity (not to call it a <hi>pious Fraud</hi>) of ſome Gentlemen in <hi>New England,</hi> in their Diſcourſe HAD (as they elegantly term it) of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Ordination. The Deſign of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is to prove from Scripture, that meer Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had the Power of Ordination. And thus they go to work. Page 11. <q>
                  <hi>We can't but apprehend their [the Presbyters] Power of Ordination from Scripture Precedents.</hi> I ſhall name two famous Inſtances. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſet apart by the Hands of ordinary Elders.</q> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 1, 2, 3. This is falſe. They were not <hi>ordinary Elders,</hi> for they were Prophets and Teachers <hi>immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God</hi> to ſend theſe Men on that particular Errand, as is plain by the Text. Beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of Himſelf, that He was <hi>an Apoſtle, (not of Men, neither by Man, but by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father,—Gal.</hi> i. 1. And moreover, it appears by the Text to be an extraordinary Act, for it is ſaid to be done by the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>BUT to let the Gentlemen go on. <q>So was <hi>Timothy</hi> ordained by the Impoſition of the Hands of the Presbytery: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 14. And what was then valid is now.—Upon the whole, if
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:039804_0005_101616302EC0DF40"/>Scripture be the Rule then we can't but ſafely conclude for the Right of Presbyters, or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Goſpel Miniſters, to ordain others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS they. Now, before I anſwer it, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to take Notice, that they call it a <hi>famous Inſtance,</hi> which implys thus much, that they thought it a very good One for the Proof of the Validity of <hi>Presbyterial Ordination;</hi> and indeed, it is the chief Text upon which the Diſſenters build their unhappy Miſtakes. But theſe Gentlemen might have been better inform'd by their great Maſter <hi>John Calvin,</hi> whoſe Opinion I ſuppoſe will have ſome Weight with them. Theſe are his Words upon the Place. <q>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf elſewhere declares that he (without any others) laid Hands on <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> I admoniſh Thee (ſays He) that thou ſtir up the Gift that is in thee, by the laying on of MY HANDS; for what is ſaid in the other Epiſtle of the laying on the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> I don't take it as if <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of the College of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but by that Name I underſtand the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination it ſelf: As if he ſhould ſay, ſee that the Grace which thou didſt receive by the laying on of MY HANDS when I made thee a <hi>Presbyter</hi> be not in vain: <hi>Calv. Inſtitut.</hi> L. 4. C. 3. Thus Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Summ of the Diſpute betwixt theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and us on this Head is this. We affirm (and are ſure) that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not ordain'd by <hi>ordinary Goſpel Miniſters</hi> inferiour to the Apoſtles. They affirm, that <hi>ordinary Goſpel Miniſters</hi> inferiour to the Apoſtles ordain'd <hi>Timothy.</hi> And they produce this famous Inſtance (as they call it) to prove their Aſſertion. Now, nothing is more certain than this; that it is the current Opinion of great Numbers of good Divines, both antient and modern, that by <hi>Presbytery</hi> is not meant a Number of Men, but the Office; and in particular Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> you ſee, has given it up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:039804_0006_10161631B45C5BA0"/>
BUT nothing is (or can be) more plain than the Scripture it ſelf, therefore to the Law and to the Teſtimony. Let it be decided by Scripture. There Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſays to <hi>Timothy.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wherefore I put thee in Remembrance, that thou ſtir up the Gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of</hi> MY HANDS. Thus the Scripture. Now if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was an <hi>ordinary Goſpel Miniſter</hi> inferiour to the Apoſtles, then thoſe Gentlemen, for once, are in the right.</p>
            <p>BUT this Text, I fear, was induſtriouſly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Beams of Light darting from it, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly pointing at their unhappy Error, they could not bear the Sight of it, but hid it under a Buſhel. But let them take care, for it is a ſtanding Maxim, That He is as much a falſe Witneſs who keeps back any Part of the Evidence, as He who produces <hi>that</hi> for Evidence which is not Truth.</p>
            <p n="10">10. THEREFORE, that ſince it do's not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>that the Commiſſion to ordain,</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles receiv'd from our bleſſed Saviour, was ever granted by them to thoſe who are now called <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> they cannot juſtly lay claim <hi>to the Power of Ordination:</hi> Every Commiſſion neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Conveyance, and being excluſive of all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> except <hi>thoſe</hi> to whom it is given.</p>
            <p n="11">11. AND laſtly, that they who had <hi>the Power of Ordination</hi> lodged in their Hands by the Apoſtles, had many <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and many Congregations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Jurisdiction, as may be ſeen by theſe Texts of Scripture.<note n="(f)" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>So far we may conclude from the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves; and from primitive Antiquity it is farther evident.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT immediately after the Death of St. <hi>John,</hi> theſe three Orders, <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039804_0007_10161633499FA750"/>
               <hi>Deacons,</hi> were eſtabliſhed in every Church; and the Power of <hi>Biſhops</hi> over <hi>Presbyters</hi> univerſally owned and acknowledged to be of divine Right. See the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> at the End of this Tract.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT down from the Beginning of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unto the Time of the Reformation, the Power of conferring Orders was ſuppoſed to be lodged, not in the Hands of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but of <hi>Biſhops;</hi> nor can ſo much as one Inſtance be produced of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> laying claim to this Power, and of its being allowed by the Church of Chriſt. For the Truth of this Propoſition, we have the ſame Evidence that we have for the Canonicalneſs of ſeveral Books of the new Teſtament, <hi>the concurrent Teſtimony of the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT at the Time of the Reformation, this Power of our Church ſtill continued in, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to thoſe of the higheſt Order.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THAT thoſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> who firſt broke off from the Communion with their Biſhops, and firſt pretended to this <hi>Authority of ordaining others,</hi> did not receive it; only a Power to preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments, according to the Rules of the Goſpel, and the Canons of the Church, and this in Subordination to their <hi>Biſhops;</hi> much leſs did they receive Authority to ordain others, in Oppoſition to THEM to whom they owed, and had ſworn Obedience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT therefore, <hi>ſince none can give that which he did not receive,</hi> they amongſt us, who have received their Orders only from the Hands of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> have <hi>no valid Ordination, no Authority,</hi> to act in Chriſt's Name, as his <hi>commiſſioned Miniſters,</hi> and to be ſpiritual Guides of the People.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add farther under this Head, that tho' it was only a doubtful Caſe, <hi>whether Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ordination was valid, or not;</hi> yet, ſince it is confeſſed on all Hands, that they of the National
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039804_0008_1016163688E08D70"/>Church who are Epiſcopally ordained, are lawful Miniſters of Chriſt, it is the Chriſtian's Duty and Intereſt to obey and ſubmit to them, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them ONLY as their <hi>Guides that watch for their Souls;</hi> ſince in all doubtful Caſes the ſafeſt Side is to be choſen.</p>
            <p>AND now, having ſaid thus much, I ſhall once more take Notice of thoſe <hi>New England</hi> Gentlemen before mentioned. But, before I animadvert upon them, I muſt confeſs I am at a loſs, and know not what Name to give to ſomething I find in their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Performance; whether I ſhall call it <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> or <hi>Sleight of Hand:</hi> For I am perfectly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed! that Gentlemen of ſuch Figure (as I have been informed they were) among the Diſſenters, that ſuch Rabbies of the Party ſhou'd betray ſuch fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, ſuch conſummate Ignorance in Church Hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory; and if it muſt not be imputed to their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, I aſſure you, that my Aſtoniſhment is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, to think that Men, who call themſelves the Guides of Souls, ſhou'd be ſo daringly wicked, as to aſſert THAT for Truth, which they knew to be falſe, and in a Cauſe too where the Souls of Men were concerned.</p>
            <p>THEY affirm, Page 7. <q>That we have nothing in primitive or later Antiquity but what may be reconciled hereto, (that is to the Practice of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> ordaining of <hi>Presbyters</hi>) and much to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this Practice.</q> And to ſhew you that this was not dropt from them thro' Inadvertency but by Deſign, They are at it again Page 11. where they aſſert very roundly that, <q>We find much in Antiquity primitive and later, that favours this Power of Presbyters, and nothing but what may be reconciled to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Gentlemen were reſolv'd to do Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they ſcorn'd to mince the Matter.</p>
            <p>I confeſs ſeriouſly, that I never met with any Aſſertion more ſurprizing than this, nor more falſe.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039804_0009_101616380E1842D8"/>Surely theſe Gentlemen cou'd not think to impoſe upon all Mankind with their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or their <hi>Legerdemain.</hi> But 'tis plain, their ſinking, dying Cauſe requires ſuch mean, ſuch little <hi>Tricks</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. They perceiv'd, that the People were reſolv'd for the future to ſee with their own Eyes, and were univerſally enclin'd to enquire into An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, being deſirous to underſtand the State of the Primitive Church, and reſolving to pay Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Church which was moſt <hi>Apoſtolick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE they thought it neceſſary to aſſert, that we have much in Antiquity, primitive and later, that favours this Power of <hi>Presbyters</hi> ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and nothing but what may be reconcil'd to it.</p>
            <p>THAN which nothing is more Falſe. Here we will joyn Iſſue. And if theſe Gentlemen will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any one Inſtance of a <hi>Presbyter</hi>'s ordaining a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> for the Space of 1500 Years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was not condemn'd by the Catholick Church, I aſſure them, for my part, I'll give up the Cauſe. There are but two Inſtances of ſuch Ordinations for 1500 Years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that of <hi>Iſchyras</hi> and <hi>Colluthus;</hi> one of which was not done upon a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that <hi>Presbyters</hi> have a Power to ordain; nor was it done in Oppoſition to the Biſhop, who was preſent, but being indiſpos'd, order'd a Prieſt to read the Words of Conſecration, the Biſhop laying on his Hands. But the primitive Church wou'd not ſuffer even this to paſs, but ſeverely condemn'd this as well as the other. And it was a principal part of the Hereſy of <hi>Aerius,</hi> his affirming, that there was no Difference between a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter</hi> by divine Right, and for which (among other Things) he was condemn'd for a Heretick by the Catholick Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if theſe Things are true, (and I call upon theſe Gentlemen to diſprove them if they are not) you may ſee what little Ground they had to aſſert,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039804_0010_10161639D8670E18"/>that they had much in Antiquity to confirm their Practice. Oh, to what deſpicable Arts are Men driven in defending a bad Cauſe!</p>
            <p>BUT the other Part of this monſtrous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as much beyond this, as this is beyond all Modeſty, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have nothing in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity but what may be reconcil'd to it, that is, to their Practice. What! — Nothing but what may be reconcil'd to it! — Why, Sirs! Were all the Biſhops of the Catholick Church for 1700 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no more than common <hi>Presbyters?</hi> What! Can all the Ordinations, the Thouſands, the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions that have been perform'd in the Catholick Church, in all that ſpace of Time, by Biſhops, and upon <hi>this Principle,</hi> that Biſhops <hi>alone</hi> had the Power of Ordination; can all theſe too be reconciled to your Practice!</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY theſe Gentlemen were out of their Senſes when theſe unaccountable Abſurdities were were ſuffer'd to come abroad.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond Page of their Rhapſody, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, (nay, they ſay, it ſeems evident to a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration) the Neceſſity of an uninterrupted Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Apoſtles. They were obliged to do this from the Nature of the Thing; it being ſo plain that the meaneſt Capacity underſtands it. The ſhort Method has demonſtrated it. But notwithſtanding ten thouſand Demonſtrations, they found that it was their Intereſt to deny it; and accordingly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were not in the Succeſſion, at pag. 14, they tack about, and wiping their Mouths very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely tell us, that they don't believe the Neceſſity of an uninterrupted Succeſſion from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Men make a great Noiſe, and amuſe the People with the <hi>great Names</hi> of — <hi>our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers the foreign Churches,</hi> &amp;c. — thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as if the foreign Churches approv'd of their Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:039804_0011_1016163C56B44180"/>
WHEREAS nothing is more plain, than that our Diſſenters have departed from <hi>Calvin</hi> as well as from <hi>Luther,</hi> in their Abhorence of Epiſcopacy, from all the Chriſtian World, in all Ages; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from all our late Reformers, both of one Sort and another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> wou'd have anathematized all of them, had he lived in our Days. He ſays there were none to be found in his Time, who oppoſed the Epiſcopal Hierarchy, but only the Papal. But ſay H, <q>if hey wou'd give us ſuch an Hierarchy, in which the Biſhops ſhou'd ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as that they did not refuſe to be ſubject to Chriſt, and to depend upon Him as their <hi>only</hi> Head, and refer all to Him; then I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they are worthy of all Anathemas, if any ſuch ſhall be found, who will not reverence it, and ſubmit themſelves to it, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Obedience.</q> Calvin de Neceſſitate Eccles, Reformand.</p>
            <p>AND <hi>Beza</hi> ſuppoſes as poſitively as <hi>Calvin</hi> had done, that there were none who oppoſed the Epiſcopal Hierarchy, but only the Papal, or that oppoſed the Order of Biſhops; and condemns them as Madmen, if any ſuch cou'd be found. For thus ſays he,</p>
            <p>
               <q>IF there be any (which you ſhall hardly perſuade me to believe) who reject the whole Order of Epiſcopacy; God forbid that any Man in his Wits, ſhou'd aſſent to the Madneſs of ſuch Men. Beza. id Tractat. de Miniſt. Ev. Grad. ab Hadrian. Sarav. Belga. Edit. C. 1.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND particularly as to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her Hierarchy of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, He ſays, that he never meant to oppugn any thing of that; but calls it a <hi>ſingular Bleſſing of God,</hi> and wiſhes that ſhe may ever enjoy it. <hi>Ibid.</hi> C. 18</p>
            <p>PRAY take Notice, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays, — <hi>if there ſhall be any ſuch,</hi> — and <hi>Beza</hi> ſays, — <hi>if there be any who</hi> won't ſubmit to Epiſcopacy as it is in <hi>England.</hi> which ſuppoſes that THEY knew none ſuch amongſt their Reformers: And that if any ſuch ſhould ariſe, THEY thought there were no <hi>Anathemas</hi> which they did not deſerve.</p>
            <p>So that our modern Diſſenters are diſarm'd of the precedent of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Beza,</hi> and all the Reformers abroad, by whoſe Sentence they are <hi>anathematized,</hi> and counted as Madmen.</p>
            <p>☜ Thoſe who have a Mind to ſee the Propoſitions in this ſmall Tract prov'd beyond the Poſſibility of a Reply, are deſir'd to read a Diſcourſe concerning Epiſcopacy, which they may have at the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Gate</hi> oppoſite to the Weſt End of the Town-Houſe in <hi>Boſton.</hi> Where likewiſe may be had <hi>Barclay's</hi> perſwaſive, printed in <hi>London,</hi> by <hi>Jonah Bowyer,</hi> with other Books of the like Nature.</p>

II. For whereas ye are ſubject to your Biſhop as to Jeſus Chriſt, ye appear to me to live not after the manner of Men, but according to Jeſus Chriſt; who died for us, that ſo believing in his Death, ye might eſcape Death. It is therefore neceſſary, that as ye do, ſo without your Biſhop, you ſhou'd do nothing: Alſo be ye ſubject to your Presbyters, as to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Jeſus Chriſt our Hope; in whom, if we walk, we ſhall be found <hi>in Him.</hi> The Deacons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as being the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, muſt by all means pleaſe all. For they are not the Miniſters of Meat and Drink, but of the Church of God. Wherefore they muſt avoid all Offences, as <hi>they would do</hi> Fire.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In like manner, let all Reverence the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons as Jeſus Chriſt, and the Biſhop as the Father; and the Presbyters as the Sanhedrim of God, and College of the Apoſtles. Without theſe there is no Church. Concerning all which I am perſwaded that ye think after the very ſame manner: For I have received, and even now have with me the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of your Love, in your Biſhop. Whoſe very Look is Inſtructive; and whoſe Mildneſs Powerful: Whom I am perſwaded, the very Atheiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot but Reverence. But becauſe I have a Love towards you, I will not write any more ſharply unto you about this Matter, tho' I very well might; but now I have done ſo; leſt being a Condemn'd Man, I ſhould ſeem to preſcribe to you as an Apoſtle.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I have great Knowledge in God; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain myſelf leſt I ſhould periſh in my Boaſting. For now I ought the more to fear; and not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thoſe that <hi>would</hi> puff me up. For they that ſpeak to me <hi>in my praiſe,</hi> Chaſten me. For I indeed deſire to ſuffer, but I cannot tell whether I am worthy <hi>ſo to do.</hi> And this Deſire, though to others it does not appear, yet to my ſelf it is <hi>for that very reaſon</hi> the more Violent. I have therefore need of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039804_0014_101615FF54DE0698"/>Moderation; by which the Prince of this World <hi>is deſtroy'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. AM I not able to write to you of Heavenly things? But I fear leſt I ſhould Harm you, who are yet but Babes in Chriſt; (Excuſe me <hi>this Care;</hi>) And leſt perchance being not able to receive them, ye ſhould be choaked <hi>with them.</hi> For even I my ſelf, although I am in Bonds, yet am not therefore able to underſtand Heavenly Things: As the Places of the Angels, and the ſeveral Companies of them, under their reſpective Princes; Things Viſible and Inviſible; but in theſe I am yet a Learner. For many things are wanting to us, that we come not ſhort of God.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. I Exhort you therefore, <hi>or rather</hi> not I, but the Love of Jeſus Chriſt; that ye uſe none but Chriſtian nouriſhment: abſtaining from Paſture which is of another Kind, I mean Hereſie. <hi>For they that are Hereticks,</hi> confound together <hi>the Doctrine of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; with <hi>their own</hi> Poiſon, whilſt they ſeem worthy of Belief: As Men give a deadly Poiſon mix'd with Sweet Wine; which He who is ignorant of, does with the treacherous Pleaſure ſweetly drink in his own Death.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Wherefore guard your ſelves againſt ſuch Perſons. And that you will do if you are not puffed up; but continue inſeparable from Jeſus Chriſt <hi>our</hi> God, and from your Biſhop, and from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Apoſtles. He that is within the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is Pure: But he that is without, that is, that does any thing without the Biſhop, and Presbyters, and Deacons, is not Pure in his Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. NOT that I know there is any thing of this Nature among you; But I fore-arm you, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>greatly</hi> Beloved by me, foreſeeing the Snares of the Devil. Wherefore putting on Meekneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new your ſelves in Faith, that is the Fleſh of the LORD; and in Charity, that is the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Let no Man have any <hi>Grudge</hi> aganſt his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039804_0015_10161644EFE2AAC0"/>Neighbour. Give no Occaſion to the Gentiles; left by means of a few Fooliſh Men, the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of God be Evil ſpoken of. For woe to that Man through whoſe Vanity my Name is Blaſphemed by any.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Stop your Ears therefore, as often as any one ſhall ſpeak contrary to Jeſus Chriſt; who was of the Race of <hi>David,</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Who was truly Born, and did Eat and Drink; Was truly Perſecuted under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> Was truly Crucified and Dead; Both Thoſe in Heaven, and on Earth, and under the Earth being Spectators of it. Who was alſo truly raiſed from the Dead by his Father, after the ſame manner as he will alſo raiſe up us who believe in Him, by Chriſt Jeſus; without whom we have no true Life.</p>
            <p n="10">X.

Why do I deſire to fight with Beaſts? Therefore do I die in vain: Therefore I will not ſpeak falſely againſt the LORD.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. FLEE therefore theſe Evil Sprouts which bring forth deadly Fruit; of which if any one taſte, he ſhall preſently Dye. For theſe are not the Plants of the Father; Seeing if they were, they would appear to be the Branches of the Croſs, and their Fruit would be Inccorruptible: By which he invites you through his Paſſion, who are Members of him. For the Head cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Members, God having promiſed a Union, that is Himſelf.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. I Salute you from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> together with the Churches of God that are preſent with Me; who have refreſh'd me in all things, both in the Fleſh and in the Spirit. My Bonds, which I carry about me for the ſake of Chriſt, (beſeeching him that I may attain unto God) exhort you, that you continue in Concord among your ſelves, and in Prayer with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039804_0016_10161687F5110988"/>one another. For it becomes every one of you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Presbyters, to refreſh the Biſhop, to the Honour of the Father, of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles. I beſeech you that you hearken to me in Love; that I may not by thoſe things which I write, riſe up in Witneſs againſt you. Pray alſo for Me; who through the Mercy of God ſtand in need of your Prayers, that I may be worthy of the Portion which I am about to obtain, that I be not found a Reprobate.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The Love of theſe who are at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſalute you. Remember in your Prayers the Church of <hi>Syria,</hi> from which I am not worthy to be called, being one of the leaſt of it.

Love every one his Brother with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Heart. My Soul be your Expiation, not only now, but when I ſhall have attain'd unto God: For I am yet under Danger. But the Father is Faithful in Jeſus Chriſt, to fulfil both mine and your Petition: In whom may ye be found ublame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
