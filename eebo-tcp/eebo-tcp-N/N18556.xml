            <title>A discourse, intended to commemorate the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus; delivered at the request of the Historical Society in Massachusetts, on the 23d day of October, 1792, being the completion of the third century since that memorable event. : To which are added, four dissertations, connected with various parts of the discourse, viz. 1. On the circumnavigation of Africa by the ancients. 2. An examination of the pretentions of Martin Behaim to a discovery of America prior to that of Columbus, with a chronological detail of all the discoveries made in the 15th century. 3. On the question, whether the honey-bee is a native of America? 4. On the colour of the native Americans and the recent population of this continent. / By Jeremy Belknap, D.D. ; [Six lines in Latin from Seneca]</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A DISCOURSE ON THE <hi>DICOVERY</hi> OF <hi>AMERICA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE are met together, this day, my reſpectable auditors, to commemorate an event; which, whether it be conſidered in its cauſes, in its execution, or in its conſequences, muſt be acknowledged, a ſplendid inſtance of the accompliſhment of that remarkable predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prophet,
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>DANIEL, Chap. xii. ver. 4.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>"Many ſhall run to and fro and knowledge ſhall be increaſed."</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words in their obvious and literal meaning point out a vaſt increaſe of ſcience, and the ſubſerviency of travelling to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſe. The time to which they refer cannot be preciſely defined; but it muſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024085_0005_0FC31C6454F6BEB8"/>
be conſidered as remote from that in which they were delivered; and, it is evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the appearance of that glorious perſon "Michael the Prince," whoſe coming and kingdom, and the ſalvation of which he is the author are foretold in the ſame proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy.</p>
            <p>A thought of this kind would not readily have occurred to the mind of a captive Jew, had he not been under the influence of the prophetic ſpirit. Tranſported by the fortune of war into the dominions of a foreign Prince, as was Daniel, his higheſt expectation would be to return to the land of his nativity and reſume his former employments and mode of acquiring knowledge; the objects of which were, the antiquities of the world, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the divine unity, the ſeries of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the ritual worſhip and the ſyſtem of moral duty, which were taught in the ſacred books. The hope of ſuch a return, grounded on a divine promiſe was one ſource of conſolation to the Jews in their captivity; but this proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et was favoured with ſuch divine communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpecting the future fortunes of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the ſtate of the Church of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reign of the Meſſiah, as carried his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024085_0006_0FC31C65E925B8D0"/>
views into the moſt diſtant ages, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcenes and events, of a nature very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from the genius and character of the times in which he lived. Among theſe, the increaſe of ſcience, as it is connected with travelling, is not the leaſt conſpicuous. Though brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, yet it is placed among the moſt important facts, and is repreſented as one of the happy events attending the reign of the Prince Meſſiah, of the increaſe of whoſe gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and peace there ſhall be no end.</p>
            <p>Subſequent ages and tranſactions have proved that this prediction was founded in truth. Time has unfolded what was foreſeen in prophetic viſion; and the hand of divine Providence has ſpread before our eyes, thoſe great events, which many prophets and wiſe men deſired to ſee, but ſaw them not.</p>
            <p>As "the teſtimony of Jeſus is the ſpirit of prophecy," ſo we may very properly conſider the travels of the Apoſtles to ſpread the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the goſpel, as one capital inſtance of the fulfilment of Daniel's prediction. By virtue of the commiſſion which they received from their Lord, and the ſpecial powers with which they were veſted, particularly the gift of tongues, thoſe choſen witneſſes carried the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024085_0007_0FC31C7689B7A008"/>
knowledge of the truth to all parts of the world, then known; ſo that it might be ſaid of them, as of the luminaries of heaven, "their found went into all the earth and their words to the end of the world; there was no ſpeech nor language where their voice was not heard." The effects of that evangelic miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though in ſome places tranſient, yet in others were abiding. Though a corrupt form of chriſtianity overſpread many of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who had heard the glad tidings of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; yet ſo much of the truth remained, as to be a foundation for reviving the pure doctrines and practices of the apoſtolic age, when a concurrence of circumſtances preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a favourable opportunity.</p>
            <p>Beſide the miraculous ſpreading of divine truth by the labours and travels of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, there was no remarkable event, which might be called another inſtance of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the prophecy of Daniel, till ſeveral centuries had elapſed. Other cauſes then contributed to produce events, which, either in their nature or conſequences, proved beneficial to the intereſt of ſcience. Even the ſuperſtition which prompted the cruſades, in the tenth and eleventh centuries,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024085_0008_0FC31C7F4798E2A0"/>
opened a communication between the moſt diſtant countries of Europe and Aſia; and the adventurers, who returned from the holy land, brought home a taſte for the manners, habits and productions of the eaſt, which proved favourable to the ſpirit of commerce; the moſt powerful of all cauſes which have contributed to enlarge the ſphere of ſcience; becauſe it is ſtimulated by one of the moſt active principles of the human mind.</p>
            <p>But even the operations of commerce were ſlow and languid, till the diſcovery of the magnetic needle, in the beginning of the fourteenth century. Before that period, the cautious mariner followed the indentings of the ſhore, and conſumed much time in creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along from Cape to Cape; ſeeking a port before every tempeſt, and drawing up his bark to land during the reign of winter, or of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe winds. But when the polarity of the magnet became known, he ventured farther into the ocean, and began to aſſume that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the ſea, for which man had a grant from his Creator, when he was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed in the divine image. Then the deep rooted errors of antiquity were gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>About the middle of the fifteenth century, when the Portugueſe under the conduct of Prince Henry, and afterward of King John II. were puſhing their diſcoveries along the weſtern ſhore of Africa, to find a paſſage by the ſouth to India; a genius aroſe, whoſe memory has been preſerved with veneration in the pages of hiſtory, as the inſtrument of enlarging the region of ſcience and commerce, beyond any of his predeceſſors. CHRIST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OPHER COLUMBUS, a native of the Republic of Genoa, was born in tbe year 1447, and at the age of fourteen entered on a ſeafaring life, as the proper ſphere, in which his vigorous mind was deſtined to perform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits which ſhould aſtoniſh mankind.<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus by his ſon Ferdinand— Chap. 4. See Vol. II. of Churchill's Collection of Voyages.</note> He was educated in the ſciences of Geometry and Aſtronomy, which form the baſis of nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024085_0010_0FC31C819C073390"/>
and he was well verſed in Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, Hiſtory and Philoſophy. His active and enterpriſing genius, though it enabled him to comprehend the old ſyſtems, yet would not ſuffer him to reſt in their deciſions, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſanctified by time or by venerable names; but, determined to examine them by actual experiment, he firſt viſited the ſeas within the polar circle, and afterward thoſe parts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which the Portugueſe had diſcovered, as far as the coaſt of Guinea; and by the time that he had attained the age of thirty-ſeven, he had from his own experience received the fulleſt conviction, that the opinion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients reſpecting the torrid and frigid zones was void of any juſt foundation.</p>
            <p>When an old ſyſtem is found erroneous in one point, it is natural to ſuſpect it of farther imperfections; and when one difficulty is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, others appear leſs formidable. Such was the caſe with Columbus; and his views were accelerated by an incident, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to put an end to his life. During one of his voyages, the ſhip in which he ſailed took fire in an engagement with a Venetian galley, and the crew were obliged to leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024085_0011_0FC31C83266E8BF8"/>
the ſea, to avoid periſhing in the flames. In this extremity, Columbus by the help of a floating oar ſwam upwards of two leagues, to the coaſt of Portugal near Liſbon, and met with a welcome reception from many of his countrymen who were ſettled there.</p>
            <p>At Liſbon, he married the daughter of Pereſtrello, an old ſeaman, who had been concerned in the diſcovery of Porto Santo and Madeira; from whoſe journals and charts, he received the higheſt entertainment. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing his inquiries in Geography, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſlow progreſs the Portugueſe made in their attempts to find a way round Africa to India, "he began to reflect that as the Portugueſe travelled ſo far ſouthward, it were no leſs proper to ſail weſtward,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Life, Chap. V.</note> and that it was reaſonable to expect to find the deſired land in that direction.</p>
            <p>It muſt here be remembered, that India was in part known to the ancients, and that its rich and uſeful productions had for many centuries been conveyed into Europe, either by Caravans through the deſarts of Syria and Arabia; or by the way of the Red Sea, through

The Portugueſe were then ſeeking it by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the circumnavigation of Africa; and their expectation of finding it in that direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was grounded on ancient hiſtorical tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that a voyage had been formerly made by the orders of Necho King of Egypt, from the Red Sea, round the ſouthern part of Africa to the ſtraights of Hercules; and that the ſame route had been traverſed by Hanno the Carthaginian, by Eudoxus the Egyptian and others. The Portugueſe had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nſumed about half a century in making va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attempts, and had advanced no farther, on the weſtern Coaſt of Africa, than juſt to croſs the Equator, when Columbus conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his great deſign of finding India in the weſt.</p>
            <p>The cauſes which led him to entertain this idea are diſtinguiſhed by his ſon, the writer of his life into theſe three,<note n="†" place="bottom">Life, Chap. VI.</note> "natural

reaſon, the authority of writers, and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſailors."</p>
            <p>By the help of "reaſon," he argued in this manner, That the earth and ſea compoſed one globe or ſphere. This was known by obſerving the ſhadow of the earth in lunar eclipſes. Hence he concluded that it might be travelled over from eaſt to weſt or from weſt to eaſt. It had been explored to the the eaſt by ſome European travellers as far as Cipango or Japan, and as far weſtward as the Azores or Weſtern Iſlands. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſpace though now known to be more than half, he ſuppoſed to be but one third part of the circumference of the globe. If this ſpace, were an open ſea, he imagined it might be eaſily ſailed over; and if there were any land extending eaſtwardly beyond the known limits of Aſia, he ſuppoſed that it muſt be nearer to Spain by the weſt than by the eaſt. For it was then a received opinion that the continent and iſlands of India ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over one third part of the circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the globe; that another third part was comprehended between India and the weſtern ſhore of Spain; therefore it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the eaſtern part of India muſt be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024085_0014_0FC31C96F3E25170"/>
as near to Spain as the weſtern part. This opinion though now known to be erroneous, yet being then admitted as true, made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to Columbus very eaſy and practicable to diſcover India in the weſt. He hoped al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that between Spain and India, in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, there might be found ſome iſlands; by the help of which, as reſting places in his voyage, he might the better purſue his main deſign. The probability of the exiſtence of land in that Ocean, he argued, partly from the opinion of philoſophers, that there was more land than ſea on the ſurface of the globe; and partly from the neceſſity of a counterpoiſe in the weſt, for the immenſe quantity of land which was known to be in the eaſt.</p>
            <p>Another ſource from which he drew his concluſion, was "the authority of learned men," who had affirmed the poſſibility of ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the weſtern coaſt of Spain, to the eaſtern bounds of India. Some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Geographers had admitted this for truth, and one of them<note n="*" place="bottom">Pliny.</note> had affirmed that forty days were ſufficient to perform this nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation. Theſe authorities fell in with the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024085_0015_0FC31C981DACB9B8"/>
theory which Columbus had formed; and having as early as 1474, communicated his ideas in writing to Paul, a learned Phyſician of Florence, he received from him letters of that date, confirming his opinion and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging his deſign; accompanied with a chart, in which Paul had laid down the city of Quiſay (ſuppoſed to be the capital of China) but little more than two thouſand leagues weſtward from Liſbon, which in fact is but half the diſtance. Thus by arguing from true principles, and by indulging conjectures partly well founded and partly erroneous, Columbus was led to the execution of a plan, bold in its conception, and to his view eaſily practicable; for great minds overlook inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate obſtacles, which men of ſmaller views magnify into inſuperable difficulties.</p>
            <p>The third ground on which he formed his idea was "the teſtimony of mariners;" a claſs of men who at that time, and in that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of ſcience, were too prone to mix fable with fact; and were often miſled by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which they could not ſolve. In the ſea, between Madeira and the Weſtern Iſlands, pieces of carved wood and large joints of cane had been diſcovered, which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024085_0016_0FC31C9992791870"/>
to be brought by weſterly winds. Branches of pine trees, a canoe, and two hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man bodies of a complexion different from the Europeans and Africans had been found, on the ſhores of theſe iſlands. Some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators had affirmed, that they had ſeen iſlands not more than an hundred leagues weſtward from the Azores. There was a tradition, that when Spain was conquered by the Moors in the eighth century, ſeven Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops who were exiled from their country, had built ſeven cities and churches, on an iſland cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Antilla; which was ſuppoſed to be not more than two hundred leagues weſt of the Canaries; and it was ſaid that a Portugueſe ſhip had once diſcovered this iſland, but could never find it again. Theſe ſtories, partly true and partly fabulous, had their effect on the mind of Columbus. He believed that iſlands were to be found, weſtward of the Azores and Canaries, though according to his theory, they were at a greater diſtance than any of his contemporaries had imagined. His candour led him to adopt an opinion from Pliny re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting floating iſlands, by the help of which he accounted for the appearances related to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024085_0017_0FC31CA44929FE38"/>
him, by his marine brethren. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that the large iſlands of floating ice, driven from the Polar Seas to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; or the Fog Banks, which form many ſingular appearances reſembling land and trees, might have been the true foundation of this opinion and of theſe reports.<note n="*" place="bottom">

But deeming the enterpriſe too great to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by any but a ſovereign ſtate, he firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied (as it is ſaid) to the Republic of Genoa, by whom his project was treated as viſionary.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is ſaid on the authority of Herrera the Spaniſh hiſtorian; Ferdinando Columbus, in the life of his father, ſays nothing of it; but repreſents his application to the King of Portugal as the firſt, and gives this reaſon for it, "becauſe he lived under him."</note> He then propoſed his plan to John II. King of Portugal, who, though a Prince of good underſtanding and of an enterpriſing diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet was ſo deeply engaged in proſecuting diſcoveries on the African coaſt, with a view to find a way to India round that continent; and had been at ſo vaſt an expenſe without any conſiderable ſucceſs, that he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to accept the terms which Columbus propoſed. Influenced however by the advice of Calzadilla, a favourite courtier, he private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024085_0020_0FC31CAA2002DAD0"/>
gave orders to a ſhip, bound to the iſlands of Cape de Verd, to attempt a diſcovery in the weſt, but through ignorance and want of enterpriſe, the navigators, after wandering for ſome time in the ocean and making no diſcovery, reached their deſtined port and turned the project of Columbus into ridicule.</p>
            <p>Diſguſted with this baſe artifice he quitted Portugal, and went to Ferdinand, King of Spain, having previouſly ſent his brother to England to ſolicit the patronage of Henry VII. But being taken by pirates, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſeveral years in captivity, Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew had it not in his power to reveal his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Henry, till Chriſtopher Columbus had ſucceeded in Spain. Before this could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, he had various obſtacles to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount; and it was not till after ſeven years of painful ſolicitation that he obtained his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
            <p>The objections made to the propoſal of Columbus, by the moſt learned men in Spain, to whom the conſideration of it was referred, will give us ſome idea of the ſtate of geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical ſcience at that time. One objection was, How ſhould he know more than all the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024085_0021_0FC31CB40E452320"/>
wiſe men and ſkilful ſailors who had exiſted ſince the creation? Another was the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Seneca who had doubted whether it were poſſible to navigate the ocean at any great diſtance from the ſhore; but admitting that it were navigable, they imagined, that three years would be required to perform the voyage, which Columbus propoſed. A third was, that if a ſhip ſhould ſail weſtward on a round globe, ſhe would neceſſarily go down, on the oppoſite ſide, and then it would be impoſſible to return, becauſe it would be like climbing up a hill, which no ſhip could do with the ſtrongeſt wind. A fourth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was grounded on a book of St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, in which he had expreſſed his doubt of the exiſtence of antipodes and the poſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of going from one hemiſphere to the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. As the writings of this Holy Father had received the ſanction of the Church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him was deemed hereſy.<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, Chap. XII.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For ſuch reaſons, and by ſuch reaſoners the propoſal of Columbus was at firſt rejected; but by the influence of father Perez, a Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Prieſt, and Lewis Santangel, an officer of

the King's houſhold, Queen Iſabella was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to liſten to his ſolicitation, and after he had been twice repulſed, to recal him to Court; when ſhe offered to pawn her jewels to defray the expenſe of the equipment, amounting to no more than 2500 crowns; which ſum was advanced by Santangel, and the Queen's jewels were ſaved. Thus, to the generous deciſion of a female mind, we owe the diſcovery of America.</p>
            <p>The neceſſary preparations being made, and a year's proviſion laid in, on the 3d of Auguſt, 1492, Columbus ſailed from Palos, a port of Spain, on the Mediterranean, with three veſſels, one of which was called a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack, and the other two, Caravels; having on board, the whole, ninety men. Having paſſed through the ſtraights of Gibraltar, he arrived at the Canaries, on the 12th of the ſame month; where he was detained in refit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one of the Caravels, and taking in wood and water, till the 6th of September, when he ſailed weſtward on his voyage of diſcovery.</p>
            <p>This voyage, which now is conſidered as an eaſy and pleaſant run, between the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of 20 and 30 degrees, with a trade wind, was then the boldeſt attempt which had ever
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024085_0023_0FC31CBA9799A428"/>
been made, and filled the minds of the beſt ſeamen with apprehenſion. They were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly from home, and from all hope of relief, if any accident ſhould befal them. No friendly port nor human being was known to be in that direction. Every bird which flew in the air, every fiſh which appeared in the ſea, and every weed which floated on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, was regarded with the moſt minute at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the journal of the voyage in the Life of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, Chap. XVIII—XXI.</note> as if the fate of the voyage depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it. A phenomenon which had never before been obſerved ſtruck them with terror. The magnetic needle appeared to vary from the pole: They began to apprehend that their compaſs would prove an unfaithful guide; and the trade wind, which waſted them along with its friendly wings, they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would obſtruct their return.</p>
            <p>To be twenty days at ſea, without ſight of land was what the boldeſt mariner had never before attempted. At the expiration of that time the impatient ſailors began to talk of throwing their commander into the ocean and returning home. Their murmurs reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024085_0024_0FC31CBF46112D48"/>
his ears; but his active mind was never at a loſs for expedients, even in the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. By ſoothing, flattery and artifice, by inventing reaſons for every uncommon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, by promiſing rewards to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and a gratuity to him who ſhould firſt diſcover land, in addition to what the King had ordered, and by deceiving them in the ſhip's reckoning, he kept them on their courſe for ſixteen days longer. In the night of the 11th of October, he himſelf ſaw a light, which ſeemed to be on ſhore, and in the morning of the 12th, they had the joyful ſight of land, which proved to be the iſland of Guanahana, one of the cluſter called Bahamas, in the 25th degree of north latitude.</p>
            <p>Thus in the ſpace of thirty-ſix days, and in the 45th year of his age, Columbus complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a voyage which he had ſpent twenty years in projecting and executing; a voyage which opened to the Europeans a new world; which gave a new turn to their thoughts, to their ſpirit of enterpriſe and of commerce; which enlarged the empire of Spain, and ſtamped with immortality the name of Columbus.</p>
            <p>After ſpending ſeveral months in ſailing from one iſland to another in that vaſt archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024085_0025_0FC31CC649D17550"/>
which, from the miſtakes of the age, received the name of the Weſt-Indies, Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus returned to Spain with the two ſmaller veſſels, the larger having been wrecked on the iſland of Hiſpaniola. During his paſſage he met with a violent tempeſt which threatened him with deſtruction. In this extremity he gave an admirable proof of his calmneſs and foreſight. He wrote on parchment an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his diſcoveries, wrapped it in a piece of oiled cloth, and incloſed it in a cake of wax, which he put into a tight caſk and threw into the ſea. Another parchment, ſecured in the ſame manner he placed on the ſtern, that if the ſhip ſhould ſink, the caſk might float, and poſſibly one or the other might be driven on ſhore, or taken up at ſea by ſome future navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator. But this precaution proved fruitleſs. He arrived ſafe in Spain in March, 1493, and was received with the honours due to his merit.</p>
            <p>After this, he made three other voyages to America, in one of which he diſcovered the continent; and in a ſucceeding voyage he endeavoured to find a paſſage through it to India, but in vain; that deſirable country he never ſaw.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024085_0027_0FC31CD1444621A8"/>
the probability, and then demonſtrated the certainty of the exiſtence of this continent.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that a fate ſimilar to that of Columbus, hath befallen others of the firſt adventurers to America. The great RALEIGH was ſacrificed to the jealouſy of Spain by the puſillanimity of his ſovereign. SMITH, GOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GES, MASON and POPHAM, conſumed their time and fortunes in proſecuting diſcoveries, and laying a foundation for the proſperity of their ſucceſſors. Yet the names of theſe men have not been given to any conſiderable part of this territory, the object of their painful and expenſive undertakings. Hiſtory how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will preſerve the memory of their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though forgotten by thoſe STATES which are indebted to them for their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Having thus traced the ſteps by which the <hi>diſcovery of America</hi> was made to the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans; let us take a view of its connexion with the <hi>advancement of ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt branch of ſcience which preſents itſelf in this inquiry is <hi>Geography</hi>; the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of which has been moſt eſſentially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by means of this diſcovery. It is to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024085_0028_0FC31CD86EA85DD0"/>
us very aſtoniſhing, that the ancient phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers perſiſted ſo tenaciouſly in their opinion reſpecting the five zones; and eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially that they deemed the equatorial regions uninhabitable, when they had the means of better information. For, voyages were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made from the red ſea to the coaſt of India, within ten or twelve degrees of the equator. The Carthaginians planted colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on the weſtern ſide of Africa, within five degrees of it; and if the country of Ophir was the ſame with Sofala, on the eaſtern ſhore of Africa, the navy of Solomon muſt have croſſed the equator both in going and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Notwithſtanding this advantage which they certainly had, it was a received opinion among the Greeks and Romans, which no one dared to controvert; that the torrid zone was ſcorched by the vertical ſun, and that no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being could reſide in it, or paſs through it, from the northern to the ſouthern hemiſphere. This error, it is probable, firſt aroſe from the knowledge which they had of the vaſt, ſandy deſarts of Africa, which had ſometimes prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſtructive to whole armies who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to paſs them. The only way, in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024085_0029_0FC31CD96FAEFC48"/>
which we can account for their not correcting this miſtake, is, that the navigation of the ſouthern ſeas was performed chiefly by the Phenicians and Carthaginians, who were the enemies and rivals of the Greeks and Romans, and kept their knowledge to themſelves. We find among them no philoſophers, and very few authors. They were practical ſeamen and merchants, intent on gain, and monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers of commerce.</p>
            <p>The Greeks and Romans had very little more of the ſpirit of enterpriſe than was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with their hoſtile expeditions; but they formed theories of geography, either by the obſervations and reports of their military commanders, or by ſecond hand information, or by conjecture and hypotheſis. Theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions produced many authors, and many of their books are preſerved to our times, in which we ſee the imperfection of their knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the globe, their prejudice in favour of their erroneous ſyſtem, and their incredulity when evidence was offered againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived hypotheſis.</p>
            <p>On the authority of theſe philoſophers, the Roman world for many ages founded all their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024085_0030_0FC31CDADE334AF0"/>
geographical knowledge. That imperfect ſyſtem became at length a part of the creed of the Roman church, and was defended by the court of inquiſition. If St. Auguſtine doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diurnal motion of the earth, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of antipodes, or the habitableneſs of the torrid zone; St. Dominic was ready with his infernal logic, to ſilence every one who preſumed to diſſent from the infallible chair. Thus ignorance and error were canonized, and the feeble dawn of ſcience was ſcarcely able to penetrate the dark miſt of the middle ages. Even after the diſcoveries made by the Portugueſe in the eaſt, and by the Spaniards in the weſt, the Roman Pontiff gravely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a right to divide the world between them by a line drawn from pole to pole, at the diſtance of an hundred leagues from the Azores or weſtern iſlands; without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, in caſe they ſhould meet, and their claims ſhould interfere on the oppoſite ſide of the globe.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Bull at large in Hazard's Collection, vol. I. page 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>By the progreſs of diſcovery, thoſe ancient ſyſtems have gradually vaniſhed, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024085_0031_0FC31CE6CD575FF0"/>
have founded their knowledge of the form and contents of the terraqueous globe, on fact and experience. One traveller has ſucceeded another, and one nation has emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated another, in the ſurvey of the earth, till within the laſt twenty years the boundaries of navigation have been preciſely aſcertained, and the circuit of the globe is now become a familiar voyage among our marine brethren. The reign of George III, though ſtained with the groſſeſt political errors, and diſgraced by the loſs of a large portion of this continent from his dominion; yet deſerves reſpect, for giving birth to many expenſive adventures to the moſt diſtant regions, eſpecially in the vaſt pacific ocean; by which the ſcience of geog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphy has been much improved. Indeed we are now ſo far advanced in our acquaintance with the globe, that every ſchool-boy knows more of it than all the philoſophers of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and as we proceed in our inquiries into this noble ſcience, we learn more and more of the wonderful works of him who is perfect in wiſdom and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Connected with geography, we may view the ſcience of <hi>navigation</hi> as alſo greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024085_0032_0FC31CE7DAED0930"/>
ſince this diſcovery. By navigation I do not mean barely the mathematical knowledge neceſſary to keep the reckoning of a ſhip, and the celeſtial obſervations to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its poſition; though even theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to more accuracy, and performed by better inſtruments than formerly; but I would comprehend the whole art of travelling by ſea, the conſtruction and equipment of ſhips, and the methods uſed to preſerve the lives and health of ſeamen in all climates. When Columbus ſailed on his firſt voyage, two of the veſſels employed in that ſervice were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out decks,<note n="*" place="bottom">

This muſt give us an idea of the very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of naval architecture at that period; for theſe were doubtleſs the beſt ſhips which could be procured in the dominion of Queen Iſabella, and they were three months in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the voyage. After that period, commerce, the ſoul of navigation, dictated the building and equipment of larger, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024085_0033_0FC31CE91EA419D8"/>
and more commodious veſſels, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of tranſporting merchandiſe, and explor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new regions. But that fatal diſtemper the ſcurvy, was an obſtacle which for many years baffled the ingenuity of man, and the power of medicine. It is but half a century ſince the ſquadron of ANSON, in circumnav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igating the globe, were reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs, by its uncontroled ravages. But within the laſt twenty years, methods have been adopted to prevent it; and the name of COOKE will always be renowned in naval hiſtory, for having ſucceſsfully perfected the means of preſerving the lives of ſeamen in the longeſt voyages; as well as for having eſtabliſhed the limits of navigation, toward the ſouthern and the northern poles.</p>
            <p>It is now known by experience, that the human conſtitution is capable, by proper management, of enduring all the viciſſitudes of heat and cold, of moiſture and dryneſs, to which any acceſſible part of the earth is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and that its health may be preſerved in all climates and ſituations. This diſcovery is in the higheſt degree favourable to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of commerce, which in the preſent age,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024085_0034_0FC31CF08C19CF10"/>
affords its friendly aſſiſtance to the progreſs of knowledge and humanity.</p>
            <p>We may alſo reckon the ſcience of <hi>natural hiſtory</hi> as greatly improved by the diſcovery of this continent. It has given mankind more juſt and ſublime ideas of the works of GOD, ſome of which appear to be conſtructed on a larger ſcale, and in a more magnificent ſtyle, than in the old continent. The immenſe Andes of South America are elevated above the Alps, the Taurus or the Atlas. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azon, Oronooque and La Plata diſcharge greater quantities of water than the Danube, the Ganges or the Nile. The vaſt chain of lakes which flow into the St. Lawrence, forms a ſingular phenomenon, which no part of the old continent can parallel. Beſides, America can boaſt of the moſt extenſive and fertile plains, whilſt it is entirely free from thoſe ſcorching ſands and parched deſarts, which deform the countries of Africa and Arabia.</p>
            <p>In America are found ſeveral ſpecies of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imals unknown in other parts of the world, beſide the remains of ſome ſuppoſed to be now extinct, which for bulk and ſtrength muſt at leaſt have equalled the elephant of Aſia and Africa. The vegetable productions of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024085_0035_0FC31CF165DE5600"/>
this continent have alſo enriched the medical art, with many valuable acquiſitions before unknown. The precious metals, gold and ſilver as well as diamonds and pearls are vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more common, and of leſs value than before; and the foſſil treaſures which have been diſcovered, afford not only many uſeful articles in commerce and the arts, but dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtrate the certainty of an univerſal diſrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth, at ſome remote period, and thus confirm the truth of ſacred hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The diſcovery of America has alſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an important page in the <hi>hiſtory of man.</hi> We find our brethren of the human race, ſcattered over all parts of this continent, and the adjacent iſlands. We ſee mankind in their ſeveral varieties of colour, form and habit, and we learn to conſider ourſelves as one great family, ſent into the world to make various experiments for happineſs.</p>
            <p>One of the grandeſt of theſe experiments has been made in our own part of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. Freedom, that noble gift of heaven, has here fixed her ſtandard, and invited the diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all countries to take refuge under it. Our virtuous anceſtors fled from the impoſitions and perſecutions to which they were ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024085_0036_0FC31CFA725FB0E0"/>
in England, and found in this wilderneſs an aſylum from that tyranny. Their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was followed by others, and in North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, the oppreſſed of Europe have always found ſafety and relief. But we were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Providence for a nobler experiment ſtill: Not only to open a door of ſafety to our European brethren here; but to ſhow them that they are entitled to the ſame rights in their native countries; and we have ſet them an example of a hazardous, but ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vindication of thoſe rights, which are the gift of God to man.</p>
            <p>It is both amuſing and inſtructive to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view our former notions of liberty, both civil and religious; and to ſee what imperfect ideas we had on theſe ſubjects, derived by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from our European anceſtors. Like them we boaſted of <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberty; as if Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen had ſome excluſive rights, beyond any other people, on the face of the earth. And what was Engliſh liberty? Its origin muſt be ſought in ancient charters, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>magna charta,</hi> granted by, or rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forced from, one of the worſt princes that ever diſgraced a throne. The liberties of Engliſhmen, after the Norman Conqueſt,

were the grants of their Kings;<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"I have always conſidered the boaſted birth-right of an Engliſhman, as an arrogant pretenſion built on a beggarly foundation.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024085_0038_0FC31D03745F45B8"/>
ſtyled royal provinces, which were governed by temporary commiſſions from the crown, revocable at the royal pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In like manner, our title to religious free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was ſuppoſed to be derived, partly from the ſame charters and commiſſions; in which, liberty of conſcience was <hi>granted</hi> by the King, to ſuch of his ſubjects as ſhould ſettle in the plantations; partly from acts of toleration, made in England, and conſtrued to extend to the colonies; and, partly from our own laws made to favour the religious opinions and practices of thoſe who diſſented from the majority. Religious liberty was not placed on its right foundation, nor deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its true ſource. The world was not obliged to the ſtateſman or the divine, for the firſt acknowledgment of this darling right; but to the ſpirit of commerce and to the intereſted views of the merchant. Religious toleration was introduced into the European countries for the benefit of trade. When the merchants of Holland ſtruck out the idea, it was regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their neighbours, with the ſame horror as a peſtilence. It was imported into England, with William, Prince of Orange, under whoſe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024085_0039_0FC31D0F07A3A0A0"/>
patronage it was formed into a law; but it has never been there ſo extenſively admitted as to put all ſects and parties on an equal foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A preference is ſtill given to one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination above all others; and if an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman would fully enjoy the privileges of an Engliſhman, he muſt conform to the rites and ceremonies of what is called the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed church; all other perſons are ſubject to burdens and incapacities, from which they cannot be free, whilſt they continue within that realm; and the oppoſers of theſe une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual burdens are expoſed to the rage of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty zeal, which in ſome late inſtances has been carried to the moſt criminal exceſs.</p>
            <p>Too much of the ſame ſpirit, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, has reigned here. Our anceſtors in New England eſtabliſhed a teſt before any was enacted by the Engliſh parliament; and though it has, long ſince, been abrogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the idea of an excluſive right to the honours and emoluments of government, by the prevailing religious denomination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till very lately. Some of us can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time, when it was thought a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient objection to a man's being choſen to a ſeat in the legiſlature, that he belonged to the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024085_0040_0FC31D136A9F6C38"/>
Epiſcopal Church. And, even at this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened period, I bluſh to own, that, by the Conſtitution of this Commonwealth, the Jew, the Mahometan, the Gentoo, and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Confucius, are excluded from our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic councils, be they ever ſo good citizens; whilſt men, who for convenience, call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, though deeply tinged with infidelity, and deſtitute of moral principles, <hi>may</hi> freely be admitted.</p>
            <p>But though imperfection is more or leſs interwoven with all human conſtitutions; yet a ſpirit of improvement is evidently pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this country. Several of the firſt forms of government which were made for theſe States, have been reviewed and amended. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious teſts have been gradually aboliſhed; and our national form of government is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free from them. It leaves religion where all civil government ought to leave it; to the conſciences of individuals, under the control of the ſupreme Lord.</p>
            <p>As learning is acknowledged to be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary to the preſervation of a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government, ſo wherever the true ſpirit of liberty reigns it will cheriſh the intereſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024085_0041_0FC31D1BEB790740"/>
of ſcience. This principle was well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the fathers of New England, and we their poſterity have reaped the benefit of their wiſe and faithful care to provide the means of inſtruction for us. The ſame ſpirit ſeems more and more to prevail throughout this country, and forms one of the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py omens of the preſervation of liberty to future generations.</p>
            <p>From our example of a government found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the principle of repreſentation, exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all family pretenſions and titles of nobil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, other nations are beginning to look into their natural and original rights as <hi>men</hi>; and to aſſert and maintain them againſt the claims of deſpotiſm. As far as the preſent ſtruggle in Europe againſt civil and ſpiritual uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is conducted on virtuous principles, we cordially wiſh it ſucceſs. But have we not reaſon to fear that the cauſe of liberty may be injured by the intemperate zeal of its friends, as much as by the ſyſtematic oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its enemies? If wiſdom, harmony and fortitude were combined with patriotiſm on the ſide of liberty, we might hope that the time was approaching, when an hereditary right to govern a nation would appear as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024085_0042_0FC31D1CE5F39380"/>
as the royal touch for the King's evil; and when the loftieſt prelates of Europe would find themſelves reduced to the ſame level with the curate of a pariſh. But what ſcenes of anarchy and diſtreſs may take place before theſe deſirable events, we muſt wait for time to unfold.</p>
            <p>It is an old obſervation of Solomon, "He that increaſeth knowledge increaſeth ſorrow." This may juſtly be applied to the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſcience which is made by the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of America. The field is extended, but difficulties have ariſen which are not yet ſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though we have learned more of the works of creation and providence than was known to preceding ages, yet we find that there is ſtill more behind the curtain.</p>
            <p>Among theſe difficulties we may reckon the queſtion, <hi>whence was America peopled?</hi> For three centuries this has been a ſubject of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate among the learned; and it is amuſing, to ſee how national prejudice has become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved with philoſophical diſquiſition, in the attempts which have been made to ſolve the queſtion. The claims of Hanno the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian, of Madoc the Welchman, of the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024085_0043_0FC31D24B0762890"/>
ſeven Biſhops of Spain, and the ten tribes of Iſrael, have had their ſeveral advocates; and after all, the claim of the ſix nations is as well founded as any, that their anceſtors ſprung like trees out of the ſoil. The true philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher will treat them all with indifference, and will ſuſpend his judgment till he has better information than any which has yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Since the late diſcovery of many cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of iſlands in the Pacific Ocean, and the near approach of the Aſian to the American continent, the difficulty with reſpect to the population of America, by the human ſpecies is leſſened; and had this continent been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by a ſcientific people on its weſtern, before it was on its eaſtern ſide, perhaps the queſtion would not have been ſo long nor ſo warmly agitated. But ſtill the tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other animals from the old to the new continent, and the exiſtence of ſome here which are not known there, is a ſubject, which remains involved in obſcurity.</p>
            <p>Before we have ſolved one difficulty anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er riſes to view. It is not many years ſince the large bones found in the neighbourhood of the Ohio excited much attention. We
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024085_0044_0FC31D2C0CF87328"/>
had ſcarcely conjectured to what animal they belonged when a new object was brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Mounds</hi> and <hi>fortifications</hi> of a regular conſtruction were diſcovered in the thickeſt ſhades of the American foreſt, overgrown with trees of immenſe age, which are ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be not the firſt growth upon the ſpot ſince the dereliction of its ancient poſſeſſors.</p>
            <p>The moſt obvious mode of ſolving the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty which aroſe in the curious mind on this occaſion was by making inquiry of the natives. But the ſtructures are too ancient for their tradition, their oldeſt and wiſeſt men know nothing of their original. Indeed the form and materials of theſe works ſeem to indicate the exiſtence of a race of men in a ſtage of improvement ſuperior to thoſe natives of whom we or our fathers have had any knowledge; who had different ideas of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and utility; who were more patient of labour, and better acquainted with the art of defence.</p>
            <p>That theſe works were not conſtructed by any Europeans who have penetrated the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican wilderneſs ſince the diſcovery of the continent, appears from various conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;

            <p>Our aſtoniſhment is further excited, by conſidering that the diſcovery of America has opened a large mart for the <hi>commerce in ſlaves</hi> from the oppoſite continent of Africa. So much has been written and ſpoken on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity attending this deteſtable ſpecies of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, that I need not attempt again to excite the feelings of indignation and horror, which I doubt not have pervaded the breaſt of every perſon now preſent, when contemplating this flagrant inſult on the laws of juſtice and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. I ſhall only obſerve, that the firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:024085_0046_0FC31D2FF10EF5C0"/>
of the negro ſlavery into America, was occaſioned by the previous deſtruction of the native inhabitants of the Weſt-India iſlands, by the cruelty of their Spaniſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, in exacting of them more labour than they were able to perform. The moſt remarkable and unaccountable circumſtance attending the beginning of this traffic, is, that it was recommended by a Spaniſh Biſhop, one of the moſt benevolent friends of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, whom he could not bear to ſee ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly deſtroyed by his countrymen. When they preſſed him with this difficulty, "How ſhall our plantations be cultivated if we may not uſe the natives as our ſlaves?" He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them to ſend to Africa, for a more ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt and patient race of men, who could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bear the fatigue of labour in a warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Thus from a principle of lenity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſavages of America, he introduced the commerce of ſlaves from Africa; which has proved deſtructive to human life and happineſs, in the ſame proportion that it has encouraged avarice, luxury, pride and cruelty.</p>
            <p>But do I not ſee the dawn of that auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious day which ſhall put a ſtop to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024085_0047_0FC31D3B8A413E80"/>
traffic, and ſhall teach mankind that Africans have a native right to liberty and property as well as Europeans and Americans? May theſe rights ever be reſpected, and nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more be infringed, eſpecially by thoſe who have ſucceſsfully contended for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own.</p>
            <p>Let us now turn our attention to another ſubject of debate, ariſing from the knowledge of this continent. If the goſpel was deſigned for an univerſal benefit to mankind, why was it not brought by the Apoſtles to America, as well as propagated in the ſeveral regions of the old continent? To ſolve this difficulty, it has been alleged that America <hi>was</hi> known to the ancients; and that it was enlightened by the perſonal miniſtry of the Apoſtles.<note n="*" place="bottom">See an elaborate Eſſay on this ſubject by the late Dr. Samuel Mather.</note> With equal propriety it might be ſolved, by denying that America was at that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by any human being, and it might not be impoſſible to maintain this negative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, againſt any poſitive proof which can be adduced to the contrary. But both are attended with difficulties which require more
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024085_0048_0FC31D3CA5DD09F8"/>
light to unravel than has yet appeared. If America was peopled at that period, perhaps the ſtate of human ſociety was ſuch, that the wiſe and benevolent Author of chriſtianity ſaw no proſpect of ſucceſs, to the propagation of his goſpel here, without the intervention of more and greater miracles, than were conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with divine wiſdom or the nature of man to permit.</p>
            <p>Nearly akin to this, is another difficulty. The native inhabitants of Peru, for ſome centuries before the Spaniſh invaſion, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as worſhipers of the ſun; whoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally benignant influence to the world they thought themſelves bound to imitate.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Garcilaſſo de la Vega's Royal Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peru.</note> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly their national character was mild, gentle and humane. They made no offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wars; and when they repelled the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their ſavage neighbours, and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, it was done with a view to reduce them from their native ferocity, under the government of rational and ſocial principles; and to incorporate them with themſelves, that they might enjoy the benefits of their own pacific ſyſtem. Their code of laws, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024085_0049_0FC31D3DE7F2E5F0"/>
by the founder of their empire, was a work of reaſon and benevolence, and bore a great reſemblance to the divine precepts giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by Moſes and confirmed by Jeſus Chriſt. In ſhort, they ſeem to have made the neareſt approach to the ſyſtem of chriſtianity, I mean the moral part of it, of any people who had never been formally inſtructed in its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>It would ſeem then to human reaſon, that they were fit objects for an apoſtolic miſſion; and, that if the pure, ſimple, original doctrine of the goſpel had been preached to them they would readily have embraced it.</p>
            <p>But when we find that theſe mild and peaceful people were invaded by avaricious Spaniards, under a pretence of converting them to the catholic faith; when inſtead of the meek and humble language of a primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evangeliſt, we ſee a bigoted Friar grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advancing at the head of a Spaniſh army, and, in a language unknown to the Peruvians, declaring that their country was given to his nation, by the Pope of Rome, God's only vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar on earth, and commanding them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their new maſters on pain of death; when we conſider this parade of arrogant hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024085_0050_0FC31D3FD6D2BA48"/>
as the ſignal for ſlaughter, and ſee the innocent victims falling by the ſword of theſe miniſters of deſtruction; when we ſee the whole nation vanquiſhed, diſheartened, and either murdered or reduced to ſlavery, by their ſavage conquerors; when inſtead of the worſhip which they addreſſed to the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary of heaven, and which needed but one ſtep more to conduct them to the knowledge of its inviſible Creator, we ſee the pomp of Popiſh idolatry, with the infernal horrors of the Inquiſition introduced into their country; our aſtoniſhment is excited to the higheſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and we can only exclaim, "Thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, O Lord, are a great deep! and thy ways are paſt finding out!"</p>
            <p>It would give me the greateſt pleaſure, if in concluding this diſcourſe I could ſay any thing, with reſpect to the propagation of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, among the original natives of America, which could be conſtrued into a fulfilment of the prediction of Daniel, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Every European nation, which poſſeſſes any conſiderable ſhare of the continent, has made this deſireable work a part of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſign; in planting and ſettling the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024085_0051_0FC31D4C2F3CE540"/>
country; and it muſt be acknowledged that ſome very zealous and well meant endeavours have been made, by men who had neither wealth nor power in their view; but the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs has not been anſwerable to the goodneſs of the deſign, nor to the wiſhes of thoſe who have engaged in it. If we ſurvey the whole continent, from the firſt diſcovery of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, to the preſent time, the number of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to chriſtianity, among the Indians, bears but a ſmall proportion to thoſe, who have been deſtroyed either by war, by ſlavery or by ſpirituous liquors. And, with reſpect to many of thoſe who have been called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, it may juſtly be inquired, whether any thing more can be ſaid in favour of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, than that they have exchanged their original ſuperſtitions, for others, more glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and refined.</p>
            <p>If the truths of our holy religion are to be propagated among the ſavages, it will become us to conſider, whether we had not better firſt agree among ourſelves, what theſe truths are. For whilſt they ſee diverſities of opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and that ſome of the more zealous advocates of particular tenets, are endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſtil the peculiarities of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024085_0052_0FC31D4E51B781D8"/>
ſects among them, and to prejudice them againſt others; the native ſagacity with which theſe people are endowed will lead them to avoid confounding themſelves with our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, and to retain the religion of their anceſtors, till they can find one, more free from perplexity, than chriſtianity appears by the diverſity of our opinions concerning it.</p>
            <p>It is alſo worthy of conſideration, whether the vicious lives and conduct of our own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and eſpecially thoſe on the frontiers, with whom the Indians are moſt acquainted, be not a great obſtruction to the ſpreading of divine knowledge among them. It is very natural to eſtimate the goodneſs of any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by the influence which it appears to have on thoſe who profeſs it; and, if they are to regard the conduct of the people by whom they have been cheated, robbed, and murdered, as a ſpecimen of the influence of chriſtianity on the human mind, it would be a greater wonder that they ſhould embrace it than reject it.</p>
            <p>If the chriſtian religion is to be propagated, without the aſſiſtance of miracles, among the ſavages of this continent, it muſt be in ſome ſuch manner as the Moravians have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024085_0053_0FC31D56EDB055B8"/>
Theſe people ſeem to have an art of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taching ſavage nations to their faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and of forming them into civilized and laborious ſociety, beyond any other denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of chriſtians; and, for the honour of the common cauſe, I cannot but wiſh them all that ſupport and encouragement which their zealous and benevolent efforts deſerve.</p>
            <p>It is much to be wiſhed, that the ſpirit of bigotry and the <hi>ſhibboleth</hi> of party were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally aboliſhed; that the chriſtian religion may appear in its native ſimplicity and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that the profeſſors of it would diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh themſelves by that love, that meekneſs and gentleneſs which marked the character of its author and his primitive followers. By theſe marks all men will know us to be his diſciples; our light will ſo ſhine before men, that they will ſee our good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and glorify our father who is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding any preſent unfavourable appearances, yet we have the greateſt reaſon to expect that the time will come when knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge will univerſally prevail; when ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative truth will be reduced to practice, and men will be led to a devout acknowledgement of the only true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024085_0054_0FC31D581E14B6D0"/>
whom he hath ſent, evidenced by a careful obedience to the laws of virtue and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Then will "the earth be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the ſea." Then will be fulfilled thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime predictions of the inſpired Iſaiah. "I will bring thy ſeed from the eaſt and gather them from the weſt; I will ſay to the north, give up; and to the ſouth, keep not back, bring my ſons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth. Thy gates ſhall be open continually, they ſhall not be ſhut day nor night; becauſe the abundance of the ſea ſhall be converted to thee, the forces of the Gentiles ſhall come to thee. Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land, waſting nor deſtruction within thy borders; but thy walls ſhall be ſalvation and thy gates praiſe. Thy ſun ſhall no more go down, neither ſhall thy moon withdraw itſelf; for the Lord ſhall be thy everlaſting light, and thy God ſhall be thy glory. Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous; they ſhall inherit the land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hand that I may be glorified. I the Lord will haſten it in his time."</p>

               <hi>DISSERTATION</hi> I. ON THE CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF <hi>AFRICA</hi> BY THE ANCIENTS.</head>
            <p>THE authenticity of hiſtorical tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on this ſubject hath been queſtioned by ſeveral writers ancient and modern. I ſhall here place in one view, what evidence hath been produced on both ſides of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as far as I have had opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; with ſuch obſervations as have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me during the inquiry.</p>
            <p>The firſt navigators of whom we have any account were the Phenicians, who were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered along the coaſts of the Mediterranean and of the Red Sea. As early as the days of Moſes, they had extended their navigation beyond the pillars of Hercules, on the weſtern coaſt of Africa, toward the ſouth; and as far northward as the iſland of Britain, whence they imported tin and lead,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Numbers, Chap. xxxi. ver. 22.</note> which according to the univerſal teſtimony of the ancients, were not then found in any other country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:024085_0059_0FC31D7603328AE0"/>From the accounts given in ancient hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the expeditions of Seſoſtris, King of Egypt, ſome have been led to conclude, that he made a diſcovery of <hi>all</hi> the coaſts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.<note n="*" place="bottom">Forſter's Hiſtory of Voyages and Diſcoveries, page 7.</note> However this might be, there is no doubt that he opened, or revived a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intercourſe with India and Ethiopia, by way of the Red Sea. It hath alſo been thought, that the voyages of the Phenicians and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews to Ophir, in the time of Solomon, were nothing more nor leſs than circumnaviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Africa.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But, leaving theſe for the preſent in the region of conjecture; the earlieſt regular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which we have, of any voyage round the continent of Africa, is that performed by order of Necho, King of Egypt, and recorded by Herodotus; the moſt ancient hiſtorian, except the ſacred writers, whoſe works have come down to our time. His character as a hiſtorian is, "candid in his acknowledgment of what is uncertain, and abſolute when he ſpeaks of what he knows." The date of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho's reign is fixed by Rollin 616 years before Chriſt. The date of Herodotus's hiſtory is
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:024085_0060_0FC31D771F0D8238"/>
placed by Dufreſnoy in the third year of the 83d Olympiad anſwering to 446 years before Chriſt. So that he muſt have penned his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this voyage, in leſs than two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies after it was performed. I ſhall give his account at large, in a literal tranſlation, from the Geneva Edition of his work, in Greek and Latin, by Stephanus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. iv. Cap. 42.</note> In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the ſeveral great diviſions of the earth, he ſpeaks thus:</p>
            <p>"I wonder at thoſe who have divided and diſtinguiſhed Libya,<note n="†" place="bottom">Libya is the name by which the whole continent of Africa was called by the Greeks.</note> Aſia and Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which there is not a little difference. If indeed Europe agrees with the others in length, yet in breadth it does not ſeem to me, worthy to be compared. For Libya ſhews it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be <hi>ſurrounded by the ſea,</hi> except where it joins to Aſia. Necos, King of the Egyptians, being the firſt of thoſe, whom we know, to demonſtrate it. After he had deſiſted from digging a ditch from the Nile to the Arabic gulf [in which work above twenty thouſand Egyptians periſhed; he betook himſelf to raiſing armies and building ſhips, partly in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:024085_0061_0FC31D82E84AE548"/>
the north ſea<note n="*" place="bottom">By the north ſea is meant the Mediterranean, which lies north of Egypt.</note> and partly in the Arabian gulf, at the Red Sea, of which they yet ſhow ſome remains.<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. ii. Cap. 48.</note>] He ſent certain Phenicians in ſhips, commanding them, that having paſſed the pillars of Hercules, they ſhould penetrate the north ſea, and ſo return to Egypt. The Phenicians therefore looſing from the Red Sea, went away into the ſouthern ſea, and, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſhips to land, <hi>made a ſeed time,</hi> that when autumn ſhould come, they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a harveſt, and might aſſiduouſly coaſt Libya.

               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:024085_0062_0FC31D84550BE8B0"/>"In the ſecond place, there have been Carthaginians, who have ſaid, that a certain Sataſpes, ſon of Teaſpis, a man of the Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides did not ſail round Libya, when he was ſent; but being deterred by the length of the navigation and the ſolitude of the country returned home, having not fulfilled the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which his mother enjoined him. For he had violated a virgin daughter of Zopy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, the ſon of Megabyſus; and for that cauſe, being by Xerxes condemned to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, his mother, who was ſiſter to Darius, liberated him; becauſe he ſaid, he had rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impoſe on himſelf that puniſhment, than ſubmit to the King's command. Wherefore it became neceſſary for him to ſail round all Libya, till he ſhould come to the Arabian Gulf. Xerxes conſenting to this, Sataſpes went into Egypt, and, having there taken a ſhip and companions, ſailed to the pillars of Hercules. Having paſſed them, and having doubled the promontory of Libya called Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes,<note n="*" place="bottom">Now called Cape Bojador in the 26th degree of north latitude.</note> he kept a ſouthern courſe. Having traverſed much of the ſea in many months,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024085_0063_0FC31D85D568F500"/>
and finding much more time neceſſary, he turned about and came back to Egypt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Xerxes, he reported, that in viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remoteſt coaſts, he had ſeen ſmall men, clothed in Phenician garments; who at the approach of his ſhips, fled to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and left their villages; which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and took nothing from them but cattle. He gave this reaſon for not having ſailed round Libya, that his ſhip could ſail no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but was ſtopped. Xerxes did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and becauſe he had not performed his engagement, ordered him to undergo his deſtined puniſhment."</p>
            <p>To the authenticity of this circumnaviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the African continent, the following objections have been made.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is ſaid that "the veſſels which the ancients employed, were ſo ſmall as not to afford ſtowage for proviſions, ſufficient to ſubſiſt a crew during a long voyage."</p>
            <p>Secondly, "their conſtruction was ſuch that they could ſeldom venture to depart far from land, and their mode of ſteering along the coaſt was ſo circuitous and ſlow, that we may pronounce a voyage from the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean to India, by the Cape of Good Hope,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024085_0064_0FC31D905FAA8D58"/>
to have been an undertaking beyond their power to accompliſh, in ſuch a manner as to render it in any degree ſubſervient to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. To this deciſion, the account pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Herodotus of a voyage performed by ſome Phenician ſhips employed by the King of Egypt, can hardly be conſidered as repugnant."<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's India, p. 175, American edition. The objections taken from this learned author were not made directly againſt the voyage mentioned by Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus; but rather againſt the poſſibility of a paſſage to India by way of the Atlantic Ocean, and round the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican continent. However, as he brings this voyage into view in the ſame argument, and ſpeaks of it dubiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is conceived that his ſentiments are not miſrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented in the above quotations.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I have choſen to conſider both theſe objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together, becauſe that each one helps to deſtroy the other. For if the veſſels were ſo ſmall, as not to contain proviſions for a long voyage, this was one reaſon for the navigators to keep their courſe near the land; that they might find water fruits, game and cattle on the ſhore, as well as fiſh on the ſhoals and rocks near the coaſt, for their ſubſiſtence. And if it was their deſign to keep near the land, for the ſake of diſcovery, ſmall veſſels were beſt
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024085_0065_0FC31D91D2E8ED58"/>
adapted to the purpoſe; becauſe they could paſs over ſhoals and through ſmall openings, between iſlands and rocks, which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſituate near the coaſts of great continents. Beſides, if the veſſels were ſmall they could carry but ſmall crews, who would not require very large quantities of proviſion.</p>
            <p>But Herodotus has helped us to ſolve the difficulty reſpecting proviſions, in a manner perfectly agreeable to the practice of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though unknown to modern navigators. They went on ſhore and ſowed corn, and when it was ripe gathered the harveſt. This enables us to account for two circumſtances attending the voyage of Necho; the length of time employed, and the ſupply of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, at leaſt of bread, conſumed in it.</p>
            <p>Nor was this ſowing and reaping any loſs of time; for the monſoons in the Indian ocean would not permit them to proceed any faſter. A ſhip ſailing from the Red Sea with the N. E. monſoon, in the ſummer or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, would meet with the S. W. monſoon, in the beginning of December, which muſt have detained her in ſome of the harbours, on the eaſtern coaſt of Africa, till the next April. During this time in that warm climate, corn
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024085_0066_0FC31D9389E036A8"/>
might be ſown and reaped; and any other articles, either of proviſion or merchandiſe, might be taken on board. Then the N. E. monſoon would carry her to the ſouthern parts of Africa, into the region of variable winds. This regular courſe and changing of the monſoons was familiarly known to the navigators of Solomon's ſhips, and was the cauſe of their ſpending three years, in the voyage to and from Ophir. "In going and returning, they changed the monſoon ſix times, which made thirty ſix months. They needed no longer time to complete the voyage, and they could not perform it in leſs."<note n="†" place="bottom">Bruce's Travels—B. II. chap. iv.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is not pleaded, that the voyage of Necho was undertaken for the ſake of commerce; or if the authenticity of it were eſtabliſhed, that it would prove the practicability of a voyage from the Mediterranean to India, round the Cape of Good Hope, by the veſſels then in uſe, and the nautical ſkill then acquired. The voyage of which Herodotus ſpeaks might have been a voyage of diſcovery; ſuch an one as was perfectly agreeable to the genius of the people by whom it was performed, and of the prince, by whoſe order and at whoſe
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:024085_0067_0FC31D995EFBAFB8"/>
expenſe it was undertaken. "The progreſs of the Phenicians and Carthaginians, in their knowledge of the globe, was not owing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the deſire of extending their trade from one country to another. Commerce was followed by its uſual effects, among both thoſe people. It awakened curioſity, enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ideas and deſires of men, and incited them to bold enterpriſes. Voyages were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, the ſole object of which was to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover new countries and to explore unknown ſeas.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's America—Vol. I. p. 11, 4th edit.</note> The knowledge acquired in theſe voyages of diſcovery might afterward be ſubſervient to commerce; and though the Phenicians might not think it convenient, to circumnavigate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, more than once, yet that they carried on a commercial intercourſe with different parts of that country, and particularly with places ſituate on the eaſtern coaſt, in the Indian ocean, we have evidence from the ſacred writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. In the reign of Solomon "the king's ſhips with the ſervants of Hiram and the navy of Tharſhiſh every three years brought ivory,<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Chron. viii.18. ix.21.</note> apes and peacocks, beſides ſilver and the gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi>" which is with great reaſon ſuppoſed
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:024085_0068_0FC31D9D0F4E78E8"/>
to be the country now called <hi>Sofala</hi> on the eaſtern coaſt of Africa, in the ſouthern hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſphere; as the learned Bruce, in his late book of travels, has ſatisfactorily proved.</p>
            <p>The prophet Ezekiel, who was contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with Necho, King of Egypt, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he gives of the merchandiſe of Tyre, enumerates ſeveral commodities, which it is well known belong to Africa, "horns of ivory and ebony, and the perſons of men."<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezekiel, chap. xxvii. ver. 13, 15.</note> We may form ſome idea of the ſtrength and materials of the ſhips of the Tyrians, and of their ſkill in navigation, from the following paſſages in his apoſtrophe to Tyrus. "They have made all thy ſhip-boards of fir trees of Senir; they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make maſts for thee; of the oaks of Baſhan have they made thine oars. Thy wiſe men, O Tyrus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were thy pilots. The ancients of Gebal, the wiſe men thereof were thy calkers. The ſhips of Tharſhiſh did ſing of thee; thou waſt repleniſhed and made very glorious in the midſt of the ſeas; thy rowers have brought thee into great waters." Though we have no particular deſcription of the ſize or model of their ſhips; yet they certainly had maſts and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:024085_0069_0FC31DA14F9A52E0"/>
ſails and oars; their pilots and calkers were wiſe men, and they were not afraid to ſail in great waters, by which is probably meant the ocean, in diſtinction from the Mediterranean.</p>
            <p>Of the form and ſtructure of the Grecian veſſels we have a more particular knowledge. "They were of inconſiderable burden, and moſtly without decks. They had only one maſt, and were ſtrangers to the uſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors."<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's America—Vol. I. p. 15.</note> But then it muſt be remembered, that "the Phenicians, who inſtructed the Greeks in other uſeful arts, did not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them that extenſive knowledge of nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation, which they themſelves poſſeſſed."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p 14.</note> We may hence conclude that the ſhips of the Phenicians were much ſuperior to the Grecian veſſels; that they were fitted with maſts; ſails and oars, and with expert pilots. We have then no evidence from the ſtructure of their veſſels or their mode of ſailing, to warrant a doubt of the ability of their ſhips or ſeamen, to perform a voyage round the continent of Africa in three years.</p>
            <p>To an European theoriſt ſuch a voyage may ſeem leſs practicable than to an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024085_0070_0FC31DA89A558038"/>
The Europeans have uſually employed none but ſhips of great burden, in their trade to India and China; but ſince the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans have viſited thoſe countries, ſloops of fifty or ſixty tons have ſailed round the Cape of Good Hope to China, and round Cape Horn to the northweſt coaſt of America, and acroſs the north Pacific Ocean. If any doubt can yet remain, it may be entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the recollection of a voyage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the year 1789, by Lieutenant Bligh of the Britiſh navy; who, being turned adrift by his mutinous crew, traverſed the ſouth Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific Ocean, above twelve hundred leagues, in a boat of twenty three feet long, without a deck, in much ſtormy weather, with ſcanty proviſions; and having paſſed many danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rocks and ſhoals, among unknown iſlands, arrived in forty one days at a Dutch ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Moluccas.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the printed narrative by Lieut. Bligh.</note> The objections then againſt the reality of Necho's voyage, from the ſize and ſtructure of the Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian veſſels, and the want of proviſion are not ſo formidable on examination as at the firſt appearance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:024085_0071_0FC31DAA95AA0D10"/>A third objection againſt the credibility of this early circumnavigation is, that "ſeveral writers of the greateſt eminence among the ancients, and moſt diſtinguiſhed for their knowledge of geography, regarded this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count rather as an amuſing tale, than the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of a real tranſaction; and, either enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained doubts concerning the poſſibility of ſailing round Africa, or abſolutely denied it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's India, p. 175.</note> That the Roman geographers and hiſtorians did doubt and diſbelieve the ſtory is very ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ident; and the cauſes are not far to be ſought.</p>
            <p>The firſt was the jealouſy of the Phenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. "Whatever acquaintance with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote regions of the earth the Phenicians or Carthaginians acquired, was concealed from the reſt of mankind with a mercantile jealouſy. Every thing relative to the courſe of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a ſecret of ſtate as well as a myſtery of trade. Extraordinary facts are recorded concerning their ſolicitude to prevent other nations from penetrating into what they wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould remain undivulged."<note n="†" place="bottom">Robertſon's America, vol.

the places, whence the Carthaginians fetched tin and amber "ſent a veſſel, with orders to ſail in the wake of a Phenician veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. This being obſerved by the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, he purpoſely ran his veſſel among rocks and ſand banks; ſo that it was loſt, together with that of the inquiſitive Roman.

            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon was the pride of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. If, as Pope tells us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </q>
the ſame pride would make their wiſe men ſcorn to learn geography or navigation, theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retically, from thoſe who were beſt able to teach them. It is acknowledged that the Romans "did not imbibe that commercial ſpirit and ardor for diſcovery which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their rivals."<note n="†" place="bottom">Robertſon's America, vol. I. p. 14.</note> It muſt alſo be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there was but little intercourſe between them; and that the Carthaginians were deficient in thoſe ſciences for which the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024085_0073_0FC31DB0D26B9768"/>
Romans were famous. Among the Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Carthaginians, the ſtudy and knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of their youth were confined to writing, arithmetic and mercantile accounts; whilſt polite literature, hiſtory and philoſophy were in little repute; and by a law of Carthage, the ſtudy of the Greek language was prohib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited; leſt any communication ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with their enemies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin's Ancient Hiſtory, book II. part I. ſect. 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A third reaſon was the opinion which the wiſeſt men among the Romans had formed, and to which they obſtinately adhered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the five zones, and the impoſſibility of paſſing from one hemiſphere to the other, becauſe of the torrid zone lying between. This doctrine of the zones is ſo fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Dr. Robertſon<note n="†" place="bottom">Robertſon's America, vol. I, note 8.</note> that I need only refer the reader to what he has written on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the doubts and the infidelity of the Roman Philoſophers, and the great deference paid to them by this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cautious inquirer; there is one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which has <hi>almoſt</hi> convinced him of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:024085_0074_0FC31DB41F4FF9D8"/>
the reality of Necho's voyage, as related by Herodotus. It is this, that the Phenicians, in ſailing round Africa, "had the ſun on their right hand;" which Herodotus, with his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al modeſty and candor ſays, "with me has no credit, though it may with others." On this the Doctor judiciouſly remarks, "The ſcience of aſtronomy was in that early period ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, that it was by experience only, that the Phenicians could come at the knowledge of this fact; they durſt not, without this, have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to aſſert what would have appeared to be an improbable fiction."<note n="*" place="bottom">Robertſon's India, note 54.</note> Indeed if they had not known it by experience, there is not the leaſt conceivable reaſon for their invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a report; nor even for the entrance of ſuch an idea into their imagination. The modeſt doubt of Herodotus is another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of the truth and genuineneſs of it; for as he had no experience to guide him, and the idea was new, it was very prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for him to heſitate in admitting it, though he ſhowed his impartiality by inſerting it in his relation.</p>
            <p>So much for the voyage performed by the Phenicians under the orders of Necho, which
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:024085_0075_0FC31DB515F4A6B8"/>
is the <hi>firſt</hi> proof produced by Herodotus of his poſition that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Libya is ſurrounded by the ſea, except where it joins Aſia."</p>
            <p>His <hi>ſecond</hi> proof is not ſo concluſive, nor the deſign of his introducing it ſo obvious. It is the relation of a voyage undertaken by Sataſpes a Perſian, whoſe puniſhment was commuted from crucifixion to ſailing round Libya; which voyage he began, but returned by the ſame route, not having completed it. The reaſon which he gave for returning was, that "his ſhip was ſtopped and could ſail no farther," which his ſovereign did not believe, and therefore put him to death, to which he had before been condemned.</p>
            <p>The only evidence which this ſtory can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford is, that the circumnavigation of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican continent was, at that time, thought practicable. Sataſpes thought ſo, or he would not have propoſed it to his ſovereign; and Xerxes thought ſo, or he would not have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed the ſtory of the ſhip being ſtopped; by which expreſſion was meant that the ſea was no farther navigable, by reaſon of land.</p>
            <p>The exact date of this voyage is not aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; but as Xerxes reigned twelve years,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:024085_0076_0FC31DB9A037B610"/>
and died in the year 473 before Chriſt, it could not have been much more than thirty years, preceding the time when Herodotus publiſhed his hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The voyage of Hanno the Carthaginian, is thus briefly mentioned by Pliny. "In the flouriſhing ſtate of Carthage, Hanno having ſailed round from Gades [Cadiz] to the bord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Arabia, committed to writing an account of his voyage; as did Himilco, who was at the ſame time ſent to diſcover the extreme parts of Europe."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pliny's Natural Hiſtory, lib. 2, cap. 67.</note> The character of Pliny, as a hiſtorian is, that "he collected from all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, good and bad, who had written before him; and that his work is a mixture of truth and error, which it is difficult to ſeparate." An inſtance in confirmation of this remark occurs in this very chapter; where he ſpeaks of ſome merchants, ſailing from India, and thrown by a tempeſt, on the coaſt of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He alſo mentions a voyage, made by Eudoxus; from the Arabian gulf to Gades, and another of Coelius Antipater from Spain to Ethiopia.</p>
            <p>Of theſe voyages, that of Hanno is beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated. He ſailed from Carthage with
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024085_0077_0FC31DC0EC51AC30"/>
ſixty gallies, each carrying fifty oars, having on board thirty thouſand men and women, with proviſions and articles of traffic. The deſign of this equipment was to plant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies along the weſtern ſhore of Africa, which the Carthaginians, from priority of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and from its contiguity to their territory, conſidered as their own dominion. Hanno was abſent five years, on this colonizing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; but there is no <hi>certainty</hi> of his having proceeded any farther ſouthward, than the Bay of Benin, in the eighth degree of north latitude. A fragment of his journal, which at his return he depoſited in the temple of Saturn, at Carthage, is now extant; and though it has been treated as fabulous by ſeveral authors, ancient and modern, yet its authenticity has been vindicated by M. Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainville, in the 26th volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Inſcriptions and Belles Lettres; where a French tranſlation of it is given from the Greek, into which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage it was rendered from the original Punic.</p>
            <p>Concerning the voyage of Eudoxus, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing account is given by Bruce.<note n="*" place="bottom">Travels, book II. chap. V. The voyage of Eudoxus was originally written by <hi>Poſidonius,</hi> but I have not met with that author.</note> He was
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024085_0078_0FC31DC2989E0C38"/>
ſent by Ptolemy Euergetes, as an ambaſſador to India, to remove the bad effects of the King's conduct in the beginning of his reign, who had extorted contributions from mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of that and other trading countries. Eudoxus returned after the King's death, and was wrecked on the coaſt of Ethiopia; where he diſcovered the prow of a ſhip, which had ſuffered the ſame fate. It was the figure of a horſe, and the ſailors, who had been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in European voyages, knew this to have been part of one of thoſe veſſels, which traded on the Atlantic ocean; of which trade Gades was the principal port. This circumſtance amounted to a proof, that there was a paſſage round Africa, from the Indian to the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ocean. The diſcovery was of no greater importance to any perſon, than to Eudoxus himſelf; for, ſome time afterward, falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the diſpleaſure of Ptolemy Lathyrus, and being in danger of his life, he fled; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking on the Red Sea, ſailed round Africa and came to Gades.</p>
            <p>This voyage of Eudoxus was treated as a fable by Strabo, the Roman geographer, who wrote about a century and a half after the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024085_0079_0FC31DC41C0EC128"/>
time when it is ſaid to have been performed. The true cauſe of the incredulity of him and of other Roman authors in reſpect to theſe voyages and diſcoveries, was the doctrine of the zones, to which they inflexibly adhered, and which effectually precluded all convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the evidences which I have had opportunity to examine reſpecting the queſtion of the circumnavigation of Africa,<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. FORSTER, in his hiſtory of Voyages and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries (chap.

               <hi>DISSERTATION</hi> II. AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRETENSIONS OF MARTIN BEHAIM, TO A DISCOVERY OF AMERICA, PRIOR TO THAT OF CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOPHER COLUMBUS.</head>
            <p>SO much has already been well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on this ſubject by Dr. ROBERTSON, that I ſhould not have thought of adding any thing to it; had not a Memoir appeared in the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond volume of the Tranſactions of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Philoſophical Society<note n="*" place="bottom">No. 35, p. 263.</note> at Philadelphia, in which the pretenſions of Behaim are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by M. OTTO; who has produced ſome authorities which he had obtained from Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg, an imperial city of Germany, and which appear to him, "to eſtabliſh in the cleareſt manner a diſcovery of America ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of Columbus."</p>
            <p>It is conceded that Behaim was a man of learning and enterpriſe; that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024085_0084_0FC31DDF228474D0"/>
with Columbus and was his friend; that he purſued the ſame ſtudies and drew the ſame concluſions; that he was employed by King John II. in making diſcoveries; and, that he met with deſerved honour for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices which he rendered to the Crown of Portugal. But, there are ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties attending the ſtory of his diſcovering America, as appear to me inſuperable. Theſe I ſhall ſtate; together with ſome remarks on the authorities produced by M. Otto.</p>
            <p>The firſt of his authorities contains ſeveral aſſertions which are contradicted by other hiſtories;<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoirs of Philip de Comines. Mezeray's and Henault's hiſtory of France. Collier's Dictionary.</note> (1) That Iſabella, daughter of John, King of Portugal, reigned after the death of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, ſurnamed the Good. (2) That to this lady, when regent of the Dutchy of Burgundy and Flanders, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haim paid a viſit in 1459, and (3) that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed her of his deſigns, he procured a veſſel in which he made the diſcovery of the iſland of Fayal, in 1460.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:024085_0085_0FC31DE712A36878"/>It is true that Philip, Duke of Burgundy and Flanders, ſurnamed the Good, married Iſabella the daughter of John I. King of Portugal; but Philip did not die till 1467, and was immediately ſucceeded by his ſon Charles, ſurnamed the Bold, then thirty-four years of age. There could therefore have been no interregnum, nor female regent after the death of Philip; and if there had been, the time of Behaim's viſit will not correſpond with it; that being placed in 1459, eight years before the death of Philip. Such a miſtake, in point of fact, and of chronology, is ſufficient to induce a ſuſpicion that the "ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives of Nuremberg" are too deficient in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy to be depended on as authorities.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the diſcovery of Fayal, in 1460, M. Otto acknowledges that it is "con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the received opinion;" and well he might; for the firſt of the Azores, St. Maria was diſcovered in 1431; the ſecond, St. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael in 1444; the third, Terceira in 1445; and before 1449, the iſlands, St. George, Gracioſa, Fayal and Pico, were known to the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024085_0086_0FC31DEC94755DA0"/>
Portugueſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Forſter's hiſtory of voyages and diſcoveries, p. 256, 257, Dublin edition.</note> However true it may be that Behaim ſettled in the iſland of Fayal, and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there twenty years; yet his claim to the diſcovery of it muſt have a better foundation than the "archives of Nuremberg," before it can be admitted.</p>
            <p>The genuine account of the ſettlement of Fayal, and the intereſt which Behaim had in it, is thus related by Dr. Forſter, a German author of much learning and good credit.</p>
            <p>"After the death of the infant Don Henry [which happened in 1463,] the iſland of Fayal was made a preſent of by [his ſiſter] Iſabella, Dutcheſs of Burgundy, to Jobſt von Hurter, a native of Nuremberg. Hurter went in 1466, with a colony of more than 2000 Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of both ſexes, to his property, the iſle of Fayal. The Dutcheſs had provided the Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh emigrants with all neceſſaries for two years, and the colony ſoon increaſed. About the year 1486, Martin Behaim married a daught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Chevalier Jobſt von Hurter, and had a ſon by her named Martin.—Jobſt von Hurter, and Martin Behaim, both natives
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024085_0087_0FC31DEE32C27DD8"/>
of Nuremberg, were Lords of Fayal and Pico."<note n="*" place="bottom">Forſter's hiſtory of voyages, and diſcoveries, p. 257, 258, 259.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The date of the ſuppoſed diſcovery of America, by Behaim, is placed by M. Otto, in 1484, eight years before the celebrated voyage of Columbus. In the ſame year we are told<note n="†" place="bottom">Garcilaſſo de la Vega's Royal commentaries. Preface. Purchas. vol. V. p. 1454.</note> that Alonzo Sanchez de Huelva was driven by a ſtorm to the weſtward for twenty-nine days; and ſaw an iſland, of which at his return he gave information to Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus; from both theſe ſuppoſed diſcoveries this concluſion is drawn, "That Columbus would never have thought of his expedition to America, had not Behaim gone there before him." Whether it be ſuppoſed that Behaim and Sanchez ſailed in the ſame ſhip, or that they made a diſcovery of two different parts of America, in the ſame year, it is not eaſy to underſtand from the authorities produced; but what deſtroys the credibility of this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible tale, is, that Columbus had formed his theory, and projected his voyage, at leaſt ten years before; as appears by his correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024085_0088_0FC31DFDC5A38AE0"/>
with Paul, a learned phyſician of Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which bears date in 1474.<note n="*" place="bottom">Life, chap. viii.</note> It is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at what time Columbus firſt made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the King of Portugal, to fit him out for a weſtern voyage; but it is certain that after a negociation with him on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and after he had found out the ſecret and unſucceſsful attempt which had been made to anticipate a diſcovery; he quitted that kingdom in diſguſt, and went into Spain, in the latter end of the year 1484.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. chap. xii.</note> The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe facts is unqueſtioned; and from them it fully appears, that a prior diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of America, by Behaim or Sanchez, made in 1484, could not have been the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the enterpriſe of Columbus.</p>
            <p>M. Otto ſpeaks of letters written by Behaim in 1486, in the German language, and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the "archives of Nuremberg" which ſupport this claim to a prior diſcovery. As theſe letters are not produced, no certain opinion can be formed concerning them; but from the date of the letters, and from the voyages which Behaim actually performed in
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024085_0089_0FC31DFEEABD0270"/>
the two preceding years, we may with great probability ſuppoſe, that they related to the diſcovery of CONGO, in Africa; to which Behaim has an uncontroverted claim.</p>
            <p>I will now ſtate the facts relative to this event, partly from the authorities cited by M. Otto; and partly from others.</p>
            <p>Dr. Robertſon places the diſcovery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go and Benin in 1483, and with him Dr. Forſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agrees. The authors of the modern uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal hiſtory<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. XVI. p. 133, 135.</note> ſpeak of two voyages to that coaſt, the firſt in 1484; the ſecond in 1485; both of which were made by Diego Cam,<note n="†" place="bottom">Diego is the Spaniſh name of James, in Latin Jacobus. and in Portugueſe, Jago. Cam is in Latin, Camus or Canus, and in Spaniſh, Cano; theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent names are found in different authors.</note> who is ſaid to have been one of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert ſailors and of an enterpriſing genius. From the chronicle of Hartman Schedl, as quoted by M. Otto, we are informed, that Behaim ſailed with Cam, in theſe voyages, which are deſcribed in the following terms. "Theſe two, by the bounty of heaven, coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the ſouthern ocean, and having croſſed the equator, got into the other hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſphere;
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:024085_0090_0FC31E00224BBD48"/>
where, <hi>facing to the eaſtward,</hi> their ſhadows projected toward the ſouth, and right hand." No words could be more completely deſcriptive of a voyage from Portugal to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, as any perſon may be ſatisfied by inſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a map of Africa; but how could M. Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to imagine that the diſcovery of America was accompliſhed in ſuch a voyage as this? "Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed this cruize (continues Schedl) in the ſpace of 26 months, they returned to Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, with the loſs of many of their ſeamen, by the violence of the climate." This latter circumſtance alſo agrees very well with the climate of the African coaſt;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Brooks's Gazetteer, <hi>Benin.</hi>
               </note> but Schedl ſays not a word of the diſcovery of America.</p>
            <p>M. Otto goes on to tell us "that the moſt poſitive proof of the great ſervices rendered to the crown of Portugal by Behaim, is the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompenſe beſtowed on him by King John II; who in the moſt ſolemn manner, knighted him, in the preſence of all his court." Then follows a particular detail of the ceremony of inſtallation, as performed on the 18th of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1485, and M. Otto fairly owns that this was "a reward for the diſcovery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go."
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:024085_0091_0FC31E019CFF4F30"/>
Now let us bring the detached parts of the ſtory together.</p>
            <p>Behaim was knighted on the 18th of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1485, for the diſcovery of Congo, in which he had been employed 26 months pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding; having within that time made two voyages thither in company with Diego Cam. It will follow then that the whole of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding years, 1484 and 1483 were taken up in theſe two voyages. This agrees very well with the accounts of the diſcovery of Congo, in Robertſon and Forſter, and does not diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the modern univerſal hiſtory, as far as the year 1484 is concerned; which unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately is the year aſſigned for Behaim's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of "that part of America called Braſil, and his ſailing even to the Straights of Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan."</p>
            <p>The only thing in M. Otto's memoir which bears any reſemblance to a ſolution of this difficulty is this. "We may ſuppoſe that Behaim, engaged in an expedition to Congo, was driven by the winds to Fernambouc, and from thence by the currents toward the coaſt of Guiana." But ſuppoſitions without proof will avail little; and ſuppoſitions againſt
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024085_0092_0FC31E103A936068"/>
proof will avail nothing. The two voyages to Congo are admitted. The courſe is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed; and the time is determined; and both theſe are directly oppoſed to the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his being driven by winds and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to America. For if he had been driven out of his courſe and had ſpent "ſeveral years in examining the American iſlands, and diſcovering the ſtraight which bears the name of Magellan;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoirs, p. 269.</note> and if one of thoſe years was the year 148<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, then he could not have ſpent 26 months preceding February, 1485, in the diſcovery of Congo; but of this we have full and ſatisfactory evidence; the diſcovery of America therefore muſt be given up.</p>
            <p>There is one thing further in this memoir which deſerves a particular remark, and that is the reaſon aſſigned by M. Otto, for which the King of Portugal declined the propoſal of Columbus to ſail to India by the weſt. "The refuſal of John II. is a proof of the knowledge which that politic prince had <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> procured, of the exiſtence of a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, which offered him only barren lands,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024085_0093_0FC31E120E4E9518"/>
inhabited by unconquerable ſavages."<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoirs, p. 276.</note> This knowledge is ſuppoſed to have been derived from the diſcoveries made by Behaim. But, not to urge again the chronological difficulty with which this conjecture is embarraſſed, I will take notice of two circumſtances in the life of Columbus, which militate with this idea. The firſt is, that when Columbus had propoſed a weſtern voyage to King John, and he declined it, "The King by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of one Doctor Calzadilla, reſolved to ſend a caravel privately, to attempt that which Columbus had propoſed to him; becauſe in caſe thoſe countries were ſo diſcovered, he thought himſelf not obliged to beſtow any great reward. Having ſpeedily equipped a caravel, which was to carry ſupplies to the iſlands of Cabo Verde, he ſent it that way which the admiral propoſed to go. But thoſe whom he ſent wanted the knowledge, conſtancy and ſpirit of the admiral. After wandering many days upon the ſea, they turned back to the iſlands of Cabo Verde, laughing at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and ſaying it was <hi>impoſſible there ſhould be any land in thoſe ſeas.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, chap. xi.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:024085_0094_0FC31E13A7FE6358"/>Afterward "the King being ſenſible how faulty they were whom he had ſent with the caravel, had a mind to reſtore the admiral to his favour, and deſired that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the diſcourſe of his enterprize; but not being ſo diligent to put this in execution as the admiral was in getting away, he loſt that good opportunity; the admiral, about the end of the year 1484, ſtole away privately out of Portugal for fear of being ſtopped by the King."<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, chap. xii.</note> This account does not agree with the ſuppoſition of a prior diſcovery.</p>
            <p>The other circumſtance is an interview which Columbus had with the people of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, and the King of Portugal, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his firſt voyage. For it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Columbus on his return was by ſtreſs of weather obliged to take ſhelter in the port of Liſbon; and as ſoon as it was known that he had come from the Indies, "the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thronged to ſee the natives whom he had brought and hear the news; ſo that the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel would not contain them. Some of them praiſing God for ſo great a happineſs; others ſtorming <hi>that they had loſt the diſcovery through their King's incredulity.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:024085_0095_0FC31E2328EA3E40"/>When the King ſent for Columbus, "he was doubtful what to do; but to take off all ſuſpicion that he came <hi>from his conqueſts,</hi> he conſented." At the interview, "the King offered him all that he ſtood in need of for the ſervice of their Catholic Majeſties, though he thought, that foraſmuch <hi>as he had been a captain in Portugal,</hi> that conqueſt belonged to him. To which the admiral anſwered, that he knew of no ſuch agreement, and that he had ſtrictly obſerved his orders, which were <hi>not to go to the mines of Portugal,</hi> [the gold coaſt] nor to Guinea."<note n="*" place="bottom">Life, chap. xli.</note> Had John II. heard of Behaim's voyage to a weſtern continent, would he not have claimed it by priority of diſcovery rather than by the commiſſion which Columbus had formerly borne in his ſervice? Had ſuch a prior diſcovery been made, could it have been concealed from the people of Liſbon? And would they have been angry that their King had loſt it by his incredulity? Theſe circumſtances appear to me to carry ſufficient evidence, that <hi>no</hi> diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of America prior to that of Columbus had come to the knowledge of the King of Portugal.</p>

               <pb n="98" facs="unknown:024085_0096_0FC31E290D1428E8"/>In anſwer to the queſtion "Why are we ſearching the archives of an imperial city for the cauſes of an event, which took place in the weſtern extremity of Europe?" M. Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gives us to underſtand, that "from the fourteenth to the ſixteenth centuries, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were the beſt geographers, the beſt hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians and the moſt enlightened politicians." Not to detract from the merit of the German literati of thoſe ages, I think we may give equal credit to a learned German author of the preſent age, Dr. John Reinhold Forſter; who appears to have a thorough underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the claims not only of his own country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but of others. In his indefatigable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches into the diſcoveries which have been made by all nations, though he has given due credit to the adventures of Behaim in Congo and Fayal, yet he has not ſaid one word of his viſiting America; which he certainly would have done if in his opinion there had been any foundation for it.</p>
            <p>He has indeed given us a long detail, with much reaſoning, on a diſcovery made in the 11th century by the Normans, of a country called <hi>Winland</hi>; which he ſuppoſes to be the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:024085_0097_0FC31E2A2969E5F0"/>
iſland of Newfoundland; but neither he nor any other writer pretends that the knowledge of this diſcovery was ever communicated to Columbus. That great man therefore, is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entitled to the honour of an original diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of America.</p>

                        <p>I AM very glad to hear of the familiarity you have with your moſt ſerene and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent King; and though I have very often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed concerning the <hi>ſhort</hi> way there is from hence to the Indies where the ſpice is produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſea, which I look upon to be ſhorter than that you take by the coaſt of Guinea; yet you now tell me that his highneſs would have me make out and demonſtrate it, ſo as it may be underſtood and put in practice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though I could better ſhow it him with a globe in my hand, and make him ſenſible of the figure of the world; yet I have reſolved to render it more eaſy and intelligible, to ſhow this way upon a chart, ſuch as are uſed in navigation; and therefore I ſend one to his majeſty, made and drawn with my own hand; wherein is ſet down the utmoſt bounds of the weſt, from Ireland in the north, to the fartheſt part of Guinea, with all the iſlands that lie in the way. Oppoſite to which weſtern coaſt is deſcribed the beginning of the Indies, with the iſlands and places whither you may go, and how far you may bend from the north pole
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:024085_0100_0FC318BBF9B68940"/>
toward the equinoctial, and for how long a time; that is, how many leagues you may ſail, before you come to thoſe places moſt fruitful in all ſorts of ſpice, jewels and precious ſtones. Do not wonder if I term that country where the ſpice grows <hi>weſt,</hi> that product being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſcribed to the eaſt; becauſe thoſe who ſhall ſail weſtward will always find thoſe places in the weſt; and th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> that travel by land eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will ever find thoſe places in the eaſt. The ſtrait lines that lie lengthways in the chart, ſhew the diſtance there is from weſt to eaſt; the others croſs them, ſhew the diſtance from north to ſouth. I have alſo marked down in the ſaid chart, ſeveral places in India, where ſhips might put in, upon any ſtorm or contrary winds, or any other accident unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.</p>
                        <p>Moreover to give you full information of all thoſe places which you are very deſirous to know; you muſt underſtand, that none but traders live or reſide in all thoſe iſlands, and that there is as great a number of ſhips and ſeafaring people with merchandiſe, as in any other part of the world; particularly in a moſt noble port called <hi>Zacton,</hi> where there
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:024085_0101_0FC318BD20FEF1F8"/>
are every year a hundred large ſhips of pepper loaded and unloaded, beſides many other ſhips that take in other ſpice.</p>
                        <p>This country is mighty populous, and there are many provinces and kingdoms, and innumerable cities under the dominion of a prince called the great <hi>Kham,</hi> which name ſignifies King of Kings, who for the moſt part reſides in the Province of <hi>Cathay.</hi> His pred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eceſſors were very deſirous to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and be in amity with Chriſtians; and 200 years ſince, ſent ambaſſadors to the Pope; deſiring him to ſend them many learned men and doctors to teach them our faith; but by reaſon of ſome obſtacles the ambaſſadors met with, they returned back, without coming to Rome.</p>
                        <p>Beſides, there came an ambaſſador to Pope Eugenius IV. who told him the great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there was between thoſe princes, their people and the Chriſtians. I diſcourſed with him a long while upon the ſeveral matters of the grandeur of their royal ſtructures, and of the greatneſs, length and breadth of their riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. He told me many wonderful things of the multitude of towns and cities founded
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024085_0102_0FC318BEA4B8E8D0"/>
along the banks of the rivers; and that there were 200 cities upon one river only, with marble bridges over it, of a great length and breadth, and adorned with abundance of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. This country deſerves as well as any other to be diſcovered; and there may not only be great profit made there, and many things of value found, but alſo gold, ſilver, all ſorts of precious ſtones, and ſpices in abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which are not brought into our parts. And it is certain, that many wiſe men, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, aſtrologers, and other perſons ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in all arts, and very ingenious, govern that mighty province, and command their armies.</p>
                        <p>From Liſbon directly weſtward, there are in the chart 26 ſpaces, each of which contains 250 miles, to the moſt noble and vaſt city of <hi>Quiſay,</hi> which is 100 miles in compaſs, that is 35 leagues; in it there are ten marble bridges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the name ſignifies a heavenly city; of which, wonderful things are reported, as to the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the people, the buildings and the rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enues. This ſpace abovementioned is almoſt the third part of the globe. This city is in the province of Mango, bordering on that of Cathay, where the King for the moſt part reſides.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="106" facs="unknown:024085_0103_0FC318C018A74398"/>From the iſland <hi>Antilla,</hi> which you call the ſeven cities, and <hi>of which you have ſome knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge,</hi> to the moſt noble iſland of <hi>Cipango</hi> are ten ſpaces, which make 2500 miles, or 225 leagues; which iſland abounds in gold, pearls and precious ſtones; and you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they cover their temples and palaces with plates of pure gold. So that for want of knowing the way, all theſe things are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and concealed, and yet may be gone to with ſafety.</p>
                        <p>Much more might be ſaid, but having told you what is moſt material, and you being wiſe and judicious, I am ſatisfied there is nothing of it, but what you underſtand, and therefore I will not be more prolix.

                  <p>I am glad it is well underſtood, and that the voyage laid down is not only poſſible, but true, certain, honourable, very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moſt glorious among all Chriſtians. You cannot be perfect in the knowledge of it, but by experience and practice, as I have had in great meaſure, and by the ſolid and true information of worthy and wiſe men, who are come from thoſe parts to this court of Rome; and from merchants who have traded long in thoſe parts, and are perſons of good reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that when the ſaid voyage is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it will be to powerful kingdoms, and to the moſt noble cities and provinces; rich and abounding in all things we ſtand in need of, particularly in all ſorts of ſpice in great quantities, and ſtore of jewels.</p>

               <hi>DISSERTATION</hi> III. ON THE QUESTION, WHETHER THE HON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EY BEE IS A NATIVE OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>MR. JEFFERSON, in his notes on Virginia, has ſaid, that "the honey bee is <hi>not</hi> a native of our continent. The Indians concur with us in the tradition that it was brought from Europe, but when, and by whom we know not. The bees have generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themſelves into the country, a little in advance of the white ſettlers, The Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans therefore call them the white man's fly; and conſider their approach as indicating the approach of the ſettlement of the whites." He allows that "in Braſil there is a ſpecies of honey bee, without a ſting, but that it is very different from the one we have, which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembles that of Europe." The facts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by this reſpectable author are true; but they will not warrant his concluſion that "the honey bee, meaning the one reſembling that of Europe, is not a native of our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent."<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 79, American Edition. 121. Engliſh.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:024085_0114_0FC318F0D6DD6C90"/>There is one circumſtance in the hiſtory of Columbus, which proves that bees were known in the iſlands of the Weſt-Indies, at the time of his diſcovery. When on his firſt return to Europe he was in danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſea, he wrote an account of his diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery on parchment, which he encloſed in <hi>a cake of wax,</hi> and put into a tight caſk, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the whole to the ſea, in hope of its being driven on ſhore or taken up. This wax was procured in the iſland of Hiſpaniola<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Life, chap. xxx.</note> which he had viſited, and it was one of the firſt fruits of his diſcovery.</p>
            <p>The indefatigable Purchas gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the revenues of the empire of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico, before the arrival of the Spaniards, as deſcribed in its annals; which were pictures drawn on cotton cloth. Among other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles he exhibits the figures of covered pots, with two handles, which are ſaid to be pots of "bees honie."<note n="†" place="bottom">Purchas, vol. IV.</note> Of theſe pots, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred are depicted in one tribute-roll, and one hundred in ſeveral others.</p>
            <p>This account is confirmed by a late hiſtory of Mexico, written by the Abbe Clavigero, a native of Vera Cruz, who from a reſidence of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:024085_0115_0FC318F2536535C0"/>
thirty-ſix years in Mexico, and a minute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the natural hiſtory and antiquities of his country muſt be ſuppoſed to be well informed, and competent to give a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. He tells us, that a part of every uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful production of nature or art was paid in tribute to the Kings of Mexico; and among other articles of revenue he reckons "600 cups of honey" paid annually by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſouthern parts of the empire.<note n="*" place="bottom">Book VII, p. 351, 4 to edit.</note> He alſo ſays, "that though they extracted a great quantity of wax from the honey comb; they either did not know how, or were not at the pains to make lights of it."</p>
            <p>In his enumeration of the inſects of Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico, he reckons ſix different kinds of bees which make honey,<note n="†" place="bottom">Book I, p. 68.</note> four of which have no ſtings, and of the other two which have ſtings, one "agrees with the common bee of Europe, not only in ſize, ſhape and colour; but alſo in its diſpoſition and manners, and in the qualities of its honey and wax."</p>
            <p>In the account given by Purchas, of the travels of Ferdinando de Soto, in Florida, it is obſerved, that when he came to Chiaha,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024085_0116_0FC3190082E0D8D0"/>
which by the deſcription was on one of the upper branches of the Mobille, [now in the ſtate of Georgia] he found among the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the natives "a pot full of honie of bees."<note n="*" place="bottom">Purchas, vol. V. p. 1539.</note> This was A. D. 1540, when there were no Europeans ſettled on the continent of America, but in Mexico and Peru.</p>
            <p>From theſe authorities it is evident that honey bees were known in Mexico and the iſlands, before the arrival of the Europeans; and that they had extended as far northward as Florida, a country ſo denominated from the numberleſs flowers, which grow there in wild luxuriance and afford a plenty of food, for this uſeful tribe of inſects. The inference is, that bees were not imported by the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards; for however fond they might be of honey as an article of food, or of wax to make tapers for common uſe, or for the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their churches; yet as bees were known to be in the country, there could be no need of importing them. The report of honey and wax being found in the iſlands, in Mexico, and in Florida, had reached Europe and had been publiſhed there long before any emigrations were made to the northward; if
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024085_0117_0FC31901A5E79918"/>
therefore if theſe had been conſidered as articles of ſubſiſtence or of commerce; the ſanguine ſpirit of the <hi>firſt</hi> adventurers would have rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er led them to think of <hi>finding</hi> them in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, than of tranſporting bees from Europe to make them.</p>
            <p>As to the circumſtance of the bees "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves a little in advance of the white ſettlers," it cannot be conſidered as a concluſive argument in favour of their having been firſt brought from Europe. It is well known, that where land is cultivated, bees find a greater plenty of food than in the foreſt. The bloſſoms of fruit trees, of graſſes and grain, particularly clover and buck wheat, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them a rich and plentiful repaſt; and they are ſeen in vaſt numbers in our fields and orchards at the ſeaſon of thoſe bloſſoms. They therefore delight in the neighbourhood of "the white ſettlers," and are able to increaſe in numbers, as well as to augment their quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſtores, by availing themſelves of the labour of man. May it not be from this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that the Indians have given them the name of "the white man's fly;" and that they "conſider their approach (or frequent
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024085_0118_0FC319034A5E24F0"/>
appearance) as indicating the approach of the ſettlement of the whites?"</p>
            <p>The firſt European ſettlement in Virginia was made about ſeventy years after the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Soto, in Florida, and the firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in New England was ten years poſterior to that in Virginia. The large intermediate country was uncultivated for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. The ſouthern bees therefore could have no inducement, to extend themſelves very far to the northward, for many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſettlements were begun; and within that time bees were imported from Europe.</p>
            <p>That honey and wax were not known to the Indians of New England is evident from this, that they had no words in their language for them. When Mr. ELIOT tranſlated the bible into the Indian language, wherever theſe terms occurred, he uſed the Engliſh words, though ſometimes with an Indian termination.</p>
            <p>Joſſelyn, who viſited New England firſt in 1638, and afterward in 1663, and wrote an account of his voyages with ſome ſketches of natural hiſtory in 1673, ſpeaks of the honey bee in theſe words, "The honey bees are
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024085_0119_0FC3190A5788DF30"/>
carried over by the Engliſh, and thrive there exceedingly."<note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage to New England, p. 120.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There is a tradition in New England, that the perſon who firſt brought a hive of bees into the country was rewarded with a grant of land; but the perſon's name, or the place where the land lay, or by whom the grant was made, I have not been able to learn.</p>
            <p>It appears then, that the honey bee <hi>is</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of America, and that its productions were found by the firſt European viſitors as far northward as Florida and Georgia. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo true that bees were imported from Europe into New England, and probably into Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; but whether, if this importation had not taken place, the bees of the ſouthern parts would not have extended themſelves norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or whether thoſe which we now have are not a mixture of native and imported bees, cannot be determined. It is however certain that they have multiplied exceedingly, and that they are frequently found in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in a wild ſtate, in the trunks of hollow trees, as far northward as cultivation and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements have extended, which is nearly to the forty-fifth degree of latitude.</p>

               <hi>DISSERTATION</hi> IV. ON THE COLOUR OF THE NATIVE AMERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CANS, AND THE RECENT POPULATION OF THIS CONTINENT.</head>
            <p>IT has been queried, "if the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Africans and the Eaſt Indians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the torrid zone, be the effect of climate; why are not the original natives of America, within the ſame latitudes equally black?"<note n="*" place="bottom">American Muſeum, 1790—p. 78.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That the blackneſs mentioned is the effect of climate is generally admitted by philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers. Their meaning is, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat of the climate, in a long ſeries of time, produces this effect. The heat of a country depends not only on its proximity to the equator; but on its particular and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſituation. A plain is hotter than a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a continent is hotter than an iſland, and one ſide of a continent is hotter than the other. Though almoſt all the countries and iſlands of Aſia and Africa, between the tropics, have black inhabitants; yet there is a diverſity in
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024085_0122_0FC3191AF3A95780"/>
the ſhades of their ſable hue, as well as in the form of their hair. The criſped woolly head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inhabitants of the weſtern coaſt of Africa, are ſaid to be the blackeſt of mankind, becauſe that country, from its peculiar ſituation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and retains a greater degree of heat than any other part of the globe; the eaſterly winds which paſs over that continent being extremely heated in their paſſage. The ſame wind (which at ſea is called the trade wind) is cooled in paſſing over the Atlantic. The eaſtern parts of South America are much cooler than the oppoſite coaſt of Africa, in the ſame latitude; and the natives of Guiana and Braſil are of a brown colour. Between Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil and Peru are ſituate thoſe lofty mountains, the Andes; which again arreſt and cool the eaſterly wind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before it reaches the weſtern coaſt of America; and, the inhabitants of Peru are of a lighter colour than thoſe of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil. Mexico is in the ſame latitude with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal and Gambia; the inhabitants of the two latter countries are black, whilſt thoſe of the former are of an olive complexion, which is ſuppoſed to have been the original colour of the human ſpecies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:024085_0123_0FC3191D0DF351D0"/>This account is conformable to that given by the celebrated naturaliſt, Buffon; but he has alſo formed an opinion, which, if it were admitted, might ſolve the queſtion in another way. He conjectures that America is "of a much more recent exiſtence" than the old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; that it muſt have remained buried under the waters of the ſea much longer; and has but lately emerged from the waves. In illuſtration of this conjecture he aſks, "if this continent be really as ancient as the other, why did ſo few men exiſt on it? Why were thoſe few ſavage and diſperſed? Why did the inhabitants of Mexico and Peru, (the only ones which had the ſmalleſt degree of ſociety) reckon only two or three hundred years from the time that they were firſt aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?" He might have gone on with his queries thus—Why are not the inhabitants of the torrid zone in America, of as dark a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion as thoſe of the Aſian iſlands, and the eaſtern ſide of the African continent? For it is well known, that <hi>length of time</hi> as well as <hi>heat of climate,</hi> is neceſſary to produce any great and permanent change in the human colour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:024085_0124_0FC3192123229930"/>This conjecture of the late emerſion of the American continent from the waters of the ocean, advanced by Buffon, De Paw, and other European theoriſts, appears to me at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an inſuperable difficulty. For whilſt buried in the water it muſt either have been ſunk below, or the water muſt have been raiſed above the preſent level of the continent. On the former ſuppoſition, there muſt have been ſome mighty convulſion of nature, and of very long continuance; to raiſe ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe a bulk from the bottom of the ocean to its preſent elevation; and the water which covered it muſt have been ſo driven back on all ſides, as to have made great encroachments on the ſhores of the other continent and iſlands of the globe. Or, on the latter ſuppoſition, that the water was raiſed above the preſent level of America, it would have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for that element to preſerve its equilib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, according to the laws of hydroſtatics, without at the ſame time overwhelming the ancient continent. This difficulty renders the conjecture inadmiſſible, without ſome hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical proof of the exiſtence of theſe effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:024085_0125_0FC319226CD43DF8"/>But, though the antiquity of America be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed equal to the reſt of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is poſſible that its <hi>population</hi> may be more recent. It is very certain that the annals of Mexico and Peru extended back but a few centuries pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the Spaniſh invaſion. If we are to believe them, Manco Capac, the founder of the Peruvian monarchy, was contemporary with Henry II. of England, in the twelfth century; and the Mexican empire was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the fourteenth. The moſt elaborate inveſtigation of the late hiſtorian Clavigero, carries the <hi>firſt</hi> population of Mexico by the Toltecas, no further back than the ſeventh century of the Chriſtian Aera. Beyond that, they had no tradition, excepting that their anceſtors came from the north weſt.</p>
            <p>If any analogy can be drawn from the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs which the ancient Aſſyrians and Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians made from a rude to a civilized ſtate; that is, to the ſame degree of improvement which the Mexicans and Peruvians had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; there could not have intervened more than four or five centuries, from their firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in America, to the appearance of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co. This calculation will bring the time of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024085_0126_0FC3192C131BE820"/>
the population of America, five or ſix centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries within the Chriſtian Aera.</p>
            <p>Since modern voyagers have diſcovered the Pacific Ocean to be full of iſlands, and thoſe iſlands full of people, many of whom are well ſkilled in navigation, the population of the weſtern parts of America, from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſhores and iſlands of Aſia is rendered more credible than ever; and if the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Peruvians came originally from the north of China or Corea, they might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring ſome degree of refinement with them, beyond what thoſe had who found their way hither from the more northern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of Tartary. If this could be aſcertained, it would greatly ſtrengthen the argument for the recent population of America, and help us to account for the difference between the inhabitants of thoſe celebrated empires, and the wild wanderers in the northern regions of this vaſt continent; which is very analagous to the difference between the people of China, and the roving Tartars in the northern foreſts of Aſia.</p>
            <p>In ſuch an inquiry, where ſo little light can be derived from hiſtory or tradition, the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:024085_0127_0FC3193124169620"/>
mind is apt to reſt, perhaps too much on cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial proofs which ſeem to favour an hypotheſis. Let this be my apology, if any be neceſſary, for introducing the following quotation from the learned Dr. Forſter.</p>
            <p>"From the year 1259 to 1294 of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Aera, reigned KUBLAI-KHAN, [Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of Tartary, whoſe reſidence was in Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay, the northern part of China, and whoſe capital was a part of the preſent city of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.] He ſent a fleet and army to Niphon, or Japan for the purpoſe of conquering that country. The ſhips compoſing his fleet were very much ſhattered by ſtorms, and it is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that ſome of them were not able to get back to Japan or China. About this period there ſprung up in America almoſt at one and the ſame time, two great empires, Mexico and Peru, which had regular inſtitutes of religion; notions of rank and ſubordinations, were in ſome meaſure civilized; were connected with each other by various kinds of aſſociation; practiſed agriculture; and in the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſtate did not allow polygamy. In Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico, they had even a kind of hieroglyphic writing, together with many other marks of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:024085_0128_0FC319386D2071C8"/>
cultivation; notwithſtanding that both theſe empires are ſurrounded on all ſides by ſavage and rude nations, very inconſiderable in point of extent, and are beſides at a diſtance from each other. All this favours the ſuppoſition, that theſe two colonies came thither by ſea, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are ſome of the people who were loſt in the expedition to Japan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their ſhips having been driven by the ſtorm to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica." <note n="*" place="bottom">Forſter's Hiſtory of Voyages and Diſcoveries, chap.
