            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A SHORT HISTORY OF A Long Travel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the Days of my Youth, when I lived at Home in my Father's Houſe, I heard many People talk of the Houſe of God; and that whoſoever did attain to get into it, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all manner of Happineſs, both in this World, and that which is to come. And a great Deſire kindled in me, if it was poſſible, to get into the Houſe; but I knew not where it was, neither did they that talk'd of it: But they had heard the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and they had reported what they had heard. There were alſo ſome Books that had been written by Men that had been in that Houſe: which Books did declare much of the Joy and Felicity they had in that Houſe: Which Books I got, and Read them over and over, which did much ſtrengthen my Belief in the Truth of the Reports; but by no means could I tell which was my Way. Yet ſo ardent were my deſires, that I thought my ſelf willing to forſake my Father's Houſe, and country and all, to Travel any where,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006656_0003_1029757D73C78610"/>wherever my Legs could carry me, ſo I might find this Houſe.</p>
            <p>And upon a Time I was breaking my Mind to a Friend of mine upon this Subject, who really told me, there were Men appointed in every Place, to Guide them that were willing to go thither; and it was their Buſineſs, and they had nothing elſe to do. When I heard this I was Comforted; and deſired him if he loved me, to bring me Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with one of theſe Men.</p>
            <p>He told me he would, which he did; and when I came to Treat with the Man, and let him know the fervent Deſire I had to get to the Houſe of God, which I had heard ſuch Excellent Things of; and that I heard he was one Appointed to Guide any thither, that were willing to go. He very readily Anſwered, and told me it was his Buſineſs to Guide any thither that were willing to go, and to perſwade Folks that were not yet willing to go; and if I would comply with his Terms, and follow him, he would lead me thither.</p>
            <p>I asked him what his Terms were; he ſaid, the Way was long, and would lead him from his Home, and I muſt bear his Charges, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over.— To all which I agreed; ſo we ſet forward on our Journey early in the Morning; but before we had gone one Days Journey, I ſaw my Guide ſometimes ſtand ſtill and look about him; and ſometimes would pull a little Book out of his Pocket, and read a little to himſelf; which made me begin to miſtruſt, that he knew the Way no better than I. However I ſaid nothing, but went on, following him ſeveral Days Journey after this manner; and the further he went the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006656_0004_1029757F0E09A4A8"/>more my Guide was at a loſt; and went ſometimes a little on, and then would look about him, and then turn another Way, and ſometimes right back again for a while, and then turn again. So my Suſpicion grew very ſtrong, and I began to be in great Anxiety of Spirit, but ſaid little to him about it.</p>
            <p>But one day as we were Travelling along, we met with a Man that took Notice of my ſad Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and tired Condition, and he ſpoke very kindly to me, <hi>Young Man, whether art thou Bound?</hi> And when I began to tell him ſomething of my Journey, he deſired me to ſit down upon the Graſs, in a ſhady Place, and Diſcourſe a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my Journey, and ſo we did, and I told him how things had gone with me to that very hour. And whilſt I was telling him the Story, my Guide fell aſleep; at which I was not ſorry, for thereby I had the more freedom to Diſcourſe with the Man; and when I had told him all, he pittied me, and withal told me, to his certain Knowledge this Guide of mine had never been at the Houſe, neither did know the way to it, but as he had got ſome marks of the way, which he had receiv'd, as I or another may do, and if I followed him all my Days, I ſhould be never the nearer to it, and ſhould find at laſt, I had ſpent my Time, Money and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe did ſo aſtoniſh me, that I was at my wits end, and did not know what Courſe to take. The Man ſeeing what an Agony I was in, began to Comfort me, and told me that the Houſe I ſought was nearer than I was aware of; and if I would forſake that Guide, and follow him, he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006656_0005_1029758212EA8B68"/>would ſoon bring me in ſight of that Houſe. Quoth he, I am one that belongs to that Houſe, and have done ſo ſeveral Years; and whereas, ſaid he, thou art to bear his Charges, and give him Money beſides, I will aſſure thee it is not the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Guides that belong to this Houſe of God to take Money for Guiding People thither, I my ſelf have been a Guide to many a one in my Time, but never took one Penny of them for it.</p>
            <p>By this time you may think within your ſelves, how my drooping Spirits were Comforted, and a new Hope ſpringing, and a Reſolution to forſake my wandering Guide, and to follow this New one.</p>
            <p>Upon which, I awaked my Guide, and told him my Mind, and Paid him what I had agreed for, And Adviſed him never to ſerve poor Soul as he had done me; for I ſee, ſaid I, thou knoweſt not the way, but as thou haſt learned in ſome Books of it. If Book-Learning would have ſerved my turn to have found this famous Houſe, I needed not thee, nor any body elſe to have guided me to it, for there are but very few that have written expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally of it; but I have Read them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but now I have met with a Man, that I judge has more experience of the way than thou haſt, and I am reſolved to go with him; and if thou wilt honeſtly confeſs thy Ignorance, and go along with us, come and welcome, one Guide will ſerve two Travellers as well as one in the way; but I could not perſwade him, ſo I left him to take his own way as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>So I ſet forward with my new Guide pretty chearfully, and he entertained me with a good deal of Diſcourſe by the way, and we went on in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006656_0006_102975851F216FC8"/>pretty ſmooths Paths, and without ſtopping, and he told me in a ſhort Time, we ſhould come in ſight of the Houſe, which made my Travel the eaſier; and he alſo told me ſomething of the Rules and Orders of the Houſe, at which I was not at all Diſcouraged; for I conſidered, God was a God of Order, and I doubted not but there was good Orders in his Houſe, to which I was willing to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>And as we were thus Travelling along, he of a ſudden ſpake to me, ſaying yonder is the Houſe; at which I was exceeding glad, for now I thought I had not ſpent my Labour in vain, and the nearer we grew to it, the more my Joy encreaſed; and when I came in view of it, I pleaſed my ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly with looking at it, and viewing the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Turrets that were upon it, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Carvings and Paintings with which it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned; and there was as much of Art in ſetting it forth, as could be imagined. Oh! thought I, if there be ſo much Glory without, ſurely there is more within, which I ſhall ſhortly be a Partaker of.</p>
            <p>And as I was thus Contemplating my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and was come within as it were a Bow ſhot of the Houſe, we were to go down into a Valley, which we did, and in the Bottom of the Valley glided a long ſmall River, and I looked about to ſee for a Bridge to go over it, but could ſee none; at which I wondered; but on we went till we came to the River ſide, then I asked my Guide where the Bridge was; truly he told me there was none, but we muſt go thro' it, and ſo muſt all that go into that Houſe.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006656_0007_102975886C82B6E0"/>I was a little troubled with my ſelf, but he told me he had been through it, and there was no Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all. With that I began to think within my ſelf, have I taken all this Pains, and ſhall give over for ſo ſmall a matter as this is; what would I have gone through when in my Father's Houſe, to attain to the Knowledge of the Houſe of God, and a Poſſeſſion therein; not Water nor verily Fire would have ſtopt me then, if I had had ſo fair a Proſpect of it as now I have.</p>
            <p>I told my Guide, if he pleaſed to go before, I would follow him; ſo in he went, and I after him; but when I came at the middle, there it was ſo deep, that the Water went over my Head but I made ſhift to keep my Feet to the ground, and got well out on the other ſide; and my Guided and I went up together very pleaſantly; and when we came to the top of the Hill, there was a wide Plain, and in the middle thereof the Houſe ſtood. So we went apace, and drew near to it, and there I ſaw a very ſtately Porch at the Weſt end of the Houſe, and at the Door ſtood a ſtrong tall Porter, to whom my Guide ſpake, and ſaid to him on this wiſe.</p>
            <p>This Young Man hath long had a Deſire to be Entertained in the Houſe of God, thereupon I have conducted him hither; the Porter asked him which way I came thither? He ſaid through the River, and I don't remember he asked him any more Queſtions, but bid me welcome, and let me into the Houſe, and my Guide went in with me, through many turnings and windings into a great Hall; mine Eyes went to and fro as I went about the Houſe, and in the great Hall there I ſaw
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006656_0008_1029758B77AE12F8"/>many People, they bid me welcome, but none knew the Anguiſh of my Soul; for I began to Queſtion, whether I was not again beguiled, for I found the Houſe foul and Dirty, almoſt in every Part, and ſo belined with Spiders and Cobwebs, that I thought in my ſelf it had never been Swept clean ſince it was Built; and ſome things I met withal that diſpleaſed me yet worſe, as ye ſhall hear; howbeit a good Bed was provided for me to Reſt upon if I could; and I having little Stomack, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſaw how it was made ready, I went to Bed, and diſpoſed my ſelf to Sleep what I could, but alas Sleep departed from me, and my Spirits were grievouſly vexed, and my Cogitations were many, and grievous; ſometimes I thought of the Paintings without, and how that Suited not with the Dirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that was within; and if I was deceived, what Courſe I ſhould take,</p>
            <p>After a long and tedious thinking, I pleaſed my ſelf with this, it may be better To-morrow, ſo I fell into a Slumber a pretty while. In the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before I Roſe, I heard two or three Contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ind about ſome Accounts, in which one laid Fraud to the others Charge; the other, inſtead of vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating himſelf, fell a twitting him in the Teeth with ſomething of the like kind; they grew hot in Words, ſo that they threatened to turn each other out of Doors, and drive him back again through the River, and never ſuffer him to come into the Houſe any more.</p>
            <p>My Heart was ready to burſt with Sorrow, and in the Anguiſh of my Spirit, I Roſe and went to them, and told them, I little thought to have found
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006656_0009_1029758FEDA4A588"/>ſuch Doings, or heard ſuch Language in the Houſe of God. I fear, quoth I, I am deceived, and brought in amongſt you by a fair Shew, but ſee not the Glory, Peace and Tranquility.</p>
            <p>So I walked away to another Part of the Houſe where I heard a great noiſe of hard Words, and I drew near, and underſtood it was about chooſing an Officer, and two was ſtriving about it, and each of them had got a Party, and each Party grew hot one againſt another. As ſoon as I could be heard, I ſpake to them, and told them ſuch kind of doings as this, did more reſemble a place in the World, called <hi>Billingsgate,</hi> than the Houſe of God.</p>
            <p>I went a little further, and there I heard ſome Women Scolding about taking the upper hand, and about ſome Faſhions in their Cloaths; and others about getting their Childrens Play things from each other. All this and much more than I ſhall mention, increaſed my Sorrow: I now began to long to ſpeak with my Guide that brought me thither; and with diligent Search at laſt I found him, and began with him in this Manner.</p>
            <p>Whether haſt thou brought me, and where are the Rules and Orders thou toldeſt me were in the Houſe of God? I have often read of the Beauty, Order, Peace and Purity of the Houſe of God, but here I find nothing but the contrary; I fear thou haſt brought me to a wrong Houſe, and haſt beguiled me; ſo I Rehearſed to him what I had met withal. To which he Replied; I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Men have their humane Frailties, and that Men were but Men, and perſwaded me to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and make further Trial. And as for the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006656_0010_1029759173776E28"/>Orders he ſpake of, they were moſt about Meats and Drinks, and about Rules for Electing of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to Rule the Houſe of God, as I would ſee in Time, if I ſtayed; and as to the Dirtineſs of the Houſe, he confeſſed, them to whom the Care belonged, and was Committed, to keep the Houſe Clean, had not been ſo Diligent as they ought to have been, but he hoped, upon Admonition, they would be more Careful. To which, I returned this Anſwer. What! doſt thou talk of Humane Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilties in the Houſe of God? that Complaint is at large in the World, but doth not become the Houſe of God, into which, I have heard none can come, but ſuch as are Redeemed from the Earth, and are waſhed from their Polutions; for God ſaith, <hi>all the Veſſels in my Houſe ſhall be Holy;</hi> and they that dwell in the Houſe of God, muſt have pure Hearts, and clean Hands; and much more I told him of what I heard and read concerning the Houſe of God. And told him plainly, I had let in ſuch a Belief of the Peace, Purity, Glory and Comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Houſe of God, that I was perſwaded that was none of it, and where to find it I knew not; but if I never found it while I lived, I would never give over ſeeking; my Deſires were ſo after it, that I thought nothing would ſatisfy me ſhort of the Enjoyment of it. But as for your Houſe here I have no Satisfaction in it to be the Place I ſeek for, ſo I muſt leave you.</p>
            <p>His Anſwer was to me, he was ſorry I could not be ſatisfied there as well as he, but if I could not, he would lay no Reſtraint upon me; for his part, he had directed me as far as he knew, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006656_0011_1029759475C050A0"/>he could do no more for me. After our Diſcourſe was ended, I got up and went out, but knew not where to go; ſeveral in the Houſe threw things after me in a ſpiteful manner, but none hurt me; and I wandered ſometimes North, and ſometimes South, and over every way that came in my Mind; but whitherſoever I went, the Anguiſh of my Soul went along with me, which was more than Tongue or Pen can declare or utter, or any one can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; except this Relation ſhould meet with any one that has experienced the ſame Travel; which if it doth, they will underſtand it.</p>
            <p>But ſo was, I had no Comfort Night nor Day, but ſtill kept going on, whether Right or Wrong I knew not, nor durſt I ask any Body, for fear of being beguiled as before. Thus I got into a vaſt howling Wilderneſs, where there ſeemed to be no way in it, only now and then I found ſome Men and Women footſteps, which was ſome Comfort to me in my Sorrow; but whither they got out, without being devoured of Wild Beaſts, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould go I knew not. But in this woeful State I travelled from Day to Day, caſting within my ſelf what I had beſt to do, whether utterly to Diſpair in that Condition, or whether I had beſt to ſeek ſome other Town or City, to ſee if I could get ſome other Guide. The firſt I ſaw to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, I alſo deſpaired of the laſt, having been ſo deceived from Time to Time; ſo that all theſe Conſultatons did but increaſe the bitterneſs of my Soul.</p>
            <p>And one Day as I was Travelling in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon a terrible Storm aroſe, with Hail and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006656_0012_102975960C04D7E0"/>and great Wind, which laſted till Night, and in the Night alſo. I being weary, both of Body and Mind, lay me down under a great Tree, and alter ſome Time I fell aſleep; and when I waked, and came to my ſelf, it was ſtill very Dark; &amp; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, I ſaw a ſmall Light pretty near me; and it came in my Mind to go to it, and ſee what it was, and as I went, that went before me.</p>
            <p>Then it came into my Mind that I had heard of falſe Lights, as <hi>Ignis-Fatuus,</hi> and ſuch like, that would lead People out of their Way; then thought I again, how could I be led out of my Way, that knew no way of Safety. And whilſt I ſate down to let theſe ſtarving Thoughts have their Courſe, I took notice, and beheld the Light as near me as at the firſt, as if it had waited for me. At which I was ſtrongly affected, and thought within my ſelf, may be ſome good Spirit is come to take pitty of me, and is come to lead me out of this miſerable Condition. And ſo a Reſolution aroſe in my Mind, that I ſhould get up and follow it; concluding in my ſelf, that I could not be brought into a much worſe Condition than I was now in. So I aroſe and followed it, and it went a gentle eaſie pace at firſt, and I kept my Eye ſtrait to it; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I found a great part of the Luggage &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion I had got together, did but burthen me in my Journey; ſo I threw away one thing, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that I thought I could beſt ſpare, but kept a great bundle of Cloaths ſtill by me, not knowing whether I ſhould need them. And as I thus went on and the Light before me, it led me out of the Wilderneſs, along a plain Champion Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006656_0013_1029759C031EF340"/>Trees, or Inhabitants; only I perceived as if ſome few had gone that way, and the Light kept ſtrait in that Path, without any winding or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till I came to the Foot of a great Mountain; and going up that great Mountain, I found it hard getting up, and began to conſider my great bundle of Cloaths and Garments, and that ſeveral of them were in uſe for a Traveller as I was, and did not know how far I ſhould go, nor whether I ſhould want them, if ever I was ſo Happy as to attain what I aimed at; nor whether the Faſhions would ſuit the Place I was going to. So I threw away ſome, and anon other ſome, till I had none left but what I worn. And as I followed this my Guide, I at laſt got up to the top of this Mountain, and ſaw another yet higher; and there I ſaw a Man; he asked me whither I was going, I told him I could not well tell; but I would tell him whither I deſired to go, he ſaid whither, to the Houſe of God? He told me it was that way, but he thought I ſhould never get thither. I asked him why? Why, quoth he, there lieth in yonder Mountain, ſo many Vipers, Adders, and Serpents, and ſuch Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Beaſts, that they devour many People that are going that way. For my part ſaid he, I was going alſo, but I was ſo afrighted with thoſe Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Serpents, I was forced to turn back, and ſo I would have you.</p>
            <p>I anſwered him, Friend, I have for a pretty while taken yonder Light for my Guide, and it hath directed me a long way, and it doth not leave me; look, doſt thou ſee it there before me? He anſwered yes, I ſee it; well, ſaid I, I have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006656_0014_1029759EFB51E5D8"/>heard by Travellers, that if a Man have Fire or Light, the Venemous Beaſt, cannot hurt him; and I intend to quicken my pace a little, and keep as cloſe to the Light as I can, come go along with me and venture it.</p>
            <p>He ſaid it was true, he had heard that Fire would preſerve from them, but he thought Light would not. However, for his part, he would not venture his ſweet Life amongſt them; If would, I might, he wiſhed me well, and ſo we parted; and I made haſte, got up pretty near the Light, and up I went the Second Mountain; and when I came almoſt to the top of the Mountain, I ſaw many Serpents Dens, and Vipers Holes, both on the Right Hand, and on the Lift, and they drew near me, and hiſs'd at me, and I began to be in great fear, and trembled exceedingly; but many times when they were ready to ſting me. the Light would ſtep in, or appear betwixt me and them, and they were afrighted, and run away into their Holes and Dens.</p>
            <p>Oh! when I perceived this, how did my heart leap for joy within me, my joy abounded, my fear of the Serpents abated, my Love to my kind and tender Guide increaſed, and my Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence abounded; and I began to believe I was in the Right way to attain my Deſire. So on I went, keeping my Eye to the Light, through them all, without harm, till I came to the top of the Mountain; and then I ſaw an exceeding large Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, that I could not ſee to the further ſide of it; it ſeemed to be all Moors, and Places of Water, and Boggs and Mire all over the Valley, which began
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006656_0015_102975A085AFFA78"/>again to diſhearten me; but thought I, what ſhall I do; all is well hitherto; I was ſtrangely deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Serpents, and whatever comes of it, if this Light leave me not, I will follow it, if it be through Fire and Water; and ſo I kept on, and went down the Mountain a gentle eaſie pace, and ſee many of thoſe cruel Creatures by the way, who put out their Stings at me, but none hurt me. And I took Notice, the nearer I kept to the Light, the more they kept from me; ſo I got down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Mountain, into the large Valley, which was very Green and Pleaſant for a little Way; but by and by the Light went towards a great Mooriſh Ground full of Water, and that I thought was very Dangerous; but when I came juſt to the ſide of the Place, I ſaw a ſmall Narrow Path through the middle of it, juſt broad enough for a Man to go upon it, and into that Narrow Way the Light lead me, and went before me; and whilſt I kept my Eye ſteady to it, I went on ſafely; but if at any time I began to gaze about, my Feet ſlipt into the Mire, and Puddles, and then I had much ado to get into my Way again, had not the Light kindly and tenderly waited for me, I had loſt ſight of it, and had periſhed in the way; for ſometimes it was ſo far before me, that I could hardly diſcern it, &amp; then I would quicken my Diligence, and be more Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of my Goings, and keep as cloſe to it as I could. So that ſometimes the Light ſhined round about me, and I walked in the ſhining of it with great fulneſs of Spirit, and after I had walked a long time in this Narrow Way. I lift up my Eyes, and ſaw to the further ſide of the Mooriſh Valley;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006656_0016_102975A3852B5188"/>and ſaw beyond, that there was a very high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and on the top of that, there was a very great Houſe; at the ſight of which I was greatly comforted, ſuppoſing that might be the Houſe I had for a long ſought.</p>
            <p>But after this, I met with another ſore Exerciſe; for there were many I perceived had been Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in that Narrow Way, and had fallen into the Mire, ſome on the Right Hand, and ſome on the Lift; and they lay wallowing, full of Envy; ſome by plucing at me, to pull me in; others by throwing Mire and Dirt upon me, to Diſcourage me: Others would ſpeak very fair, on purpoſe to draw me into Diſcourſe with them, that whilſt I ſpent my precious Time, I might be caſt ſo far behind, that I might loſe that Sight of my good Guide. But I ſaw their Evil Deſigns, and was aware of them, keeping on my Narrow Way till I came to the End of the Boggy Valley, and then found Firm Ground under my Feet, to my great Comfort. And I had gone but a little way, and then my Guide the Light went into a Narrow Lane, well Hedged on both ſides; at which I was glad, thinking I could not go wrong, and need not now take ſo very much Care; but alas, I quickly found ſo many By-Lanes, and Ways, that lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſo ſtrait forward as that I went in; ſo that if it had not been for the Light which went a little before me, I might certainly gone wrong many time; but by carefully keeping to my good Guide, I got at laſt up the Mountain, and ſaw the Houſe again, and diſcerned a Man, of that Country a pretty way off; and I called to him, Friend, Ho! Friend, pray tell me what is the Name of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006656_0017_102975A7F91524D8"/>yonder Great Houſe; He told me, the Name of it was <hi>Bethel;</hi> then I preſently remembered that that was the Name by which the Houſe of God was called in my Fathers Country, where I had heard the Reports of it, and was ſo earneſtly ſet to find it out.</p>
            <p>Oh! the Joy and Conſolation that I felt in my Soul, no Tongue can expreſs it, to think that now after all my Travels, Perils and Diſappointments, I had now found that I ſought for. So on I went Journying with Joy unſpeakable; and as I went I viewed the outſide of the Houſe, and that was very large, and had but one Tower, there was no Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Work about it, nor no Paintings, nor any kind of Device that I could diſcern, but all the Stones were curiouſly Joined together from the Top to the Bottom. I alſo took Notice that all the Stones of the Building were Tranſparent, ſome more, and ſome leſs, and I ſaw no Windows to let in Light, from without; and when I drew near to it, it had a large outward Court, and a pretty large Gate to go into it, ſo that a Man might go into it with a large Burthen on his Back; and when I came at it, in I went, where I ſaw many People that were very cheerful, and lived very pleaſant Lives; and ſome of them told me they had lived there many Years, and wanted for nothing, for there was a mighty Tree grew in the midſt of the Court, and the Fruit thereof was good, and the Leaves alſo, and they were well contented with it, and it bore Fruit all the Year long; and many of them were ſo kind as to invite me to ſit down and Eat with them, but that I refuſed; and they ſhewed me a great Ciſtern, they had hewn out to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006656_0018_102975A980F4E368"/>to catch Water from the Elements, and they had made themſelves convenient Lodgings, in the ſides of the Court, to Lodge in; but this did not ſatisfie me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> I ſaw my beloved Guide paſs through them all, and enter in at a little Door at the further ſide of it; whereupon I left them, and made haſte to the Door, wherein I ſee my Guide had entered, and attempted to enter in thereat, but could not, it was ſo ſtrait, which put me into great ſorrow of Mind, and what to do I knew not, my thoughts troubled me on every ſide; and all ways I tried, but in vain; Oh! thought I, are all my Troubles and Labours come to this, muſt I be ſhut out at the laſt, what ſhall I do? And as I was thus perplexing my ſelf, I thought I heard a Voice, but knew not from whence it came, which ſaid, <hi>Young Man, ſtrip thee of thy old Garments, and ſo thou mayeſt enter.</hi> This occaſioned yet more trouble of Mind, for I was loath to go in Naked; but at laſt, I thought it better to go in Naked, than not at all. So at laſt I went to Stripping, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few pitiful Rags ſhould not hinder me of ſo great an Enjoyment. And when I was ſtrip ſtart Naked as ever I was born, I tried to enter, and found great difficulty in it; and ſo ſoon as I was entered, one met me, and caſt a Garment of pure white Linen over me, which reached down to my Feet; and he brought me into a narrow Room, and ſaid, Reſt here a while. And then I lay me down in ſo much Joy and Comfort, as is impoſſible to be expreſſed, all things were ſo pleaſant about me; and my Reſting place was ſo delightful, and my Heart was ſo fully ſatisfied, that it overcame me with Songs of Joy; but I found my Buſinesſ
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006656_0019_102975AC81E40628"/>to be ſtill and quiet in my happy Condition, that I was come for to enjoy.</p>
            <p>I had not been long in this Room, before I was called out to ſee the Beauty and Comlineſs, of the Houſe: And as I walked, I found every thing ſo Clean and Bright, that I was raviſhed in an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Manner with it; and I met alſo with ſome People that welcomed me to the Houſe of God, with ſuch Kindneſs as refreſhed my Heart; and as I came to be Acquainted with them, I marked their Converſations, and their Diſcourſes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Comfortable to me; no Quarrelling, no Contention, no high or hot Words, but all paſſed with Meekneſs, and Reverence, and due reſpect one for the other; the young Men waited for the Words of the Ancients and Fathers, and Virgins carried a reverent reſpect to the Matrons, and there was an Univerſal Concord &amp; Unity, ſo that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered greatly; &amp; one Day I was opening my Mind to an Ancient, and told him, <hi>I admired much, and wondered greatly at the Univerſal Concord that I had taken Notice of, beyong all I had met with in my Life.</hi> He ſaid it muſt needs be ſo, and could not be otherwiſe; for that was the Guide which lead me hither, had been the Guide to them all. And further told me, there could be no Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no but where two Spirits ſtrove for Maſtery, but it was not ſo in this Houſe. His Anſwer was ſo full and ſatisfactory to me, that I ſaid no more to him at that time, but went on, viewing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Order of every thing I ſaw, till my ſoul was filled, and I might ſay, my Cup did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow. So that my former Labours and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sorrows and Perils did ſignifie nothing to me, I had a full Reward, a hundred fold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006656_0020_102975AF83F11C08"/>
So I returned to my Reſt again, in a Larger Room than before, where I Sung Praiſes to my God; and ſetting forth the Praiſes of the Houſe, and them that dwell therein. And a while after I was called forth of the Room where I was, and told, I was not brought to that Place, only to take pleaſure and delight therein, but there was Work to be done, and I muſt take my part of it, and be faithfull and deligent in what I was ſet about. To which I anſwered, it was enough I had attained my deſires in being admitted into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Place; but if there were any Buſineſs that I could do, I was willing to do it, be it what it would, for it would be my greateſt Joy to do any thing to the Advancement of the Honour of the Houſe of God, and them that dwell therein. Then he that talked with me, told me, it was my Work, to teach the Children ſo far as I knew and had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as far as I ſhould from Time to time be further inſtructed. Indeed I was a little amazed thereat, knowing my Inabilities: But when I had a little pondered that part of the Sentence; that I ſhould be from Time to Time further inſtructed, I took Courage in my Work, and made ſome Progreſs in it with great Fear, and Reverence, waiting daily for thoſe Inſtructions I was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and I did receive in an abundant maner; and the work proſpered in my Hand, and the Children loved me, and I loved them entirely, as though they had been my own Children; and many of them grew up to a good Underſtanding, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their places and orders, to my great Delight. And after I had thus continued a while, the Elder that talked with me before, came and told me,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006656_0021_102975B289DA6A48"/>I muſt take the charge of part of the Houſhold, and give them their Meat in due ſeaſon; and ſuit every ones Meat, in deviding to every ones State and Condition; <hi>and not to feed ſtrong Men with Milk, or Babes with ſtrong Meat;</hi> and for that Purpoſe, he gave me a Key that led into the Treaſure, or Sore-Houſe; which when I came to ſee and behold it was abundently filled with all ſorts of Nouriſhments that never could be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſpent while the World endured.</p>
            <p>And after ſome Time I took out to Diſtribute daily among the Houſhold of God, and the Store Houſe was ſtill full, as at the begining, and ſo it continues to this day, and for ever.</p>
            <p>And having continued a long while in this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Habitation, it comes in my Mind to let my Countrymen the Children of my old Father whom I leſt in <hi>Babylon,</hi> hear of me; for I ſuppoſe they judge me loſt, or devoured; but I could be glad if any, yea all of them were hear to behold, and taſte and feel what I do.</p>
            <p>And let none of them ſay, I happen'd better than many can; for I have wandered ſince I came into this Houſe. The ſame Light that appeared to me doth appear to any poor diſtreſſed Soul in the whole World; but the reaſon that ſo few come here, is becauſe they fear the Perils and dangers that are in the Way, more than they love the Light that would lead them thither through them; and ſo turn aſide, and ſhelter themſelves in an Old Rotten Building, that at one time or other will fall on their Heads and they periſh in the Ruins.</p>
            <p>Now if any one have a mind to know my Name in my Fathers Country; but in this long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006656_0022_102975B70B1E5FE0"/>Journey I have loſt it. but ſince I came hither, I have a new Name, but I have no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to ſignify it by, that I can Write, or they can Read. But if any will come where I am, they ſhall know my Name. But for further Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I was born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Spiritually call'd and my Father went and lived in <hi>Babylon,</hi> about the Time the true Children of <hi>Iſarel</hi> were in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; there I came acquainted with ſome of the Stock of the <hi>Jews,</hi> about the time they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their own Land; and they told me wonderfull things of the Glory of the Houſe they had at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and would have had me gone along with them; and amongſt the reſt, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that Solomon with many thouſands of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters and Maſons had built it. Upon which I conſidered, within my ſelf, that if <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Carpenters and Maſons had Built it, Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Maſons might at one time or other pull it down again. So I went not, but ſought a City, whoſe Builder is God: And now I have found it Hallalujah in the Higheſt, Glory, Honour, and Renown to his Worthy Name, and Power, throughout all Ages and Geanrations, <hi>Amen.</hi>
