            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>IN penning the following memoirs, I had no other object in view than my own amuſement. This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may, perhaps, be accepted as an excuſe for the familiarity of my ſtyle; which, as well as many other imperfections, will, no doubt, be perceived and condemned by the critic. The candid and indulgent reader, who reflects, that the piece was not till lately intended for the public eye—nor then, without the moſt urgent ſolicitations of a number of friends, will generouſly pardon any defect he may diſcover in the peruſal. Having been intimately acquainted with the hero of the piece, in my juvenile days, I can with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence vouch for the authenticity of the narrative. 'Tis true, I have introduced ſome perſons and incidents which appear to be unconnected with the foundation of the ſtory; yet, it will be found, that were any of theſe withdrawn, the chain of events would be broken, and the congruity of the piece deſtroyed.—Upon the whole, if the ſtyle is not florid, it will not wound the ear of modeſty; if she ſubjects are not ſublime, they have a manifeſt tendency to propagate ſentiments of virtue—to ſtimulate youth to an humble reſignation to the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of providence—and to diſcountenance vice.</p>
            <p>At all events, I have ventured to lay it before the public, in hopes that, as a forlorn infant, it may find a foſter father, who will not ſuffer it to ſink in oblivion.</p>

            <head>FORTUNE's FOOTBALL.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter into a detail of the adventures of our hero, I preſume it will not be unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my readers, if not expedient, to give a curſory ſketch of his birth and education, in order to illuſtrate the ſubject of the following ſheets. This I ſhall do in as conciſe a manner as poſſible—well knowing that prolixity creates diſguſt.</p>
            <p>He was the firſt and only ſon of a gentleman in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, who enjoy'd an affluent and independent fortune —was noble, generous, humane and hoſpitable: His income not only ſupported his family in ſplendour, but alſo diſpenſed its glad'ning ſtreams to the dreary abodes of pain and indigence. This gentleman, at a a ſuitable age, with the approbation of his friends, paid his addreſſes to a young lady of a diſtinguiſhed family, and great fortune—poſſeſſed of every accompliſhment to render a man of honour happy: To whom he was ſhortly married. Before the anniverſary of their nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials arrived, their happineſs was augmented by the birth of a ſon, who, from that period, was the delight of every eye that ſaw him, and in whom all the riſing hopes of his fond parents concentrated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:031902_0004_0FEF3B88F4380EA8"/>This ſon, is the perſon whoſe ſurprizing and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated adventures I intend to diſcloſe—candidly tracing him through the various mazes and doublings of his peregrination:—He was called Mercutio.</p>
            <p>There is a period between infancy and manhood, in which, let our ſtation in life be what it may, nothing but trifles occur: I ſhould hold myſelf inexcuſable in detaining the attention of my readers from the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting incident of my narrative, with an inſipid rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe; and therefore, ſhall date the adventures of our hero from the commencement of his ſixteenth year. At that period, he became enamoured with a young lady, by an accident, which laid the foundation of his future fortunes and misfortunes, and of courſe, this hiſtory.</p>
            <p>He had juſt completed his ſtudies, at Oxford, when he attained his ſixteenth year: He therefore took leave of his teachers and fellow ſtudents, and repaired to London. It would be needleſs to deſcribe the joyful emotions of his parents, on his arrival—Let it ſuffice to ſay, that while the fond mother claſp'd him with ardour to her boſom, his father's heart expanded with parental pride, to ſee his ſon—his only ſon, in full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every neceſſary accompliſhment—nature as well as art having largely contributed to render him complete.</p>
            <p>His mother, liſten'd with ſupreme delight to the periods, which, with uncommon eaſe and propriety
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031902_0005_0FEF3B785FD5E318"/>
he pronounced, while he deſcribed the progreſs he had made in his ſtudies, and remark'd on the beauties and deformities of the ſeveral authors which had come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his particular obſervation—which he did with ſo much judgment and candour, that envy herſelf could have made no exception—She revolved in her mind the many years of uninterrupted happineſs which it was probable he might enjoy—the many hours of heart-felt ſatisfaction ſhe herſelf, as well as his happy father were yet likely to experience, not only in his company and converſation, but alſo in the pleaſing contemplation of his tranſmitting his name and virtues to millions yet unborn: But alas! the happineſs of mankind is fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tranſitory—like fair weather in an April day, it is but of ſhort duration; and though ſo widely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, from diſappointment, pain and ſlavery, in its nature and conſequences, is, nevertheleſs, ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſucceeded by them, as to appear, to human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to be of the ſame family.</p>
            <p>This happy family lived within fifteen minutes' walk of Hyde-Park, and it being that delightful ſeaſon of the year in which nature ſeems to take a pride in diſplaying her innumerable beauties—our hero frequently walk'd in the Park for recreation—ſometimes in company with his happy parents, and at others alone. As he delighted much in reading, he ſeldom took an excurſion alone without a book, in the peruſal of which he often ſpent an hour or two—reclining beneath the friendly ſhade of ſome one of thoſe venerable trees which adorn that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031902_0006_0FEF3B8ACE655550"/>
fine Park. One evening, while he was amuſing himſelf in this manner, he was rouſed by a ſhriek of diſtreſs, which was uttered by a young lady, who, walking too near the ſerpentine river, where the bank was very ſteep, accidentally fell in—and the ſtream running ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly, waſh'd her more than a hundred yards in a few ſeconds. Mercutio, being at a conſiderable diſtance from the bank of the river, exerted his utmoſt ſpeed, and perceiving the young lady juſt above the water— he plunged in—caught her in his arms, and with much difficulty, bore her to the ſhore, almoſt breathleſs. He was met at the bank of the river by two ladies, in tears, who prov'd to be the mother and ſiſter of her he had reſcued from a watery grave. They gave him what aſſiſtance they could, in conveying her to a convenient ſituation, then requeſted him to ſtep to the end of Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadilly for an eminent phyſician, who lived there. He ran immediately, leaving the young lady to the care of her mother and ſiſter, and in a few words communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his buſineſs to the ſurgeon: who inſtantly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to the ſpot. The young lady, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the endeavours of her mother and ſiſter, was to all appearance dead. The tender parent was hardly kept from fainting, while the ſurviving daughter wept immoderately—ſo that the whole exhibited a ſcene of real diſtreſs. While the ſurgeon exerted his abilities to recover the almoſt drowned lady, it required all the philoſophy as well as rhetoric of Mercutio, to keep the other two in any tolerable degree of ſpirits;—however it pleaſed God to crown the endeavours of the ſurgeon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031902_0007_0FEF3B7C1473FA28"/>
with unexpected ſucceſs:—Cheerfulneſs diffuſed itſelf inſtantly over every countenance, when her reſuſcita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was announced—they ſurrounded her with an eagerneſs which plainly indicated their late apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and preſent ſatisfaction. Our hero was not the laſt in congratulating her on her recovery; but the joy of her mother and ſiſter, is eaſier imagined than deſcribed. She, with a heavy ſigh, opened her eyes, which, even in that impair'd ſtate, were equal in luſtre to the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of the moſt exquiſite poliſh, and looking around her, eagerly ſaid, where is my mama?—Where is Charlotte?—Here we are, replied the mother and ſiſter together. Be compoſed, my dear, ſaid the old lady—Heaven his interpoſed in our favour, and all will be well. Madam, interrupted the ſurgeon, my advice is to convey your daughter home as ſoon as poſſible—let her be put in a warm bed, and do not diſturb her to night—give me your addreſs, and I will viſit her early in the morning, and preſcribe ſuch things as I ſhall then judge ſalutary. The old lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned her thanks for his care, and informed him that ſhe lived on the ſouth ſide of Cavendiſh-Square. The patient was then placed between her mother and ſiſter, in the doctor's chariot, which had brought him and Mercutio, who having promiſed, at the inſtance of the old lady, to accompany the ſurgeon the next day, took leave and departed.</p>
            <p>Although the foregoing accident and adventure, does not appear to have been calculated for the foundation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031902_0008_0FEF3B8D814A6DD8"/>
of an amour; yet this was abſolutely the caſe: For no ſooner did Lucinda, (the young lady) expand her beauteous eyes, than love, like the electrical fire, diffus'd itſelf through each avenue of our hero's heart, which being tender and ſuſceptible, retained this firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo firmly, that it was never eradicated, until the lovely orbs, by which it was communicated, were quench'd in death.</p>
            <p>Mercutio's mind had never been agitated before, in the ſame manner, as it was that evening, and the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night. He ſlept little—broken ſlumbers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd ideas, tortur'd his imagination, till the return of the day. The image of Lucinda appear'd to his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination in various forms: At one time, he beheld her pale and lifeleſs on the bank of the river—at another, faintly ſtruggling with the impetuous ſtream—and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as a bride, adorned for the nuptial ceremony, in all the bloom of youth, beauty and native innocence.</p>
            <p>Having breakfaſted, he haſtened to the houſe of the ſurgeon, and with him, for the firſt time, rode to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendiſh-Square, where he was received with all that politeneſs peculiar to perſons of exalted rank and refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed education. Lucinda, after a comfortable night's reſt, aroſe, invigorated and cheerful, and having been informed by her mama, of the particulars of what ſhe had ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing evening, and of her miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous preſervation—ſhe was juſt expreſſing her deſire to ſee and thank her deliverer, when the ſervant announc'd
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031902_0009_0FEF3B9184B89E40"/>
the arrival of the phyſician and another gentleman. Lucinda's matchleſs charms blazed forth in their native ſplendor—and, her natural vivacity having reſumed its feat, her diſcourſe conſiderably encreaſed the ſatisfaction of the company. The old lady, acknowledged the preſervation of her daughter's life, in the moſt grateful terms, and added, that ſhe knew Lord S—r, her huſband, would never forget the obligation. Though our hero was fully recompenſed for the ſervice he had rendered the daughter of Lord S—r, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of having been inſtrumental in ſaving ſuch a compoſition of wit and beauty from the mercileſs jaws of death; yet his ſatisfaction was conſiderably augmented, by the acknowledgments of Lucinda her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which ſhe expreſſed in the following manner: Words, ſir, are too weak, to deſcribe my grateful ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the vaſt obligation, under which, my mama informs me, you have laid me, by your humane exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſaving me from impending danger; but as the only return in my power at preſent, is a grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the favour, I hope that may be accepted in part, and I promiſe to make up the deficiency, by ever eſteeming you as the generous preſerver of my life.</p>
            <p>Madam, ſaid he, the reward you have promiſed, and which I accept with joy, and ſhall ever ſtrive to deſerve, is more than an equivalent to any ſervice I could poſſibly render; but you muſt not ſuppoſe yourſelf under any obligation to me; for a gentleman who could have done leſs, on a ſimilar occaſion, muſt have diveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

himſelf of every particle of humanity, as well as violated its common laws.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeon finding his fair patient in perfect health, and being ſatisfied for his trouble, departed. Mercutio was more than once prevented from taking his leave, by the joint ſolicitations of the ladies, who ardently requeſted the favour of his company till evening, to which he very willingly complied.</p>
            <p>Dinner being over, the ladies played a duetto on the harpſichord, accompanied with their voices: The maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſkill with which they performed, and the enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmony produced from the lips and fingers of theſe lovely girls, increaſed the infant paſſion of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio to a degree of ardor not often exceeded. He liſtened with rapture, and gazed with ſilent aſtoniſhment! He had never feaſted his eyes and ears ſo ſumptuouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The evening approaching, he took leave, having previouſly, in compliance with reiterated requeſts, promiſed to renew his viſit ſhortly, which he did not fail punctually to obſerve, as will appear in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>As the accident which gave riſe to our hero's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with this family, proved to be the ſource of thoſe ſurprizing adventures of which the enſuing part of this hiſtory is compoſed, I preſume it will not be accounted a digreſſion, to preſent the reader with a very brief account of the eminent perſonages, who gave birth to the empreſs of his affections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:031902_0011_0FEF3B942F9EC008"/>The father of Lucinda was the eldeſt ſon of the duke of N—, whoſe great abilities, as well in the field as cabinet, are too well known to need a repetition in this place: The ſon poſſeſſed not only the eſtate of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo his virtues and bravery. At a ſuitable age, without having run through thoſe ſcenes of vice and diſſipation, which are too frequently and fatally the principal objects which our young noblemen purſue, he fixed his affections on an amiable young lady, daughter of Lord H—n. They lived, as might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in all that harmony which never fails a virtuous union, founded on mutual eſteem. The firſt fruit of their connubial love was a daughter, which was the ſame who had captivated the affections of Mercutio. She had received an education ſuitable to her birth and fortune, which ſhe improved by every means poſſible. The ſecond child was a ſon, and called Charles, an amiable youth, then in Naples: He had been taken dangerouſly ill in that city, and his companion and tutor having written to his father, to inform him of the ſituation of his ſon, he had embarked, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a very able phyſician, for Italy.—But to return:—</p>
            <p>Mercutio's attention was totally diverted from its uſual channel: 'twas entirely abſorbed in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the charming qualifications of Lucinda, and in revolving the happy conſequences that would infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attend an honorable union with her—and began ſeriouſly to reſolve on matrimony, if the conſent of all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031902_0012_0FEF3B96E214A7B8"/>
parties could be obtained: Of this, however, he had many doubts and fears; having frequently heard his father reprobate the cuſtom of marrying at too early a period, and being ſo young, he imagined would be an inſurmountable obſtacle in procuring his conſent, which he conceived as abſolutely neceſſary to his future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>Lucinda's gratitude was, at the firſt interview, by an eaſy tranſition, converted to genuine friendſhip: It is no wonder, then, if the exact and manly features, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry of ſhape, engaging deportment, and natural viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Mercutio, aſſiſted by ſo powerful an ally as the moſt uncontaminated eſteem, ſhould have made an indelible impreſſion on ſuch a heart as her's—ſuſceptible of the ſlighteſt. This was the caſe—but each was ignorant of the attachment of the other, and bore hard on the feelings of both; for it would have afforded great conſolation to them, to have known the real ſituation of each other's heart.</p>
            <p>Mercutio reſolved to love—he relinquiſhed all his former diverſions: The park, the ball, the opera and play, had no charms for him! he devoted himſelf to ſolitude while at home—and ſeldom went abroad but to Lord S—'s.</p>
            <p>It was at one of thoſe viſits he had the honour of his firſt interview with the father and brother of his beloved Lucinda. They had arrived from Italy the day before,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031902_0013_0FEF3B99A97E6408"/>
both in health and vigour. On entering the room, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda with a charming grace, taking his hand, preſented him to her father, ſaying, This, papa, is the gentleman (with the aſſiſtance of heaven) to whom I owe this my ſecond exiſtence. He aroſe inſtantly, and encloſing him in his arms, ſaid, Sir, you have bound, by your generoſity, me, and every branch of my family, by the moſt laſting ties, thoſe of friendſhip—let this day be the epocha of our invariable attachment. My dear Charles, ſaid he to his ſon, from this day forward, conſider this our worthy friend as a brother—a beloved and truly meritorious brother. So ſaying, he joined the hands of the two young men, who ſaluted each other with ardor. Mercutio congratulated his newly adopted brother, on his recovery and return to England; and he, in return, aſſured him of his unſhaken gratitude and affection. They then entered into unreſtrained converſation, in the courſe of which Mercutio's anxiety forſook him—he diſcourſed with his uſual vivacity and good ſenſe, and by his judicious reaſoning and remarks, prov'd himſelf the finiſhed gentleman. Charles was enraptured with his diſcourſe, and earneſtly wiſhed to cultivate an acquaintance with one, whoſe ſentiments appeared congenial with his own, and who had already engroſſed a large portion of his eſteem.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, they took an excurſion in Hyde-Park, and coming to the ſpot where Lucinda had ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the river, the gratitude of the whole family was again called into action: They reiterated their former
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031902_0014_0FEF3B436EDB3958"/>
acknowledgments, ſo that Mercutio, overwhelmed with a ſenſe of their generoſity, entreated them to deſiſt, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the favours he had received that day, were ſufficient to preponderate all he had done, or ever ſhould be able to do, though his whole future life ſhould be devoted to their ſervice. This turned the diſcourſe in another channel—for, as the whole family entertained ſentiments of the higheſt eſteem for him, they forebore ſpeaking on a ſubject which they found gave him pain, though they conceived themſelves ſo highly obliged, that they held themſelves inſolvent.</p>
            <p>Before they parted, Charles begged the favour of Mercutio's company to Hampton court, on that day week, adding, he had been ſo long abroad that he had almoſt forgot the beautiful retreats of his own country. Mercutio promiſed to wait on him at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and taking leave of the whole family, departed.— His father, having ſome affairs to tranſact at Briſtol, ſet out the next morning for that place, while his ſon formed the reſolution to diſcloſe his love for Lucinda to his mother, before his father's return: Rightly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if ſhe approved, it would not be a very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous taſk to procure his approbation alſo. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this reſolution, one evening, being engaged in ſerious converſation with her, he introduced the important ſecret that engroſſed all his thoughts—and cauſed him ſo much anxiety, and which he had never communicated to any one before. It happened that his mother was not altogether unacquainted with the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031902_0015_0FEF3B9B61507140"/>
family to which ſhe found her ſon ſo firmly attached, and had he been of riper years, would not have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her approbation a moment; but knowing her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's tenacity in that point, ſhe forebore giving a poſitive anſwer, for the preſent; promiſing, however, to do every thing in her power, to intereſt his father in his behalf.</p>
            <p>This, though inſufficient immediately to obliterate every doubt, was a cordial to the mind of Mercutio: He, from that evening became cheerful, and before the day arriv'd on which he had conſented to ride to Hampton, he enjoyed the moſt perfect tranquillity of mind, and reſolved to acquaint his friend Charles, with the paſſion he had conceived for his eldeſt ſiſter, but previouſly to enjoin him to ſecrecy, if he ſhould diſapprove of it. Having ſettled theſe things in his mind, he met his friend Charles at the appointed time and place. It was a fine day, and Charles entertained him with the many rarities and diverſions of Italy, which afforded Mercutio much ſatisfaction. They arrived at Hampton about noon, and having refreſhed, ordered dinner to be ready at three, and then went to regale themſelves with the beauties of the elegant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens which pertain to the palace.</p>
            <p>After ranging thoſe ſpacious and delightful avenues for ſome time, the keeper appear'd, to conduct them into the Labyrinth, which is a maſter-piece of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It is ſo very intricate, that it is next to an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility for a perſon, unacquainted with its various turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031902_0016_0FEF3B9E2BDDF330"/>
and windings, being once fairly entered, to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf without the aſſiſtance of a guide. Thoſe youths having entered, the keeper retired, but remained within call, well knowing they would have need of his aſſiſtance. Having attained the centre, they ſat down under a fine ſhady tree to reſt, and to diſcourſe till it ſhould be time to go to dinner. After ſome preparatory converſation, Mercutio, in a few words, and in a very diffident ſtyle, informed Charles of his violent paſſion for Lucinda, and requeſted him to give his opinion and advice on the ſubject, as it was a very important one to him. My dear friend, ſaid Charles, it gives me infinite pleaſure, that the perſom whom I ſo much eſteem, has honoured me with his confidence in a matter ſo weighty and intereſting, and muſt freely confeſs, that it is no more than I ſuſpected. I have, ſince my return from Italy, obſerved a degree of ſingularity in my ſiſter's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, which gave birth to that ſuſpicion: She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votes much of her time to ſolitude—appears remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly penſive—except when you honour us with your company, at which time ſhe reſumes her native ſprightlineſs; but no ſooner are you gone, than ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to her chamber, and ſeldom appears cheerful till a ſimilar occaſion preſents itſelf. My ſiſter Charlotte has alſo made the ſame remark, which ſhe communicated to me, and imputes it to the real cauſe, namely, Love: And to give you my ſentiments freely on the ſubject, I really believe Lucinda to be under the ſame perplexities you labour under yourſelf. But tell me, my dear Mercutio, have you ever diſcloſed your
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031902_0017_0FEF3BA226869838"/>
paſſion to my ſiſter? No, my dear friend, your virtuous —your accompliſhed ſiſter is yet unacquainted with the flame which preys each moment on my heart, and this it is that has rendered me unhappy:—Unhappy!- ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Charles, I ſhould hold myſelf guilty of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and conſequently unworthy your friendſhip, if I could harbour the moſt diſtant idea of your being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy without ſympathizing with you, and contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all in my power to reſtore your peace of mind: —My ſiſter, or I am much miſtaken, loves you ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. My advice is, that you reveal your ſentiments to her without delay—for I am fully ſenſible that there is not one of the family, but would be proud of the alliance: —Baniſh every apprehenſion—explain yourſelf without reſerve, and my life for it, you'll ſucceed. For my part, you may depend on all the aſſiſtance in my power— but my opinion is, you have a friend in the citadel, that will do more execution than all the external aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries you can command.</p>
            <p>Mercutio was ſo overwhelmed with a ſenſe of his friend's uncommon generoſity, that he was for ſome time at a loſs for words to deſcribe his own feelings on the occaſion.—My ineſtimable friend, ſaid he, where have you imbibed this greatneſs of ſoul? Your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo unlimited, that there is not a bare poſſibility of a retaliation—but rely on my unchangeable attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—my willingneſs to embrace every opportunity of rendering you all the ſervice in my power—Come, come, ſaid Charles, haſtily interrupting him, no more
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031902_0018_0FEF3BA513E9F238"/>
of this—let's away to dinner. Mercutio, looking at his watch, found it was four. They ſtarted up inſtantly, and walked almoſt an hour at a good round rate, when to their amazement, they found themſelves juſt where they had been ſitting ſo long—they attempted it again, but without ſucceſs—they were conſtrained to call the keeper, who liberated them in a few minutes.</p>
            <p>They haſtened to the inn, where they found dinner waiting—their walk having created good appetites, they ate heartily; and after taking a cheering glaſs, remounted, and ſet out for London. Night overtook them about three miles from town, and as they were riding ſlowly along, buſy in diſcourſe, they were met by a youth, genteely dreſſed, and well mounted, who preſenting a piſtol to Mercutio's breaſt, demanded his money.</p>
            <p>Their ſervants being armed, rode up and took him, which was eaſily accompliſhed, as he made no reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; but exclaimed aloud—Now, my miſeries will ſoon have an end! I ſhall die contented, and my dear Amelia will ſee that I prefer even an ignominious death, to a wretched life, without her!—Theſe words ſurprized our young friends—they both wiſhed to know the cauſe of this young highwayman's inconſiſtent behaviour. The ſervants had bound him, and were riding one on each ſide, when Mercutio and Charles halted—The words and actions of this young man, ſaid Mercutio, ſurprize me exceedingly—I feel deſirous to know what has prompted him to take to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way—
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031902_0019_0FEF3BA6C3C30EF8"/>
in my opinion, he is but a novice in the trade; for inſtead of attempting an eſcape, he appeared will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be taken, and by the words he expreſſed while the ſervants were binding him, I ſuſpect this action the effect of a deſperate reſolution, formed in conſequence of ſome diſappointment in a love affair—I think it would be worth our while to examine him on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. You have utter'd my ſentiments exactly, replied Charles—I think there muſt be ſomething very ſingular in his caſe; for as you obſerved, he does not appear to have had much experience. They ſoon overtook their company, and ordering their ſervants to ride forward, took charge of the priſoner themſelves.</p>
            <p>My friend, ſaid Mercutio, what could induce you, among ſuch a variety of occupations which exiſt in this kingdom, to make choice of one, which muſt inevitably terminate in ignominy and puniſhment?</p>
            <p>That queſtion, ſaid the priſoner, ſtabs me to the ſoul. He pauſed—and would have ſaid no more, had not Mercutio deſired him to inform them by what means he had been reduced to that way: You need not, ſaid he, be under apprehenſion of any circumſtance, which you may probably diſcover in your narrative, being brought againſt you before a magiſtrate—for you may depend upon our honour, that whatever you diſcloſe to us, ſhall be buried in eternal oblivion—and for this reaſon we ſent our ſervants forward: Therefore, by giving us a brief and candid relation of the misfortunes
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031902_0020_0FEF3BA9B352A430"/>
or temptations, which, perhaps, contrary to your natural inclination, precipitated you into this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe, may have a palliative tendency, and your affairs, however unpromiſing at preſent, may ſhortly terminate in your favour.</p>
            <p>If you mean, returned the priſoner, that it will have a tendency to divert your intentions of ſurrendering me into the hands of juſtice, I ſhould willingly refuſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a perſon who has no buſineſs in this world, ſhould ſtay no longer in it than to procure a convenient paſſage to another, which however bad, cannot be worſe than this; and as I am one of this deſcription, am willing to meet death in any form and at any time. But, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you appear to be generous, and therefore, whatever pangs the relation of my late misfortunes may add to my tortured ſoul, I ſhall endeavour to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify your requeſt.</p>
            <p>My father is a merchant of no ſmall account, in the city which now lies before us. My mother died when I was about eleven years of age, and I being the only child, was placed at Rule's academy, at Iſlington, where I remained two years; when a brother of my mother's, having repeatedly urged my father to ſend me to one of the univerſities, without ſucceſs, took me from thence and placed me at Oxford, where, after making ample proviſion for my education, &amp;c. took an affectionate leave, previouſly exhorting me to be diligent, and obedient to my tutors—If you are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive

               </gap>ience to his orders. This anſwer pleaſed him exceedingly—and from that day to this, I have tranſacted his buſineſs with the greateſt care and punctuality. But how ſhall I relate the reſt?—Some time ago, I conceived a tenderneſs for an amiable young creature, the only daughter of a very wealthy jeweller, in Cheapſide: This tenderneſs encreaſed ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly, and was ſoon ſucceeded by the moſt ardent paſſion. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my ſufferings to the dear object of my wiſhes— who con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſcended to approve, and accepted my vows. Our love became reciprocal. But—ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce that fatal moment, anxiety has been my inſeparable companion. Our fathers happened to have ſentiments congenial—
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031902_0022_0FEF3B15289A8BE8"/>
yet it was impoſſible ever to obtain their mutual conſent to our union—as they had both formed a determination never to agree to the marriage of their children with any perſon, but ſuch as had a great fortune, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd principles ſimilar to their own—and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to part with a ſhilling, until death ſhould deprive them of the power of accumulating wealth.</p>
            <p>Under ſuch circumſtances, conceive, if you can, the torment we endured. Buoyed up with flattering hopes, however, and having frequent opportunities of enjoying each other's company, our ſituation was yet tolerable; but alas! this was but of ſhort duration. My father, yeſterday evening, came into the compting-houſe, and appeared remarkably pleaſant:—After ſome preliminary diſcourſe—George, ſaid he, I am ſurprized that a young fellow of your lively turn don't endeavor to puſh yourſelf into the world;—I mean, continued he, by marriage. There is nothing gives a young man ſo great an opportunity of making a fortune as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous match. Why, before I was of your age, there was not a great fortune, maid or widow, in town, or within twenty miles round it, but I paid my addreſſes to—and you ſee what an eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te I have raiſed from your mother's dowry. You underſtand the law, and if you was married to a woman of fortune, you might, with the help of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er gold, ſoon climb the ladder of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—might ſoon be lord chief juſtice, my boy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:031902_0023_0FEF3BB112099978"/>I was aſtoniſhed at his diſcourſe, as I had frequently, ſince I left college, heard him reprobate a married life as being attended with great expence, care and anxiety, and declaring, that if he was a young man, he never would be duped into it again. However, I told him I had often thought of matrimony, and ſhould have no objection to it, with an agreeable young woman. As to her being agreeable, ſaid he, I ſuppoſe you mean handſome, or young—theſe are but ſecondary conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: The woman whom I would recommend ſhould be rich—if handſome it would be no objection; but for age, it ſignifies not a button. Now I have taken the pains to ſelect a woman for you, to whom in my opinion, you cannot have the leaſt objection—ſhe's none of your fooliſh, extravagant jillflirts, who would ruin you in paint, patches and lace:—No, no, my boy, ſhe's a ſober, ſtaid body, induſtrious and frugal—true, ſhe's about forty or forty-five; but then ſhe has twenty-five thouſand pounds in glittering gold, my boy: and the greateſt advantage of all is, ſhe'll not have many children. Now, George, what do you think of my propoſal?—What do you think you are indebted to me for anticipating your very hopes—and providing ſuch a wiſe for you?</p>
            <p>I was ſo confounded with this laſt ſpeech, that for ſome time I was unable to anſwer him; but recovering myſelf a little from the vexation I felt, I obſerved, that I was deeply ſenſible of his goodneſs, in procuring ſuch a perſon as he had deſcribed; but thought it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031902_0024_0FEF3B3DC2EAC3E0"/>
the lady's affections might be pre-engaged, as I had never been honoured with an interview—Not at all, not at all, interrupted my father, haſtily: People of ſenſe never ſuffer their affections to be engaged contrary to their intereſt:—She knows I have no child but you, and conſequently, that you will be very rich at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe: You need not be under any apprehenſion on that ſcore—I'll introduce you to-morrow, and my word for it, you'll meet with no repulſe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, my dear father, I am ſorry it is out of my power to accept the honour you intended me—as I am engaged to a perſon of ſuch beauty and good ſenſe, that you yourſelf muſt applaud my choice, and—A damn'd proſtitute, interrupted he, in great rage—ſome offspring of extravagance and folly, I dare ſay; but I dont care who or what ſhe is—if you don't acquieſce with my proproſal, prepare to turn out, for here you'll ſtay no longer, nor ever finger one penny of my eſtate, I promiſe you:—I would ſooner bequeath it to my grave-digger. Let me have a final anſwer to-morrow morning;—but, d'ye hear, I will be obey'd, one way or other.</p>
            <p>With theſe words he left me to the moſt mortifying reflections. I remained petrified with aſtoniſhment for ſome time; but at length reſolved to pay my dear Amelia a viſit to inform her of my deplorable ſituation. and urge her to accompany me to my uncle's, where I knew we ſhould be received with affection, and there tie the indiſſoluble knot, which would forever fruſtate
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031902_0025_0FEF3BB3010E4380"/>
the caprice of an unfeeling parent. With theſe perplexing ideas, I reached her father's, who, to my inexpreſſible anguiſh, would not permit me to ſee her. You muſt diſcontinue your viſits here, ſaid he—my daughter is to be married in a few days to Mr. Ephraims of the old Jewry, a wealthy broker. I was juſt going to ſolicit a moment's interview—but he cut me ſhort— George, it's needleſs for you to put yourſelf to any further trouble about her, as it will be impoſſible for you to ſee her until ſhe is married to Mr. Ephraims, who is now with her in the dining-room: Come, will you take a walk to the coffee-houſe? I made him no anſwer, but taking my hat and cane, left the room, pronouncing the words DAMNED AVARICE! I returned home in dreadful perturbation of mind, threw myſelf on the bed in all the pangs of deſpair. I ſlept none— but waited the return of day, with an anxiety not to be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>I went this morning to the compting-houſe, as uſual, though undetermined what anſwer to give my father. He did not ſuffer me to deliberate long; for coming in ſuddenly, he demanded my anſwer, with a countenance which indicated his diſpleaſure, and the ſtorm impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſoon burſt upon my devoted head:—Don't heſitate a moment, young man, ſaid he, I'm not to be trifled with. In the tumult which then pervaded my ſoul, I told him, I had given all the anſwer I had to give:—Then, you infamous ſcoundrel, ſaid he, begone out of my houſe inſtantly—you unworthy raſcal! if
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031902_0026_0FEF3BB820091C60"/>
ever I catch you within my doors again, I'll ſhoot you. I roſe inſtantly, and he thruſt me out the door, in a degree of rage bordering on madneſs.</p>
            <p>In the height of my deſpair, I took the fatal reſolution which you have juſt witneſſed. I hired this horſe at a livery ſtable where I was known, in order to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and ſet out in the duſk of evening—The reſt you know; but when I attacked you, my wiſh was, that you would have lodged a friendly bullet in my head, and rid the world of the unhappieſt of mortals. Here he ſtopped, when Mercutio, with ſome earneſtneſs, demanded his name:—My name, replied he, is George Wright. Gracious heavens! exclaimed Mercutio, is it poſſible that you are my friend and fellow-ſtudent, with whom I have ſpent ſo many delightful hours at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford? Have you forgot Mercutio?—Mercutio! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, greatly agitated, is this you? No, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to forget him—but long abſence, and the extreme confuſion of mind, had almoſt obliterated from my memory every trace of thoſe well known features—Oh Mercutio! did you ever expect to ſee what you have this evening?—Tears forbid further utterance. He was immediately unbound, while Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio and Charles endeavoured both by moral and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical arguments to diſſuade him from his deſperate purpoſe—in which they happily ſucceeded. Mercutio offered him his purſe, which he refuſed—ſaying, I have money enough: If that would purchaſe happineſs, I need not be long without it. Being now pretty late,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031902_0027_0FEF3BBB1D8C54C0"/>
when they reached Hyde-Park wall, and having exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a promiſe from George, that he would not attempt to ſhorten his days, either directly or indirectly, they parted, each taking a different route.</p>
            <p>The next day, Mercutio paid a viſit to Lucinda, and Charles having introduced him, retired. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his viſit with manifeſt marks of ſatisfaction on her countenance, which inſpired her lover to avow his paſſion with confidence, which he did in the moſt une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal, yet reſpectful terms, and received an anſwer, which totally eradicated every ſentiment of anxiety from his breaſt,—the moſt perfect tranquillity pervaded his ſoul. His father having returned from Briſtol, he communicated his caſe to him in a letter, couched in the moſt ſubmiſſive and reſpectful terms—relating, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, every circumſtance which had occurred in the firſt of his ſeeing the beautiful object of his love, until that day, and finally requeſting permiſſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his addreſſes to the young lady. This letter he committed to the care of his mother, who was to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate the matter for him. Having diſpatched this part of the buſineſs, it was neceſſary to communicate his wiſhes to the parents of Lucinda. This he reſolved to do in perſon: Accordingly, he ſummoned up all his fortitude, and waited on them for that purpoſe. He was received with the ſame degree of kindneſs which he had experienced ever ſince his acquaintance in that family. When the common topics of the day were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, the ladies withdrew, leaving him, Charles and the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031902_0028_0FEF3BBCB0929DB8"/>
father together. After a ſhort preface, Mercutio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lord S—the motive of his viſit, and earneſtly ſolicited his permiſſion to addreſs his eldeſt daughter on the ſubject of marriage. His reply was ſuch as might have been expected:—I ſhould hold myſelf ungrateful in the higheſt degree, ſaid he, and conſequently highly culpable, if not unpardonable, were I to deny your requeſt; but ſo far from that, I grant it with pleaſure, as to a perſon, of all others, the moſt deſerving: and, I miſtake, or Lucinda herſelf is of the ſame opinion. Mercutio made a ſuitable acknowledgment of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done him, adding, that the pleaſure he experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the preſent occaſion, could only be exceeded by that which he muſt derive from the abſolute conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſired union.</p>
            <p>Not to trouble the reader with a repetition of all the tender epithets, and languiſhing ſpeeches, inſeparable from negociations of this kind—let it ſuffice to ſay, that matters were in a ſhort time ſo forward, that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage articles were drawn—a day appointed for the celebration of the nuptials, and the two families united in the ſtricteſt amity. So far, then, had Mercutio been ſucceſsful; nay, ſo flattering was the proſpect, that he would not have relinquiſhed his claim, to have been made emperor of the world. But, alas! the period was approaching, with haſty ſtrides, in which the moſt gloomy ſadneſs was to uſurp dominion over the empire of his ſoul—when all thoſe gilded ſcenes which then preſented themſelves to the eye of his imagination, were
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031902_0029_0FEF3BBEB3F2C460"/>
to "diſſolve, and like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, leave not a wreck behind."</p>
            <p>A few days previous to that appointed for the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lucinda was attacked with an extreme pain in her left breaſt and ſide. A phyſician being called, ſhe was let blood, and was, apparently, in a fair way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; but the enſuing night, ſhe was ſeized with an intermittent fever; and, in nine days, in ſpite of the moſt ſkilful and ſtrenuous endeavours of ſeveral of the faculty, eminent in their profeſſion, the beauteous Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda reſigned her immortal parts into the hands of Him who gave it, reclining in the arms of her diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late lover, who had ſcarcely eat, drank or ſlept, or even left the houſe, during her illneſs.</p>
            <p>This was a ſevere ſtroke to the afflicted Mercutio! Yet well calculated to teach him reſignation to the will of the Almighty. She was interred in the family vault in St. James's church, on the very day her hand was to have been joined to Mercutio's, who followed her remains, array'd in ſolemn black, which but faintly expreſſed the gloomy ſituation of his mind.</p>
            <p>Having aſſiſted at thoſe rites, which forever ſeparated him from that treaſure, which but a few days before, not all the riches of the eaſt would have purchaſed, he betook himſelf to the moſt profound ſolitude—kept no company—never went abroad, except to ſpend a lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hour in St. James church. One morning early,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031902_0030_0FEF3B4C4F9CFE78"/>
when he repaired to that owful receptacle, and having walked backward and forward for ſome time, with his arms folded together, ſuppoſing himſelf alone, broke out into the following paſſionate exclamations: Oh! my tortured boſom!—Where ſhall my ſoul find peace? Alas, there is none for me on this ſide eternity—no, no, the marble jaws of death hath ſeparated, finally ſeparated me from all the world contained to render me happy! I ſhall never more behold thoſe raviſhing fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which once tranſported my devoted ſoul—where blooming innocence and inimitable beauty contended for pre-eminence—ſhall never liſten to thoſe joy-inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accents, which has ſo frequently fill'd my ſoul with pleaſure unſpeakable! But though the cruel tyrant has ſeparated our bodies, our ſouls can never be divided— that tie is too ſtrong—it cannot—ſhall not be broken. Here, Charles, who had arrived at the mournful ſpot before Mercutio, and had heard the foregoing, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf. Though the time, place and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, had a palpable tendency to render ſolitude more ſolitary; yet it was a matter of conſolation to thoſe young friends to meet, even on ſo mournful an occaſion: For though it was impoſſible for one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the melancholy from the other, yet by interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their griefs, they were enabled to ſupport the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous load more patiently, than they could have done ſeparately. After diſcourſing ſome time on the ſhortneſs and poſitive certainty of the extinction, ſooner or later, of human life, as well as the innumerable avenues lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gloomy manſions of death, that are conſtantly

               </gap>rouded with perſons of all ranks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ages, ſex, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, travelling to the never-ending regions of eternity—they found themſelves inperceptibly betrayed into a train of cheerful ideas, (the natural conſequence of moral and religious diſcourſes) and their melancholy retreated inſenſibly. In this frame of mind, Mercutio requeſted Charles to ſpend the day with him. Taking leave of that awful receſs, they dropt a tributary tear and departed. They ſpent the day in a manner corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with that in which they had began it, taking to their aſſiſtance HERVEY and SHERLOCK, whoſe inimitable works made no ſmall addition to that cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſignation with which their morning diſcourſe had inſpired them.</p>
            <p>Thus did thoſe young men, adopt the moſt proper meaſure imaginable, to fruſtrate the ſecret wiles of the great adverſary of mankind, who is ever ready, on ſuch occaſions, to ſuggeſt doubts of the providence of God, whereby the afflicted, or rather tempted perſons, are ſometimes prompted to precipitate themſelves into ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievable ruin, by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing, uncall'd-for, into the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and immediate preſence of God; "with all their imperfections on their heads."</p>
            <p>Mercutio, finding no reliſh for the reigning pleaſures of the town, and being conſtantly importuned to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the youthful and gay in diverſions, which to him were diſguſting, reſolved to travel, if it ſhould meet the approbation of his parents. He accordingly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031902_0032_0FEF3B46DC0270D0"/>
propoſed it to them—they freely aſſented, in hopes that a diverſity of climate, and the innumerable objects, both natural and artificial, to be met with in making the tour of Europe, might have a happy effect in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving thoſe animated marks of a cheerful heart and vigorous body, which had ever been the leading features in his countenance, until impaired by grief and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>Preparations were made for his intended voyage: He viſited the parents of the much lamented Lucinda. But, it would require ſome of the fineſt ſtrokes and ſtrongeſt colouring that ever proceeded from the pen of the immortal Raphael, to paint the emotions of the whole family, when the moment of ſeparation arrived. Not an eye preſent but ſhed the tear of real affection! Not a heart but palpitated, in perfect uniſon, with the ſoul-dividing pangs of ſeparation. Lord S— and his amiable conſort, claſp'd their departing friend to their noble breaſts, in all the extacy of parental love. Adieu! my dear ſon they exclaimed together. Adieu! my beloved friend and brother, repeated Charles and Charlotte—It was too much for human nature to bear—The organs of ſpeech were mutually arreſted —tears ſupplied the place of words. He ſilently and ſpeedily withdrew, while his agitated limbs were yet capable of ſupporting him out.</p>
            <p>After taking an affectionate leave of his parents, he ſet out poſt for Dover, and embarked on board a packet
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031902_0033_0FEF3B5FF2BA2CF0"/>
at that place, attended by two truſty domeſtics, who had been many years in the family, and arrived at Calais the ſame evening. It is more than probable, that if Mercutio, or his friends, had barely conceived the danger, difficulties, hardſhips and ſlavery, he had to encounter, before they were to meet again, they would have guarded againſt ſo fatal an event with all their powers; but it is more wiſely order'd: man is not permitted to penetrate the unfathomable depths of futurity: he is allow'd a faint glimpſe of the preſent: and, while he retains his faculties, he may, by retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, take an imperfect, ideal view, of ſuch of the paſt as has been ſtrongly marked, and conſequently made a more laſting impreſſion than generally attend the common occurrences of life; but the incidents and objects of futurity are concealed behind an impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cloud, until the unceaſing, undeviating order of nature, ſhall unfold them, individually, in the order in which they may then lie.</p>
            <p>He made no ſtay in Calais, but proceeded to Paris. As he had not much reliſh for coverſation, he intended, while he reſided in Paris, to act the part of a ſpectator only: Of courſe, he took lodgings at a private houſe, in a pleaſant ſituation, where he could enjoy the cool air, undiſturb'd by the rattling of chariots, and the vain pomp of Pariſian grandeur. He attended all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic places of recreation, but carefully avoided culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating an intimacy with any perſon. He wrote to his father and other friends, by every poſt: This, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031902_0034_0FEF3B7215518118"/>
the peruſal of the ſeveral epiſtles from them, (not one of whom neglected to anſwer punctually every one of his) employed moſt of his leiſure time, and afforded him much of that kind of pleaſure, in which he then moſt delighted.</p>
            <p>Being preſent at an auction of pictures, one day, where ſeveral perſons of diſtinction were aſſembled, his eyes involuntarily caught a face which ſeem'd familiar to him: He fixed his attention on the object, and after conſidering him for ſome minutes, found it to be his old acquaintance and fellow-ſtudent, George Wright. Mercutio was a good deal ſurprized at ſeeing him in that place, and ſo richly dreſſed (it being an elegant ſuit, faſhioned in the Pariſian taſte, and richly embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) in ſo ſhort a time after the ſingular affair before recited. He found means to diſcover himſelf to his friend, who, when he recognized him, gave a ſignal to follow, and immediately left the room. When they had got into the ſtreet, Georg, in a very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate manner, took Mercutio by the hand, ſaying, I have joyful news to communicate to you, my dear friend; but we will ſtep into a hotel, where we can diſcourſe in private, and with freedom. There being one within a few ſteps, they entered, when George called for a private room and a bottle of Burgundy. I make no doubt, ſaid George, but you are aſtoniſhed at the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration you perceive in me—but baniſh your ſurprize: The dear girl, of whom I told you the laſt time I had the happineſs of ſeeing you in England, and whom I
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031902_0035_0FEF3BC6CFD6DAF8"/>
conſidered as irrecoverably loſt to me, is now in Paris, and mine by every law, human and divine, and death alone can ſeparate us. Why, you have been very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate indeed, replied Mercutio. Fortunate! Yes, my friend, my good fortune has exceeded my moſt ſanguine expectations; and, be aſſured, my heart vibrates with gratitude to heaven, and you, the happy inſtrument of my ſalvation from eternal infamy and deſpair! Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio expreſſing a wiſh to be informed of the particulars of this apparently unaccountable revolution, George proceeded to gratify it. After I parted with you and your friend at Hyde-Park wall, I went to a friend in whom I could confide, and related my ſtory in a few words, concealing only the reſolution I had taken in conſequence of my father's barbarity, and requeſted his advice and aſſiſtance. Why, ſaid he, it's a critical affair —I'm at a loſs how to adviſe—After a ſhort pauſe— George, ſaid he, I'll tell you what—I will go in the morning to your father, and, without taking any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of having ſeen you, as I am ſomething in his debt, ſettle and pay him off: Then, as he will be obliged to examine the account himſelf, I ſhall have a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to enquire for you, if he does not ſtart it himſelf. This will naturally (as you know our intimacy) bring out the whole tranſaction, in which I ſhall be able to diſcover how the old man ſtands affected towards you. If I find him relenting, I will immediately preſs him to a reconciliation—if not, I ſhall be ſilent on the ſubject: This is all in my power to do, in the preſent ſtate of affairs. In the morning he ſet out—and it is hard to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031902_0036_0FEF3B6CEA6B15C8"/>
determine whether hope or fear was moſt predominant in my ſoul during his abſence; but one thing is certain, that I never ſuffered ſo much uneaſineſs in ſo ſhort a time before. At length he returned—and, to my extreme amazement, announced the inſtantaneous death of my father! And though it might be ſuppoſed, after expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riencing ſuch cruel treatment, I ſhould receive the news of his deceaſe with a degree of ſatisfaction, rather than regret:—But I do aſſure you, this was not the caſe— I ſtood aſtoniſhed for ſome time, and know not how long I ſhould have remained ſo, had not my friend rouzed me from my reverie, by telling me, my preſence was abſolutely neceſſary at home, as my father was a widower, and having no child but me, the af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>airs of the family would otherwiſe ſoon fall into a diſtracted ſtate. Beſides, what would the world ſay, if you ſhould ſo far neglect your duty, as not to provide for and ſuperintend your father's funeral?—Although I was fully ſenſible of the juſtice and propriety of theſe hints—yet I was ſo wrapt in the contemplation of the ſudden ſtroke which had reduced my father to a ſtate of inanimation, that I had forgot every thing elſe. However, not to detain you, I repaired home, where I no ſooner perceived him from whom I derived my exiſtence, lying pale and breathleſs, than, impelled by filial love and duty, I fell on the venerable corpſe, and bathed it with tears— lamenting, in the moſt ſincere and pathetic terms, his premature death, which was occaſioned by a fit of apoplexy. To be brief—in one month after the funeral obſequies were performed, in conſequence of a letter
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031902_0037_0FEF3BC8C030DFB8"/>
from my uncle in Venice, requeſting me to go thither, I applied myſelf to the ſettling my affairs, which to me who had managed my father's buſineſs ſo long, was an eaſy matter.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, after ſettling and paying every legal demand, I found myſelf worth at leaſt forty thouſand pounds. Among a number of bonds, which I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a little box in my father's ſcrutoire, one for five and twenty hundred pounds, on the father of my dear Amelia preſented itſelf. I wrote to him without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, informing him of my intended voyage to Venice, and requeſting immediate payment. The next day, I received an anſwer to my billet, full of conſolatory lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, expreſſing much ſorrow for the loſs I had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſo good a father—requeſting the favour of a viſit, and added, that he could not reimburſe the whole ſum for a few weeks, owing to ſome heavy loſſes he had met with in the public funds, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As I wiſhed for nothing on earth ſo much as one more interview with his daughter, if yet unmarried, ſhould it even be the laſt—a gleam of hope darted thro' my ſoul, and ſuggeſted the idea, that if ſhe was yet ſingle, I might one day be ſo happy as to call her mine.</p>
            <p>I waited on the old man in a few days. He received me with much apparent kindneſs, and to my inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy, introduced me to his daughter, as beautiful, and as much at liberty as when I laſt parted with her—
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031902_0038_0FEF3B37F29883C0"/>
though her father had employed the moſt rigorous means to force her to wed the avaricious, ſuperannuated Iſraelite—yet it was all to no purpoſe—the lovely girl remained inflexible; ſhe choſe rather to endure confinement, nay, even death itſelf, than ſubmit to be joined to a wretch of that deſcription. In the courſe of our converſation, I gave him to underſtand, that I ſhould have immediate occaſion for the money, as I intended to embark for Venice in a few days, having ſettled all my affairs, and that a failure would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental, and perhaps productive of diſagreeable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. He told me, he would endeavour to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it within three weeks, and concluded with a requeſt, that I would not paſs his door as a ſtranger, in the mean time; for as he ever had a great veneration for my deceaſed father, he ſhould think it an honour to be ranked among the friends of his ſon.</p>
            <p>It was eaſy to perceive the old fellow's drift. He was well acquainted with my father's circumſtances, and alſo, that I was ſole heir; therefore, he conceived if he could ingratiate himſelf with me, I would not only marry his daughter without a portion, but alſo releaſe him from the payment of the bond, in which he was not altogether miſtaken; for finding her attachment as ſtrong as ever, I was determined to renew my viſit ſhortly, and demand her of her father in marriage, and if granted, I was reſolved to have celebrated as ſoon as poſſible, without regard to the motives or conditions of his conſent. In ſhort, at the very next viſit I declared
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031902_0039_0FEF3BCACD2A73F0"/>
myſelf to him. He conſented without heſitation, and in ten days more, heaven conferred on me the greateſt bleſſing—my every wiſh. We were married, and the ſame day I reſigned the bond into his own hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration, which pleaſed him exceedingly. George, ſaid he, you have been a dutiful ſon to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed father, and for that reaſon I have given you my only child, and though I have given her nothing on the day of her marriage, all I have will fall to you both when I die, and perhaps I ſhall make as great an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my preſent ſtock, as you could poſſibly, if you had it in your own hands.</p>
            <p>I immediately made the neceſſary preparations for my intended voyage. Having never been in France, I reſolved, in order to ſhow my dear Amelia the manners of the Pariſians, as well as gratify my own curioſity, to take it in my tour: We have been here a month, and expect to ſail for Italy in a few days.—This is all I have to communicate at preſent. Now, I wiſh you to accompany me to my lodgings, where, as long as we remain in Paris, you ſhall be a welcome gueſt. Mercutio conſented, and on the way informed George of his own ſad diſaſter, and of the reſolution he had taken in conſequence. George ſympathized with him in his misfortunes; but at the ſame time, begged him to be conſoled: for, it argues a debility of mind, to faint under the diſpenſations of providence;—true fortitude, you have taught me, conſiſts in a virtuous and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſignation: It is to your animating and well-timed
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031902_0040_0FEF3B2AF54BE008"/>
inſtructions, I owe all my preſent and future happineſs: but for them, I might ere now, have ſuffered an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death. I beg you will not take amiſs what I ſo freely ſay, as it proceeds from a ſincere deſire to ſee you happy; for you may reſt aſſured, there is not a man upon earth, who ſhares with you an equal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my eſteem. No, replied Mercutio, ſo far from it, that I deem it as a particular mark of friendſhip. Mrs. Wright gave her new viſitor a cordial reception. She was very handſome, and poſſeſſed a ſufficient ſhare of good ſenſe, ſo that he was very happy in having met with ſuch agreeable company, and hearing much of the beauty and pleaſant ſituation of Venice, which is ſituated on ſeventy-two ſmall iſlands, in the Adriatic gulph, reſolved to accompany his friend thither.</p>
            <p>Having diſpatched a letter home to advertiſe his friends of his intention, he embarked on board an Italian ſhip, bound to Rome, whither they had a ſhort and pleaſant paſſage. After ſtaying three days in that once fam'd capital, to refreſh, they ſet out by land for Ancona, from whence they ſailed in a ſmall veſſel for Venice. On their arrival, they ſound George's uncle in good health, who received Mercutio with the greateſt politeneſs imaginable. He was at firſt, overjoyed to ſee his nephew; but his tranſport was much abated, when he was informe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:031902_0041_0FEF3B6B5103F118"/>Mercutio, at the earneſt requeſt of the whole family, took up his abode with them during his ſtay at Venice. He viſited all the iſlands in the republic, and every place of public reſort in each, ſo that at length he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his former vivacity, and began to entertain a reliſh for ſociety. The tranquillity of his mind appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed viſible on his countenance, and he frequently ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the young Venetians of quality, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions peculiar to that country.</p>
            <p>The Doge having given an invitation to all the youth of diſtinction in the city (to partake of a ſplendid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to be given in honour of the Doge of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Mercutio was preſſed by a young Venetian of the firſt rank to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him. He complied, and had the honour of danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Doge's daughter, beautiful as Venus, but not a Diana. He was ſtruck with the brilliancy of her charms, but was ignorant of her quality—yet ſuppoſed her the daughter of ſome great perſonage. The higheſt encomiums were beſtowed on him and his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble partner by the two Doges, who were preſent during the whole entertainment. 'Twas late when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany retired, and Mercutio having juſt turned the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſtreet where he lodged, was overtaken by a young female, who delivered him a billet, the ſubſtance of which was couched in the following terms:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:031902_0042_0FEF3BD0639D62C8"/>STRANGER,</p>
            <p>HAVING been ſo happy as to be honored with your hand this evening, I have, for a peculiar reaſon, a ſtrong deſire to have a ſhort interview in private, as I have a matter of great importance to communicate to you. If this meets your approbation, you will attend veſpers to-morrow evening, at the chapel of St. Aloyſius, where the perſon who delivers this will attend, to conduct you to a proper place for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe—if not, deſtroy this, and quit Venice ſpeedily— Perhaps you may find no reaſon to repent a compliance.</p>
            <p>Mercutio having got home, examined the billet, and peruſed it attentively ſeveral times over, juſtly conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it muſt be the lady with whom he danced, that had honored him with this ſingular epiſtle. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhowed the billet to George, and requeſted his advice, adding, he would fain meet the author, if he thought he might do it with ſafety. Why, replied he, I don't imagine you have any cauſe to apprehend dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in meeting her; but a refuſal, it appears to me, if you remain here, may be attended with diſagreeable conſequences. If I was in your place, I would meet her at all events. In conſequence of this advice, he attended at the time and place appointed, where he had not been long, before he obſerved a female, whom he thought the ſame that delivered him the paper. She ſeemed very buſy in examining the features of the whole congregation; at length, fixing her eyes on him for ſome time, and having ſatisfied herſelf as to the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031902_0043_0FEF3BD313C59D70"/>
identity of his perſon, her ſolicitude vaniſhed, and ſhe contented herſelf with a ſlight glance now and then. It was growing duſk when veſpers ended, yet he ſtill obſerved the female loitering about till the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was diſperſed—ſhe then beckoned him to follow her. He complied—and without ſpeaking a word, followed her through many turnings and windings, and juſt as the day cloſed, they arrived at a ſmall wicket, which opened into a ſpacious garden. His conductreſs having admitted him, locked the gate, and conducted him to an elegant ſummer-houſe, where, in a whiſper ſhe told him he muſt wait a few moments, while ſhe went to inform her miſtreſs of his arrival—and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted inſtantly.</p>
            <p>While he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uminating on the ſingularity of his preſent ſituation, his attention was ſuddenly diverted by the ruſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling of ſilk, advancing towards the place where he ſat. He roſe, and advanced to ſalute her— ſhe unveiled at his approach, and returned his ſalute with ardor. She prevented him from ſpeaking by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:—Your condeſcention, ſir, has exceeded my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, which induces me to draw the moſt flattering preſage of our future correſpondence. My preſent conduct may, perhaps, appear to have an air of levity; but I hope I ſhall be able to juſtify it to you, at leaſt; for though cuſtom has rendered it criminal for a female to make advances towards the other ſex; yet nature and reaſon mutually conſpire, to render a diſpenſation with this tyrannical cuſtom abſolutely neceſſary, in ſome
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031902_0044_0FEF3B6993C07138"/>
particular circumſtances. How peculiarly hard muſt that woman's ſituation be, who, poſſeſſing the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adulterated paſſion, and being entirely cut off from all manner of communication with the object of her love, muſt, in obedience to an arbitrary cuſtom, linger out her days in the moſt excruciating torture—not daring to employ the means neceſſary to reſtore her peace of mind. Here ſhe pauſed—but without giving him time to reply, proceeded:—This is the caſe with me—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, your generoſity will, I truſt, plead in my behalf, and ſtimulate you to pardon me, for deviating from the common path, as you are the cauſe, though perhaps never intended or deſired it.</p>
            <p>You ſurprize me, exceedingly, madam, replied Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio; I am not conſcious of having, by any means— No, no, ſaid ſhe, interrupting him, I am convinced you never intended to inſpire me with ſuch tender ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, as thoſe I imbibed on the firſt ſight of you laſt night, and which now and ever ſince that fatal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pervade my ſoul—I ſhould be happy in a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your having come to the entertainment, with ſuch an intention: for then I ſhould have reaſon to hope for a ſuitable return. But, if ſome happier maid has already ſecured your affections, and the avenues leading to your heart thereby eternally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arred againſt me, I cannot—will not long ſurvive the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Mercutio, for the firſt time ſince the death of Lucin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, found his heart powerfully aſſailed on all ſides, by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031902_0045_0FEF3BD4A6FCCDF0"/>
the charms of Leonora, whoſe movements were ſo rapid, that he had not time to collect his forces: What wonder then, if ſhe carried her point by a coup-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main? She requeſted that he would accom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>any her into the houſe—he complied—what man could have refuſed?—Their love became reciprocal—mutual careſſes ſucceeded the moſt unequivocal proteſtations of eternal fidelity, and *********************.</p>
            <p>Man, in the courſe of his peregrination through life, is, and juſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubject to innumerable diſappointments and inquietudes, which act more or leſs powerfully, in proportion as his ſenſibility is more or leſs refined. The ſenſibility of Mercutio was of that kind which is denominated the moſt delicate, conſequently, real ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings made more laſting impreſſion on his mind, than they would probable on one leſs ſuſce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tible: For tho' he did not lack a degree of philoſophy, and reliance on providence, ſufficient to ſupport him under the common accidents of life; yet, like all the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>am, he had a ſpark of that frailty, which, in thoſe receſſes of reaſon when the ſoul is left unguarded, and open to the hoſtile attacks of misfortune, expels both religion and philoſophy, and, by debilitating the mental faculties, abſorbs every idea of happineſs, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents every object, paſt, preſent and future, in the moſt gloomy colours, and in the moſt diſcouraging points of view, by which means perſons un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031902_0046_0FEF3B19D2FEF5F8"/>
which are commonly imaginary. How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably kind and indulgent is Providence in caſes of this nature: For when the mind has experienced any uncommon ſhock, there is always a counterpoiſe placed within reach, ſufficient to prevent the dreadful effects of a mind ſurcharged with grief. This was exemplified in the caſe before us: For had Mercutio remained at home, a variety of objects would frequently have awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the remembrance of Lucinda, and kept his mind in a continual ſtate of dreary ſolitude, if not abſolute deſpair. But by a myſterious concatenation of events, we behold him reinſtated in his former vigour and gaiety —involuntarily engaged in an amour, which, though apparently criminal, is not abſolutely ſo; for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to repair the error he had been ſuddenly betrayed into, by an honorable marriage, as ſoon as a convenient opportunity ſhould preſent.</p>
            <p>The female confidante, before the dawning of the day, gave Mercutio notice it was time to decamp. Though this was an unwelcome piece of intelligence, yet a compliance being abſolutely neceſſary, they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with reluctance, Leonora having previouſly preſſed a very valuable ring on the finger of Mercutio, which ſhe requeſted him to wear in teſtimony of her unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attachment.</p>
            <p>Having propoſed to renew his viſit, on an appointed evening, his female conductreſs eſcorted him to the ſpot where ſhe had met him the evening before, and on the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031902_0047_0FEF3B65273C1140"/>
way, laid down a very judicious and well-conſtructed plan for their future operations, and withal, pointing out the moſt infallible marks whereby he might find the wicket without difficulty or danger of being diſcovered. Having rewarded her honeſty with a few pieces, he repaired to his lodgings, juſt as the dawn of day began to appear, and went immediately to bed, where the ſoft balm of ſleep locked up his faculties, while his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance exhibited a type of death—his imagination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteadily fixed on the object of his love.</p>
            <p>About noon, his friend George waited on him, to whom Mercutio made known every particular of his nocturnal adventure—But pray inform me, ſaid he, if ſo much may tranſpire, in what part of Venice does your fair enamoretto dwell? Indeed, replied Mercutio, I am not able to ſolve that queſtion, though I am of opinion, I could find the houſe; but the way to and from it is ſo intricate, that it would be next to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility for me to point out the particular ſpot, until I make a further diſcovery, which I am determined to attempt this day. But, my dear George, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you to keep this matter a profound ſecret, becauſe I have very cogent reaſons to ſuſpect that the young lady is of an exalted rank, and if the affair ſhould inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ertently be developed, diſagreeable conſequences might enſue. Pardon me for giving you this (perhaps need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) caution, as it does not proceed from a doubt of your fidelity: but from a conviction of the tenderneſs of your connections, which will ſcarcely admit of the leaſt
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031902_0048_0FEF3B50AABE0828"/>
reſerve. For, added he, I have experienced too many proofs of your ſincere attachment, to harbour the moſt diſtant idea of your ſaying or doing any thing that might prove injurious to me, with deſign. George aſſured him he ſhould never abuſe the confidence repoſed in him, by any means, adding, that it would afford him the higheſt ſatisfaction to ſee his friend completely happy.</p>
            <p>After dinner, he ſallied forth, determining to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, by day-light, the mine which contained the ſum of all his earthly treaſure. Accordingly, paſſing thro' all thoſe crooked defiles through which he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the preceding night, ſoon diſcovered the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, which he paſſed with ſome precipitation, and paſſing two angles of the garden-wall, found himſelf in a ſpacious ſtreet, where, running his eye along that ſide of the wall which fronted the ſtreet, he perceived a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between it and a magnificent building, which he rightly conjectured muſt be the houſe he ſought. He was confirmed in this opinion—for, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the oppoſite ſide of the ſtreet, he perceived two young ladies at one of the windows, one of whom was Leonora. She obſerved him, and inſtantly retired.</p>
            <p>He hurried home, and having deſcribed the building, &amp;c. to his friend, was aſſured, it could be no other than the palace of the Doge, and that his miſtreſs muſt be his daughter. This information was received with manifeſt ſatisfaction by Mercutio, who determined to purſue his amour in conſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:031902_0049_0FEF3BD70DD7EA30"/>He carried on his operations with ſuch precaution, that he continued his nocturnal viſits for the ſpace of eight months, when the effects of their illicit commerce began to appear, and to conceal it much longer, would have been a difficult taſk, if not utterly impracticable. This circumſtance, which, in another ſituation, would have heightened their joys into rapture, embarraſſed them exceedingly: But though difficulty and danger ſtared them in the face, neither love, fortitude or inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſerted them in this emergency.</p>
            <p>Speedy and effectual meaſures being abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, they devoted one whole night in deliberating what was moſt proper to be done; and after propoſing and rejecting ſeveral plans, determined, that Mercutio ſhould immediately provide for their tranſportation to England, if poſſible; if not, to ſome other part of the world. In the mean time, Leonora, with the aſſiſtance of Margaretta, her maid, ſhould be ſetting all things in proper train for an elopement at a minute's warning. Theſe preliminaries being ſettled, he returned home, and taking his well-tried friend aſide, made known the project, and earneſtly ſolicited his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>I have a plan in my head, (ſaid George, after pauſing ſome time) which I am of opinion, if adopted, cannot fail of being ſucceſsful. I have a light veſſel lying at a ſmall diſtance from hence, which arrived but yeſterday from Valona, whither ſhe had been with a cargo of merchandize. Now, as the utmoſt privacy is requiſite,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031902_0050_0FEF3B538D0148E0"/>
it would be highly improper to attempt ſailing in any of the veſſels lying in the gulph, except this, as there is not one bound to any port in Great-Britain: I can have her ready in twelve hours, and will carry you down to Oſimo in eight more, from whence you may travel eaſily over land to Naples, in a ſhort time, and remain incog. until your miſtreſs can proceed with leſs difficulty, if you think proper; if not, there are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſhips from every part of Europe, ſo that you may ſail for England when you pleaſe. Now, what do you think of my plan? Why, I think, ſaid Mercutio, nothing could have been ſo fortunate, and it ſhall be put in execution this night, if agreeable to you. The ſooner the better, ſaid he, for it is hardly known that the veſſel has returned, and if we can ſail early in the night, I can replace her in her preſent ſituation by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to-morrow at fartheſt, and ſhall never be miſſed. Theſe reaſons appearing perfectly ſatisfactory, he took leave in order to make the neceſſary preparations for his departure. In the afternoon, they went on board, in order to ſhow the ſervants where to carry the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, as ſoon as it was dark, while Mercutio conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Leonora. After taking a view of the veſſel, and learning the neareſt way to it, they returned to George's houſe, and by the time they had taken a ſlight refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it was duſk. George, offered it as his opinion, that it would be moſt proper to depart without taking a formal leave of the family, adding, that after matters were ſettled, and they arrived in England, he might write to his uncle, and inform him of the reaſon of his abrupt
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031902_0051_0FEF3C2F3AF58950"/>
departure. This was agreed to, and Mercutio ſat out, to pay his laſt viſit at the Doge's, while his ſervants conveyed the baggage on board, and George with his little crew, got up the anchor and unfurled the ſails, ſo that there might be no delay.</p>
            <p>Mercutio found his miſtreſs ready and willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, ſo that they ſoon ſallied out at the wicket, and bidding an eternal, though ſilent farewell to the Doge, proceeded towards the water ſide: The faithful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta bearing a large bundle of wearing apparel, and Mercutio an ebony box, crammed with ducats, which Leonora put into his hands, juſt as they were leaving the houſe, though he was ignorant of its contents until after their arrival at Naples.—They embarked ſafely, having a fine breeze from the weſtward, and a ſtrong current ſetting outward, anchored at Oſimo in ſix hours.</p>
            <p>It happened very fortunate for our adventurers, that George had an intimate friend there, who at that time lay under particular obligations to him. As ſoon as they dropped anchor, George went on ſhore, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired immediately to the houſe of his friend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, that there was a gentleman and his wife on board his veſſel, wiſhing to proceed to Naples, and for particular reaſons, to perform their journey as privately as poſſible, and requeſted him to procure a convenient vehicle to tranſport them. Here, ſaid he, are thirty ducats—be faithful—be diligent. This is but a trifling earneſt of what I will do further for you. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031902_0052_0FEF3BDC614D2968"/>
will correſpond with me during his ſtay at Naples —you will forward our letters with care, ſecrecy and expedition. His friend aſſured him he was happy in being charged with this commiſſion, as it would afford him an opportunity of demonſtrating his gratitude for the many favours he had already received Well, ſaid George, I rely on your word; now come with me and conduct them to your houſe, for I want to ſail im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately—I expect to ſee you again in a few days— in the mean time let nothing extort this ſecret from you.</p>
            <p>George returned on board, and informed his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friend the ſubſtance of his negociation: Then taking an affectionate farewell, thoſe adventurers lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, and followed their new hoſt; while George ſpread the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas to the wind, which at that time had veered round ſeveral points in his favour, ſo that before the day dawned he had remoored and got home to his own houſe—having performed a trip of more than forty-ſix leagues, in ſomething leſs than ten hours and a half.</p>
            <p>Proper apartments being aſſigned for the reception of our adventurers, they tetired to reſt, whilſt the vigilant hoſt went in ſearch of a carriage to convey them to Naples, the enſuing day. Having ſucceeded to his wiſh, he returned, and informed his gueſts, who were then up, and taking chocolate with his wife, a woman of good ſenſe, who informed Leonora, that ſhe had a ſiſter, a widow, in Naples, an approved and experienced midwife, that kept a commodious houſe fitted for the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031902_0053_0FEF3B41A028CDA8"/>
reception of ladies in her ſituation, where they might be accommodated with every thing neceſſary as long as ſhe pleaſed to remain. This was an agreeable piece of information; and her huſband, in order to fulfil his engagements with George, in the fulleſt extent, made a tender of his ſervice to accompany them to his ſiſter in-law's, and negociate the whole buſineſs for them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on their arrival. This propoſal was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy, as it ſeemed exactly adapted to their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; for 'twould have been madneſs to have taken Leonora to ſea, except in a caſe of the moſt preſſing neceſſity.</p>
            <p>They ſtarted next morning with the firſt light, and arrived at the place of their deſtination on the fourth day about ſun-ſet. When they were within two leagues of Naples, their hoſt rode forward to provide for their reception, which having accompliſhed, he met the carriage about half a mile from the city, where they alighted and walked to their lodgings. They received a very cordial welcome from the miſtreſs of the houſe, who was a genteel a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>able perſon. An elegant ſupper was ſerved up, of which our young travellers eat hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and at an early hour were conducted to proper apartments for repoſe.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Mercutio wrote to his friend George, to inform him of their ſafe arrival, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to write as ſpeedily as poſſible, as Leonora was anxious to hear how matters were conducted at Venice,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031902_0054_0FEF3BDF115EBF30"/>
in conſequence of her elopement—well knowing her father's impetuous temper would, in the firſt torrent of his rage, bear down all before it. This letter he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his generous hoſt, accompanied by a purſe of ducats, which, for ſome time heſtrenuouſly refuſed; but on Mercutio's declaring, he ſhould not look on him as his friend, if he did not accept it, with reluctance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, ſaying, heaven knows, I neither wiſhed or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any reward for the trifling pains I have taken to ſerve you—you may reſt aſſured, I would not have done and promiſed what I have on any other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that of ſerving my friend, who informed me, is deeply intereſted in what concerns your welfare. He then departed, with a promiſe to forward all letters that came under his care, to and from him, with the greateſt ſecrecy and diſpatch.</p>
            <p>In five days, Mercutio had the inexpreſſible ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of receiving the following letter from George, by the hand of his late friendly hoſt:—
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>I RECEIVED yours by the bearer, who is faithful and diligent, and am happy to hear of your being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated ſo much to your ſatisfaction. You wiſh to know the conſequence of your departure—I will tell you: I arrived here ſafely, before day, the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after I parted with you. All things remained quiet that day—but there was not a crevice in Venice left unſearched by the enſuing evening. The ſucceſs
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031902_0055_0FEF3BE0E336ADD0"/>
attending the ſearch you are acquainted with. The Doge finding his endeavors to recover his daughter fruitleſs, cauſed ſtrict enquiry to be made, whether any veſſel had failed that night, or ſince, and was informed that a certain ſwift-ſailing ſloop had weighed, and ſtood out to ſea early in the morning, but her deſtination could not be aſcertained. He natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally concluded ſhe was on board the ſloop. A young gentleman, a native of France, had left his lodgings, the houſe of an eminent merchant which ſtood in the ſame ſtreet where the Doge's palace ſtands, where he had reſided for ſeveral months, that very even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It ſeems he had contracted an intimacy with his landlord's daughter, the effects of which began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and although ſhe loved him to diſtraction, and was willing to ſuffer any thing rather than a ſeparation, yet the unfeeling villain abſconded privately, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſailed in the ſloop, leaving the diſtreſſed creature to a fate, which makes me ſhudder at the bare recital. The Doge obtained information of a perſon of this deſcription having eloped, gave peremptory orders to have the merchant and his whole family inſtantly ſeized and brought before him, concluding that their lodger had carried off his daughter, and they of courſe acceſſary: For as yet his ſeducing the merchant's daughter was not ſuſpected. In vain the Doge endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to extort confeſſion from each of them apart, they perſiſted in their innocence: He, therefore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be ſeparately confined till next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, threatning them with the rack if they ſhould ſtill
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031902_0056_0FEF3BE2DF92A058"/>
perſiſt. The next day it was the ſame, but their aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of innocence ſerved only to enrage the Doge. He ordered the inſtruments of torture to be brought into his preſence. The merchant's daughter falling on her knees deplored the Doge to defer the dreadful pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for a few minutes, while ſhe diſcloſed the ſecrets of her ſoul, of which her parents were ignorant. With a look of indignation he ordered her to proceed. Tho' my dear parents and my wretched ſelf ſtand as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in your preſence, my lord, yet I truſt I ſhall be able to convince you of our innocence; yet in ſo doing, I muſt publiſh my own ſhame. If M. de Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delle has robbed Venice of ſo great a treaſure as my lord's daughter, his treachery to me, and ingratitude to my parents, muſt forever acquit us of having been either acceſſaries or principals in the crime. For, know, my lord, the faithleſs wretch had previouſly effected the deſtruction of the hapleſs woman who now addreſſes you:—In a fatal hour I yielded to his falſe promiſes, and by that means rendered myſelf an object of contempt. It is probable, by his artifice, he has found means to ſeduce your daughter, and, knowing my ſituation, perſuaded her to accompany him to France, where it is likely, when ſated with her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he will abandon her as he has me, to all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of infamy and deſpair!—Oh! my unhappy parents! Pardon your wretched daughter—who cannot, will not ſurvive the publication of her diſgrace!—As ſhe pronounced theſe words, ſhe, to the aſtoniſhment of all preſent, plunged a poignant in her breaſt, and expired

inſtantly. Such a horrid ſcene, could not fail to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the mind of the Doge and thoſe of the ſpectators, with a ſtrong conviction of the ſincerity of her confeſſion, as well as of the innocence of her parents. The Doge retired with manifeſt marks of ſorrow and confuſion, and gave immediate orders for the liberation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy parents, who continued bathing the body of their dear, unfortunate child with tears! The next day, the Doge ſent for them, and was cloſeted with them for the ſpace of three hours. The reſult of their conference has not yet tranſpired: but the merchant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who is a native of Spain, with the remains of his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, embarked this morning for Valencia.</p>
                     <p>Since this unhappy affair happened, there has been very little ſaid about it, as the Venetians ſeem willing to conſign the remembrance of ſuch a lamentable cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe to eternal oblivion. Let me intreat you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as quiet as poſſible, during your ſtay at Naples; and as ſoon as circumſtances will admit, to take ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for England.

            <p>At length, the much deſired period arrived—when ſhe was ſafely delivered of a beautiful boy, to the no ſmall ſatisfaction of our hero and his lovely companion. Leonora being diligently attended by her kind hoſteſs, and the faithful Magaretta, was ſoon in a ſituation to undertake the intended voyage. Her ſon, healthful and vigorous, grew exceedingly faſt, and his father's features were ſtrikingly depicted in his face, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance gave birth to the moſt pleaſing reflections i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the minds of his parents.</p>
            <p>Mercutio began immediately to make diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for an Engliſh ſhip; and finding one bound for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpool, bargained with the commander, whoſe name was Nicholſon, for his paſſage. The ſhip waited for nothing but a fair wind, therefore, he was as expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as poſſible, in providing neceſſaries for the voyage, and conveying his baggage on board. Having arranged all his affairs in ample order, nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be done, but to ſatisfy his hoſteſs, and write a farewell epiſtle to his friend George. They devoted the laſt evening to mirth and hilarity; our hero hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing previouſly diſcharg'd his reckoning with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ducats. Juſt as they were ſitting down to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they were ſurpriz'd by the appearance of George and his friend. Mutual ſalutations paſt, George in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031902_0059_0FEF3BEB64205E08"/>
them the cauſe of his journey as follows:— "About three days ago, I was informed by a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian gentleman, a friend of the Doge's, that the Doge of Naples had ſent a very preſſing invitation to the Doge of Venice, to honour him with a viſit, which, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the one he received from him when you were there, as well as the ſtrict amity exiſting between them, he had accepted, and is expected in Naples this evening. I was afraid to commit this piece of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to paper, and therefore ſet out as ſoon as I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly could, in order to let you know your danger: For a diſcovery now, might be attended with dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences."—My ineſtimable friend, replied Mercutio, how ſhall I ever make you a ſuitable return for your diſintereſted exertions in my favour? Unadulterated friendſhip is all you hold worthy your acceptance, and it ſhall be my chief care, to preſerve that inviolate and undiminiſhed. We are, my dear George, to embark for Liverpool to-morrow morning—I have every thing on board, and if the wind ſhould prove favorable, the ſhip will ſail immediately, ſo that if heaven permits, we ſhall ſoon be on the Britiſh ſhore; and, probably, the firſt letter you receive from me will inform you of the celebration of our happy union. May heaven grant you a ſafe, and agreeable paſſage, returned George.</p>
            <p>At a very late hour they retired to reſt, and before the dawn of day, were all aſſembled in the common apartment, where they reiterated their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of eternal friendſhip. Our voyagers taking
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031902_0060_0FEF3B562AA3B5E0"/>
an affectionate leave of their hoſteſs, ſet out, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by George and his friend. The anchor was weighing by the time they got on board, and George, having ſeen them ſafe through the whole of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterprize, wiſhed them a proſperous voyage, and returned to the ſhore.</p>
            <p>Our hero was as happy at the commencement of this voyage, as the nature of the circumſtances would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Leonora too, promiſed herſelf the moſt perfect felicity in the endearing company of her beloved Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio, and with the enchanting prattle of the dear pledge of their mutual affection. Mercutio had previouſly diſpatched a packet to England, to inform his friends of the time of his intended departure from Naples, and in the letter to his mother, he ſignified his intention of bringing with him a Venetian lady, whom he intended to make his wife, with the approbation of his friends, immediately on his arrival in London. But it is the uncontrolable will of heaven, that man, when he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets his origin, and looks up with confidence to ſupreme felicity as already within his graſp, ſhould experience the chaſtiſing rod of affliction, in order to bring him to a ſenſe of his duty—to acknowledge his own imbecility and the omnipotence of that Being, from whom all happineſs, whether in heaven or on earth, muſt flow; and to whom all thanks are neceſſarily due. A ſtriking inſtance of this was exhibited in the caſe before us. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio conceived that nothing could intervene to blaſt the flattering proſpect which had juſt engaged his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention;
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031902_0061_0FEF3BED58AA1A28"/>
but which was on the eve of diſappearing: The fatal moment was faſt approaching, in which all his imaginary joys were to vaniſh, like the fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meteor: The cloud was already collected, and ſuſpending over his head, which was ſhortly to burſt and involve him in miſery. How vain! how trifling! in the view of Omnipotence, are the purſuits of ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ighted mortals;—ever anxious to ſecure happineſs which ſhall be permanent, our imagination is eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the wing; our invention is tortured for ſchemes to ſecure the glittering phantom, and we madly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſubſtance, which thro' life, is conſtantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our reach; and ignorantly purſue a ſhadow, which we never can—never will overtake.</p>
            <p>They had juſt weather'd Comin, on the Iſle of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia, when a moſt tremendous hurricane from the N. W. accompanied with an irreſiſtable current ſetting out of the gulph of Lyons, and violently paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Minorca and Sardinia, drove them, in ſpite of their ſkill and induſtry, into the Streights of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina. The day was juſt cloſing when they doubled the cape, which tended to aggravate the horror of the ſcene which immediately ſucceeded. The awful burſts of thunder, and ſtreams of livid lightning, together with dreadful ſqualls of hail, rain, and wind, ſeemed to threaten a final diſſolution. The whole univerſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in violent convulſions, and the ſhip was hurled about like an egg-ſhell in this elemental conflict, which none but the moſt inſenſible being, could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031902_0062_0FEF3BF0B1F52388"/>
without horror. To adminiſter comfort to Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora was the whole buſineſs of Mercutio, during the ſtorm, and it was with much difficulty he preſerved her from fainting.</p>
            <p>About day light, however, it pleas'd that God in whoſe hand the whole univerſe is but as a grain of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and, to quell the fury of the unfathomable deep—to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the winds; and immediately all was huſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> diſpers'd—the blue concave appear'd in its native ſplendor, and the beams of that glorious diffuſer of light and heat, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed new vigor to the benumbed limbs of the fatigued mariners, and cheerfulneſs once more reigned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſtorm ſubſided, captain Nicholſon ordered all hands to appear on the quarter deck, when both ſeamen and paſſengers beat, in lowly reverence, to that all merciful Being, whoſe aſſiſtance is ever at hand, to relieve and ſupport his unworthy creatures, and offered up the acceptable ſacrifice of grateful hearts, in the moſt unfeigned thanks for his divine protection during the ſtorm, without which they muſt inevitably have periſhed. This done, they began to repair their ſhattered ſails and rigging, which had ſuffered much in the hurricane. Though they were much rejoiced with their late deliverance, their ſatisfaction was conſiderably damped, when the captain found that they were within a few leagues of Malta, and leſs of the coaſt of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031902_0063_0FEF3BF6C669C110"/>
Barbary; and, as the wind ſtill blew freſh from the N. W. it would be exceedingly difficult to keep off the coaſt; conſequently, they would be in continual danger of the rovers, until they made the Streights of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar. They inſtantly braced up, and laid the ſhip as cloſe to the wind as poſſible, ſtood away for the South point of Sicily. They had ſailed only three hours in this direction, when the captain, from the main topmaſt head, diſcovered a corſair, at the diſtance of about three leagues and a half, bearing down on them. Capt. Nicholſon immediately ſhifted his courſe, in hopes of making Puzoli, before the pirate could reach them; but in this he was unfortunately diſappointed; though it is very probable, he might have ſucceded, had his veſſel been in as good ſailing order, as ſhe was before the late ſtorm; but it was impracticable in the preſent ſhattered condition to eſcape—the pirates gained on them every moment.</p>
            <p>When the captain found all his endeavours to eſcape fruitleſs, he told Mercutio, that their liberty, property, and perhaps lives, depended on their courage and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: Therefore, added he, I expect you will lend me all the aſſiſtance in your power. There are three guns on board, which I will load with grape, and bring them to bear in an oblique direction: I have, ſixteen hands beſides myſelf, and you with your two ſervants will make twenty;—we have ſmall arms plenty, with which we muſt endeavour to prevent them from board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us:—For my part, I am determined never to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031902_0064_0FEF3B74CFDE7448"/>
while I have a living man, or a load of ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition on board. We will, continued he, flee fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> them as faſt as we can, as well to gain time to arrange matters, as to amuſe and fatigue them—and when they get within reach of our guns, ſuddenly tack and pour in a volley, which, perhaps, will throw them into diſorder, and if their number and metal does not exceed ours, decide the matter in our favor.</p>
            <p>Mercutio aſſured him, that all the aſſiſtance in his power ſhould be devoted to his ſervice, and they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made the neceſſary diſpoſitions for the event. The pirate, in the mean time, was not idle, but bore down upon them with crouded ſails and oars; and in a ſhort time hailed captain Nicholſon, and ordered him, if he wiſhed to experience any mercy, to bring too immediately, and ſtrike his colours. The captain having all things in readineſs, clapt his helm a-lee, and was about in an inſtant; then poured in a well-directed fire, which killed four of the Turks and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Chriſtian ſlaves, who were chained to the oar. This ſudden, unexpected volley, and the execution performed by it, diſconcerted the pirates conſiderably, but being thirty in number, beſides eight Chriſtians at the oar, they returned the fire vigorouſly, and dropping aſtern, diſcharged ſix double fortified fours into the cabin windows, by which, the unfortunate Leonora, her ſon, and Margaretta, were at the ſame moment, ſent into eternity!—The galley then came along ſide, and the commander levelling his piece at the brave captain
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031902_0065_0FEF3B5A5F11FEA8"/>
Nicholſon, ſhot him through the heart. Mercutio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the conflict, with great firmneſs and courage. The galley having grappled the ſhip, the infidels im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately attempted to board her; but were bravely repulſed—Mercutio, jumping into the mizen chains, cut off, with his hanger, the arms of two Turks, who fell overboard and were drowned. The pirates then made a feint of falling off; but juſt as our hero was ſtepping out of the chains, he received a ball in his right knee, which laid him proſtrate on the quarter deck. The pirates immediately grappled again, and without much reſiſtance, boarded the ſhip, as there were only two men left unwounded. Captain Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſon, his two mates, the carpenter, Mercutio's two ſervants, and five foremaſt men were killed; and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio, the boatſwain, cook, cabin-boy, and three ſailors wounded. The loſs on the part of the Turks, was twelve killed, excluſive of four ſlaves, and three wounded.</p>
            <p>Mercutio's wound bled amazingly, by which means he became inſenſible, and remained in that ſituation till the pirates, perceiving ſome ſigns of life, and judging by his habit, that he was a perſon of diſtinction, had conveyed him on board the galley, and confined him to a ring-bolt, on his back. 'Twas in this unhappy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation he became ſenſible, when, making an effort to riſe, he found himſelf chained hand and foot!—But what words can deſcribe the intolerable anguiſh of his ſoul, when he was informed, by one of his
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031902_0066_0FEF3BF86F9146D0"/>
fellow-captives, of the dreadful fate of the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Leonora and her lovely infant! Had he not been chained faſt to the deck, it is more than probable, that, in the midſt of deſpair, he would have leaped overboard; but finding it impoſſible to move out of the ſpot, he gave himſelf up to immoderate grief! and formed the deſperate reſolution of taking no food, in order, as he expreſſed it, to end his life and miſeries as quick as poſſible.</p>
            <p>The wound he had received having never been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, grew very painful; and being overheated in the action, he had caught a violent cold, which brought on an intermittent fever, ſo that at the time the galley arrived at Algiers, he was actually delirious. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negado who commanded, was a Spaniard, who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercutio a perſon of quality, had him taken to his own houſe, and procured an eminent phyſician, who applied ſuch healing medicines, that in about one month he was reinſtated in his health; but ſtill remained diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate for his beloved Leonora and darling ſon.</p>
            <p>The renegado, perceiving the health of Mercutio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, aſked him ſeveral queſtions relative to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and connexions, and whether he had any expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being ranſomed. Mercutio anſwered, that if a letter could be conveyed ſafely to London, he was ſure of being ranſomed. This was granted, and he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one letter to his father, and another to his friend George Wright.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:031902_0067_0FEF3B3635BA2680"/>The renegado demanded three hundred crowns for his ranſom; and as he had loſt ſeveral of his men in the late engagement, he took our hero and three of his fellow captives on board his own galley, where they were conſtrained to row night and day, chained to the thwart they ſat on. They had no occaſion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form voluntary abſtinence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their food was of the coarſeſt kind, and the quantities ſo ſmall as to be but barely ſufficient to ſupport them in a life of wretched bondage. This cruel ſlavery bore much heavier on Mercutio than his companions in diſtreſs, having never been accuſtomed to hardſhips. His hands were ſoon ſtript of ſkin, yet his mercileſs commanders compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to labour, though the blood ran in ſtreams down the handle of the oar.—He who 'till then, had been clothed with the fineſt production of the loom, had no other covering than a frock and drawers of the coarſeſt canvas, without ſhoes or ſtockings. His feet began to ſwell and grow exceedingly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Three months had elapſed without any news arriving from England or Venice, all hands having been preſſed in the Downs out of the veſſel that had ſailed to England; and the other having foundered off Minorca, and all on board periſhed: However, he obtained leave to write once more to Venice, and, in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bout ſix weeks, received a letter from his friend George, wherein he aſſured him he ſhould have the money in fifteen days without fail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:031902_0068_0FEF3BFA13DE6918"/>The money arrived at the appointed time, with three hundred crowns more than he had requeſted, to furniſh him with clothes and other neceſſaries; and an invitation, to come and reſide in Venice for ſome time. Our hero would willingly have waved going there, well knowing that the very fight of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be a dagger to his ſoul; yet, the regard he had for his friend, and the great and many obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he lay under, ſilenced every objection that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf, and decided the matter quickly. He paid the renegado the ſum demanded for his own ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and two hundred crowns for his three companions in ſlavery, who, with himſelf were immediately liberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He gave the three poor fellows ten crowns each, and told them to make the beſt of their way home; but they finding him going to Venice; begged permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſail on board the ſame ſhip, as they had no chance of getting their paſſage to England, and added, that, when he was gone, the Turks might ſeize and enſlave them again. This he complied with, and they all embarked on board the ſhip in which George had ſent the money, and arrived at Venice in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>Our hero having taken leave of theſe poor fellows, who expreſſed their gratitude to him in the moſt fervent manner, went to ſee his well tried friend, whom he found in health, but not quite ſo cheerful as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having juſt returned from the funeral of his uncle and aunt, who both expired in one day. He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, however, with unaffected kindneſs, which he
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031902_0069_0FEF3BFD6E538EE0"/>
experienced for the ſpace of ſix weeks, the time he remained in Venice; and, having pretty well recruited his health and ſpirits, he reſolved to embark for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland on board the firſt ſhip he could find bound thither. George endeavoured to diſſuade him from his purpoſe, by repreſenting to him the danger of being cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by the French privateers; that nation having entered into an alliance with the States of America: Who had thrown off the Hanoverian yoke, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves Independent; and, under the auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a gentleman of Virginia, (George Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton) who had given indubitable proofs of his bravery and ſkill in tacties, in former wars between France and England, were bravely ſtruggling againſt the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic arms of Great-Britain, in ſupport of the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible Rights of Man.</p>
            <p>Mercutio, however; was not to be diverted from undertaking, his intended voyage: Diſconſolate for the loſs of Leonora, and weary of the repeated viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of his adverſe fate, he reſolved to attempt a paſſage to England at all events.</p>
            <p>George finding it to no purpoſe to perſiſt, urged the matter no further; but procured a veſſel, and furniſhed him with a ſum of money, more than ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray every expence. In a ſhort time he was ready to embark, and having taken leave of his kind friends, with the moſt grateful acknowledgment for all paſt favors, and promiſing to remit the money George had
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031902_0070_0FEF3C034A3F3310"/>
ſo freely advanced for his ranſom, &amp;c. by the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity after his arrival in London, once more bid adieu to Venice.</p>
            <p>Fortune favoured them with proſperous gales and pleaſant weather; and in a few days, they were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly waſted within ſight of the Lizard. Mercutio, for the firſt time, ſince his redemption from captivity, became cheerful. He experienced that kind of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which the hopleſs mariner, who, having been deprived the fight of land or ſunſhine for many days, and all the time threatened by the devouring waves, to be buried in the bowels of the deep, is ſuddenly wafted into the deſired haven.</p>
            <p>They arrived, and moored off Deal without an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Mercutio propoſed hiring a poſt-chaiſe, and to ſet out for London the next morning. But alas! Fortune, that fickle goddeſs, had raiſed her foot with a deſign to give him another kick. Preſs-warrants were out for raiſing ten thouſand ſeamen; in conſequence of which, a lieutenant and forty ſeamen boarded the ſhip, about midnight; and, ſlipping down between decks, made prize of the whole crew, and among the reſt, Mercutio.</p>
            <p>Reſiſtance would have been as vain as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, they therefore made a virtue of neceſſity, and ſubmitted to be conveyed on board the Otter, (a tender) where they remained for ſome days, and then put on board the Iſis, of 50 guns, at Spithead. They were welcomed on board with three cheers from the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031902_0071_0FEF3C04DD1A0AF0"/>
whole crew. The lieutenant who had preſſed them, cauſed plenty of grog to be diſtributed among the new hands: This done, he ordered the boatſwain's mate to bring them aft, where he read over the articles of war; after which, he entertained them with the following eloquent ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The major part of the preſſed men accepted this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite invitation, while he continued to diſplay his rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal powers:—"Come, my brave meſs-mates, now is the time to EXTINGUISH yourſelves in OFFENCE of your king and country—There an't a man in England but muſt turn out now, d—n me, either by ſea or land; and, for my part, I'd rather be an under-turnkey in hell, than a SOGER, d—n me if I had'nt."</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031902_0072_0FEF3B21531A5D98"/>This animating oration had a great effect on the tar-pawlings; for as he very juſtly obſerved, there they were, and there they were like to remain, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, might as well comply as not—ſo they generally took his advice. Adverſe as Mercutio's fate appeared, he did not abſolutely deſpair of procuring his liberty, if he could gain acceſs to the commander; but found, on enquiry, that he was on ſhore. Finding no officer on board ſuperior to this loquacious ſon of Neptune, he reſolved to ſolicit his aſſiſtance in remitting a letter to London. Having executed this reſolve, this patriotic officer gave him the following anſwer:—"I'll tell you what, meſs-mate, you may write a letter to Lunnan, but I'm d—'d if I think it will be of any ſervice to you. However, if you think it will do you any good, as you have the look of a clever fellow, I'll ſpeak to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer for pen, ink and paper for you; and when I go aſhore to night, I'll clap it in the poſt-office. But God knows when or where we ſhall ſail—we may ſail to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, and mayhap we may'nt this month, d'ye ſee." Mercutio thanked him for his civility, and told him he would ſatisfy him for his trouble. He went down to the purſer, and ſoon returned with a quire of paper, an inkſtand, and a parcel of pens; and beckoning to him, in a vociferous tone, ſaid, "Meſs-mate, come down into my cabin, and there you may write as much as you pleaſe—here's pen, ink, and paper enough to ſet the whole world in an uproar—Old Singe-the-Devil, d—n his old froſty face, charged me four ſhillin for this roll of paper: He never thinks he has enough for any

            <p>Our hero put his hand in his pocket, and pulling out ten dollars, preſented them to the lieutenant, which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our hero paid very little attention to what he ſaid, but ſat down on a cheſt, and wrote a very preſſing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his father, informing him of the deſperate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances under which he lay, and earneſtly requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to employ all poſſible means to obtain his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe. Having delivered the letter to his friend the lieutenant, he grew cheerful, and began to cheriſh the hope of being yet reſtored to his friends, without being forced to ſea again. But Providence, it ſeems, had otherwiſe decreed. The next morning, very early, orders came on board, for the Iſis, with two frigates, and ſome tranſports, to weigh, and ſail the next tide. Their deſtination was to ſome part of the Continent; but as the ſpecial orders were ſealed, and not to be opened till they had got into a certain degree of latitude, the particular port was unknown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:031902_0074_0FEF3C09A1A07D70"/>The captain and officers who had been on ſhore, came on board ſoon after the ſailing orders, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio made application, by letter (through his friend the lieutenant) for a diſcharge—but without effect: In vain he repreſented the ſufferings he had endured in Algiers, from whence he had been ſo lately redeemed —he was deaf to his entreaties: All the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he received, was, that if he behaved well, he might make his fortune before the war was over.</p>
            <p>Finding all his efforts defeated, he conſigned himſelf to his fate. His countenance became gloomy and thoughtful; and had he remained long in that ſtate, it is more than probable, he would have degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a moſt unſocial being—ſo, true it is, that the ſweeteſt temper may be ſoured by frequent repulſes and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments.</p>
            <p>The neceſſary preparations being made, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor was weighed; the ſails extended to the expanding gale; and with drums beating, trumpets ſounding, colours flying, and every other demonſtration of naval joy, they took their departure.</p>
            <p>Satisfaction appeared conſpicuous on every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance on board, except that of Mercutio's, which was impreſſed with marks of the deepeſt melancholy.

had never taken notice of Mercutio till they had been a full week at ſea. This gentleman obſerving him in a penſive attitude one day, at the ſame time remarking, that he had not the leaſt appearance of a ſeaman; enquired of the ſecond lieutenant who he was, and from whence he came.</p>
            <p>Being informed of this, and that he had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly releaſed from the Algerines, he was impatient to have ſome diſcourſe with a perſon of ſo ſingular a deſcription. He wrote a billet, and ſent it by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin-boy, requeſting a ſhort interview. Our hero, after peruſing the billet, ordered the boy to conduct him to the perſon who had ſent him: He followed, neither knowing nor caring who it was that deſired the interview. On entering the cabin he ſaluted the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant with a very low bow, who inſtantly aroſe, and taking our hero by the hand, very politely returned the ſalute. But what words can paint the amazement and joy of Mercutio, when in the features of the lieutenant he recogniſed thoſe of his beloved friend Charles, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda's brother! Charles inſtantly recollected his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—and ruſhing into each others arms, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with mutual tranſport, without uttering a ſyllable: The ſudden ſhock of joy having ſhackled their organs of ſpeech for ſeveral minutes.</p>
            <p>Mercutio firſt recovering his ſpeech ſaid, My dear Charles, my tongue would but diſcover its impotence in attempting to deſcribe the pleaſing ſenſations which pervade my ſoul, on this occaſion—to meet a friend

ſo much eſteemed, after ſo long and painful a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is a happineſs ſo unexpected, that my weak frame, fatigued and emaciated, with trouble, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and melancholy, is almoſt unable to ſuſtain the ſudden ſhock, which, like the ſwift winged, livid lightning, has penetrated the very centre of my ſoul—ſtunned my whole fabric—and unhinged all my ſenſes. But tell me, what good genii ſent you here, to adminiſter the balm of conſolation to my diſtracted ſoul? My beloved, reſpected friend, replied Charles, the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior pleaſure which this happy interview affords me, would have been incapable of augmentation, had it not been damped by your hint of "trouble, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and melancholy," which your countenance too clearly demonſtrates to have been your companions. What dreadful reverſe of fortune can have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the peace of my friend? If there is any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of my power that will, in the ſmalleſt degree, contribute to your eaſe or ſatiſfaction, only-mention it: Command my purſe—enjoin me to any thing I am capable of, and you ſhall ſee with what willingneſs I will exert all my powers to reſtore your peace of mind.</p>
            <p>Mercutio, after making him ſuch an anſwer as his unbounded, diſintereſted offers merited, related the whole of his adventures, from the time they parted laſt, in London, till they met on board the Iſis: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing, however, his amour with Leonora.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:031902_0077_0FEF3C0FA4BC2108"/>Charles generouſly ſympathized with him in all his misfortunes, promiſed to render him all the ſervice in his power, and to repreſent his caſe to the captain, who, notwithſtanding his profeſſion, was a gentleman of the niceſt feelings, and moſt diſtinguiſhed merit; and, added he, if the fleet is detained on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can coaſt, I think I have influence enough with him to procure your diſchage, and you can ſail from New-York to England at any time, as packets are conſtantly going and coming. Mercutio made him a genteel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment for his intended favours; but declared, that ſince fortune had brought them together once more, he was determined to accompany him through the whole courſe of the expedition.</p>
            <p>Charles expreſſed the higheſt ſatisfaction at this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, and proteſted that no event could have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that could give him equal pleaſure.—Mercutio then deſired to be informed of his friend's reaſon for making choice of a ſea-faring life, together with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral narrative of his tranſactions during their long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. I ſhall with pleaſure gratify your curioſity in that point, replied Charles, but muſt beg leave to wave it for the preſent, and filling a glaſs of wine, preſented it to Mercutio, ſaying, Come, my friend, you muſt endeavour to conſign the remembrance of your late misfortunes over to eternal oblivion—you are now among as lively a ſet of fellows as the world can produce:—They hope every thing—fear nothing—and drink punch, grog and phlip, like ſo many fiſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:031902_0078_0FEF3C1147F0E1F8"/>Having taken a cheerful glaſs, they went upon d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>k, when Charles, taking him by the hand, preſented him to the captain as his particular friend; and, in a few words, informed him of the moſt intereſting parts of his adventures. The captain congratulated our hero on his releaſe from the infidels, and at the ſame time lamented the neceſſity of preſſing men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately: He concluded, with promiſing him a total exemption from all manner of duty while he continued on board; together with permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to England by the firſt opportunity, and ample protection from all preſs-gangs during the war.</p>
            <p>From that time Charles and Mercutio eat, drank, and ſlept together; the officers vied with each other in a genteel treatment to him, and the captain became his firm friend. Theſe fortunate circumſtances produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt agreeable change in his countenance and converſation. One fine evening, when the ſurface of the immenſe ocean, calm and ſerene, reflected the glittering rays of that glorious luminary, the ſun, with redoubled ſplendor, Mercutio, with his friend was ſurveying and admiring the liquid green which every where ſurrounded them, boundleſs! reiterated his requeſt.

your travels, I have experienced many hard ſtrokes myſelf.</p>
            <p>"Some time after your departure, Auguſtus Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, ſon of Sir Edward Davenport, of Oxfordſhire, having ſeen my ſiſter Charlotte, at my uncle's ſeat, which lies contiguous to Sir Edward's, where ſhe was on a viſit, came to London, and reſided with his brother in-law, Sir Benjamin Godfrey. As his journey to the metropolis, was undertaken with a view of ſetting on foot an hymeneal treaty between him and my ſiſter, he engaged Sir Benjamin, (knowing the great friendſhip exiſting between him and my father) to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, and aſſiſt in the courſe of the negociation with his recommendation and advice.—He was ſhortly permitted to pay his addreſſes to Charlotte—When matters were nearly ripe, Auguſtus took leave for ſome time.—He returned, accompanied by his father and—a ſiſter—That ſiſter!—Oh Mercutio! do not ſuppoſe yourſelf unfortunate!—But I'll proceed: The marriage contract being ſanctioned with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all parties, they were married, to the great ſatisfaction of both families.</p>
            <p>"After ſtaying ſix weeks in town, Sir Edward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed returning to his country ſeat; and, as Auguſtus after tarrying a while at his father's, intended to take his wife to a ſeat which Sir Edward had lately purchaſed and promiſed to give him whenever he ſhould enter the bands of wedlock, the old knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031902_0080_0FEF3C13C984E3C0"/>
or rather inſiſted, that I ſhould accompany them thither. I acquieſced, being prompted by more powerful motives than thoſe produced by his invitation.</p>
            <p>"We ſat out, all on horſe-back, and had a very agreeable ride to Sir Edward's, who treated us nobly for the ſpace of one month, at the end of which, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus prepared to go to his own ſeat. I, as well as his ſiſter, accompanied them. But, now, Mercutio, your repeated misfortunes, though great, will quickly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when you hear the ſequel—I might almoſt ſay with the Ghoſt of Hamlet:

            <p>"This daughter of Sir Edward was, I believe, a model of beauty and apparent innocence. She poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed every accompliſhment neceſſary to render a woman lovely, and the undivided poſſeſſion of her, a peculiar bleſſing. I have frequently when in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, contemplated on her perfections with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And, I verily believe, if any man had told me then, of the fatal change which has ſince taken place in her, I ſhould have been ready to run him through. This enchanting paragon, without intention, or even ſuſpicion, eſtabliſhed ſo abſolute a dominion over my ſoul, that the very thought of parting with her, was as daggers to my heart!—I addreſſed her on the

ſubject—ſucceeded to my wiſh—and, we were married. But ah! what bitter reflections does the remembrance of that curſed union awaken in my ſoul! One year I lived with her in ſo great a degree of felicity, that I would not have exchanged my ſituation for all the riches of the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>"She wiſhed to viſit her friends at Oxfordſhire—I conſented; for what could I refuſe to her whoſe breaſt was the repoſitory of my ſoul?—We found Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in good health; and after ſtaying a few days, proceeded to the ſeat of Auguſtus, where we arrived juſt as Charlotte had made her firſt appearance at church after the birth of a beautiful boy.</p>
            <p>"While we remained there, all the neighbouring gentry for ſeveral miles round, came to congratulate the young couple on the birth of an heir. Among thoſe who appeared the moſt aſſiduous, was Charles Howard, ſon to a noble Earl, who I afterwards found, had been acquainted with Louiſa Davenport, from her infancy, but had not ſeen her during the laſt five years. This perſon, though a villain of the firſt magnitude, had nevertheleſs, by long practice in the inſidious arts of ſeduction, become an adept in diſſimulation, ſo that he had actually ſecured the good opinion of every perſon of condition in and about Oxfordſhire—conſequently, was received into all parties of pleaſure with a hearty welcome; and was never parted with but with regret. He was remarkably aſſiduous in congratulating myſelf
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031902_0082_0FEF3B2FAEE68FB0"/>
and wife on our late union, and at length received an invitation to pay us a viſit in London.</p>
            <p>"One evening, as I was ſitting with my wife, in one of the ſide-boxes of Drury-Lane theatre, Howard entered the ſame box, and ſeated himſelf over againſt us; my wife knew him inſtantly, and welcomed him to London. He ſeemed ſurprized at this meeting—I immediately recollected his features, and roſe to ſalute him—he returned the ſalute in a very polite manner, and ſeating himſelf on our ſide, informed us in a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he had juſt arrived in town. My wife and he began a whiſpering dialogue; the ſubject of which was on her part, an enquiry about the people in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire.</p>
            <p>"The play being ended, he very politely took leave, having previouſly received an invitation to pay us a viſit the firſt opportunity, which he promiſed to obſerve.</p>
            <p>"Some ſhort time after, he paid the viſit; but as I happened to be abroad, I was deprived of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing him; which, I ſuppoſe, was no diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: For I have every reaſon to think my wife entertained him to his ſatisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>"Conceive, Mercutio, if you can, the ſituation of my mind at that inſtant. I never experienced ſuch a ſtruggle between love and revenge before. I retired to a tavern, where I ſealed the letter, and returned it to the porter. After enjoing him to the moſt profound ſecrecy, I paid him the promiſed reward, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>"I ſhould certainly have wreaked ray vengeance on the faithleſs wretch, but for the deſire of puniſhing her
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031902_0086_0FEF3B7F7B4C4C40"/>
co-partner in guilt, with my own hand. My mind was ſo violently agitated for ſome hours, that I found it impoſſible to form any reſolution. After taking a ſerious retroſpect of the matter, I determined to go home— behave as uſual, if poſſible—mark critically every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and from the reſult form my determination.</p>
            <p>"Having ſettled this in my mind, I walked about till duſk, by which time I had pretty well compoſed myſelf, and then returned to my faithleſs wiſe; who, Judas like, received me with a kiſs. I was obliged to feign a ſlight indiſpoſition, in order to avoid ſuſpicion, as well as to procure an opportunity to ſtifle my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſilence.</p>
            <p>"The next day I ſtaid at home till after five in the evening, and perceived as the evening approached, ſhe grew very uneaſy—frequently aſking me if I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed. She alſo put me in mind of an aſſignation I had made, to meet ſome friends at White's that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which I had abſolutely forgot. When ſhe mentioned this, I told her I would go. Accordingly I departed, apparently in a hurry. I walked down the ſtreet precipitately, and ſlipped into a tavern, poſted myſelf at a window which commanded a full view of my houſe; ſo that nobody could have entered unperceived by me.</p>
            <p>"I had not remained long, before I obſerved a man in a ſcarlet cloak, knock at my door: He was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031902_0087_0FEF31B401E89238"/>
inſtantly; and though I could not be certain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was the mark I was aiming at or not, it being then duſk; yet determined I was to know who he was, and his buſineſs there.</p>
            <p>"Juſt as I got to my own door, I met one of my ſervants coming out: I aſked him if any company had come that evening. He ſeemed ſurprized, but replied, he knew of none—adding, that Jenny (the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid) had let ſomebody in a few minutes ago, and on his aſking her who it was, ſaid it was her maſter. This was enough: I made no delay, but going in, ſhut the ſtreet door, locked it, and putting the key in my pocket, proceeded cautiouſly up ſtairs.</p>
            <p>"I liſtened a moment at the door, and heard enough to convince me of my diſhonor. In a degree of rage bordering on madneſs, I burſt open the door! They were on the bed:—I drew inſtantly, and calling him baſe villain—curſed traitor, with many other epithets of the ſame kind, ordered him to riſe and defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as I was determined to loſe my life or puniſh his perfidy with death. He roſe with apparent reluctance, and drew his ſword, which lay on the table, and put himſelf in a poſture of defence. After a few paſſes, I left him for dead on the floor—having run him quite through the body. Turning to my faithleſs wife, Madam, ſaid I, though you deſerve a ſimilar fate, yet I forbear the ſacrifice: Perhaps you can find ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erfuge to vindicate your conduct to the world; but
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031902_0088_0FEF31B59CE1A570"/>
conſcience will not be impoſed on. I therefore leave you to the ſtings of that monitor.</p>
            <p>"Before I left the houſe, I ordered a ſervant to go for a ſurgeon, that if the wretch had any remains of life, he might be ſaved if poſſible. Whether he lived or died I know not. I went immediately to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, and in as few words as the circumſtances would admit, informed him of the whole tranſaction. He was much alarmed, told me I had acted extremely wrong in committing ſuch a raſh and deſperate act: However, as the thing was done, and as it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for me to diſappear ſpeedily, for ſome time at leaſt, he immediately wrote a letter to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, with whom he was intimately acquainted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting him to appoint me to ſome poſt on board one of his majeſty's ſhips; at the ſame time giving him ſome hint of the cauſe of his making the requeſt. He then gave me one thouſand guineas, and bank notes to four times that amount; to which he ſubjoined his bleſſing, with tears, as did alſo my honored mother: Both of them lamenting with me the fatal cauſe of the diſagreeable ſeparation.</p>
            <p>"I inſtantly took horſe for Portſmouth, attended by a ſervant who is now on board. The admiral received me in a very polite and friendly manner; and when he had read the letter, told me, he was very ſorry it was not in his power to ſupply me with any thing higher than a firſt lieutenancy, of a fifty gun ſhip, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031902_0089_0FEF3B24FB3C7978"/>
better in his gift; but aſſured me of the firſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy. He then preſented me with the commiſſion immediately; and now, ſaid he, I will give you the orders for ſailing, as that fleet muſt ſail with the firſt fair wind. The ſecretary copied the orders, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, after ſealing, delivered them to me, together with a letter from the captain.</p>
            <p>"The wind being fair when I came on board, the captain, on reading the admiral's letter, hoiſted the ſignal for ſailing. What has taken place ſince, you know already. And now, you muſt confeſs, that I have had no ſmall ſhare of misfortune—nevertheleſs, I endeavour to eradicate the impreſſions it has made in my mind; 'tis true, the reflection gave me much uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for two or three days, but I find myſelf quite eaſy and cheerful now."</p>
            <p>Our hero readily perceived, that the misfortunes which he had experienced, were by no means equal to thoſe of his friend. He highly commended Charles's reſolution of leaving his wife to the ſevere laſhes of her own conſcience, which, he obſerved, would probably be productive of better effects, than any corporal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment that could have been deſired.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happened in the courſe of the voyage. They arrived at Quebec in May 17. After landing their troops, marines, proviſions, &amp;c. Sir Guy Carlton gave orders for the ſhips to be cleared,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031902_0090_0FEF3C22C98E0B80"/>
and repaired, if neceſſary, and to ſail into a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and their cruize in order to intercept the French fleet. They were ready to ſail in ſixteen days. Their force conſiſted of two fifty gun ſhips, and three frigates, all well manned and fit for either offence or defence.</p>
            <p>The captain of the Manheim, of fifty guns, dying at Quebec, Charles was appointed to the command; in conſequence, our hero leſt the Iſis, and accompanied his friend.</p>
            <p>The period was approaching, in which our two friends were to be once more ſeparated:—The thick and gloomy clouds of adverſity were already collected, ſuſpended over, and ready to burſt on the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fortune had laviſhed her favors profuſely on the king of England; but the meaſure of his iniquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full to the brim, the goddeſs took offence at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary proceedings of the imperious monarch, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with Bute, North, Sandwich, and ſeveral others of the ſame ſtamp, and was determined to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their arrogance, by taking into her protection the oppreſſed, much injured Americans, whoſe deſtruction was meditated, and every meaſure that appeared likely to effect it, adopted in London, for no other reaſon than that they would not tamely ſubmit to be plundered of the fruits of their virtuous labour.</p>
            <p>This favorable turn of affairs reanimated the fainting Americans, who laboured under every diſadvantage but want of bread, courage, and a good General.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:031902_0091_0FEF3C1E2B38CDD8"/>In England it had a different effect. The King and his ſycophantic train were utterly confounded; for they had never dreamt of reſiſtance in America. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected implicit obedience to their commands and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, however tyrannical or unjuſt. But the ſequel demonſtrated their miſtake; and had ſo remarkable an effect on George, that he became inſane, and it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful whether he is yet rational or not.</p>
            <p>This fleet had not cruized long before they diſcovered five French and two Spaniſh ſhips of war, bearing down with crowded canvas: The two latter were in the ſervice of France. A council of war was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately called on board the Iſis, wherein it was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack the French (they were all under French colours) as ſoon as ever they came within gun-ſhot. Accordingly, the neceſſary diſpoſitions being made, the two large ſhips bore up in front, in order to ſuſtain the firſt ſhock of the enemy's fire. The frigates at the ſame time dropt aſtern, with orders to act as opportunity or neceſſity might require. Every man ſtood at his ſtation, with his eye fixed attentively on the approaching enemy —not a whiſper could be heard on board. The fleets advanced to the conflict, with ſilent rapid motion. What an awful ſituation! where thouſands of human beings ſtand on the very verge of eternity! ſtand ready to diſcharge the dreadful meſſengers of death among their fellow-creatures! Surrounded by the devouring ocean: Dreadful abyſs! ſhocking idea!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:031902_0092_0FEF3B324DFC9CB8"/>The French commander call'd to the captain of the Iſis to ſtrike, otherwiſe to expect no quarter. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he wiſhed for no quarter, and that if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to capture the Engliſh fleet, he muſt kill him firſt, for he was determined never to ſurrender while he had a living man on board. He had no ſooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced theſe words, than he gave orders to pour in a broadſide, which was performed with alacrity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no leſs vigorouſly. The fight ſoon became ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Chain, grape and langridge, flew like hail. Maſts, yards, fails and ſhattered rigging, covered the foaming ſurface of the ocean, which, from the moſt beauteous green, was converted to a crimſon hue.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh tars, it muſt be acknowledged, fought with unparelleled bravery. Pity it had not been in a better cauſe. One of the Engliſh frigates taking a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the ſmoke to leeward, ran under the ſtern of a French ſhip of ninety guns, poured in a heavy broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, which raked her fore and aft, and ſet her on fire, which was never extinguiſhed till ſhe was burnt down to the water. The frigate wore as ſhe diſcharged the broadſide, and recovered her poſition without injury or difficulty.</p>
            <p>Juſt at that inſtant, a two and forty pounder pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the Blenheim, between wind and water, and was on the point of ſinking before the leak was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered—all hands were employed in repelling the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, and therefore paid no attention to any
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031902_0093_0FEF3C245D22ADE0"/>
thing elſe. At the ſame inſtant, the brave commander of the Iſis was deprived of his head and right hand by a chain-ſhot. Before there could be any ſtop put to the leak, the Blenheim ſunk, having three hundred and fifty met on board. Mercutio and Charles were on the quarter-deck when it went down: The principle of ſelf-preſervation prompted the former to ſeize a large hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coop, which had worked looſe, by ſome means, ſo that when the ſhip ſunk, it bore him up.</p>
            <p>After having been toſſed about for ſome time, in the midſt of this dire conflict, he, with nine of his ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, was taken into a boat belonging to one of the Spaniſh ſhips, immediately conveyed on board and hand-cuſſed two and two.</p>
            <p>They had ſcarcely got on board, when one of the French ſhips blew up—and while a ſecond ſhared a ſimilar fate with the Blenheim, the fierceſt flames de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the ſails, rigging, and hull of a third. The exploſion was dreadful; and a more horrid ſcene was never deſcribed. Legs, arms, heads, whole bodies, blood and brains, were hurled in the air, in awful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The diſtracted French ſailors were ſeen jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſea, to eſcape the more excruciating tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of being conſumed by fire. The flames having communicated to another of the French ſhips, which encreaſed the horror of the ſcene. The two ſurviving ſhips took to precipitate flight. The Engliſh made a feint of purſuit, but being in a ſhattered condition, gave
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031902_0094_0FEF3C27496770B0"/>
a great ſhout, accompanied with three times three cheers, hove about and let them go. On their return, they took up ſeveral of the miſerable wretches that had eſcaped the flames, and ſome few who had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from ſinking with the Blenheim.</p>
            <p>The French commander ſteered away for Breſt, and preſſed the Spaniard to accompany him; but he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed—ſo bore away for Bilboa, a rich ſeaport in Spain. On their arrival, Mercutio, with his fellow-priſoners, were confined in a noiſome dungeon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light or freſh air; the damp ground for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bed, and a very ſcanty allowance of courſe bread and water, for their ſubſiſtence. In this deplorable ſituation, they remained for the ſpace of three months, in which time ſix of the unhappy captives expired; for the horrid ſtench of their own ordure, which was never removed during their confinement, added to their want of food and freſh air, introduced a malignant diſeaſe among them, under which, thoſe attacked by it, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in extreme torture, about three days, and then expired. The wretched ſurvivors, envied their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting fellow-ſufferers, and earneſtly invoked the powers of heaven to haſten their diſſolution—their bodies were ſo emaciated by the combined force of grief, want and diſeaſe, that they reſembled ſkeletons more than living men. Mercutio, however, in ſpite of all theſe, ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ered nothing more than want of liberty and food; for his appetite ſtill remained, and although re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced almoſt to nothing, was ſtill healthy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:031902_0095_0FEF3C293827DAC0"/>It happened, fortunately for our hero, that a Spaniſh nobleman having heard of the priſoners, made applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the chief magiſtrate for leave to ſend them to his villa, in order to aſſiſt at digging a canal, which was already begun, through an extenſive park, where a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of labourers where then at work.</p>
            <p>The nobleman obtained his requeſt, on certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and diſpatched a domeſtic with the magiſtrate's order to releaſe them. When they were brought out, and their chains taken off, they concluded, they were going to be put to death. True it is, death never received a more hearty welcome, than theſe men would have given him. However, this was not the caſe, they were conducted immediately to the villa, whither the nobleman had already gone. When he was apprized of their arrival, he ordered them to be brought before him.</p>
            <p>He was aſtoniſhed at their appearance, and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much indignation at the treatment they had received, generouſly commiſerated their misfortunes, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commanded plenty of good food to be given them, after forcing them to drink a large glaſs of wine, each in his preſence. His orders were punctually obeyed, and two of the poor creatures inſtantly fell victims to the gratification of their raging appetites: They expired in ſtrong convulſions, while Mercutio and the other wretched ſurvivor, remained inſenſible for ſeveral hours. The nobleman, however, whoſe name was Don Diego de Guzman, ſent for a phyſician,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031902_0096_0FEF3B768D37C618"/>
who, in a few days, by the application of ſalutary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and nouriſhing, though ſimple food, reſtored them to perfect health. After being ſhaved, waſhed, and putting on clean linen, they began to wear the aſpects of men again; but were ſtill weak.</p>
            <p>They were ſent in company with ſeveral other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers to digging the canal; here, though they eat their food by the ſweat of their brow, yet, having plenty that was good, with a quart of wine each man per day, they recovered ſtrength ſurprizingly, and began to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence much ſatisfaction. Mercutio, had he not been greatly affected with the idea of the death of Charles, would probably have been tolerably happy; for having experienced ſo many turns of fortune, he had become in ſome meaſure, habituated to croſſes and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore, though his ſituation, at that time, was by no means a deſirable one; yet it effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him from the attacks of envy, and from falling into thoſe exceſſes to which young men are expoſed; the effects of which, are galling remorſe, tormenting reflections, and very frequently, infamy. He therefore, in gratitude, returned thanks to the Supreme Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of every event, for the meaſure of contentment he ſtill poſſeſſed, in the enjoyment of ſound and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted health and increaſing vigour.</p>
            <p>Don Diego generally devoted ſeven or eight hours of each day in viewing the work and in giving directions: Though a native of old Spain, and immenſely rich, yet he was neither indolent nor imperious; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031902_0097_0FEF3B4E0D4FD258"/>
affable and generous; in a word, ſympathy and benevolence characterized that noble Spaniard. He had ſtudied the features, air, and behaviour of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio for ſome time, with the moſt acute attention, and rightly judging he was of no vulgar extraction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to queſtion him on the ſubject. Accordingly, one day he ordered Mercutio to follow him, with his mattock, as if to do ſomething that had been neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Having taking him out of the fight of his fellow labourers, he made him a number of queſtions; ſuch as, where he was born? how he came to be captured? &amp;c. The anſwer he received proved ſo ſatisfactory to the Don, that he began to entertain a very high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our hero's merit, and, after a pauſe of ſome minutes, he aſked him, if his liberty could be procured, whether he would be willing to ſtay and ſettle in Spain? Mercutio did not refuſe; his anſwer however, was evaſive. He well knew that, being at liberty, a deſire of returning to his native country would inevitably predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate. He therefore framed his anſwer accordingly, and, from the ſucceeding circumſtances, we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infer that the old Don took for granted that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſtay.</p>
            <p>Don Diego told him to go to his work, and left him. After the labours of the day were ended, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male domeſtic came to Mercutio and deſired him to follow her. He complied, and ſhe conducted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an apartment he had never ſeen before; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſiring him to ſit, retired. He had not been long,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031902_0098_0FEF31D44ADA55E8"/>
there before Don Diego made his appearance, and, preventing our hero from riſing, ſat down by him.</p>
            <p>Mercutio, ſaid he, ever ſince I firſt beheld you, I have entertained a prepoſſeſſion in your favour: I find that prepoſſeſſion has not been unjuſtly founded. Your behaviour in the inferior ſtation to which you have unfortunately been reduced, with the candid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you have given me of your misfortunes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me in the good opinion I had conceived of you, and all theſe circumſtances have concurred to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine me to ſet you at liberty. To convince you of the ſincerity of my profeſſions, (here he rang a bell and a ſervant entered bearing a bundle, which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to his maſter and departed) take this, ſaid he, and with it your liberty, preſenting the bundle, which contained a rich Spaniſh habit, embroidered; and though I propoſed in our converſation to day, your ſtaying in Spain, I did not intend to make that the condition of your liberty; as that would be only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the place of your confinement. No, I have procured your liberty, and intend you ſhall enjoy it in its moſt extenſive latitude. You are at liberty to go when and where you pleaſe. If you chooſe to remain ſome time in Spain, my houſe and my purſe are at your ſervice.</p>
            <p>Such a ſuperior diſplay of generoſity in an utter ſtranger, almoſt petrified our hero with aſtoniſhment: He remained ſilent for ſome time. At length he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031902_0099_0FEF31D79469DC50"/>
thanks to Heaven! Thanks to the generous, the benevolent Guzman! May that power who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired you with theſe exalted ſentiments, ſhower down his choiceſt bleſſings on you, and your poſterity. May his mercy be liberally extended to you and them, as you have extended yours to me, exceeding my moſt ſanguine wiſhes! Command my life! It's at your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice—there is no injunction, conſiſtent with religion and honour, you are capable of laying on me, that I can, or will, refuſe to my generous deliverer—here he was interrupted by the Don. Mercutio, ſaid he, I am already more than recompenced in the real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I derived from a conſciouſneſs of having, in this inſtance, performed my duty. It argues a ſordid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted mind, ſuch as I hope the natives of Spain are ſtrangers to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to confer a favour in hopes of retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So I deſire whatever thanks the effuſions of your gratitude may inſpire, may be directed to that Fountain of benevolence, who has commanded us to love one another, and who graciouſly inforced the precept by his own glorious example.—You will ſup with me to night, and if you would oblige me, diveſt yourſelf of all reſtraint; treating me in all reſpects as if we were ſons of the ſame father. To-morrow I will give you a more convincing proof of my eſteem: Which is greater, perhaps, than you expect. Thus this diſintereſted Spaniard ſuppreſſed the ardent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments which our hero was about to make, and which all mankind would allow him as juſtly his due: Deſiring nothing but an approving conſcience,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031902_0100_0FEF320BE9390A20"/>
and wiſhing to aſcribe all the merit of the action to the Author of all good.—He then introduced our hero to Donna Belvidera, his wife, a perſon of conſummate beauty and good ſenſe, by whom he was treated with all imaginable reſpect. The Don had two daughters, who were accounted beauties, but they never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Mercutio unveiled. After one month's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence there, no opportunity offering of procuring a paſſage to England, he reſolved to take the advantage of the Don's proffer, and, having an inclination to go to Barcelona the capital of Catalonia, noted for its trade, riches and beauty, informed him of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. He inſtantly acquieſced, and, taking him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his cloſet, unlocked his bureau and taking out a a purſe containing 200 johannes, preſented them to him, ſaying, I inſiſt on your acceptance of this trifle, as a farther token of my eſteem for you: It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ſerviceable to you in your tour, in which I heartily with you genuine ſatisfaction: Barcelona is a beautiful city, and one of the richeſt in the Spaniſh dominions. I ſhall expect to hear from you in the courſe of two months, for you may reſt aſſured I am much intereſted in your welfare; and ſhall take a pleaſure in hearing of your health and proſperity.</p>
            <p>Our hero was about to make a proper acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this and every other favor he had received at his hands, but was prevented by the Don's begging to be excuſed for that time, as he was obliged to meet ſome gentlemen on an important occaſion. This put

an end to to the conference, and Mercutio began to prepare for his intended journey. Having procured a good horſe, and being properly equipped, he took leave of the old Don and his lady, who did not part without regret, and ſet forward attended by a hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, mounted on a mule, a beaſt more frequently made uſe of there than a horſe.</p>
            <p>He made no delay, but kept ſteadily forward until he arrived at Barcelona, where he lodged ſome days at an inn, until he could procure accommodation in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe, which beſt ſuited his diſpoſition. He went one day into a jeweller's ſhop, to look at ſome trinkets, as well as to enquire for a convenient lodging; and after ſome diſcourſe with the jeweller, who was a very jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, and ſpoke tolerable Engliſh, received an invitation to dine. He accepted the invitation, and was conducted to an elegant back apartment, where his wife and four fine children were ſitting. When the lady was informed that our hero was from London, ſhe roſe and gave him a very cordial reception, as ſhe was a native of that city herſelf. Their converſation became general till dinner was ſerved up. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Mercutio, that they were married in London, and had lived and carried on buſineſs near three years; but the father of the jeweller dying, he was obliged to return to Barcelona, to ſettle his affairs and take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the eſtate. The jeweller further informed him, that he reſided four years in London prior to his marriage, in which time he had embraced the Proteſtant
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031902_0102_0FEF3C30E08E4638"/>
faith, and added, that he was determined to return to that city, as ſoon as the war with America was at an end; as he found it very difficult to diſguiſe his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentiments, though he uſed the utmoſt precaution for that purpoſe—which line of conduct he conjured our hero to purſue as he valued his life.</p>
            <p>He ſpent the evening with his new acquired friends, much to his ſatisfaction; and as they had a couple of rooms unoccupied, Mercutio hired them for himſelf and ſervant. He took leave late in the evening, and the next morning, diſcharged his reckoning at the inn, and after providing for the accommodation of his cattle, removed to his new lodging.</p>
            <p>Here he began again to taſte the ſweets of ſociety; his hoſt and hoſteſs being perfectly frank, ſocial and generous, which rendered his ſituation very comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—his kind country-woman propoſed a ſeparate table for him; but he requeſted as a favor, to be permitted to eat and drink with her and her huſband. This was agreed on, and they enjoyed much ſatisfaction in the ſociety of each other. During his reſidence at this place, he viſited every place of polite entertainment and reſort in that beautiful and opulent city, by which means he contracted an acquaintance with ſeveral young Spaniards of diſtinction; ſome of whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a very great friendſhip for him; but among all thoſe, none had ſo great a ſhare of the eſteem of our hero, as Don Alonzo, a young Caſtilian nobleman,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031902_0103_0FEF3C3278FFCC00"/>
who inherited the moſt happy diſpoſition: To a very regular ſet of features, and genteel ſhape, he added an agreeable and graceful deportment—his judgment was found, and his converſation animating, modeſt and pleaſing. He had juſt arrived at Barcelona, after a reſidence of two whole years in the capital of France, that mart of vivacity and politeneſs, ſo that he retained none of that imperious ſtiffneſs of a Spaniard—neither had he acquired the extreme volatility which character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izes the French; but that happy medium, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his company very deſirable.</p>
            <p>Alonzo profeſſed every ſentiment of reſpect for our hero, who fell nothing ſhort, ſo that in a little time a reciprocal attachment took place between them, which rendered their walks, recreations, and intereſts of every kind inſeparable.</p>
            <p>Alonzo had a very extenſive acquaintance, to whom at different times, he introduced Mercutio as a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend; by which means, he became, as it were, naturalized;—and as he ſpoke the Spaniſh language fluently, his company was courted by all the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spaniards in Barcelona.</p>
            <p>Our hero with his friend Alonzo, and ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction, made an appointment to divert themſelves in chaſing the wild-boar, a kind of exerciſe common in that country. The company met accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appointment, and ſet forward in high ſpirits to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031902_0104_0FEF3C34F434D670"/>
the chace. The dogs beat the low grounds for ſome time, and at length rouſed an amazing large boar.</p>
            <p>The foaming beaſt took to an adjacent mountain, and aſcended it ſwiftly. They purſued him vigorouſly over the ſame; but on deſcending the other ſide, which was very ſteep and craggy, Mercutio's horſe was ſtung ſo ſeverely by a tarantula, that he bounded ſuddenly over a ſharp ridge of a rock, by which he diſmounted his rider, though an excellent horſeman. This unlucky accident put an end to the ſport, and threw the reſt of the company in the utmoſt conſternation. Every one diſmounted inſtantly, and ran to his aſſiſtance. On examining, they found his right arm broke, and his ſhoulder diſlocated. Alonzo mounted his horſe and ran, or rather flew to a ſmall village, which lay conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the foot of the mountain, for a ſurgeon, who dwelt there, and begging his attendance immediately, went out and procured a horſe for him, in order to acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate his ſpeed, which he had brought to the door juſt as the ſurgeon had his dreſſings and implements ready —They ſoon arrived at the ſpot where he was lying in extreme pain. Alonzo immediately gave him a large glaſs of cordial, which greatly revived his ſpirits. The ſurgeon then got him removed to a convenient place, and ordered a palanquin to be ſent for immediately, to convey him to the neareſt houſe, where accommodation could be procured, after the opperation of ſetting was performed. Mercutio's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was diſpatched on this buſineſs inſtantly, as there
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031902_0105_0FEF3C39F63A85C8"/>
was not one to be had nearer than Barcelona, which was full ſeven Engliſh miles.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeon, who was eminent in his profeſſion, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined, ſet, and bound up his arm and ſhoulder in an exceeding tender manner, told him he need not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any apprehenſion, as he would pledge his life for the performance of the cure in the ſpace of four weeks, with God's aſſiſtance, if he followed his directions. The young gentleman, ſaid he, turning to the company, muſt be carefully removed to ſome houſe as near as poſſible. A young Spaniard, one of the company, whoſe father's ſeat lay but a ſmall diſtance from the mountain, propoſed his being removed thither, where, he obſerved, he ſhould be carefully attended, until his cure ſhould be effected. Mercutio, who by this time, was conſiderably relieved from his pain, returned him thanks for his kindneſs; but aſked the ſurgeon, if he might not be removed to Barcelona, without danger, and being anſwered in the negative, gratefully accepted the offer.</p>
            <p>The ſervant having exerted all his ſpeed, ſoon return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, followed by a couple of brawny fellows, bearing a palanquin, in which Mercutio was immediately placed, in an eaſy poſition, and conveyed to the gentleman's houſe. The ſon having rode on before to inform his father, whoſe name was Don Ferdinando de Caſtigni, of the accident.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:031902_0106_0FEF3C3BBB2140B8"/>The old gentleman met the reſt of the company at the gate, gave them a cordial welcome, ſaid he was ſorry for the unfortunate interruption in their amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that nothing ſhould be deficient on his part to render the time of the young gentleman's ſtay in his houſe, as eaſy and agreeable as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Mercutio was taken out of the palanquin and put to bed, and the ſurgeon having deſired him to be compoſed, till the morning, took his leave, as did alſo the reſt of the company, except Alonzo, who did not leave the houſe that night.</p>
            <p>Our hero was bleſſed with a good night's reſt: His friend Alonzo had been twice at his bed-ſide in the morning before he awoke—the third time finding him awake, eagerly enquired how he had reſted. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he had never reſted better in his life; add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had not felt the leaſt pain, ſince he had laid down.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeon appearing ſoon after, dreſſed his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but did not open the bandage of his arm, ſaying he would let it remain till the evening of the enſuing day; and aſſured him, if he kept himſelf ſtill, he was not afraid but he ſhould be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to perfect the cure in fifteen days.</p>
            <p>Alonzo ſat with him the greateſt part of that day: In the afternoon he took leave, with a promiſe to ſee
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031902_0107_0FEF3C3D88516118"/>
him early next morning. Mercutio parted with him reluctantly, as he was not intimately acquainted with young de Caſtigni. However, he did not want for company in Alonzo's abſence; for the old Don and his ſon, ſat with him, until they conceived it time for him to repoſe.</p>
            <p>Not a day paſſed that he had not two or three of his friends to viſit him. In ſhort he was as well attended, during the three weeks that he was under the ſurgeon's hands, as he could poſſibly have been in England. His arm was reſtored to its proper ſhape and vigour, for which he liberally rewarded his ſurgeon.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he was able to leave his chamber, he made an apology to the old Don and his lady, for the trouble his unlucky fall had made in their houſe, and at the ſame time returning his moſt unfeigned thanks for the generous and polite attention he had received during the time he had reſided with them. Don de Caſtigini prevented him from proceeding any further, by ſaying, "Come, come, Sir, I requeſt you will ſay no more on this ſubject—humanity is a duty incumbent on every perſon who profeſſes chriſtianity; to have done leſs, for a perſon in the ſituation you were when firſt introduced here, would have diſcloſed a very callous heart, an unchriſtian-like diſpoſition, that would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace a Heathen, and conſequently beneath a Chriſtian. But, however, as I ſee you are deſirous of making a ſuitable return for the little ſervice you have received
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031902_0108_0FEF3C40942253D0"/>
in my houſe, I will ſoon give you an opportunity of diſplaying your gratitude to advantage." Make your own conditions, replied Mercutio, and you ſhall ſee with what willingneſs, I will hazard my life, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in the ſervice of my generous and kind benefactor. "Well then," rejoined the Don, "the condition is this: That you will favor us with your company fourteen days at leaſt. This is all I aſk, and after your profeſſions of gratitude, I expect you will not refuſe me the favor."</p>
            <p>To this he very willingly agreed, and the Don in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him to his three daughters, whom he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before ſeen. They were all beautiful, and each of them attired in a rich Spaniſh undreſs, of blue ſatin, ſpangled with ſilver. The two eldeſt were a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to brown, though beautifully featured; but the youngeſt poſſeſſed all the beauty that could poſſibly be comprized in one woman. They drop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> their veils when Mercutio entered the apartment with their father; but he ordered them to unveil, and converſe without reſerve, as though no ſtranger was preſent. They o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, and the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ect of ſuch a ſudden blaze of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, flaſhing all at once on our hero, greatly embarraſſed him: However, he advanced to ſalute them, and they met him with congratulations on his recovery. He returned their compliments in a very modeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſtyle.</p>
            <p>They had juſt ſeated themſelves, when Alonzo and young Ferdinando entered. After mutual ſalutations
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031902_0109_0FEF3C4500CEE0F0"/>
and congratulations had paſſed between them, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into an animated ſtrain of converſation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the young ladies bore a diſtinguiſhed part. The agreeable and pertinent remarks which, with the moſt engaging modeſty they expreſſed, afforded Mercutio the moſt ſuperior ſatisfaction. Donna Iſabella, the youngeſt daughter, whoſe perſonal charms were, though matchleſs, totally eclipſed by the real and more laſting beauties of her mind, made an impreſſion on the heart of our hero, not eaſily deſcribed. To the moſt happy turn of wit, ſhe united the ſweeteſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the moſt critical propriety of ſpeech: All theſe amiable qualifications rendered her converſation delighting. 'Twas this captivated Mercutio. When Iſabella took any part in the converſation, he was in extacy; with the moſt profound attention he liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the enchanting accents ſhe pronounced, and when ſhe ceaſed to ſpeak, preſerved his attentive at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as if petrified with pleaſure by the raviſhing ſound.</p>
            <p>A collation was ſerved up, conſiſting of the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Europe; which was followed by a deſert of the choiceſt viands of Spain, and the evening was ſpent in the moſt undiſſembled mirth and hilarity; Don Ferdinando himſelf being a very ſocial perſon, his frank and affable behaviour conſiderably augmented the ſatisfaction of the whole company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:031902_0110_0FEF3C47A6E7ABC8"/>The next day, our hero wrote to his friend and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, Don Guzman, at Bilboa: His letter contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moſt grateful acknowledgment of the obligations he lay under to him—an account of the accident he had met with, and his recovery, and concluded with a promiſe to ſee him in a ſhort time, being determined to ſet out for Bilboa in a few days.</p>
            <p>Though Mercutio certainly intended to fulfil his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in its fulleſt extent, yet he ſoon found (what he might be ſuppoſed to have been well acquainted with before) that nothing earthly is entitled to our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but that all our actions are guided by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible power; and that however flattering our future proſpect may appear to our partial fight, or however near, yet the clouds of diſappointment and adverſity, which are driven about by the uncertain gales of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, may intervene and deprive us of the glittering phantom, if not forever, at leaſt for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>It was with the utmoſt reluctance that Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando and his family permitted our hero to depart, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtay of twenty four days, nor then, without the moſt preſſing invitations to pay them another viſit ſhortly. A ſtrict regard to truth conſtrained him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them of his intention of leaving Spain very ſoon. This information had a remarkable effect on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Donna Iſabella. Mercutio, however, in compliance with the requeſt of the whole family, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to pay them a parting viſit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:031902_0111_0FEF3C4A6012AD98"/>The countenance of Iſabella reſumed its wonted ſerenity, and they took a cheerful and friendly leave of each other; he returned to Barcelona, accompanied by Alonzo and young Ferdinando. His kind hoſt and his wife were happy in ſeeing him ſafe again, and, in teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the pleaſure they derived from his return, devoted the day to mirth and good cheer: The only thing that occurred to damp their joy, was the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo ſoon parting with Mercutio: However, they ſpent the day very agreeably. In the evening, Alonzo and his friend took an affectionate leave of our hero, and his hoſt, and departed. Mercutio hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retired to his apartment, began to reflect on the long ſeries of adventures he had run through ſince his departure from his native country, which appeared like a chaſm in his life: The reſult was, he reſolved to ſtay about one week longer in Barcelona, take leave of his friends there, and return to Bilboa, where he intended to take ſhipping for England. But alas, how vain are the reſolutions of man! When the idea of taking leave of Caſtigni's family preſented itſelf, the image of the charming Iſabella, arrayed in all the charms peculiar to innocence, youth, and beauty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving in tears at the ſeparation, accompanied it. However, as he ſuppoſed his heart was entirely diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, he perſiſted in his reſolution, and under this impreſſion endeavoured to compoſe himſelf to reſt, but in vain, the pleaſing phantom was ſtill viſible to the eye of his imagination; all his reflections ſerved but to increaſe his perplexity; nor could he ſleep until Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031902_0112_0FEF3C4C9F575C78"/>
had tinged the oriental clouds with ſtreaks of the deepeſt crimſon; then the God of ſleep gently advanced, and ſpreading his downy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pinions over him, lulled him into a pleaſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>mber, where we will leave him to his repoſe, and as Iſabella is ſoon to be introduced, as a principal character, we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how ſhe ſpent the night.</p>
            <p>We find, from her own confeſſion, that ſhe paſſed that night in no leſs perplexity than Mercutio. When ſhe anticipated the fatal, approaching day which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o ſeparate her from him for ever, her tender boſom ſwelled with ſighs; and ſhe wet her pillow with her tears. Oh! ſhe would exclaim, how unhappy am I! Though I enjoy all the advantages of birth, fortune, and education, yet my prophetic ſoul forbodes my future miſery. I love Mercutio, yet he is ignorant of it! What then? Perhaps if he was convinced of the love I bear him, he would not have it in his power to extricate me from the wretchedneſs which awaits me, or which would complete my miſery. Perhaps ſome Engliſh beauty is now impatiently waiting his return, to crown her happineſs by fulfilling the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der engagements he entered into, when they parted. And yet, my eyes deceived me, or I obſerved ſomething like embarraſſment in his countenance to day, at parting. But what will that avail me? It may be, if unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged elſewhere, he has become enamoured with one of my ſiſters:—There ruin ſtares me in the face again! Would to heaven I was acquainted with

his ſentiments; my heart tells me he is ſincere, and, if I am not miſtaken, would diſcloſe his ſentiments on this ſubject, if I could find means to propoſe the queſtion to him. But why ſhould I wiſh to know what perhaps would plunge me into the depths of deſpair? Sleep at length overpowered her; but all her waking ideas paſſed in review before her while ſleeping, ſo that ſhe aroſe without refreſhment or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. But to return:—</p>
            <p>Mercutio aroſe without that tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>quillity of mind with which he had been bleſt for a conſiderable time before. He concealed his uneaſineſs from his kind hoſt and lady during the time they ſat at breakfaſt; and afterwards dreſt, and walked out to one of thoſe delightful gardens which are adorned with all the beauties of nature and of art, and are fitted for the entertainment and reception of perſons of quality only. He walked about, muſing on the viſion of the preceding night, for ſome time. He reflected that the paſſion which he had conceived was as yet but in embryo, and might be eaſily eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Beſides he had no foundation to build his hope on, if he ſhould cheriſh it. When he conſidered the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments and dangers he had already experienced, the loſſes he had ſuſtained, and the depths of miſery to which he had been reduced, in conſequence of his paſt amours, he reſolved to abandon an enterprize which appeared to be fraught with hazard and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt difficulty. He became cheerful again, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031902_0114_0FEF3C535BAE9BE0"/>
to leave Barcelona, in a very few days. At dinner he communicated his intention to his hoſt, without the leaſt hint of the reaſon of ſo precipitate a retreat. He diſpatched his ſervant, in the evening, to Don Ferdinando's, to inform the family that, if agreeable he would do himſelf the honour to pay them a viſit early in the ſucceeding day. His meſſage was received with pleaſure by the whole family, eſpecially by Iſabella.</p>
            <p>In the morning he ſet out, on horſe back, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſervant. He was received with the ſame degree of kindneſs, which he had uniformly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in that family. Though he was treated as uſual, yet he perceived that the apparent cheerfulneſs of the whole family was only the effect of his preſence: He perceived ſome latent grief in their countenances, ſtruggling to conceal itſelf from his obſervation: The day, however, was ſpent very agreeably: A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect of the ſociety of perſons of refined and generous ſentiments. In the evening our hero inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is intention of ſetting out for Bilboa in three days, at fartheſt. This information had an inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and viſible effect on Iſabella; (perhaps to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutio only:) ſhe withdrew, but returned ſhortly, more cheerful, apparently, than ſhe had been that day. The moment of departure was procraſtinated until a very late hour: At length, however, it arrived. Iſabella was the laſt perſon of whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e took leave. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the agitation of his ſoul, in that moment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

the power of my pen. His pulſe beat high, and he ſtood as if riveted to the floor. The lovely Iſabella, whoſe heart, tender as the orb of ſight, had caught the ſweet infection, was ſeized, when he took her hand, with a ſudden tremor, which thrilled like lightning through the deepeſt, and moſt intricate receſſes of it.—In vain ſhe endeavoured to conceal the palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her convulſed breaſt—to withhold the ſpeed of the glittering globes of chryſtal which privately ſtole down her bluſhing cheeks,—Cupid had planted one of his keeneſt darts in her un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Neither his ride home, or a retroſpect of his paſt difficulties, could extinguiſh or diminiſh the flame which that beauteous female Spaniard had kindled in his breaſt. I muſt, ſaid he, I muſt again ſee Iſabella!—I behaved very ill at parting! I muſt diſcloſe my paſſion to her! —She ſeemed to pity my diſtreſs in the parting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Perhaps the little God has been propitious— has inſpired her with ideas favourable to my wiſh!— It muſt be ſo! Her eyes betrayed the ſecret of her heart, and ſeemed to ſay, cruel Mercutio!—Can you then leave me? Leave me thus! O let me ſee you once more! Once more, e'er the relentleſs ocean for ever ſeparate us!—Thus he waſted the night; but, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He ſallied forth without making his intentions known to his hoſt, in order to go on board the Dutchman, and, if he found things to his mind, to agree for his paſſage; but he had not walked fifty paces when a billet was put into his hand by a female, who told him ſhe would meet him in an hour, on that ſpot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his anſwer—ſhe inſtantly diſappeared. He was ſurprized at the incident; but did not open the billet until he had returned to his lodging: Then locking his door, he opened it, and read as follows.</p>

My father replied, my dear friend, your requeſt cannot be granted: She is but juſt turned of thirteen years, conſequently unfit for marriage; I have two other daughters, who are of riper years, if either of them has charms ſufficient to engage your affections, I promiſe you my free conſent to marry her, and I will give her a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſupperannuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretch, who is near ſeventy, arrived here yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening with a pompous retinue.

a point. He reſolved to meet Iſabella, however, according to her requeſt—He did ſo, and every ſcruple was inſtantly removed. She came attended by her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confidante—After the firſt ſalutation, Mercutio propoſed retiring to his lodgings. This was rejected, and Iſabella informed him that ſhe commanded a private apartment in the houſe of her aunt, where they might diſcourſe without interruption. He eagerly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the offer: The more ſo, as it might convince her of the rectitude of his intentions. Thither, then, he was immediately conducted.

She brightened at this aſſurance, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to paint the obligations he lay under to her father, in the moſt ſtriking colours. He then expatiated largely on the blackneſs of ingratitude; and concluded, by declaring the fervency of his love for her, which be ſaid was heightened by the reflection of her being a daughter of the generous De Caſtigni; but added, that whatever ſteps a ſenſe of her diſtreſs might prompt him to take in her behalf, he was determined to take none that ſhould be diſhonorable to himſelf; or by which he might forfeit the eſteem of her noble father: "Such a ſtep," continued he, "would render me unworthy of your confidence."</p>
            <p>Our Hero expected the latter part of his declaration would have been a little unwelcome to Iſabella; but in this he was miſtaken: She told him ſhe abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very idea of purchaſing happineſs at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his honor or integrity, adding, if ſhe could have harboured the moſt diſtant thought of his being capable of acting in a manner unworthy of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe ſhould never have acted the part ſhe had.</p>
            <p>She then produced a letter from her brother, encloſing one from his mother. This letter promiſed a faithful attention to the requeſt of his mother, which was couched in the following terms.</p>

the immediate gift of Heaven: But to riſque every thing in eſtabliſhing that happineſs which involved his own.

               </gap>ia! A treaſure of which kings would boaſt with rapture!"—Here ſhe interrupted him by obſerving, that her mother and the Reverend Father had maturely weighed every circumſtance; that he conceived the Italian, having taken an undue advantage of a raſh vow, made in the effuſions of gratitude, his claim had neither religion, reaſon, nor juſtice for its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and conſequently was null to all intents and purpoſes; that if a countermine could be effected, it would not only be blameleſs, but meritorious: As the temporal, and, perhaps, eternal happineſs of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella was deeply concerned, it behoved them to prevent, if poſſible, a union fraught with ſo many evils and inconveniencies. They alſo agreed that to deceive the Italian, without the knowledge or concurrence of the Don would be laudable, for the reaſons above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>Our hero then enquired if ſhe had ſeen her brother ſince her arrival in town, ſhe anſwered in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and that he ſhould ſee him ſhortly. She then rang a ſmall bell, and Tereſa, her maid, appeared: She told her to inform her aunt and brother that ſhe wiſhed the favor of their company. In a few minutes
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031902_0126_0FEF3C754ECB0878"/>
they entered, accompanied by the holy Father, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon truly reverend in his appearance, the ſerenity of whoſe countenance ſpoke the goodneſs and tranquillity of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>After mutual ſalutations. Iſabella with her aunt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into a cloſet; when the prieſt began a very pious and edifying diſcourſe, in the courſe of which he made ſeveral pertinent alluſions to the cauſe of their meeting. He animadverted freely, and with great ingenuity on the impropriety of haſty marriages, unequal matches, raſh promiſes, &amp;c. and concluded by urging in a very pathetic manner, the neceſſity of the approaching union, as the lives, and what was of infinitely more value, the happineſs of the mother and daughter, wholly depended on its conſummation. He next enjoined our hero to write a letter to his intended father-in-law, containing an ample account of the whole affair—promiſing to take charge of it himſelf, and deliver it to the Don, after preparing him for the reception of the news. This Mercutio promiſed to do. They were then re-joined by the old lady, leading forward Iſabella, the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of whoſe lovely countenance but faintly typified the exquiſite felicity of her ſoul, which heightened her charms to a degree ſcarcely inferior to abſolute perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The ceremony was dignified by the ſincere devotion with which it was performed. The old lady, for the firſt time, performed the part of a mother, and young

Ferdinando that of a father, in conferring on Mercutio a treaſure which he would not have exchanged for the empire of the univerſe. The ceremony over, the prieſt and Ferdinando took leave under a promiſe of taking breakfaſt with the bride and her huſband the next morning.</p>
            <p>The hour for repoſe arriving, the old lady conducted her niece to a proper apartment, and retired, leaving her under the conduct of her maid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the buſineſs of a bride-maid having never fell within her ſphere.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that occupied our hero's attention in the morning, was a letter to his father-in-law, which he penned agreeable to his promiſe, informing him of the riſe, progreſs and conſummation of his preſent happineſs: Explaining, in the moſt reſpectful terms, the motives of his conduct, and humbly requeſted him to pardon a crime which originated merely from a wiſh to reſtore to happineſs a family, for every branch of which he entertained the higheſt ſentiments of gratitude and eſteem. After finiſhing this letter, he wrote another to his old benefactor at Bilboa.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031902_0128_0FEF3C7C98D1BAB0"/>
They were well pleaſed with the information, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando promiſed to ſpend every evening with them, until their embarkation, and to ſee them ſafe on board. He then took leave and Mercutio went in ſearch of the Dutch captain. He found him, and agreed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for their paſſage. The captain propoſed ſailing the next day, as he had to touch at Marſeilles for ſome lading; and obſerved, that if he thought proper to wait his return to Barcelona, he would lay too and take them in. This propoſal, however, did not exactly tally with the circumſtances of our hero; he therefore, made a virtue of neceſſity, and told the captain he had ſome buſineſs at Marſeilles himſelf, and was reſolved to embark very early the next morning. They parted, and our hero immediately returned to inform Iſabella of his determination. He next went to his lodgings, in order to ſatisfy his hoſt, as well as to diſcharge his ſervant and diſpoſe of his horſe. As the ſervant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to return to Bilboa, he committed the letter for Guzman to his care, which he promiſed to deliver ſafe; and then preſenting him the mule he had rode to Bilboa, the ſervant departed, very grateful for the liberal treatment he had received.</p>
            <p>Our hero diſpoſed of his horſe to his landlord, and having taken a parting bottle together, he took a final leave of them, and returned to the impatient Iſabella, who was afraid ſome unlucky accident would yet inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene to ſeparate them; ſhe was, therefore, naturally anxious to leave Barcelona with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:031902_0129_0FEF3C7F70D678D0"/>Ferdinando ſpent the evening with them; indeed they did not go to reſt that night at all—for as it might poſſibly be the laſt they were to ſpend together, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Before the day dawned, Mercutio and his brother-in-law walked down to the water ſide, as the former had appointed to meet the ſhip's boat at that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our. In the interim, Iſabella waited on her aunt in her bed-chamber, who immediately aroſe at the ſound of her opening the door, and taking her niece by the hand, led her to a cabinet, from which ſhe took a caſket, and preſenting it to her, ſaid: "Accept this, my dear Iſabella, as a token of my love to you and my dear ſiſter. May you be happy! Perhaps I ſhall never ſee you more. Your father, when informed of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent deceit that has been practiced on him, will, I am convinced, ſearch you out."</p>
            <p>Juſt then the men returned, and the boat being wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they made ready inſtantly; then taking an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate farewel, but not without tears on the part of the women, they ſet forward. Their baggage, was not very bulky, conſiſting chiefly of money and jewels, was eaſily carried to the water ſide by our hero and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando, who was reſolved to ſee them ſafe on board. Preparations were making for weighing the anchor,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031902_0130_0FEF3C82EA4044D8"/>
when they came on board, where the captain welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them heartily, and conducted them to a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious cabin, which had been cleared out and fitted for their reception. The wind being favorable, the captain left them in order to get the ſhip under way as quick as poſſible. The ſails ſet, and every thing put in order, he returned to the cabin, and informed Ferdinando that the ſhip's boat was ready to put him on ſhore, he took an affectionate leave of his ſiſter and her huſband, and returned to Barcelona.</p>
            <p>Our voyagers were ſavored with a gentle breeze for ſome days, during which time they enjoyed as much happineſs as their ſituation could poſſibly afford. They happened to have a couple of French gentlemen and a very agreeable young lady of the ſame nation, which greatly encreaſed their ſatisfaction. Social harmony, and convivial friendſhip were imparted from breaſt to breaſt, and uninterrupted tranquillity, a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that friendſhip, ſeemed to be eſtabliſhed on a permanent baſis. But, as anguiſh and rapture act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately on the human mind, it is folly in the extreme, to drea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the one or wiſh for the other as permanent: For it is obſervable, that a continual round of what is generally underſtood by the word pleaſure, becomes by repetition, diſagreeable, irkſome, and painful: Loathing and diſg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt takes place of deſire—the taſte is vitiated, and the intoxication of the ſenſes renders the agent incapable of diſtinguiſhing the difference between one and the other. Pain, ſlavery and chains, by long
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031902_0131_0FEF3C862BC62188"/>
cuſtom, become leſs irkſome, nay, in a certain degree, natural; and the anguiſh of grief diminiſhes in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the length of its continuance.</p>
            <p>Their tranquillity was not of long continuance, for when they were within two days ſail of Marſeilles, they were overtaken by a dreadful hurricane, aſſiſted by a ſtrong current ſitting out of the gulph of Lyons, which threatened the total deſtruction of the ſhip, and all on board. The wind blew with irreſiſtable violence, which carried away the fore-top-maſt and bowſprit in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſtorm, and at length grew ſo furious, that the main-maſt went by the board, at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the tiller-rope breaking, the man at the helm was knocked overboard; and it was at the manifeſt hazard of their lives that the whole crew ventured to ſeize the tiller and bend new ropes to it.</p>
            <p>Conſternation and horror pervaded the minds as well as countenances of all on board, under a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of being ſhortly buried in the capacious womb of the tremendous deep. Fortunately the ſhip hull had ſuffered no damage, for the maſts and yards which had been carried away, fell clear of the gunwale, and the rigging was immediately cut away. But as hope is generally the laſt thing that forſakes us, ſo they did not abſolutely deſpair, till after enduring the fury of the ſtorm for three days and as many nights, they found the ſhip hurled, by the combined force of wind and waves, ſtern foremoſt into a cavity between two huge rocks, where ſhe remained immoveably fixed.—
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031902_0132_0FEF3C87F2393168"/>
Deſpair at laſt ſtared them in the face!—Dreadful ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation!—The ſhip's keel was jammed in between the rocks, from which no mortal ſtrength or ſkill could extricate it:—Surrounded by the foaming waves, which were hurled about in horrible confuſion, by the yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abated fury of the tempeſt, they all betook themſelves to fervent prayer, and inſtant preparation for eternity! for death appeared inevitable. Deſpair was ſtrongly depicted in the faces of the mariners, and every hope of ſetting foot on ſhore again had fled.</p>
            <p>Five days and nights they remained in this horrid ſituation, and the major part of their proviſion, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bread, was rendered uſeleſs, the water being ſix feet deep in the hold; however, they made very little uſe of what they had—they eat little, ſlept leſs, and in all reſpects conducted themſelves as perſons hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting death.</p>
            <p>Mercutio's concern for Iſabella triumphed over every other conſideration; his expectations of relief were exhauſted, he went ſeldom on deck, ſince aſſiſtance had become uſeleſs. The two Frenchmen, from ſimilar motives, remained conſtantly below, the one being the huſband and the other the brother of the French lady: They found it an arduous taſk to keep her in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of ſpirits; but it muſt be confeſſed Iſabella ſupported her fate with a fortitude that would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected honor on philoſophy itſelf. About eleven o'clock, on the fifth night of their extreme diſtreſs, the wind ſhifted, and blew ſo violent, that the waves rolled
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031902_0133_0FEF3C8B080880D8"/>
in ſucceſſion over this devoted ſhip and crew. Their ears were at the ſame time aſſailed with the moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peals of thunder, and terrifying flaſhes of ethereal fire—floods of rain and reſiſtleſs guſts of wind roared in concert—the whole exhibited a ſcene of terror which would baffle every attempt to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>As the ſtern of the veſſel lay conſiderably higher than the head, the cabins and ſteerage were yet clear of water; the captain, his officers and paſſengers occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the former, and the common ſailors the latter. About day-break the ſtorm began to abate, and by nine o'clock, they were bleſt with a proſpect of a calm ſea and a clear ſky. This, hopeleſs as their ſituation was, afforded them a tranſitory ceſſation of grief, during which they all bent in gratitude to that Omnipotent Power, who had mercifully ſtayed the fury of the wind, and awed the boiſterous waves into ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Though this change in the weather had in ſome meaſure alleviated their diſtreſs, yet the cutting reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their ſituation, produced pangs of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating woe: The beauteous proſpect by which they were ſurrounded, ſerved but to inſpire them with the dreadful idea of ſoon terminating their days by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. In this ſtate of horrid anxiety, they ſat as if benumbed and ſtupid, until the captain broke the mournful ſilence in the following manner:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:031902_0134_0FEF3C8FA199F978"/>"My dear fellow-ſufferers, we are in a dreadful ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation I confeſs, but ſtill we have the greateſt reaſon imaginable to be thankful to the Almighty, for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation hitherto: And I look on our being caſt on this rock as a moſt ſignal mercy, for had the ſhip con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to float, the ſtorm was ſufficient to have daſhed her to atoms in a very ſhort time, and which muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably have been her fate the inſtant ſhe was thrown into this cavity, had ſhe been in any other poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion. I ſincerely believe that our being caſt here was a means, employed by the Almighty, to convince us of our nothingneſs, and that he is not only able, but willing, to ſave to the utmoſt, thoſe who rely on his Omnipotence for deliverance and protection: And although I muſt confeſs that appearances ſeem to contradict it, I really begin to conceive hopes that we ſhall all make the ſhore again with ſafety."</p>
            <p>They liſtened with rapture to what he ſaid, and eagerly demanded, what foundation he had to hope for what to them appeared to exceed the utmoſt ſtretch of human probability? "Why, my friends," rejoined the captain, "the ſea is now calm, and the ſky clear, I will take an obſervation, by which means I ſhall be able to aſcertain the beſt courſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eer to make the neareſt land."</p>
            <p>The captain found by obſervation, that it would be moſt adviſeable to ſteer for Leghorn. "We are," ſaid he, "thanks to the Almighty, all in good health
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031902_0135_0FEF3C931D3BA480"/>
and vigor, we will get out the boats, and have them ſitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> with maſts and ſails; the carpenter ſhall fix the binicle in a convenient part of the long boat;—let every one take one hundred weight of his moſt valuable property: With this burthen I am of opinion we can make the port in three days, where I have a brother, who can, perhaps, aſſiſt me in recovering a part of my cargo."</p>
            <p>This propoſal was embraced with avidity by the whole company, who immediately began to clear the boats of all incumbrances, ſo that they ſoon had them out and rigged, and then proceeded to embark the moſt valuable of their effects, proviſions, water, &amp;c. The cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain, for fear of being ſeparated by another ſquall, propoſed making a tow-line faſt to the head of each boat, by which, in caſe of extremity, they on board the cutter would be enabled to get on board the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat.</p>
            <p>About four in the afternoon they left the wreck, and ſtee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed away under an eaſy ſail Eaſt by South. Every one aſſiſted, ſo that they went at a great rate, uſing both ſails and oars. The next day, land appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the larboard bow, they were inſpired with new life; the captain aſſuring them they would be in Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn that night. Joy was imprinted in legible charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on all their countenances, and they congratulated each other on the ſignal deliverance, as if they were already on ſhore—they ſtrove to baniſh the diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031902_0136_0FEF3C95009F58F8"/>
recollection of their late diſtreſs, to make room for the more acceptable and pleaſing ſenſations which they already taſted by anticipation.</p>
            <p>About ſun-ſet they deſcried a ſloop a head, at the diſtance of about a league, which they ſoon met. They hailed her, and requeſted the commander to come on board the long boat, which he immediately complied with. This gentleman proved to be the captain's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before mentioned, who expreſſed much aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at ſeeing them coming from ſea in an open boat; but his ſurprize vaniſhed when informed of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and was much affected with the narrative; but bid them be of good cheer, as they would quickly be among humane and hoſpitable people, who would render them all the ſervice in their power.</p>
            <p>In about three hours they anchored before Leghorn. Being late at night, it was agreed to ſtay on board the ſloop till next morning, except the captain, who went on ſhore.</p>
            <p>In the morning they diſembarked, and our hero hired one of the ſailors to carry his baggage. He had juſt taken leave of his captain, and received his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's directions where to find ſuitable accommodations for ſome days, when, as he was handing Iſabella along, he was met by a gentleman in a rich Italian habit, who, after being informed of their ſhipwreck, kindly welcomed them on ſhore, and invited them to take
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031902_0137_0FEF3C99D5BA9F40"/>
breakfaſt with him. They conſented, and he conducted them to a very elegant houſe, where they were kindly received by the miſtreſs. Among other enquiries, the gentleman aſked Mercutio the place of his nativity? Finding him an Engliſhman, which he was himſelf, he told him he intended to remove to England in a very ſhort time, and politely offered him his houſe, if he would ſtay with them: He added, that he expected to embark with his whole family in three weeks at fartheſt.—Juſt then a man entered the room, the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fight of whom gave Mercutio no ſmall pleaſure: 'Twas George Wright!—The familiarity of the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe two friends, amazed the whole family. But George ſoon removed their ſurprize by informing them of the very great intimacy which had ſubſiſted between them.</p>
            <p>George embraced the firſt opportunity of taking our hero aſide, to enquire what brought him to Italy again. When Mercutio had ſatisfied him in every particular, he in his turn informed him, that his wife had paid the debt of nature, ſhortly after his departure for England. She fell a victim, ſaid he, to the ſame diſeaſe which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off my uncle and aunt. She was no ſooner attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it than the moſt unfavourable ſymptoms appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. On the eighth day the fever ſeemed to abate, which I interpreted as a good omen; but in this I was miſtaken, for that evening I obſerved the phyſicians buſy in private diſcourſe, in the courſe of which, they frequently ſhook their heads, as if void of hope. I
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031902_0138_0FEF3C9EC1009780"/>
ſuſpected the truth.—The eldeſt of the three, both in years and practice, beckoned to me to follow him, and when in private, ſaid: Endeavor, Sir, to collect all your fortitude, to ſupport you under your affliction—To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in ſuch a caſe would be unpardonable—Your amiable ſpouſe will ſoon be numbered with the dead! Six hours, without a miracle, will be the utmoſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of her exiſtence! I am ſorry to inform you that her diſeaſe is of ſo complicated a nature, that it baffles the power of medicine. I have, with my colleagues, done every thing poſſible—we therefore, ſurrender her into the hands of that Being, with whom are the iſſues of life. He added no more, but turning about, left me in pangs of the moſt intolerable anguiſh.</p>
            <p>His prediction was truly verified, for exactly at the time he mentioned, ſhe expired in my arms! I muſt confeſs, it was the greateſt ſhock I had ever experienced. I remained for ſome time inſenſible of any thing that paſſed; in which ſituation I was removed to another apartment, where, on recovering my ſenſes, I found ſeveral of my friends at my bed-ſide, kindly endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to alleviate my grief. Among the number who had collected to ſolace my melancholy, were two Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans, who entered into a very pious diſcourſe on the ſubject of reſignation, in which they did not forget to give me a modeſt reproof for neglecting to ſend for the Fathers of the Church, that they might have adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſacrament (as they called it) of extreme unction, previous to her departure. A ſlight apology and a few
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031902_0139_0FEF3CA0633E6A48"/>
ducats, however, ſilenced them on that head; but they inſiſted on celebrating maſs on the ſpot, which I did not think proper to refuſe.</p>
            <p>The clouds of melancholy enveloped my mind for a conſiderable time, and it is doubtful whether I ſhould have reſumed my native cheerfulneſs yet, had I remained in Venice. I reſiſted the ſolicitations of my friends a long time—at length, weary of their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, I reſolved to purſue their advice, and, as I had ſome affairs to ſettle in Naples, I made ready to go thither immediately.</p>
            <p>While I remained there, I went to Mount Veſuvius, at leaſt, as near as the ſtones, ſulphur, aſhes and flames would permit, as there was a moſt violent eruption, which covered the neighboring fields and gardens with thoſe combuſtibles. From thence, I viſited the tomb of the celebrated Virgil, which ſtands at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from a ſubterraneous paſſage, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut quite through the baſe of a large mountain, known there by the name of Paufilipo's Grotto. I rode through this wonderful paſſage, and could juſt, when on horſeback, touch the arched roof, (which is perfectly regular, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with millions of curious ſtones and ſhells, neatly arranged in every form that fancy can deviſe) with my horſe-whip.</p>
            <p>However, not to trouble you with a recital of every place and thing I ſaw, in travelling from Naples to
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031902_0140_0FEF3CA290668450"/>
Leghorn, I took my abode in this houſe, the owner of which is now my father-in-law, and as worthy a man as England ever produced. He then confirmed what the gentleman had told our hero, adding, that he was to accompany the family to England, and was highly pleaſed, when he found Mercutio was to be of the party.</p>
            <p>Mercutio deſired to be introduced to Mrs. Wright; but George informed him that ſhe was not in Leghorn, that he lived in St. Marino; but told him he intended to ſet out next morning for that place, and requeſted him and his lady to accompany him—declaring that nothing could give him ſo much pleaſure and ſatisfaction. Our hero gladly accepted the invitation. They then joined the company, when George was introduced in form to Iſabella, who received his ſalute with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt complaiſance as her huſband's friend.</p>
            <p>The next morning early, they ſet forward, and met a cordial reception from Eliza, Mrs. Wright, who was as complete a female figure, perhaps, as Italy could afford. The modeſt and ſprightly behavior of this lady to her new acquaintances, unfolded a ſweetneſs of temper, not frequently equalled, and never exceeded: In ſhort, her whole deportment reflected the higheſt honor on the choice and judgment of her huſband.</p>
            <p>The dwelling of George was ſituated at the foot of a mountain, on the ſummit of which ſtands the capital
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031902_0141_0FEF3CA92D07E0B8"/>
of St. Marino. A beautiful green of conſiderable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, lay in front of the houſe, terminating in an acute angle at one end, and widening at the other in a gradual manner, till it paſſes the end of the mountain, and loſes itſelf in a beautiful champaign country, diverſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fied with fields, gardens, and delightful villas. At the back of the houſe, at the diſtance of a few perches, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain roſe with awful magnificence, in ſeveral parts of which ſtood ſmall villages, and the interſtices conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſted of rocks, caves and woods, affording the higheſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to a contemplative eye.</p>
            <p>George, it ſeems, had ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce his ſecond marriage and removal to St. Marino, taken frequent excurſions through ſeveral parts of the mountain and villages ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent.—In one of his morning rambles, he perceived a path leading towards a high and craggy promontory, which j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tted over the ſea. He could not ſpare time to examine where it led to then, returned home, and thought no more about it, until one evening as they were all ſitting, enjoying the pleaſant breeze, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the diverſity of the objects which immediately ſurrounded them. "Mercutio," ſaid he, "let us take a walk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſtumbled on a path not long before I went to Leghorn, which, if I am not miſtaken, leads to ſome romantic place, and I have a curioſity to ſee it— what ſay you, will you accompany me?"—"With all my heart," ſaid he, "come ladies, favor us with your company." This was agreed to, and they all ſet out immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:031902_0142_0FEF3CAC74421510"/>After walking about a quarter of a mile along its baſe, they began to aſcend the mountain by a narrow path, which led to a ſmall village near the ſummit. The path was too narrow to admit more than one at a time; ſo George led them on, the two ladies kept the centre, and Mercutio cloſed the rear.</p>
            <p>When they had aſcended to nearly the midway, George ſtruck off into a ſmaller path, which was the one he had mentioned. They had not travelled far on that courſe, till they came into a place which appeared to have been once cultivated: Here they found vines laden with moſt delicious grapes, of which they all eat heartily. George was not miſtaken in his opinion of the place, for a more romantic ſcene was never painted; but his having ſurveyed the promontory from the water, and obſerving the direction of the path, enabled him to found his judgment truly. They all ſat down on a flat ſtone to diſcourſe on the amazing ſcene.</p>
            <p>They were about midway between the baſe of the mountain, which in that part was waſhed by the ſea, and the ſummit. The ſpot were they ſat, projected over the foaming ſurge, which in vain attempted to waſh away its ſupport, a huge pile of rocks, which roſe like a bracket:—Above their heads, from the ſide of the mountain, aroſe a ſtupendous rock of marble, which likewiſe projected, in form of a ſemi-arch, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an awful, yet a magnificent canopy over the half of the old vine-yard. What particularly encreaſed
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031902_0143_0FEF3CAF15A536C8"/>
their aſtoniſhment, was the number of trees and ſhrubs which proceeded in all directions from the fiſures of that amazing rock; for the contraſt of colours occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the various ſpecies and poſitions of the trees, gave it the appearance of a ſpacious arched ceiling, curiouſly ornamented with tapeſtry.</p>
            <p>The ladies viewed this piece of natural architecture with the utmoſt aſtoniſhment. With amazement, they caſt upwards their wondering eyes, at the awful pile which hung over, and threatened to fall and cruſh them to atoms. "Let us go down," ſaid Iſabella; "my eyes ach looking at this monſtrous rock!" "The proſpect is really terrifying," ſaid Eliza. As it was near ſun-ſet they agreed to return, and accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deſcend in the ſame order in which they had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. When they were near the foot, Mercutio, hearing a ruſtling at ſome diſtance above him, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about and perceived a man, ſtep nimbly into the path which led to the old vineyard. He inſtantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the diſcovery to the reſt of the company, and they all continued to watch the Mountaineer, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til intervening objects rendered it impoſſible. They ſet forward again, diſcourſing as they went of the ſtrange adventure of the man of the mountain. "That man," ſaid Iſabella, "is unacquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the place to which he is going, or is fonder of retirement than I am." "I am of opinion," ſaid Mercutio, "that he has ſome ſort of a habitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe rocks. I will examine that place cloſely to-morrow. I intended to have made ſome further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations

this evening, had not night overtook us, before we were aware. However, I will aſcend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow morning, before he is out of bed; will you bear me company, George?" "Yes, that I will," ſaid he, "I am anxious to know who he is, and what he follows for a livelihood: "He muſt have ſome ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon for taking up his abode in ſuch a place."</p>
            <p>At the dawn of day, George and Mercutio a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and, leaving their beauteous partners wrapt in calm ſlumbers beneath the calmy pinions of repoſe, ſet forward towards the mountain, in order, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to explore the rocky cavern, which contained the perſon they perceived aſcending the preceding evening.</p>
            <p>They arrived at the old vineyard juſt as the fun beams began to penetrate the horizontal miſts; and with the utmoſt ſilence and caution, placed themſelves under a ſpreading vine, ſo advantageouſly, that it was impoſſible for their game to eſcape; nor was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any perſon to aſcend or deſcend by the path without diſcovery. They had not remained in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh long, when they perceived the broad ſtone, on which they had ſat the preceding day, riſe, as if by magic art, and from the cave, to which it ſerved for a door, iſſued a young man richly dreſſed, followed by the identical man they had ſeen the evening before, who reared the ſtone againſt the rock.</p>
            <p>"Here William," (ſaid the young gentleman, in good Engliſh) "convey this letter to my dear Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The ſervant vaniſhed inſtantly; but our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade lay ſtill, in order to make further diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>The ſtranger, after walking backward and forward in ſilence, with his arms folded, exclaimed aloud, with all the marks of grief and anxiety in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, "Why, O Why! ye immortal powers, have ye beſtowed on me every thing that the world conceives conducive to happineſs, and ſuffer me nevertheleſs, to exiſt here a living monument of thy diſpleaſure, ſecluded from the ſociety of mankind?—If without knowledge or intention, I have merited puniſhment extreme, O haſten my diſſolution, by hurling the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing bolts of thy vengeance on my devoted head; and, at one ſtroke, reduce me to a ſtate of nonenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!

               <pb n="148" facs="unknown:031902_0146_0FEF3CB9674E5CD8"/>This ſaid, he advanced to the identical ſpot where the two friends were poſted, in order to indulge his melancholy under the branches of the cluſtering vine. 'Tis impoſſible to deſcribe his aſtoniſhment, when he ſaw them both ariſe, and heard them ſalute him in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh! He gazed wildly on them for a moment, then ſpringing backward, ran towards the edge of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, with a reſolution to throw himſelf into the ſea, and would certainly have effected it, had not Mercutio, who ſuſpected his intention, intercepted him in the midſt of his career, and with the aſſiſtance of George, took him by force, to the place where they had been ſitting ſo long. Having ſeated themſelves, one on each ſide of him, Mercutio in the moſt ſoothing terms, attempted to ſet his late raſhneſs in a proper point of view; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him at the ſame time, to fear nothing, as they were friends, and would give him all the aſſiſtance in their power, and concluded by requeſting him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf a little, to favor them with a brief ſketch of his adventures, and inform them by what means he got into that diſmal retreat.</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen," replied the aſtoniſhed youth, who could yet ſcarcely believe his eyes and ears, "before I gratify your requeſt, you muſt anſwer me two or three queſtions: Your appearance tells me you will do this candidly." They aſſured him upon honor they would. "Firſt then, were you ever in this place before this morning?" They immediately recounted to him the adventures of the preceding evening, not omitting
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031902_0147_0FEF3CBB34174808"/>
the moſt minute circumſtance. This information in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with freſh life: He then demanded if they were natives of England? And being thoroughly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in theſe particulars, he exclaimed in rapture, Thanks to the immortal Jehovah! Deign to accept the grateful thanks of an unworthy mortal, thou glorious and inexhauſtible ſource of benevolence, for this interval of happineſs in the midſt of my diſtreſs! Pardon my impatience—I am but mortal!</p>
            <p>"Forgive me, gentlemen," ſaid he, "I behave ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill; but I doubt not your generoſity will impute it to the real cauſe." They requeſted him to make no apology for his behavior as it needed none, aſſuring him they approved his ſenſibility, and looked on it as proof of a good heart.</p>
            <p>Eugenio, the ſtranger, perceiving their impatience to hear his ſtory, began thus:—"Well, gentlemen, I ſuppoſe you have not met with ſuch a ſcene as this in all your travels: If you pleaſe, we will deſcend into my ſubterraneous habitation, which exhibits a lively epitome of my own wretchedneſs." The deſcent was very craggy, which ſupplied the want of ſtairs. After deſcending about twelve feet perpendicular, they found themſelves in a kind of grotto, the floor of which was compoſed of ſolid marble. The roof was of a concave form, lined with party-coloured ſhells, and ſtones of different complexions and qualities. The cave was about thirty feet long, and fifteen in width: The end
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031902_0148_0FEF3CBDAD51F978"/>
next to the ſea was entirely open, forming an arch; and that part which compoſed the roof, projected full fifteen feet beyond the mouth of the cavern, which ſcreened him effectually from rain. The proſpect it afforded was really terrifying: Nothing could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at the back part of the cave; but the terror was greatly encreaſed by caſting the eye downward from the mouth to the dreadful cliffs which hung below. One would be tempted, when viewing this ſcene, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the author of the tragedy of Lear, was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the mouth of this cave, when penning the deſcription which he puts into the mouth of Edgar, in order to deter old Gloſter from the deſperate act of caſting himſelf headlong from ſuch a height.</p>
            <p>In one corner of the cave lay a matraſs and ſome other bedding; in another, a ſmall trunk, which ſerved the double purpoſe of table and cupboard: A ſmall kegg, and a brace of piſtols made up the reſt of the furniture, all which had been procured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed thither by the truſty ſervant.</p>
            <p>Being all ſeated on the matraſs, Eugenio proceeded to relate his ſtory:—"My narrative," ſaid he, "gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will be found barren of pleaſure or amuſement, as it conſiſts entirely (the latter part at leaſt) of melancholy, vexation and deſpair. My father, one of the repreſentatives of the county of M—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thought proper, after I had gone through all the ſteps of a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral education at home, that I ſhould take a tour thro'
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031902_0149_0FEF3CC0B917EFB0"/>
France, Spain, and Italy. In conſequence of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, he ſought out an elderly gentleman, of good morals, completely verſed in the ſciences, a competent judge of the human mind and the paſſions of it. He poſſeſt a ſweetneſs of temper peculiar to himſelf, and his countenance and deportment would have commanded reſpect among ruffians. Such a perſon, inheriting every endearing qualification, could not have failed to attract my moſt profound reverence and eſteem: I already anticipated the profit, as well as pleaſure, I ſhould derive from the company of a gentleman, who knew how to blend the moſt inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precepts with the moſt familiar converſation, from which I might imbibe principles that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect honor on the choice of my father, the abilities of my tutor, and on my own genius and induſtry.</p>
            <p>"My father's next care, was to engage a faithful ſervant to attend us through the whole of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had juſt entered my eighteenth year when I commenced this tour. Our firſt move was to Paris, where we remained three months. From thence we went to Orleans, ſtayed three weeks; and then proceeded to Lyons. We made but a ſhort ſtay there, reſolving to embark at Toulon for Civitta Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia. We ſpent ſix weeks in Rome, and then viſited
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031902_0150_0FEF3CC510099F10"/>
Naples, ſtaid there a ſhort time and ſet out for Florence, which we never yet have reached. Having miſſed our proper road we travelled till we were within an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance of the capital of St. Marino. My tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who had formerly been there, propoſed, as we were ſo near, to ride into town, put up our horſes, refreſh, and ſpend an hour or two in the evening in the governor's garden, which, he ſaid, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect type of Eden—lodge in St. Marino that night, and ſtart for Florence in the morning. I made no objection but ſubmitted every thing to his ſuperior judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The landlord where we halted, ſent a little Italian with us to the porter of the governor's gardens, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt admiſſion for us in his maſter's name. He inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the porter that we were a couple of foreign gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on our travels, who had rode a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance out of our way in order to take a view of the gardens, and that his maſter would eſteem the favor as done to himſelf if he would admit us. He admitted us without heſitation, for which my tutor rewarded him with a piece of gold. He then conducted us to a walk which led to the centre. I was ſtruck with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the aſtoniſhing ſtruggle between nature and art, which appeared in the beauteous diſpoſition of the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſurrounding objects. In the centre, a baſon of marble, well ſtocked with gold and ſilver fiſh, fifteen yards diameter, had a very fine e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ct, which was encreaſed by the figure of a ſea-horſe, gilt, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the baſon, from the noſtrils of which two ſtreams of water projected to the height of thirty feet. The
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031902_0151_0FEF3CC7F5F00778"/>
baſon is immediately ſurrounded by ten beautiful olive trees, planted at equal diſtances. Twenty yards from theſe, another circle of trees afford a charming ſhelter to the delightful arbors which occupy the intermediate ſpaces. Here perſons of the firſt rank in the republic, uſually ſpend their evenings, after feaſting their ſight and ſmell with the exquiſite odours which proceed from the flowers of every hue; which, by the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating hands of the moſt celerated floriſts, are taught to grow in every direction. In each of theſe arbors is an elegant organ, which, by turning a ſmall braſs cock, plays off thirty-ſix favorite Italian airs: They can all be ſet going together, or one, two, &amp;c. at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The contrivance is a maſter piece of art: By raiſing a ſmall gate in the ſide of a canal at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, from which the baſon is ſupplied, a ſmall trunk is immediately filled with water; at the other extremity of which are as many braſs cocks as there are organs: When theſe are turned, the muſic begins. One of thoſe organs was playing juſt as we paſſed the door of the arbor. We ſtopped a while to liſten to the enchanting ſound, an Eunuch coming out at that moment, my tutor enquired if a couple of foreigners might be admitted. He deſired us to wait a moment, left us, and inſtantly returning, deſired us to walk in. We complied, and were much ſurprized at being ſaluted, on our entrance, by five ladies"—(Here he faultered)—"Five ladies richly habited and cloſely veiled." (Here tears inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his narrative. Recovering, "Gentlemen, pardon my emotion," ſaid he, "you will find in the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031902_0152_0FEF3CCB49FA6D98"/>
ſequel of my unhappy ſtory, enough to juſtify my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent behavior.</p>
            <p>"We returned their ſalute in a proper manner. The muſic was ſuddenly ſtopt, and one of the ladies, who by her air and the ſuperiority of her dreſs, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to claim the precedence, requeſted us to be ſeated, with which we complied. She then aſked how long we had been in Italy? My tutor ſatisfied her in this particular, ſhe proceeded to aſk ſeveral other queſtions concerning our paſt travels, and the route we intended to take; to all of which we anſwered without reſerve. She expreſſed her ſatisfaction with the diſcription we had given her of England, France, and the other places through which we had paſſed; and in her turn deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the moſt animating ſtyle, the innumerable rarities of Italy, adding, that three days would not be ſufficient to review thoſe gardens, as they were very extenſive. We paſſed the higheſt encomiums on the taſte, magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and convenience, which appeared in every part; but urged the unavoidable neceſſity of departing from thence the next morning, as our time was limited, and we had ſpent a great portion of it in France; therefore, it required our exertion, in order to finiſh our intended tour within the appointed time.</p>
            <p>"To this ſhe made no anſwer, but rung a ſmall bell, which brought the Eunuch, to whom ſhe whiſpered a few words: He withdrew immediately, but ſoon after returned, bearing two bottles, ſome glaſſes, and
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031902_0153_0FEF31CC76513278"/>
a caſket of the moſt dilicious fruits. Having placed theſe on a table, he was ordered to ſet the muſic to playing. The ladies invited us to partake of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. The muſic began, and the ladies unveiled.— But ah! The pangs that ſight has coſt me are beyond deſcription! The firſt time my raviſhed eyes met thoſe of the beauteous Terentia, my ſoul experienced emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which, till then, I had been a ſtranger! Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe new impreſſions I was much embarraſſed, I retired for ſome time, for feeling my face fluſhed with an unuſual warmth, I was afraid my tutor ſhould perceive my agitation; well knowing him to be a man of the moſt acute penetration, and apt to draw the moſt exact concluſions. I was convinced that the beauteous object who was the cauſe of my emotion, perceived it plainly; for whenever my eyes accidentally met her's, I found them rivetted on me; ſhe would then caſt them downwards, and affect to be paying earneſt attention to the muſic. Having walked once or twice round the baſon, I found myſelf pretty well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; I ſummoned all my fortitude, and returned to my company. After the organ had played off a round, my tutor made a motion to retire; accordingly, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a proper acknowledgement, for the very kind reception we had met with, we took leave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
            <p>"We returned to our inn, and retired early to reſt. When I reflected on our evening's adventure, I began to be well ſatisfied at leaving St. Marino in the morning,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031902_0154_0FEF3CCCDF551A58"/>
as the means of obliterating the memory of an infant attachment, which, if ſuffered to gather ſtrength, muſt inevitably draw after it a train of diſagreeable, if not fatal conſequences; for by the influence the dear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia had over the reſt of the ladies, I concluded, and rightly too, that ſhe muſt be the governor's daughter. My ſleep, however, was much diſturbed by dreams, yet when my tutor awakened me, which was at day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, I found myſelf in tolerable ſpirits. The reaſon he aſſigned for waking me ſo early, was, that it would be much more agreeable to ride in the morning, than in the ſcorching rays of noon. I roſe immediately, and though the mandate appeared ſomewhat diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at firſt, yet I dreſſed briſkly: In the mean time, my tutor rouſed the landlord, and ordered our horſes to be got ready immediately. My chagrin wore off inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and the viſions of the prece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My ſervant was adjuſting my hair, when my tutor entered and informed us, that our horſes were ſtolen! What then is to be done? ſaid I. Why, replied my tutor, we muſt remain here a day or two, in order that the lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We had depoſited a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred guineas, the value of the horſes, in the hands of the owner, but were to be reimburſed in Florence, by the perſon to whom we were to deliver them, all but fifteen guineas, which was for their hire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="unknown:031902_0155_0FEF3CD29ADEDC48"/>"Being detained contrary to our wiſhes or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, my tutor, after breakfaſt, propoſed taking a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view of the Governor's gardens, which pleaſed me exceedingly. On our way to the gardens, my tutor pointed to a ſuperb edifice, which he informed me was the palace of the Governor. We ſtood ſome minutes to view this magnificent ſtructure, and as we were turning to go to the gardens, I perceived at one of the upper windows, the lady who had treated us ſo kindly the preceding evening; but perceiving us, ſhe inſtantly diſappeared.</p>
            <p>"This incident gave me ſome uneaſineſs; however, I ſtill ſupported a kind of feigned cheerfulneſs, in order to deceive my tutor—the firſt time I had ever felt an inclination ſo to do. Having gained admittance, we took a different walk from that of the preceding day, which led us into one of the moſt delightful ſcenes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If there is a place on earth, deſcriptive of the primeval reſidence of our firſt parents, this muſt be the ſpot.</p>
            <p>"We traverſed theſe paradiſiacal walks until noon, and the day beginning to grow warm, we retired into an elegant ſummer-houſe, ſo ſituated as to ſcreen us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from the meridional beams, and at the ſame time to command a proſpect of the circus, baſon, &amp;c.</p>

After he had ſlept ſome moments, I found myſelf weary fitting alone, I got up, and bent my ſteps towards a ſmall grove of trees, cut in the form of cones, and planted in narrow rows, which formed a very refreſhing retreat.</p>
            <p>"I had not been long in this ſequeſtered ſpot, when I ſaw four or five young ladies croſs the walk I was in, at the diſtance of about a hundred yards.

Though I was not ſure they were the ſame I had been in company with the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet I found an unuſual flow of ſpirits on their paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was anxious to have a full view of them, for ſomething whiſpered me, There goes the cauſe of your late uneaſineſs. I immediately, I know not by what impulſe, advanced to the ſpot where they had thwarted my fight. When I arrived there, I deſoried them at a diſtance taking leave of each other, after which each took a different route. I was convinced that I had gueſſed rightly, for ſhe whoſe image had haunted me all the foregoing night, was then walking ſlowly before me, towards the farther end of the walk.

            <p>"In the evening, I repaired to the ſpot where I was to meet the object of my love; 'twas at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a wood at the foot of this mountain. She appeared at the time appointed, and we at her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt penetrated the wood about half a mile, to the mountain brow, where we were met by an old Friar, who conducted us to a cell, in the ſide of the rock, and, ſhutting the door, deſired us to ſit down. My
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031902_0158_0FEF3CDA49635200"/>
charming bride told him ſhe was in haſte, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to perform the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>mony immediately, as he had promiſed.</p>
            <p>"He then repreſented the imminent danger to which he ſhould expoſe himſelf, and the magnitude of the offence; adding, that he trembled at the fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that muſt inevitably follow a diſcovery. She told him there was not a perſon on earth privy to it but thoſe who were preſent, and that as ſhe intended to ſleep in her own apartment that night, there was not the leaſt ſhadow of danger. To theſe arguments ſhe added a purſe of gold, which effectually ſilenced the reverend father, and ſecured his ſervice.</p>
            <p>"He then proceeded to the nuptial ceremony, which he performed in a very devout and becoming manner. After the ceremony was ended, he laid the ſtricteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions on us never to diſcover the place nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by whom we had been married. This we both promiſed religiouſly to obſerve; then, having thanked him and wiſhed him a good night, we were about to leave the cell, when we were much alarmed at hearing the ſound of human voices, approaching. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation was increaſed, when the Friar, who went out on the firſt alarm, came in and informed us, that a party of the Governor's life guards, with an officer at their head, were within two hundred yards, advancing briſkly, by torch-light. Imagination cannot ſhape to itſelf a ſituation more alarming than mine was at
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:031902_0159_0FEF3CDC335BACB0"/>
that moment. The Friar ſaid, "Fly my ſon! Your being found here will be fatal to us all. I have a private way to eſcape under ground; perhaps if you are not found, all may yet be well." There was no time for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; I was conſtrained to comply, Heaven knows with what reluctance! So, after taking a parting em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, I fear for ever, of my dear Terentia, he gave me a burning, waxen taper in my hand; then lifting a trap door, beſtowed on me his benediction, and I entered the diſmal gulph, overwhelmed with all the horrors which ſuch a dreadful viciſſitude was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of producing. He ſhut down the door and left me to penetrate the bowels of this mountain for near a mile, under the moſt excruciating torture of mind. At length, I emerged once more into open air, through a crevice of a rock barely wide enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me. I wandered about through the thickets, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times miſſing my ſteps and falling many yards down the rugged ſide of the mountain, till day light, when I found myſelf on the uppermoſt declivity of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory, which affords a much more horrid proſpect than you now behold. In that inhoſpitable ſpot I ſat down, weary and faint with climbing from one ridge of rocks to another, all night, to bemoan my adverſe fate, ruminating on the dreadful ſituation to which, in the ſhort ſpace of two days and two nights, I was reduced, the circumſtances which produced, and thoſe which accompanied this change; I became as it were, petrified with grief and aſtoniſhment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained inſenſible of every thing, and ſhould probably,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031902_0160_0FEF3CE1745C3C60"/>
never have recovered, had not my man, who provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially through curioſity watched us to the cell, and lay perdue till the guards were gone, diſcovered my retreat. He, obſerving that they took my dear ſpouſe and the Friar with them, ſuſpected I was ſlain, and as ſoon as they were out of ſight, entered the cell.</p>
            <p>"After he had called me ſeveral times by name, he began to ſearch diligently, and finding a waxen taper, light it, and as he has ſince informed me, ſearched eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of the cell with great minuteneſs. He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſurprized, and could not believe his own eyes: Looking again, however, very narrowly, he eſpied the trap door, which he raiſed and deſcended inſtantly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He continued purſuing and calling me until his taper was exhauſted, and then groped his way to the hole through which I had paſſed. It being then broad day, ſo that in ſome places he could trace my footſteps along. Obſerving ſomething white, at a diſtance on an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, far above him, he advanced towards it, thinking I had laid down, and hung my handkerchief there as a ſignal to him in caſe he ſhould ſearch for me. However, in this he was miſtaken; for though it was my handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. I was not there, but had dropped it by accident. But it happened through the providence of God, that as he ſtood debating with himſelf whether he ſhould proceed, or return back by the way he came, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my tutor of what had happened, that he perceived me at the diſtance, he ſuppoſed, of three quarters of a mile, climbing over a ridge of rocks. He had once
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:031902_0161_0FEF3CE4B0375A70"/>
a mind to call; but reflecting, that as I was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his having followed me, I might conceive it to be ſome of the guards in purſuit, and conceal myſelf where he would not be able to find me, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to follow in ſilence.</p>
            <p>"He found me in the ſituation I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and having after a long ſearch, found a ſpring iſſuing from a rock, he waſhed my face and temples, by which means I recovered my ſenſes again. Miſerable as I was, a tranſient gleam of joy ran through my ſoul on beholding my truſty, affectionate ſervant; but gloomy reflections took place of that, and I fear will pervade my ſoul till death puts a period to my life and miſeries together.</p>
            <p>"The place in which he found me, afforded no ſhelter from the fury of a ſtorm, which was collecting, we therefore ſet out in ſearch for a ſituation that would, and chance directed us to this cavern. About noon the clouds diſperſed, and the weather became ſerene, my man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would endeavor to find the way to town, in order to gain ſome intelligence of my tutor, if poſſible, and to procure ſome proviſions for me. Though I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wiſhed to know how matters had been conducted ſince the unhappy affair of the preceding evening, and though we could not exiſt long without ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it was with reluctance I permitted him to go. A thouſand doubts and fears poſſeſſed my mind, until he returned, and informed me of his ſucceſs. On
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031902_0162_0FEF3CE665653630"/>
his arrival in town, it was his intention to go to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> but fear being ever watchful, before he ventured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, he took care to have a watchful eye about him, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t he ſhould be diſcovered, and was no ſooner within ſight of the houſe than he perceived it ſurrounded by guards. He retreated with ſome precipitation, down a narrow lane, which led to a remote part of the town. Slackening his pace a little, he accidentally met an old acquaintance, with whom he had contracted an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy when attending my father in his travels. His friend invited him to partake of a bottle of wine, to which he complied, and while drinking, they enquired of each other the particulars of their travels, employment, &amp;c. They both anſwered without reſerve. "My friend," ſaid the other to my man, "I am ſorry to find you are in the ſervice of a perſon, who if found, will meet the moſt rigorous treatment, if not an ignominious death. The old gentleman, his companion, is now in a dungeon, as well as the Friar and landlord; and I am afraid that will not be the greateſt puniſhment the Governor will inflict on them, for he is much enraged againſt them. I was preſent at their whole examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and though there does not appear any cauſe of accuſation againſt any but the Friar, they will ſhare the ſame puniſhment."</p>
            <p>"My man then requeſted him to tell every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he knew, which he did in a few words. He informed him, that an ancient Duenna, who had nurſed Terentia, and had a real affection for her, ſeeing her ſet
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031902_0163_0FEF3CE99BC223E0"/>
out towards the Friar's cell, reſolved to follow and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her home, but on ſeeing her ſo familiarly give me her hand and enter the wood with me, returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and informed the Governor of the diſcovery ſhe had made, who immediately ordered his guards to go to Friar John's cell, and bring every perſon he found there inſtantly before him. The dear creature diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all manner of knowledge or acquaintance with me: That ſhe had met a gentleman on her entering the wood, ſhe confeſſed, but denied having any diſcourſe with him. The Friar alſo perſiſted in having ſeen her come alone to the cell, and that there had been no other perſon there that evening.</p>
            <p>"Notwithſtanding all their aſſeverations of innocence, the Friar was committed to the dungeon, and my dear bride to the care of the Duenna, with orders to keep her cloſely confined from the ſight of every perſon but herſelf. "Your horſes," continued his friend, "were found in the poſſeſſion of a man, who would not deliver them to any perſon but ſome of the Governor's houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: The landlord, and the old gentleman took him by force and conveyed him to town late laſt night, confined him in a room till this morning, when they obtained an audience of the Governor, and had their priſoner examined. His examination developed the whole affair, for he produced a note in the hand writing of Terentia, charging him to keep the horſes ſafely, until the bearer or ſome other of her father's domeſtics ſhould demand them, and not then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031902_0164_0FEF3CEE36BF1F18"/>
her orders in writing. On being aſked who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the horſes to him, he anſwered he believed it to be one of the Governor's Eunuch's, and that he was ſure he ſhould know him if he could ſee him again. All the Eunuchs were then brought into the preſence of the governor, and the man inſtantly pointed out the culprit. He denied the fact poſitively, and bore the rack a conſiderable time before he diſcloſed the truth. He confeſſed that his miſtreſs had given him orders to watch two gentlemen from the gardens to their lodgings, to find out whether they travelled on horſeback or not: That having performed this, he informed her of every circumſtance, and that ſhe gave him money and the note, charging him to go in the night, take the horſes out of the ſtable, and convey them to the place where they were found. The Governor ordered him to be ſtrangled immediately. The man in whoſe cuſtody the horſes were found, was ſeverely ſcourged, for not giving immediate notice to the Governor of theſe proceedings:" A guard was ſent to the inn to ſearch for me, with orders not to return without me; and my tutor and the landlord cloſely confined, till I ſhould be found.</p>
            <p>"This was all he could collect at that time, and being well aſſured of the fidelity of his friend, informed him of my concealment, and begged he would aſſiſt him in procuring ſome neceſſaries for my ſupport: This he complied with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they parted, having previouſly agreed to meet the next day at the ſame place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:031902_0165_0FEF3CF154F7EB80"/>"My man returned in the evening, much fatigued, having carried this matraſs and cover, beſides provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions enough for a week's ſubſiſtence, and a large flaſk of wine.</p>
            <p>"When I reflected on the concatenation of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by which my late happineſs, and preſent miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was effected, I could not but admire the power of love, which ſurmounts every difficulty, and maugre conſequences, braves every danger to attain its end. It is obvious, that our horſes were taken for no other purpoſe than to detain us in St. Marino ſome day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> longer. But to proceed:—</p>
            <p>"From the information of my man, reſpecting the fidelity of his friend, I began to entertain hopes of yet regaining my dear Terentia, if there was a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of conveying a letter to her. I communicated theſe ideas to my man, which he ſaid exactly correſponded with his, and added, that but for the ſhortneſs of the time, he would have ſounded his friend on that ſubject, but would not fail to try every expedient to procure me the ſatisfaction I deſired. He met his friend accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appointment and found every thing to his wiſh. His friend is in the ſervice of an Engliſh gentleman, who lodges in a houſe in a back ſtreet, the back win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of which overlooks the Governor's private garden, which is immediately attached to the palace.— His friend further informed him, that he had formed an intimacy with a female domeſtic of the Governor's,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031902_0166_0FEF3CF41FCA36D0"/>
by whoſe means he could be informed of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relative to my af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>airs. He ſaid, the Duenna attended the young lady as the ſhadow the ſubſtance; but that he did not doubt finding means to convey her a letter, if committed to his charge. My man aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of an ample reward if he ſucceeded; but with all conjured him not to communicate the ſecret to his fair enamoratta. He then, with the aſſiſtance of his friend, procured pen, ink and paper; flint, ſteel and candles, and returned to me full of the ſucceſs of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation. I was overjoyed at the proſpect of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happineſs, and embraced him as a brother—indeed he has manifeſted the moſt unſhaken attachment, and unwearied diligence in ſoothing my misfortunes, which demands my utmoſt regard,</p>
            <p>"The next morning I wrote a letter to my dear girl, wherein I deſcribed my dreadful ſituation—painted the anguiſh of my mind on her particular account, and my ſorrow for the fate of my beloved tutor. I conjured her by the ſacred ties which united our ſouls, to let me know the ſituation of affairs there, and gave her a hint of the fidelity of the perſon who forwarded the letter. I ſealed and delivered this to my faithful ſervant. "Now, ſir," ſaid he, "don't be alarmed, if you ſhould not ſee me for a day or two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is impoſſible to hurry this kind of buſineſs, becauſe it depends entirely upon circumſtances, and muſt be conducted with the greateſt caution." He was gone four days and as many tedious nights: I began to look on my ruin as
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031902_0167_0FEF3CF9D74820F8"/>
inevitable. I ſaw already my man ſtretched on the rack —ſaw the guards aſcending the mountain, and was ſeveral times preparing to take the deſperate leap, from which you prevented me to day. It was my determination to eſcape my enemies by that means, if ever they ſhould diſcover my retreat.</p>
            <p>"At length, however, he arrived with a letter from her dear hand: (Here he read the letter:) He ſaid his friend bid him tell me, that he had never run ſuch a hazzard in his life, as he did in procuring it. He had taken an opportunity of dropping my letter into the walk before her, when her keeper was at ſome diſtance behind. Terentia, ſaw it fall, and caſting her eyes upwards and perceiving him, ſeemed to heſitate; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe picked it up and thruſt it haſtily into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. Her keeper overtook her preſently and paſſed her, and after ſome time went into the palace. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſtay in the houſe he obſerved my wife, ſeated in a ſhady ſpot, reading the letter, with much appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent emotion. She ſuppreſſed her agitation, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anxious to ſpeak to him; but that was impoſſible, as the Duenna juſt then returned. The next morning, very early, he poſted himſelf at the window, and though it was but juſt day light, ſhe was there. She perceived him immediately, and ſhowed him a billet which ſhe ſeemed anxious to convey to him. He made a ſign to her to throw it down, and retire, giving her to underſtand that he would deſcend for it, ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him and immediately complied. He then, by the help of a rope-ladder, which was kept in the houſe
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031902_0168_0FEF3CFD1621E4C0"/>
in caſe of fire, deſcended ſpeedily, took up the letter, and returned to his poſt; then taking up his ladder he ſtood ſome minutes, till the dear creature, who had been obſerving his motions, returned to the ſpot where ſhe had left the letter, and perceiving it gone, looked up at him with a glow of ſatisfaction on her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and retired into the houſe. His friend further ſaid that he did not conceive it impoſſible to deliver her entirely from her confinement, and if I could deviſe means to convey her out of Italy immediately, he would freely undertake it.</p>
            <p>"You ſee gentlemen," ſaid he, "that my worthy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is condemned to linger out his days in a miſerable dungeon, and ſelf preſervation will not permit me to take any ſtep towards effecting his liberation. This thought afflicts me beyond meaſure. If he had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his puniſhment by any miſconduct of his own, I ſhould have been ſenſibly afflicted; but the reflection of his being entirely innocent, and of the whole crime being mine, diſtracts me, and, I fear, will make ſuch an impreſſion of grief on my mind, as will never be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced.</p>
            <p>"My ſervant is now gone with a letter to inform my dear Terentia that I am determined to free myſelf and her quickly, or periſh in the attempt. He is alſo to requeſt his friend to aſſiſt him in procuring beaſts to convey us to Leghorn, where, if we ſucceed, I will embark for England immediately. This, gentlemen,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031902_0169_0FEF3CFF40108678"/>
is the ſum of my unhappy ſtory, and I think you muſt acknowledge my misfortunes to be peculiarly diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: ſuch as, I hope, you will never experience."</p>
            <p>They confeſſed he had been unfortunate, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to be cheerful, for that his caſe, at preſent, was by no means deſperate; that he had now reaſon to expect that his affairs would take a favourable turn. They informed him of their intended voyage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him every poſſible aſſiſtance. Juſt at this inſtant the ſervant arrived.</p>
            <p>The ſervant ſtarted at the ſight of ſtrangers, and was going to retire, but his maſter, perceiving his intention prevented him, ſaying, Fear nothing, here are none but friends: Come forward, how have you ſped? At that inſtant Mercutio and George aroſe, with an intention to retire; but Eugenio inſiſted on their ſtay until his ſervant ſhould have diſcloſed the reſult of his negociation. They acquieſced, and he deſired the ſervant to inform them, without reſerve, of all his tranſactions ſince his departure from thence: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan as follows:—</p>
            <p>"I met my friend at the appointed place, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that the Governor of St. Marino intends paying a viſit to the Doge of Venice, in a very ſhort time: He added, that the lady is not ſo cloſely confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſhe has been, being now permitted to walk in the garden alone. He adviſes you, ſir, to remain here
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031902_0170_0FEF3D0123636AF0"/>
until her father ſets out for Venice; in the mean time, he promiſes to arrange matters ſo as to effect the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the lady immediately after the departure of her father."</p>
            <p>He then delivered a letter which, he ſaid, his friend had procured from the lady's own hand. Eugenio ſeized it, and read it with avidity, then preſenting it to Mercutio, ſaid, Behold a ſlight ſpecimen of her mental accompliſhments, and tell me whether the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happineſs appears to be intimately connected with ſuch perfection, or not.</p>
            <p>After peruſing it attentively, our hero and his friend could not withhold their aſſent to his propoſition: They beſtowed the greateſt encomiums on the amiable and beloved writer, who, by the ſpirit, eaſe and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance with which ſhe wrote, would have arreſted the attention, and extorted the approbation of the moſt ſurly critic. To the moſt ardent vows of eternal fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, united with wiſhes for her deliverance, ſhe added an intimation of her father's intended journey to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and a minute account of the particular rout he deſigned to take.</p>
            <p>Mercutio enjoined Eugenio to make himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eaſy, as from the preſent face of his affairs, he had every reaſon to hope they would ſhortly terminate to his entire ſatisfaction. George heartily joi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed in the admonition, and added, that his houſe and purſe
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031902_0171_0FEF3D069A678968"/>
were at his ſervice, together with all the perſonal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in his power. "My beloved friends," ſaid the aſtoniſhed Eugenio, "how ſhall I render you a proper return for your unparalelled generoſity? The liberality, and extenſive latitude of your offers, when I reflect on my preſent critical ſituation, and the danger to which you expoſe yourſelves in caſe of diſcovery, really amaze me! Of one thing I am ſure—if the whole of my future <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhould be devoted entirely to your ſervice it would fall infinitely ſhort of a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn." Common humanity, replied George, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in this caſe to prompt us to contribute to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, therefore we can have no claim on your gratitude; for all the good offices we can poſſibly perform in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of each other will entitle us to no other reward, than a conſciouſneſs of having performed a part of that duty, which, as men, we owe one to another. If by any thing in our power, your happineſs is ſecured, we ſhall participate with you in the conviction of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acted with propriety; and the only acceptable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you can make, is your friendſhip, independent of acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>This effectually ſilenced Eugenio, and George pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to retire: "In the evening," ſaid he, "I will ſend a perſon to conduct you and your ſervant to my houſe, which is but a ſhort diſtance from hence, where you ſhall be properly accommodated, and may remain in as much privacy as here, till your affairs are brought to an iſſue." Eugenio was about to return an anſwer

full of grateful acknowledgments; but they politely taking leave, and bidding him fear nothing, departed.</p>
            <p>As they deſcended the mountain, their diſcourſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally turned on the amazing revolutions of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. "Eugenio," ſaid George, "was beginning to grow deſperate yeſterday, and if we had not diſcovered his retreat, it is more than probable he would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the regaining his wiſe by means which, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, might have terminated in his deſtruction." "Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely," replied Mercutio; "the ſenſe of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had nearly overcome his reaſon and fortitude: How often are we prevented, by the interpoſition of Divine Providence from the commiſſion of that, which, if permitted, would involve us in inevitable ruin! Then how thankful ought we to be to that mighty Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſpake all things into exiſtence, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful condeſcenſion in reſtraining us from actions which, if committed, his juſtice muſt have ſeverely puniſhed."</p>
            <p>Having regained the foot of the mountain, they were joined by their ladies, who were taking a walk along the ſea ſhore, the ground between which and the mountain being covered with a delightful verdure, with fine tufts of trees interſperſed, on the boughs of which millions of birds ſat ſinging; the azure concave was beautifully clear to the extremity of the horizon, and every obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct conſpired to render their excurſion agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It was in this delightful ſpot that George <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of the diſcovery his friend and he had that
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031902_0173_0FEF3D0A411FDB68"/>
morning made. They liſtened with aſtoniſhment and expreſſed the utmoſt ſolicitude for the ſucceſs of Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio and Terentia. They next conſulted on the moſt ſalutary meaſures to be employed with regard to their intended journey, and after rejecting ſeveral propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, agreed, that preparations ſhould be made for a ſudden departure, horſes provided, ready to ſtart at a minute's warning, and all things packed up ready to lay on them. It was alſo thought requiſite that Eugenio and Terentia ſhould aſſume the appearance of ſervants, at leaſt till their arrival at Florence, in order, by concealing their quality, to prevent diſcovery. Theſe preliminaries being agreed to, George inſtructed a ſervant how to aſcend the mountain and to conduct Eugenio down thither in the twilight.</p>
            <p>Eugenio arrived attended by his guide and ſervant juſt as candles were lighting. The reception he met with, reflected the higheſt honour on the feelings of his new found friends: He was introduced to the ladies by Mercutio; they received him with marks of the moſt profound reſpect.</p>
            <p>Eugenio was a handſome perſon, perfectly well ſhaped and extremely polite; his complexion fair, his features manly; and though his late misfortunes had, in ſome meaſure, checked his natural vivacity, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning hope rendered his company very agreeable, which, added to his mental qualifications, ſecured him a ſtrong prepoſſeſſion in the affections of his new friends,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031902_0174_0FEF3D0D250A3D20"/>
who now actually conſulted the eaſe and ſafety of their gueſt more than their own.</p>
            <p>After ſupper, George informed Eugenio of the plan which had been adopted, which he highly approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, expreſſed much ſurprize at the promptitude of his friends to ſerve him, and promiſed eternal friendſhip in return.</p>
            <p>Early on the following day, Eugenio diſpatched his man with a letter to Terentia, informing her of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſituation, and of the plan projected by his friends: He likewiſe ſent a handſome preſent to his agent in town, requeſting at the ſame time, his every aſſiſtance to releaſe the lady as ſoon as the Governor ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, aſſuring him of an ample reward. The man had orders to conceal himſelf in town till an anſwer was procured. George inſtantly began to make the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary arrangements for the intended journey, in which Mercutio aſſiſted him. The houſe in which George reſided was ready furniſhed, therefore his moveables could be eaſily packed in portmantaus, which was immediately done, while our hero and George went in queſt of horſes, to tranſport them whenever they might be called for. In the mean time, Eugenio's ſervant ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with a letter from Terentia, in ſubſtance as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:

It was then concerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his friend, that on the evening of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing day, he ſhould conduct his maſter to the ſpot where he had met Terentia in order to proceed to Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r John's cell, and there wait the arrival of the lady. His friend informed him that Terentia was to feign a ſlight indiſpoſition ſome hours before that appointed for the intended enterprize, and retire to her cloſet on pretence of trying to compoſe herſelf to ſleep. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her window overlooked the garden, and was not more than four feet from the ground, ſo that ſhe might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with ſafety: In the mean time, he would fix the abovementioned ladder of ropes to his own window, with which ſhe was well acquainted, where he would ſtand centinel and inſtantly on her approach, drop the ladder, receive her into the window and, throw a man's long riding cloak over her, conduct her to the appointed ſpot: He added, that his maſter's being out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> for a few days would greatly facilitate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:031902_0177_0FEF3D16FAB49468"/>Having placed every thing in a proper train in town, Eugenio's ſervant returned with a billet from the lady, wherein ſhe aſſured him of her perfect willingneſs, and even impatience to accompany him to any part of the globe.</p>
            <p>Eugenio communicated theſe welcome tidings to his friends, who partook of his ſatisfaction on the occaſion. They then concluded, that it would be prudent to ſend for the horſes in the afternoon; to have the baggage laid on as ſoon as it was dark, then ſet forward and travel all night, and, as George knew the whole road perfectly, to halt as ſeldom as poſſible until they ſhould arrive in Leghorn.</p>
            <p>The next day all hands were buſy in making the neceſſary arrangements for their departure: Eugenio, in a ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the utmoſt anxiety, thought it the longeſt of his lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; nor were his friends leſs anxious. At two o'clock, the ſervants were diſpatched for the beaſts; at five, Eugenio and his man began to aſcend the mountain, and our hero and his friends waited their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in calm ſuſpence, as though ſomething fatal hung on the event. The whole hemiſphere was involved in darkneſs, when Eugenio and his faithful ſervant arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the place of aſſignation. After waiting about half an hour, full of hopes and fears, Eugenio was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from all his anxiety, by the appearance of her whom he eſteemed more than empires: He claſped her in his arms with ectaſy, at the ſame time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031902_0178_0FEF3D18B3756E70"/>
"And do I once more embrace my love! Thanks to all gracious heaven! Such bliſs would be cheaply purchaſed with an age of toil and ſuſpence." Terentia manifeſted her ſatisfaction by the moſt tender careſſes, and tears of joy.</p>
            <p>After the firſt emotions had ſubſided, Eugenio turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her conductor, ſaying, "And you, my much eſteemed friend! How ſhall I ever reward your merit as it deſerves? You have rendered me a kindneſs which I can never repay. But (pulling out a purſe of gold and preſenting it) accept this trifling teſtimony of my eſteem, until an opportunity ſhall offer when I may have it in my power to do more juſtice to your worth. " He refuſed it peremptorily—perſuaſions were vain, he would not touch a ſingle ducat, and it was with ſome difficulty that he was prevailed on to accept a ring which Eugenio forced on his finger, ſaying, "Wear this, as a token of my friendſhip, till you return to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when you muſt return it; and I will ſupply its place by ſomething more worthy of your acceptance."</p>
            <p>They then took an affectionate leave of each other and parted. Eugenio's man led the way bearing a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weighty caſket belonging to Terentia: They were a conſiderable time deſcending the mountain, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafely at George's juſt as ſupper was ſerved up. Terentia was received with politeneſs and affection; and, after reſting herſelf a little, ſat down to ſupper with them. Preparation was inſtantly made for their
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:031902_0179_0FEF3D1FA84BC3F0"/>
departure, Mercutio and George undertook to equip Eugenio, and the ladies diſguiſed Terentia, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to perſonate Iſabella's waiting woman. In the mean time, the ſervants ſaddled the horſes and laid on the baggage, and, after imploring the aſſiſtance and protection of heaven, they mounted and ſet forward.</p>
            <p>They arrived at Leghorn without meeting with any material occurrence, where they were received with the moſt unaffected cordiality by Mr. Wilcox and his amiable ſpouſe, who, though ſomewhat advanced in years, was poſſeſſed of the moſt perfect good nature, added to a ſuperior degree of good ſenſe, and a moſt pleaſing vivacity combined with an elegant form and unacceptionable features.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wilcox had two ſons, the eldeſt commanded a ſtout merchant ſhip in the Levant trade; the youngeſt was factor to his father, in Amſterdam; and two daughters, the youngeſt was then in Holland with her brother; and the eldeſt was married to George Wright.</p>
            <p>The old gentleman had already provided a ſhip to tranſport them to Holland, which he had freighted himſelf: He intended to remain in Amſterdam a few weeks, till his ſon Robert ſhould have diſpoſed of what merchandize he had on hand, expecting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of his other ſon from the Levant, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Liverpool with his whole family. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but ten days in Leghorn, for George having
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031902_0180_0FEF3D215C268330"/>
informed his father and mother-in-law of the adventure of Eugenio and Terentia, they judged it the moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to keep them in diſguiſe while on ſhore, and to embark as ſoon as convenient. In the mean time Mr. Wilcox and his ſon-in-law were buſy in ſeeing their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects embarked and ſafely ſtowed on board the ſhip. One day they found the captain engaged in diſcourſe with a ſtranger, who ſeemed to preſs earneſtly for ſome favor: The Captain perceiving Mr. Wilcox, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the ſtranger, ſomewhat haſtily, ſaying, here is the gentleman of whom I was ſpeaking, if he is willing to grant your requeſt I have not the leaſt objection.</p>
            <p>"What is your requeſt Sir?" ſaid Mr. Wilcox, in the moſt unreſerved manner, "I ſhall think myſelf happy in having it in my power to oblige a gentleman of your appearance, therefore pray let me hear your requeſt, and rely on my willingneſs to ſerve you." "You do me a great deal of honour, Sir," ſaid the ſtranger, "and I cannot enough admire your frankneſs and generoſity, in ſo freely tendering me your ſervice. Not to keep you longer in ſuſpence, I am a native of England, and have been tranſacting ſome affairs in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a certain nobleman in London: Having lately received letters from thence preſſing me to return on a very important affair, I am in haſte to get thither. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having, in vain enquired for a veſſel bound for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, I was informed of this being ſhortly to ſail for Holland; I therefore made application to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who informs me, that you have already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:031902_0181_0FEF3D2381227F30"/>
his ſhip entirely, and that without your conſent he could not pretend to take any paſſengers on board. Now Sir, if you will be kind enough to permit me to ſail with you to your deſtined port, as my affairs are very preſſing, I ſhall eſteem it as a favor of the firſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, and will comply with every requiſite for my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage." "Say no more, ſir," ſaid Mr. Wilcox: "You are not only welcome to your paſſage, but, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe myſelf much ſatisfaction in your company, I ſhall make that the only condition." "Your generoſity," returned the ſtranger, "demands all my gratitude, and you may reſt aſſured of my eternal acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the obligation." He would have proceeded, but Mr. Wilcox prevented him by informing him, that he intended to embark his family early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſail whenever the wind ſhould ſerve, therefore, adviſed him, if he had any buſineſs to tranſact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on ſhore, to be as expeditious as poſſible.</p>
            <p>They then politely took leave of each other; Mr. Wilcox and George returned to their friends, and the ſtranger having no buſineſs on ſhore, remained on board with the Captain.</p>
            <p>Three hours before day, our little community aroſe, and being collected in the common apartment, united in imploring the protection of that God who gave them exiſtence, in their intended voyage. They then began to prepare for embarkation: Eugenio and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia put of their menial habits, and appeared in their
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031902_0182_0FEF3D2A63D946D0"/>
proper characters. At dawn of day, being all ready, they ſet forward towards the water-ſide, where they found the ſhip's boat waiting. They embarked, and the ſhip was immediately got under weigh: The can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs being ſpread to the freſh breeze, they were, in a few hours, wafted out of ſight of the city of Leghorn.</p>
            <p>Soon after they went on board, Mr. Wilcox enquired for the ſtranger, and was informed he was not ſtirring yet. They were all ſitting on the quarter deck, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating each other on the extreme pleaſant weather with which heaven had favoured them in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of their voyage, when the ſtranger appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon deck, and advancing, ſaluted the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the politeſt manner. But how ſhall I paint the aſtoniſhment of Eugenio, when in the perſon of the ſtranger, he perceived his beloved tutor? He ſprang forward, and eagerly embracing him, exclaimed aloud, "Do I behold, once more, my honoured, my much loved maſter, friend and companion, alive and at his liberty." Then falling on his knees, earneſtly intreated him to pardon the folly of his youth, which had nearly involved them both in irretreivable ruin.</p>
            <p>"Riſe my child," ſaid his tutor, with a countenance that diſcovered the goodneſs of his ſoul, "and may heaven pardon every inadvertency of your future life as freely as I do this firſt: As to the inconveniencies I may have met with ſince our ſeperation, they were of no conſideration with me, when compared with the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031902_0183_0FEF3D2BF81AF5F8"/>
anxiety I experienced on your particular account, leſt you ſhould be diſcovered. After all I am happy in the reflection of having your company to England; and of having in my power then to preſent you ſafe to your noble parents."</p>
            <p>"My dear ſir," replied the youth, "your genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, from our firſt interview, has been familiar to me; but in this particular inſtance manifeſts itſelf in ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative degree, that it leaves me a bankrupt, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an obligation too vaſt for me ever to acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of." He then took Terentia by the hand, and preſented her to his tutor, ſaying, "behold, dear ſir the innocent, beloved cauſe of our late troubles; and ſeal my pardon by admitting her to a ſhare of your eſteem." The old gentleman prevented her from kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by catching her in his arms, as ſhe was taking that poſture: He aſſured her of his warmeſt friendſhip, adding, that he had never imputed the leaſt part of his late troubles to her intention. She declared her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in being honoured with the regard of ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a perſon; and promiſed to reſpect him as one of her beſt friends. Breakfaſt interrupted the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſome time. When over, Mr. Savigny, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio's tutor, requeſted of his pupil the particulars of his adventures ſince they parted in St. Marino. Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio accordingly related, in the moſt connect manner, every circumſtance, as it has been communicated to the reader already: Painting, in the moſt ſtriking co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours the favours he had experienced at the hands of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:031902_0184_0FEF31C66AA22F40"/>
his new friends. "Mr. Savigny liſtened attentively to every part of his narrative, not without emotion, and when it was ended, remarked, that the hand of Providence had been viſibly exerted in favour of them both; adding, that nothing ſhort of a complete affiance in the protection of the Supreme Being, could have encouraged him even to hope for an eſcape from the horrid dungeon in which he had been confined. The whole company then requeſted a ſimilar favour of Mr. Savigny.</p>
            <p>"My adventures," ſaid he, "in ſo ſhort a ſpace, cannot be ſuppoſed to have been many or important; and though intereſting to me, will afford neither plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure nor amuſemement to the company preſent: Yet, it would argue the moſt unpardonable ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in me, to refuſe ſo ſlight a gratification to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have ſo generouſly contributed to my preſent happineſs, and that of my pupil, in ſo extenſive a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The day I parted with you," turning to Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio, "You know I ſet out in company with our hoſt, in order, if poſſible, to recover our horſes. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in whoſe poſſeſſion we found them, refuſed to deliver them without a written order from the Governor or ſome of his houſhold: We were much ſurprized at this repulſe, and demanded his reaſons. He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they were delivered to him by one of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's Eunuchs, who charged him to keep them ſafely, feed them well, and that he ſhould be amply rewarded; and moreover delivered him a billet from

the Governor's daughter:" (Here Terentia withdrew with Iſabella,) "which contained peremptory orders not to deliver the horſes to any perſon without the aforementioned order.</p>
            <p>"This anſwer did but involve me in greater perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, for, what buſineſs the Governor of St. Marino could have with our horſes, or how he came by them, was to me, an inexplicable myſtery. I told him the horſes were mine, that I ſuſpected he wiſhed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on me; that the ſtory he had vamped up appeared to me a fiction, and the note a forgery. I told him further, that if he would deliver up the horſes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, I ſhould give myſelf no further trouble; if not, that I would make immediate application to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and have him ſeverly puniſhed for his obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>"Finding that all I ſaid had no effect, I left him, and with my landlord, returned to St. Marino, and ſoon obtained an audience with his Excellency: This was the next day about ten o'clock. After having made my complaint, he promiſed me ample ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inſtantly diſpatched an officer and twelve men with orders to bring the delinquent before him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. He was brought there in a few hours, when the Governor proceeded to interrogate him: He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately produced the billet. The Governor having peruſed it, aſked who delivered him the horſes? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio, replied the priſoner. He then aſked him if

Antonio had aſſigned any reaſon for bringing them to him; he anſwered in the negative.</p>
            <p>"The Eunuch was ſent for, and examined. He trembled exceedingly, his tongue faltered, and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers were ſhort, broken and ambiguous. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor commanded him to the torture—He confeſſed the whole, corroborated what the priſoner had ſaid, and completely unravelled the whole affair. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, having obtained all the information the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Eunuch could give, ordered him to be ſtrangled: My feelings revolted at this piece of cruelty, and I could not refrain ſoliciting pardon for the trembling victim; but in vain: He flew into a violent rage and began to interrogate the landlord and me concerning you, at which we were aſtoniſhed, not doubting but you was ſtill at our lodgings.</p>
            <p>"In vain we aſſured him we had neither ſeen nor heard from you ſince we had ſet out in ſearch of the horſes: He inſiſted our anſwers were all evaſions; that we had all conſpired together to rob him of his daughter, and perhaps his life. One miſcreant, ſaid he, has atoned for his crimes by death, and, if that heretic, meaning you, is not ſpeedily diſcovered, you may reſt aſſured of a ſimilar fate: Drag them away, ſaid he to the keeper of the priſon, confine them cloſely; if you ſuffer them to eſcape, your life ſhall pay the forfeit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:031902_0187_0FEF3D39157EFDA0"/>"Accordingly we were conveyed to the common pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where we were confined in a moſt horrid dungeon, denied the benefit of light or air, and in continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of being ſtrangled or broke on the wheel. The ſecond day of our impriſonment, the landlord was releaſed, in order (as the goaler has ſince informed me) to detect, if poſſible, you or your ſervant, who it was ſuppoſed, would be keeping a look out for me. Dreary as my habitation, and gloomy as my future proſpect was, my ardent prayer to heaven was, that I might be permitted to endure the utmoſt vengeance of the Governor, rather then you ſhould be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>"One night, as I lay, enveloped in the moſt gloomy darkneſs, ruminating on my unhappy ſituation, and praying for your ſafety, I thought I heard ſomebody diſcourſing in a very low key. I raiſed my head and liſtened very attentively.—I ſoon perceived, through a very ſmall crevice, the Goaler and a perſon in a cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical habit (who afterwards proved to be the Friar who married you) in cloſe converſation together: They were forming a plan for abandoning the priſon the enſuing night, and to poſt away to the dominions of Spain with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
            <p>"Hopeleſs as my ſituation was, a ray of hope darted through my ſoul with the idea of converting the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to my own advantage. A variety of reſolutions preſented themſelves to my diſtracted imagination, between that time and the dawning of the day. At al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

events, I reſolved to hint the matter to the Goaler, let him know I had diſcovered their whole plan, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, requeſt a participation in their adventure: I was encouraged to this meaſure by an idea that he would never (if he could help it) return to Italy, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently would be regardleſs of the conſequences which might attend his elopement: He might alſo be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of my diſcovering their rout.</p>
            <p>"I ſlept very little that night, and that little was interrupted by dreams, by no means agreeable, and when I awoke, my heart palpitated violently; my whole frame was much agitated, tho' unconſcious of any crime, either committed or meditated.</p>
            <p>"Morning, if the appearance of the Goaler may be termed ſo; for light never intruded my apartment, at length diſpelled the perturbation of my mind; my keeper appeared more civil than ordinary, which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted as a good omen. He preſented my uſual modicum of food—I received it with a heavy ſigh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming at the ſame time, When Oh Lord! ſhall I be releaſed from this racking ſituation?—Thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, ſaid I, turning to the keeper, are you my friend, in the enjoyment of that liberty, of which I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly deprived!

            <p>"I really commiſerate your diſtreſs, but you know, ſaid he, the nature of my employment will not admit of my contributing to the alleviation of it. Oh y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"His countenance changed, and he was about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but I prevented him, by ſaying, only reflect, my dear friend, on the conſequences reſulting from your elopement: You ſee how rigorouſly I am already trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>"He left me, and I muſt confeſs I wronged him; for I was doubtful of his integrity: He returned, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to his promiſe, and informed me, that he had conſulted with the Holy father; that he was well ſatisfied for me to accompany them to ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the town; but that then I muſt ſhift for myſelf.—I will, continued he, furniſh you with a horſe of my own, which you may diſpoſe of as you think proper, and twenty ducats to bear your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences till you are out of danger. With theſe words he preſented me with this purſe, (ſhowing it) containing the aforeſaid ſum and this dagger: You may, perhaps, find this your beſt friend, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
