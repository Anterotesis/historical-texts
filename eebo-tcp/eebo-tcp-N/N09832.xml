            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Design of this Lottery is, to dispose of a Quantity of new and curious Goods, viz. A most elegant Collection of Pictures, in green and gold Frames, ditto in black and gold Frames, and a new and large Collection of Fancy Pieces, done by the greatest Masters in the World, both in and out of Frames, and a very fine Collection of Drawing Books, both coloured and uncoloured, with a large Collection of the newest Maps, in and out of Setts, as also in Books in the very best and finest Colours; Albion Birds, in the most beautiful Colours; a large Variety of Copper Plate Writings, by the ablest Penmen in England; also the Royal Amusement, which is now extremely fashionable, and is universally played instead of Back-Gammon, &amp;c. together with many other entertaining Curiosities, lately imported from London and elsewhere; Guns of the neatest Kind, single and double barrelled Pistols: and also a fine Assortment of Jewellery, among which are Diamonds, Garnets, Gold and Fancy Rings, with a Quantity of other Jewellery too tedious to mention, besides a great many other Goods, both useful and entertaining.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Adventurers in this Lottery, may depend that every Article will be rated at the lowest Prices the Proprietor sells them out of his Shop.</p>
            <p>The Lots will be made out, nicely assorted, part Jewellery, Pictures, and other Curiosities, by four respectable Gentlemen, who will faithfully superintend the Drawing of this Lottery, and see that Justice is done to each Adventurer.</p>
            <p>The Lots, composed of the before mentioned Goods, &amp;c. are to be made out to the full Amount of the Prizes, before the Lottery is drawn, except a small Deduction of Five per Cent. to defray the Charges.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, if fortunate, may become possessed of a large and neat Assortment of Jewellery, Pictures, &amp;c. at the small Expence of Ten Shillings, to the Amount of One Hundred and Twenty Pounds, or other good Prizes, as per Scheme, which is perhaps better calculated for the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, than any yet offered to the Public.</p>
            <p>The Prizes are to be published immediately after Drawing, and paid as soon as published.</p>
            <p>There is a great Number of Tickets already engaged, which gives the Proprietor Reason to believe the Drawing will soon commence. He hopes likewise, that those who incline to become Adventurers, will be speedy in applying for Tickets.</p>
            <p>The Public may be informed where Tickets are to be had, by applying to the Bar-keeper of the London Coffee-House, and to Mr NICHOLAS BROOKS, near the Coffee-House, in Market-street, Mr. ALEXANDER POWER, near South-street, near the Wharf, Mr. JAMES SUTTER, near the Draw-bridge, opposite to Mr. John Mease, Merchant, Mr. EDWARD BATCHELOR, Merchant, in Second-street, Mr. THOMAS BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOW, Merchant, Mr. JOHN PATTON, Merchant, in Water-street, Messrs. BUDDEN and STRAKER, at their Store in Front-street, and Mr. WILLIAM DIBLEY, Western Post.</p>
