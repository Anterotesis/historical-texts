            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Dear and Well Beloved Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere is, and hath been a long time, a great Travail and Exercise upon me for the Prosperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Tranquility of New and Heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> that she may be the Praise of the whole Earth, and that her spiritual Government may spread over Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and People, where the Whorish Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath sate, which hath led People from God into <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is Confusion and Disorder. Oh, what shall I say! my Soul and Spirit is grieved and pained within me, when I take a view of the Numberless Number of hurtful things that this Spirit hath led People into; But that which on the other hand is comfort unto me, is, That the Lord our God, in his unutterable Loving Kindness, hath made bear his holy Arm, and caused his glorious Light to shine in the hearts of many Thousands, which hath discovered <hi>Mystery Babylon,</hi> (the Mother of Harlots and all Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) in a great measure, praises be to his great Name for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000586_0002_0FA95B500D7C4D10"/>
               <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> That which ought to be all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, to whom the Lord hath so largely appeared, as to make us a kind of first Fruits to himself in this latter Age, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to see that we come clear out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that we be not Partakers with her in any of her hurtful things which have been brought in in the Midnight of Darkness and Popery: The Cry is now, which <hi>John</hi> heard many Years ago, <hi>Come out of her my People, partake not of her sins, lest ye also partake of her Plagues, for strong is the Lord that judgeth her.</hi> Now <hi>dear Friends,</hi> her Worship in all her finest Dresses and Names, (under what Profession soever) you that are come (almost, in the least measure) to believe in the blessed Light, I doubt not but you see over it, and cannot joyn with them in it; yet bear with me a little, there may be some things that some may stick in, or not so clearly see over, as they should or might do if they well minded the Light. We read of some of old that had much good in them yet was short in some things; some in all Ages saw before others in some things for a time; but those which were truly faithful to what they did know, not regarding the friendship of the World, nor yet their frowns in that case, had their understandings more and more opened, and were made instrumental to convince and to strengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm others. So, all <hi>dear Friends,</hi> dwell in the Light that you may clearly see every little thing that is to be denyed, and the tendency of every Spirit, Practice or Custom that may be hurtful either in our day, or to succeeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Christ told his Disciples, <hi>that they were as a City set upon a Hill which could not be hid, and the Salt of the Earth:</hi> The Salt is to season that which otherwise would be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury. Oh! the Lord help all his People well and truly to consider this weighty thing, in all our commerce with all sorts of People, that Gods pure witness may be reached,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000586_0003_0FA95B51852611C8"/>
and every appearance of Evil born Testimony against; for the Lord is about to make a clear seperation, he will not bear much longer, as he hath done in the time of Ignorance. Therefore let us all see that we do not uphold or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any vain Custom or Practice that hath been brought up in the dark Night of Apostacy, or that may be of an evil tendency, but rather let us dwell alone in those things: What if we be not reckoned among the Nations, as it was prophesied of old? and the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> said (speaking of the Gospel times) <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out, touch no unclean thing, be ye Clean, that bear the Vessels of the Lord, Isa.</hi> 52. And the Apostle said, <hi>Be ye seperated, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean Thing, and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord God Almighty:</hi> These are precious Promises: What if we be slighted by the World, because we cannot joyn with them in any excess of Riot or evil Custom? The Apostle said, <hi>The Friendship of this World is Enmity with God</hi>; and hath not God put Enmity between the two Seeds? how then can they have affinity together? (though there may be commerce is things civil) Let this be well minded in all our Marriages; the Apostle said, Be <hi>not unequally yoked together with Vnbelievers, for what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath Righteousness with Vnrighteousness? and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion hath Light with Darkness?</hi> or what Concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? <hi>Joshua</hi> said to <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>If ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the Remnant of these Nations, and shall make Marriages with them, they shall be Snares and Traps unto you, and Scourges in your sides, and Thorns in your Eyes, until you perish from off the good Land:</hi> And did not this come to pass? and had not we need to have great care in this matter? Truly I see rather more need here than we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000586_0004_0FA95B518A1A9410"/>
had in our Native Land; for many come to our Meetings, and will get a Friend by the hand, that know little of Truth in their hearts. Therefore it concerns our Monthly Meetings to inspect well into this matter, that we may not become a mixt People, lest the Lord be angry and spue us out; but I hope better of most. <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded his Servant, <hi>That he should not take a Wife for his Son</hi> Isaac <hi>of the Daughters of the</hi> Canaanites, <hi>but of his Kindred,</hi> and the like charge <hi>Isaac</hi> gave to <hi>Jacob</hi>; but afterward Marriages with outward Kindred was forbidden, and they were to marry with them of the same Society, or with such as kept the Ordinances of God; and doth not our Society stand in that which is heavenly and spiritual, which may be call'd a spiritual Kindred, with whom we may in the fear of God joyn in Marriage. <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, where the Bed is undefiled, but Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> And if any unclean or hasty Marriage happen, when a man or woman doth not stay a convenient time after the decease of the Husband or Wife, Friends should show their dislike, and not countenance them at all, that we may be Witnesses for our God against all Unrighteousness both of Flesh and Spirit: <hi>Know ye not that the Saints shall judge the World,</hi> but if we joyn with any uncomly Action, they will judge us. And take heed of too much observing that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of making great Feasts at Weddings, or of joyning with the World therein, but let all wait to be guided in Gods Wisdom, that so all things may be done to his honour; for Marriage is a weighty thing, and ought to be solemnly performed in the fear of God, and not in Revelling and Lightness, as many of the World have done, using those immodest Actions of taking the Brides Garters and Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings, and shewing of folly in getting them to bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh! let not these things, or any other unseemly Action or Word
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000586_0005_0FA95B5246A412C0"/>
be once mentioned amongst any that profess the Truth of God; and let all Friends take heed of making, or ioyning with them that do make appointed Feasts some small time after a Child is born; for I, with many of the Lords People have seen much evil therein, and been constrained to bear our Testimony against it; yet let all beware of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in that and all other things, providing things honest in the sight of all men. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Whatsoever things are true, just, honest, pure, lovely, and of good report; if there be any Virtue, think on these things. Friends,</hi> these things should be minded in our Marriages, Births and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, that all may be in a comly sollid order, out of all Extreams, and so we shall overcome evil with good, and leave a good pattern to our Posterity.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more, which for the sake of our Youth, and some others, I cannot well omit, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a hint of it, and that is about observing the time call'd <hi>Christmass,</hi> which the false Christians set up, as they did many other days, call'd, <hi>Saints dayes,</hi> which the Lord hath laid a holy constraint upon his People to bear their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against, tho' some have not been so clear as they should have been therein. Now Friends, this is that which God by his Light and Spirit hath opened in my Heart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years ago, That when they had in a great measure lost the Saints Life and Christs Day within them, then in the darkness they set up Saints Days and Christ's Day (as they call it) without them, about which time there is more Wickedness acted than at other times: I could say much about that, and many other things which have been set up in the Night of Darkness; but these things were of weight upon me, and this is the sence which God hath given me, That none who profess the Truth should make any shew of observing these Times, either in Apparel or Provision,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000586_0006_0FA95B53B4838310"/>
or going a visiting, or neglecting their usual Business because its that time. But some may obiect, and say, <hi>We have known some Friends appoint Meetings on that day, and about that time.</hi> I <hi>Answ.</hi> True, but for what end? has it been to observe the Time? No such matter, but to catch People when they were idle, and to labour to bring them from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of days without in Vanity, &amp; to bring them to the Day of Christ within, that they might walk in the Light of it, and be saved from their sins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> These things are written in the true Love of God, and without Reflection upon any particular, but for easing my self of what for some time hath lain upon me. It was my design at first writing that it should be read in Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, but that I shall leave to the judgment of Friends to do as they see meet: I hope it will not be hurtful in any Meetings.</p>

            <p>WHen first the Lord Almighty cast his Eye of Pity towards us, we were a poor People, scattered upon the barren Mountains and partched Heaths, where some of us wandered from Mountain to Hill, from one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to another, seeking the living amongst the dead, but found him not there, for he was risen; and our Rest that we had, some in one Profession, and some in another, was polluted, and we were troubled, being as Sheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Shepherd, and then we cryed unto the Lord, and sought secret places to pour out our souls before him, as well as we could, crying for the holy guiding of his pure Spirit; for we were at a loss, and knew no bottom to stand upon. Then in this day of Distress, (which was more than my Tongue can declare) did the Lord in his unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loving-kindness open his way unto us, and shewed us that we should wait in his Light and Spirit within us, <hi>for that which was to be known of God, was manifest within</hi>; and then we durst not give our own meanings to the Scriptures or other Writings of holy men, but came to know a time of t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

And as we continued waiting upon him in his Light and Spirit, our Understandings were more and more opened, and our number encreased; The Net was cast into the Sea, and gathered of every kind; for the Lord made Fishers of men; and then he shewed us that there was need of Discipline and Order amongst us touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marriage, and many other things, and that if any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, they might be dealt with, as Christ taught in the 18th chap. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>warn them that are unruly,</hi> and further, <hi>We command you, Brethren, with-draw your selves from every Brother that walketh Disorderly</hi>; yet it was the mind of Christ, and the Apostle, that if a man was overtaken with a fault, those that were spiritual should labour to restore him in the Spirit of Meekness; and that those that oppose themselves should be instructed, that if God peradventure would give them Repentance, to the acknowledging the Truth. And as we continued waiting upon the Lord, he led us by degrees, according to our measures, into this way and method; and we have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to instruct, advise and counsel one another; and though there be diversities of Gifts and Operations, yet its by the

same Spirit that worketh all in all, to the edifying of the Body, of which Christ is the Head, to the end there be no Schism, but true Unity and Harmony amongst the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for indeed one Member cannot suffer alone, it is the nature of the Body, if any Member be out of joynt, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to bring it in again; but if it cannot be gotten in, but becomes putrified, and in danger of hurting or spoiling the whole Body, the skilful Chyrurgeon will advise to cut it off, rather than the whole Body should perish, tho' this is not delightful to the true Body, but sorrow and pain to lose a Member, and its seldom done untill all the Friends of the Monethly or Quarterly Meeting whereto such an Offender belongs, be clear of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And let not any think it to be a light thing to be so stubborn and rebellious, as to cause the Body or Church of Christ to disown them, though the <hi>Papists</hi> have assumed to themselves, for filthy Lucres sake, that Power which God never gave them, yet there is much in Christs words, (who never spoke unadvisedly) where he saith speaking of O<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Member prospered, being seperated from the living Body whereunto it did belong.</p>
            <p>And as touching Marriage, it hath been Friends advice, and a necessity hath been seen for it, that all who profess the same Truth with us, should publish their Intentions of it, according to the Law of these Provinces; yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the sence and understanding that God by his Spirit hath given me, with many Brethren, all that profess the same Truth with us, ought first to publish it to Friends, as abovesaid, and have their advice and unity in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. And all that frequent our Monthly and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meetings, should have in some measure the sence &amp; concern of Truth upon them, and not come as evil Spies to wrest Friends words, and carry Tales about; if any do so, they are more like Enemies than Friends in that matter.</p>
            <p>And all <hi>dear Friends,</hi> who have the Concerns of Truth and the care of the Church upon you, wait to feel the living Power of God in all your Gatherings, and the mind of the Spirit, that all things may be done in the Wisdom of God, which is from above, which is pure and peaceable, and easie to be entreated to every good thing. And all, both Male and Female, wait to know your several Services in the Church of Christ; for the Body is not one Member, but many, and the Eye cannot say to the Hand, I have no need of thee, nor the Head to the Feet, I have no need of thee; but every Member hath its proper Service; Though the Man is not without the Woman, nor the Woman without the Man in the Lord, yet they have their particular Service in the outward Family, so in the spiritual Family or Church of Christ: Let them that Read Understand; does not the good Woman take care that nothing be lacking in the Family? and are not the

good Men one with them in it? Oh dearly Beloved Friends! my Soul loves you, and I desire that all may feel the Unity of the Spirit, which is the Bond of true and lasting Peace. The Devil is labouring to make Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions all the World over, and can we expect to be free from his Temptations? Therefore we had need Watch and Pray that we may be delivered from Evil, that we all may be as lively Stones built up, a Spiritual House to offer Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God, by Jesus Christ, that we may shew forth the Praise of him who hath called us out of Darkness into his marvelous Light. Which is the earnest Desire and fervent Prayer of your Friend (who at the close of this Epistle is filled with the Love of God to all his Flock.)</p>
