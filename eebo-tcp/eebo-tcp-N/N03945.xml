            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſhort Word of Advice to all Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A Word of Advice to my own Heart and thine; thou profeſſeth Baptiſm, Church-fellowſhip; thou doſt well, they are glorious Ordinances: But if thou haſt not the Blood of Chriſt at the Root of thy Profeſſion, it will wither and prove but painted Pegeantry to go to Hell in.</p>
            <p>If thou retain Guilt, Self-righteouſneſs under it, thoſe Vipers will eat out all the Vitals of it at length. Try and examine with greateſt ſtrictneſs every day, what bottom thy Profeſſion and Hope of Glory is build upon, whether it was laid by the Hand of Chriſt; if not, it will never be able to endure the ſtorm that muſt come againſt it. Satan will throw it all down, &amp; great ſhall be the Fall thereof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.27.</p>
            <p>Glorious Profeſſor, thou ſhalt be winnowed: Every Vein of thy Profeſſion will be tried to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Terrible to have it all come tumbling down, and to find nothing but it to bottom upon.</p>
            <p>Soaring Profeſſor, ſee to thy waxen Wings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which will melt with the heat of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. What a Miſery to trade much and break at length, and have no Stock, no Foundation laid for Eternity, in thy Soul?</p>
            <p>Gifted Profeſſor, look there be not a Worm at the Root that will ſpoil all thy fine Goard, &amp; make it die about thee in a day of ſcorchings. Look over thy ſoul daily, and aſk, where is the Blood of Chriſt to be ſeen upon my ſoul? What righteouſneſs is it
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004864_0003_100E06A0238BDA80"/>
that I ſtand upon to be ſaved by? Have I got off all my ſelf-righteouſneſs? Many eminent Profeſſors have come at length to cry out, in the ſights of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of all their duties, Undone, undone to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>The greateſt ſins may be hid under the greateſt duties, and the greateſt terrors: ſee the Wound that ſin hath made in thy ſoul, be perfectly cured by the Blood of Chriſt, not ſkinned over with duties, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, enlargements, &amp;c. Apply what thou wilt beſides the Blood of Chriſt it will poiſon the ſore. Thou wilt find that ſin was never mortified truly; that thou haſt not ſeen Chriſt bearing it for thee upon the croſs: nothing can kill it but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdings of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Nature can afford no balſam fit for ſoul-cure. Healing from duty, and not from Chriſt, is the moſt deſperate diſeaſe. Poor ragged nature, with all its higheſt improvements, can never ſpin a garment fine enough (without ſpot) large enough (without patches) to cover the ſoul's nakedneſs. Nothing can fit the ſoul for that uſe but Chriſt's perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Whatever is of nature's ſpinning muſt be all unravelled before the righteouſneſs of Chriſt can be put on. Whatſoever is of nature's putting on, Satan will come and plunder every rag away and leave the ſoul naked and open to the Wrath of God. All that nature can do will never make up the leaſt dram of grace that can mortify ſin, or look Chriſt in the face one day.</p>
            <p>Thou art a profeſſor, art baptized, goes on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp; praying, and receiving, yet miſerable mayſt thou be. Look about thee, didſt thou ever yet ſee Chriſt to this day in diſtinction from all other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004864_0003_100E06A0238BDA80"/>
&amp; righteouſneſs in the World, &amp; all of them falling before his Majeſty and Grace, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.17.</p>
            <p>If thou haſt ſeen Chriſt truly, thou haſt ſeen pure grace, pure righteouſneſs in him, every way infinite, far exceeding all ſin and miſery. If thou haſt ſeen Chriſt thou canſt trample upon all the righteouſneſs of men &amp; angels, ſo as to bring thee into acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. If thou haſt ſeen Chriſt, thou wouldſt not do a duty without him for ten thouſand Worlds, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. If ever thou didſt ſee Chriſt, thou didſt ſee him a Rock higher than ſelf-righteouſneſs, ſatan, ſin, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 61.2. &amp; that Rock doth follow thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. And there will be continual drops of honey and grace out of that Rock to ſatisfy thee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 81.16. Examine if ever thou beheld Chriſt as the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father, full of grace &amp; truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, 16, 17. Be ſure thou art come to Chriſt, that thou ſtand upon the Rock of Ages, haſt anſwered his call to thy ſoul, haſt cloſed with him for Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Men talk bravely of believing (whilſt whole and ſound) few know it. Chriſt is the myſtery of the ſcripture; grace the myſtery of Chriſt. Believing is the moſt wonderful thing in the world. Put any thing of thine own to it, &amp; thou ſpoileſt it; Chriſt will not ſo much as look at it for believing. When thou believeſt, and comes to Chriſt, thou muſt leave behind thee thy own righteouſneſs, bring nothing but thy ſin. O that is hard, leave behind all thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſanctifications, duties, humblings, &amp;c. &amp; bring nothing but thy wants and miſeries, elſe Chriſt is not for thee, nor thou for Chriſt. Chriſt will be a pure Redeemer &amp; Mediator, and thou muſt be a pure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or Chriſt &amp; thou wilt never agree: It's the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004864_0004_100E06A253D37850"/>
thing in the world to take Chriſt alone for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; that is, to acknowlege him Chriſt: Join a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to him of thy own &amp; thou Un-chriſt's him.</p>
            <p>Whatever comes in when thou goeſt to God for acceptation, (beſides Chriſt) call it Antichriſt, bid it be gone; make only Chriſt's righteouſneſs trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; all beſides that is <hi>Babylon,</hi> which muſt fall, if Chriſt ſtand, and thou ſhalt rejoice in the fall thereof, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 1.10—12. Chriſt alone did tread the wine-preſs, and there was none with him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 63.3. If thou join to any thing but Chriſt, Chriſt will trample upon it in fury and anger, &amp; ſtain his raiment with the blood thereof. Thou think'ſt it eaſy to believe; was ever thy faith tried with an hour of Temptations, and a thorow ſight of ſin? was it ever put to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ſatan, and the wrath of God lying upon the Conſcience: When thou waſt in the mouth of hell and the grave, then did God ſhew thee Chriſt a ranſom, a righteouſneſs, &amp;c. Then couldſt thou ſay, O I ſee grace enough in Chriſt; thou may'ſt ſay that which is the biggeſt word in the world: Thou believeſt. Untried faith is uncertain faith.</p>
            <p>To believing there muſt be a clear conviction of ſin, and of the merits of the blood of Chriſt, and of Chriſt's willingneſs to ſave upon this conſideration meerly, that thou art a ſinner; things all harder than to make a world. All the power in nature cannot get up ſo high in a ſtorm of ſin and guilt as really to believe there is any grace, any willingneſs in Chriſt to ſave. When ſatan chargeth ſin upon the conſcience, then the ſoul to charge it upon Chriſt, that is goſpel-like, that is to make him Chriſt, he ſerves for that uſe. To accept Chriſt's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004864_0004_100E06A253D37850"/>
righteouſneſs alone, his blood alone for ſalvation. That is the ſum of the goſpel, when the ſoul in all duties can ſay, nothing but Chriſt, Chriſt alone for righteouſneſs, juſtification, ſanctification, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Not humblings, not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not graces, &amp;c. That ſoul hath got above the reach of the billows.</p>
            <p>For all temptations, ſatan's advantages, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings are laid in ſelf-righteouſneſs, &amp; ſelf-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, God purſueth theſe, by ſetting ſatan upon thee, as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Jacob</hi> for his Images which <hi>Rachel</hi> hid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. Theſe muſt be torn from thee, be as willing as thou wilt, theſe hinder Chriſt from coming in, and till Chriſt come in, guilt will not go out, and where guilt is, there is hardneſs of heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much guilt argues little, if any thing of Chriſt's blood, that will tend to hardening. Make Chriſt thy Peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. not thy duties, thy tears, &amp;c. Chriſt thy righteouſneſs, not thy graces, &amp;c. Thou mayſt deſtroy Chriſt by duties, as well as by ſins. Look at Chriſt, and do as much as thou wilt. Stand with all thy weight upon Chriſt's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; take heed of having one foot on thy own righteouſneſs, another on Chriſt's. 'Till Chriſt come and ſit on high upon a throne of grace, in the conſcience, there is nothing but guilt, terrors, ſecret ſuſpicions, the ſoul hanging between hope and fear, which is an un-goſpel like ſtate.</p>
            <p>He that fears to ſee ſin's utmoſt vileneſs, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hell of his own heart, he ſuſpects the merits of Chriſt. Be thou never ſo great a ſinner, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. try Chriſt to make him thy advocate, and thou ſhalt find him Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. In all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004864_0005_100E06A3D8750838"/>
fears, ſtorms of conſcience, look at Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually. Do not argue it with ſatan, (he deſires no better) bid him go to Chriſt, and he will anſwer him, it is his office as he is our advocate, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. His office to anſwer the law as our ſurety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. His office to anſwer juſtice, as our mediator, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. and he is ſworn to that office, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.20. Put Chriſt upon it; if thou wilt do any thing thy ſelf, as to ſatisfaction for ſin, thou renounceth Chriſt the righteous, who was made ſin for thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>Satan may alledge and corrupt ſcripture, but he cannot anſwer ſcripture. It's Chriſt's word of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty authority, Chriſt foyled ſatan with it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. In all the ſcripture there is not an ill word againſt a poor ſinner ſtript of ſelf-righteouſneſs; nay, it plentifully points out this man to be the ſubject of the grace of the goſpel, and none elſe. Believe but Chriſt's wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, and that will make thee willing. If thou findeſt thou canſt not believe, remember it's Chriſt's work to make thee believe; put him upon it, he works to will and to do of his good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Mourn for thy unbelief, which is a ſetting up guilt in the conſcience above Chriſt, and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing the merits of Chriſt, accounting his blood an unholy, a common, and unſatisfying thing.</p>
            <p>Thou complaineſt much of thy ſelf; doth thy ſin make thee look more at Chriſt, leſs at ſelf? That's right, elſe complaining is but hypocriſy. To be looking at duties, graces, enlargements, when thou ſhouldſt be looking at Chriſt; that's pitiful: Looking at them will but make thee proud, looking at Chriſt's grace will make thee humble. By grace you are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.2. thoſe <hi>ſurges</hi> may not be to break thee, but to heave thee off thy ſelf on the Rock Chriſt</p>
            <p>Thou mayſt be bro't low, even to the brink of hell, ready to tumble in; thou can'ſt not he bro't lower than to the belly of hell, many ſaints have been there, even dowced in hell, yet there may'ſt thou cry, there may'ſt thou look toward the holy temple, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4. Into that temple none might enter but purified ones, and with an offering too, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.26. But now Chriſt is our temple &amp; ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, altar, high-prieſt, to whom none muſt come but ſinners, and that without any offering, but his own blood once offered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. Remember all the patterns of grace that are in heaven. Thou thinkeſt, O what a monument of grace wouldſt thou be: there are many thouſands as rich monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as thou be. The greateſt ſinner did never oppoſe the grace of Chriſt, do not deſpair: Hope ſtill, when the cloud's at blackeſt, even then look towards Chriſt, the ſtanding pillar or the Father's love and grace, ſet up in heaven, for all ſinners to gaze upon continually. Whatſoever ſatan or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſays, do not conclude againſt thy ſelf. Chriſt ſhall have the laſt word, he is the judge of quick and dead, and muſt pronounce the final ſentence, his blood ſpeaks reconciliation. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. purchaſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. purging, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>v.</hi> 20. liberty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. highneſs to God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. Not a drop of this blood ſhall be loſt. Stand and hearken what God will ſay; for he will ſpeak peace to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they return no more to folly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004864_0006_100E06A5A881E368"/>
He ſpeaks grace, mercy and peace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. That's the language of the Father and of Chriſt. Wait for Chriſt's appearing, as the morning-ſtar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.19. He ſhall come as certainly as the morning, as refreſhingly as the rain, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3.</p>
            <p>The ſun may as well be hindered from riſing as Chriſt the ſun of righteouſneſs, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. Look not a moment off Chriſt. Look not upon ſin; but look upon Chriſt firſt: When thou mourneſt for ſin, if thou doſt not ſee Chriſt, away with it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. In every duty, look at Chriſt before duty, to pardon. In duty, to aſſiſt. After duty, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; without this, it is but carnal careleſs duty. Do not legalize the Goſpel, as if part did remain to thee to do, and ſuffer, and Chriſt were but an half Mediator; and thou muſt bear part of thy own ſin; make part ſatisfaction. Let ſin break thy heart, but not hope in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Look more at juſtification than ſanctification. In the higheſt commands conſider Chriſt, not as an exacter to require, but a debter, an undertaker, to work. If thou haſt looked at workings, duties, qualifications, and ſuch like, more than at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, it will coſt thee dear; no wonder thou goeſt complaining. Graces may be evidences, the merits of Chriſt (only without them) muſt be the foundation of thy hope to bottom on. Chriſt only can be the hope of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27.</p>
            <p>When we come to God, we muſt bring nothing but Chriſt with us. Any ingredients of our own qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, will poiſon and corrupt faith; he that builds upon duties, graces, and the like, knows not the merits of Chriſt. This makes believing ſo hard,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004864_0006_100E06A5A881E368"/>
ſo far above nature; if thou believeſt thou muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce (as dung and droſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7.8.) thy Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, thy obedience, thy baptiſm, thy ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thy duties, thy graces, thy tears, meltings, thy humblings, and nothing but Chriſt muſt be held up: Every day thy workings, thy ſelf-ſufficiency, muſt be deſtroyed. Thou muſt take all out of God's hand, Chriſt he is the gift of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. Faith the gift of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. Pardon a free gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. Ah how nature ſtorms, frets, rageth at this, that all is of gift and it can purchaſe nothing with its actings and tears, and duties, that all its workings are excluded, and of no value in heaven.</p>
            <p>If nature had been to contrive the way of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it would rather have put it into the hands of ſaints or angels to ſell it, than of Chriſt (who gives freely) whom therefore it ſuſpects; it would have ſet up a way to purchaſe by doing; therefore it obminates the merits of Chriſt as the moſt deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thing to it, would do any thing to be ſaved, rather than go to Chriſt, or cloſe with Chriſt. Chriſt will have nothing, the ſoul will force ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his own upon Chriſt. Here is the great controverſy. Conſider, didſt thou ever ſee the merits of Chriſt, and the infinite ſatisfaction made by his death? did thou ſee this in a time when the burthen of ſin, and the wrath of God lay heavy upon thy conſcience. That is grace. The greatneſs of Chriſt's merits is not known, but to a poor ſoul at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt loſs. Slight convictions, will but have ſlight low prizings of Chriſt's blood and merits. Deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner; thou art looking on thy right hand, and thy left, ſaying, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good</hi>? Thou
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004864_0007_100E06A789D50F30"/>
are tumbling over all thy duties and profeſſions, to patch up a righteouſneſs to ſave thee. Miſerable comforters are all thoſe to thee. Look at Chriſt now. Look to him, &amp; be ſaved, all the ends of the earth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.22. There is none elſe. He is a Saviour, and there is none beſides him, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. look any where elſe, Chriſt is lifted up on high (as the braſen ſerpent in the wilderneſs) that the ends of the earth, ſinners at the greateſt diſtance, may ſee him, and look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. The leaſt ſight of him will be ſaving, the leaſt touch healing to thee, and God intends thou ſhouldſt look on him for he hath ſet him upon a high throne of glory, in the open view of all poor ſinners. Thou haſt infinite reaſon to look on him, no reaſon at all to look off him. For he is meek and lowly of heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. He will do that himſelf which he requires of his creature, bear with infirmities, <hi>Ro.</hi> 15.1. not pleaſing himſelf, not ſtanding upon points of low <hi>ver.</hi> 2. he will reſtore with the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. And bare thy burdens, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. He will forgive, not only until ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſeven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.21, 22. It put the faith of the appoſtles to it, to believe this, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.4.5. Becauſe we are hard to forgive, we think Chriſt is hard. We ſee ſin great, we think Chriſt doth ſo too, and meaſure infinite love with our line, infinite merits with our ſins, which is the greateſt pride and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 103.11, 12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.15. Hear what he ſaith, I have found a ranſom, <hi>Job</hi> 33.24. In him I am well pleaſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. God will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; nothing elſe will do thee good, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy conſcience, but Chriſt who ſatisfied the Father, God doth all upon the account of Chriſt, thy deſerts
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004864_0007_100E06A789D50F30"/>
are hell, wrath, rejections. Chriſt's deſerts, are life, pardon, &amp; acceptation. He will not only ſhew thee the one, but he will give thee the other. It's Chriſt's own glory and happineſs to pardon. Conſider, whilſt Chriſt was upon earth, he was more among publicans and ſinners, than ſcribes and phariſees, his profeſſed adverſaries; for they were righteous ones. It is not ſo as thou imaginſt, that his ſtate in glory, makes him neglectful, ſcornful to poor ſinners; no he hath the ſame heart now in heaven, he is God, and changeth not; He <hi>is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> John 1.29. He hath gone thro' all thy temptations, dejections, ſorrows, deſertions, rejections, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.3, to 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 15.14, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. And hath drunk the bittereſt of the cup, and left thee the ſweet; the condemnation is out, Chriſt drunk up all the Father's wrath at one draught, &amp; nothing but ſalvation is left for thee; thou ſayeſt, thou canſt not believe, thou canſt not repent, fitter to repent, fitter for Chriſt if thou haſt nothing but ſin and miſery, go to Chriſt with all thy impenitency, and unbelief, to get faith &amp; repentance from him; that is glorious. Tell Chriſt, <hi>Lord, I have brought no righteouſneſs, no grace to be accepted in, juſtified by; I am come for thine, and muſt have it.</hi> We would be bringing to Chriſt, and that muſt not be; not a penny of nature's higheſt improvement will paſs in heaven. Grace will not ſtand with works <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. That is a terrible point to nature; which cannot think of being ſtript of all, not having a rag of duty, or righteouſneſs left to look at. Self-righteouſneſs, ſelf-ſufficiency, are the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004864_0008_100E06A95AB6BEC0"/>
of nature, which ſhe preſerves as her life; that makes Chriſt ſuch an ugly thing to nature, nature cannot deſire him; he is juſt directly oppoſite to all nature's glorious intereſts. Let nature but make a goſpel, and it would make it contrary to Chriſt. It would be to the juſt, the innocent, the holy, the righteous, &amp;c. Chriſt hath made a goſpel for thee, that is, to needy ſinners, the ungodly, the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the unjuſt, the accurſed. Nature cannot endure to think the goſpel is only for ſinners, it will rather chuſe to deſpair, than to go to Chriſt upon ſuch terms. When nature is but put to it by guilt or wrath, it will to its old haunts of ſelf-righteouſneſs ſelf-goodneſs, &amp;c. And infinite power muſt caſt down thoſe ſtrong holds. None but the ſelf-juſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſtands excluded out of the goſpel: Chriſt will look at the moſt abominable ſinner, before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to ſuch an one Chriſt cannot be made juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: He is no ſinner. To ſay in complement, I am a ſinner, is eaſy; but to pray with the publican indeed, Lord be merciful to me a ſinner, is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt prayer in the world. It is eaſy to ſay, I believe in Chriſt; but to ſee Chriſt full of grace and truth, of whoſe fulneſs thou mayeſt receive grace for grace. That is ſaving. It's eaſy to profeſs Chriſt with the mouth; but to confeſs him with the heart, as <hi>Peter (to be the Chriſt, the Son of the living God, the alone Mediator</hi>) that's above fleſh and blood. Many call Chriſt Saviour, few know him ſo. To ſee grace and ſalvation in Chriſt, is the greateſt ſight in the world; none can do that, but at the ſame time they ſhall ſee that grace to be theirs. Sights will cauſe applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I may be aſhamed to think, that in the midſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004864_0008_100E06A95AB6BEC0"/>
of ſo much profeſſion, yet I have known little of the blood of Chriſt, which is the main thing of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. A Chriſtleſs, formal profeſſion will be the blackeſt ſight next to hell that can be. Thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have many good things, and yet one thing be wanting, that may make thee go away ſorrowful from Chriſt. Thou haſt never ſold all thou haſt, never parted with all thine own righteouſneſs, &amp;c. Thou mayeſt be high in duty, yet a perfect enemy and advarſary to Chriſt in every prayer, in every ordinance. Labour after ſanctification to thy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, but make not a Chriſt of it to ſave thee; if ſo, it muſt come down one way or other. Chriſt's infinite ſatisfaction not thy ſanctification, muſt be thy juſtification before God. When the Lord ſhall appear terrible out of his holy places, fre ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all that as hay and ſtubble.</p>
            <p>This will be ſound religion only, to bottom all upon the everlaſting mountains of God's love and grace in Chriſt, to live continually in the ſight of Chriſt's infinite righteouſneſs and merits (they are ſanctifying, without them the heart is carnal) and in thoſe ſights to ſee the full vileneſs, yet littleneſs of ſin, and to ſee all pardoned; in thoſe ſights, to pray, hear, be baptized, &amp;c. Seeing thy polluted ſelf, and all thy weak performances continually; in thoſe ſights to trample upon all thy ſelf-glories, righteouſneſſes, privileges as abominable, and be found continually in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt only, rejoycing in the ruins of all thy own righteouſneſs, the ſpoiling of all thy own excellencies, that Chriſt alone, as mediator, may be exalted in his throne, mourning over all thy duties (how glorious ſoever) that thou haſt not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004864_0009_100E06AC91CAA060"/>
performed in the ſight and ſenſe of Chriſt's love. Without the blood of Chriſt on the Conſciences all are dead ſervices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</p>
            <p>That opinion of Free-will ſo cry'd up will be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted, as it is by the ſcripture in thy heart who hath had any ſpiritual dealings with Chriſt, as to the application of his merits, and ſubjection to his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Chriſt is every way too magnificent a perſon for poor nature to cloſe withal or apprehend. Chriſt is ſo infinitely holy, nature durſt never look at him; ſo infinitely good, nature can never believe him to be ſuch, when it lies under full ſights of ſin. Chriſt is too high and glorious for nature ſo much as to touch. There muſt be a divine love firſt put into the ſoul to make it lay hold on him, he lays ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond the ſight or reach of nature.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt that natural free-will can apprehend, is but a natural Chriſt of man's own making, not the Father's Chriſt, not Jeſus the Son of the living God, to whom none can come without the Father's drawing, <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 46. Finally, Search the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures daily, as mines of Gold, wherein the heart of Chriſt is laid. Watch againſt conſtitution ſins, ſee them in their vileneſs, and they will never break out into act. Keep always an humble, empty, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken frame of heart; ſenſible of any ſpiritual miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, obſervant of all inward workings, fit for the higheſt communications. Keep not guilt in the conſcience, but apply the blood of Chriſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. God chargeth ſin and guilt upon thee to make thee look to Chriſt the braſen ſerpent.</p>
            <p>Judge not Chriſt's love by evidences, but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Bleſs God for ſhaking off falſe foundations,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004864_0009_100E06AC91CAA060"/>
for any way whereby he keeps the ſoul awakened, and looking after Chriſt: better ſickneſs, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than ſecurity and ſlightneſs.</p>
            <p>A ſlighty ſpirit will turn a prophane ſpirit, and will ſin and pray too. Slightineſs is the bane of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if it be not rooted out of the heart, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſerious dealings with and beholding of Chriſt in duties, it will grow more ſtrong and more deadly, by being under Church Ordinances. Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure not thy graces by others attainments, but by Scripture-trials. Be ſerious, exact in duty, having the weight of it upon the Heart; but be as much afraid of taking comfort from duties, as from ſins, comfort from any hand but Chriſt is deadly. Be much in prayer, or you will never keep up much communion with God. As you are in cloſet-prayer, ſo you will be in all other Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Reckon not duties by high Expreſſion, but by low frames, and the beholdings of Chriſt. Tremble at duties and gifts. In was the ſaying of a Saint, he was more afraid of his duties, than his ſins; the one often made him proud, the other always made him humble. Treaſure up manifeſtations, they make the heart low for Chriſt, too high for ſin. Slight not the loweſt, meaneſt evidences of Grace. God may put thee to make uſe of the loweſt, as thou thinkeſt; even that, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. That may be worth a thouſand worlds to thee. Be true to truth, but not turbulent and ſcornful. Reſtore ſuch as are fallen. Help them up again with all the bowels of Chriſt. Set the broken dis-jointed bones with the grace of the Goſpel. High Profeſſors, diſpiſe not weak Saints. Thou mayſt come to wiſh to be in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004864_0010_100E06AEF932AB70"/>
the condition of the meaneſt of them. Be faithful to others infirmities, but ſenſible of thy own. Viſit ſick beds, and deſerted Souls much; they're ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſchools of experiences. Abide in your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be dutiful to all relations, as to the Lord, be content with little of the world: little will ſerve. Think every little of earth much, becauſe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the leaſt. Think much of heaven too little, becauſe Chriſt is ſo rich and free. Think every one better than thy ſelf, and carry ever ſelf-loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about thee, as one fit to be trampled upon by all the ſaints. See the vanity of the world, and the conſumption that is upon all things, and love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Chriſt. Mourn to ſee ſo little of Chriſt in the world, ſo few needing him. Trifles pleaſeth them better. To a ſecure ſoul, Chriſt is but a fable, the Scriptures but a ſtory. Mourn to think, how many under baptiſm, church-order, that are not under grace, looking much after duty, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, little after Chriſt, little verſed in Grace. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the croſs, welcome it, bear it triump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hantly like Chriſt's croſs, whether ſcoffs, mockings, jeers, contempts, impriſonments, &amp;c. But ſee it be Chriſt's croſs, not thine own. Sin will hinder from glorying in the croſs of Chriſt. Omitting little truths againſt light may breed hell in the conſcience, as well as omitting the greateſt Sin againſt light. If thou haſt been taken out of the belly of hell, into Chriſt's boſom, and made to ſit among Princes in the houſhold of God: O how ſhouldſt thou live as a pattern of Mercy; redeemed, reſtored ſoul, what infinite ſums doſt thou owe Chriſt? with what ſingular frames muſt thou walk
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004864_0010_100E06AEF932AB70"/>
in, &amp; do every duty? ſabbaths, what praiſing days, ſinging of hallelujahs ſhould they be to thee? church fellowſhip, what a Heaven, a being with Chriſt, and Angels, and Saints? Baptiſm, what a drowning the ſoul in eternal love, as a burial with Chriſt, dying to all things beſides him: every time thou thinkeſt on Chriſt be aſtoniſhed, and wonder; and when thou ſeeſt ſin, look at Chriſt's Grace, that did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it; and when thou art proud, look at Chriſt's Grace, that ſhall humble and ſtrike thee down in the duſt. Remember Chriſt's time of love when thou waſt naked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8, 9. and then he choſe thee. Canſt thou ever have a proud thought; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whoſe arms ſupported thee from ſinking, and delivered thee from the loweſt hell, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.13.) and ſhout in the ears of angels and men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. ſing praiſe for every grace. Daily repent, and believe and pray; and walk in the ſight of grace as one that hath the anointings of grace upon thee. Remember thy ſins, Chriſt's pardoning; thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, his merits; thy weakneſs, Chriſt's ſtrength, thy pride, Chriſt's humility; thy many infirmities, Chriſt's reſtorings; thy guilt, Chriſt's new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of his blood; thy failings, Chriſt's raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings up; thy ſlightineſs, Chriſt's ſufferings; thy want, Chriſt's fulneſs; thy temptations, Chriſt's tenderneſs; thy vileneſs, Chriſt's righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed Soul! whom God ſhall find not having on his own righteouſneſs, but having his robes waſht and made white in the blood of the Lamb. Woful, miſerable Profeſſor! that hath not the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel within, reſt not in church tryal, thou mayſt paſs that &amp; be a caſt-away in Chriſt's day of trial.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004864_0011_100E06B17B263E10"/>
Thou mayſt come to baptiſm, and never come to Jeſus, &amp; the blood of ſprinkling. Whatever work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or attainments come not up to clear diſtinct apprehenſions of Chriſt's blood, merits, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (the main object of the goſpel) falls ſhort of of the goſpel, and leaves the ſoul in a condition of doubtings and queſtionings, and doubtings (if not lookt unto betimes) will turn to ſlightineſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, one of the moſt dangerous frames. Trifle not with ordinances. Be much in meditation and prayer. Wait diligently on all hearing opportunities. We had need of doctrine, reproof, exhortation, conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as the tender herbs and the graſs hath of the rain, the dew, the ſmall rain, and the ſhowers. Do all thou doſt as ſoul-work, as unto Chriſt. As immediately dealing with Chriſt Jeſus, as if he were looking on thee, and thou on him, &amp; fetch all thy ſtrength from him.</p>
            <p>Obſerve what holy motions you find in your ſoul to duties. Prize the leaſt motion that is from a ſight of Chriſt, the leaſt good thought thou haſt of Chriſt, the leaſt good word thou ſpeakeſt of them, ſincerely from the heart, is rich mercy, O bleſs God from it. Obſerve of every day you have the day-ſpring from on high (with his morning dews of mourning for Sin) conſtantly viſiting, the bright morning-ſtar (with freſh influences of grace and peace) conſtantly ariſing, and Chriſt ſweetly gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſoul in all duties. What duty makes not more ſpiritual, will make more carnal, what doth not quicken and humble, will deaden and harden,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judas</hi> may have the Sop, the outward privilege of baptiſm, ſupper, church-fellowſhip, &amp;c. But
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004864_0011_100E06B17B263E10"/>
               <hi>John</hi> lean'd on Chriſt's boſom. That's the goſpel ordinance poſture, in which we ſhould pray, and hear, and perform all duties. Nothing but lying in that boſom, will diſſolve hardneſs of heart, &amp; make thee to mourn kindly for ſin, and cure ſlightineſs and ordinarineſs of ſpirit,(that gangreen in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) that will humble indeed, and make the ſoul cordial to Chriſt, &amp; ſin vile to the ſoul, yea, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the uglieſt piece of hell, into the glory of Chriſt. Never think thou art right as thou ſhould be, a chriſtian of any glorious attainment, until thou come to this, always to ſee and feel, thyſelf lying in the boſom of Chriſt, who is the boſom of of the Father. Come and move the Father for Sights of Chriſt, and you ſhall be ſure to ſpeed: You can come with no requeſt that pleaſeth him better. He gave him out of his own boſom for that very end, to be held up before the eyes of all ſinners, as the everlaſting monument of his Father's love.</p>
            <p>Looking at the natural ſun, weakeneth the eye. The more you look at Chriſt the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſtronger &amp; clearer will the eye of faith be. Look but at Chriſt, you will love him and live on him. Think on him continually, keep the eye conſtantly upon Chriſt's blood, or every blaſt of temptation will ſhake you. If you will ſee ſin's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to have it and mourn, do not ſtand look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſin, but look upon Chriſt firſt, as ſuffering and ſatisfying. If you would ſee your Graces, your ſanctifications, do not ſtand gazing upon them, but look at Chriſt's righteouſneſs in the firſt place (ſee the Son and you ſee all) then look at your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004864_0012_100E06B3308B1FC0"/>When you act faith, what you firſt look at, that you expect ſettlement from, and make it the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your Hope. Go to Chriſt in ſights of thy ſin and miſery, not of thy grace &amp; holineſs. Have nothing to do with thy graces &amp; ſanctification, they will but vail Chriſt, till thou haſt ſeen Chriſt firſt. He that looks upon Chriſt thro' his graces, is like one that ſees the ſun in water, which wavereth and moves as the water doth. Look upon Chriſt only as ſhining in the firmament of the Father's love and grace, you will not ſee him but in his own glory which is unſpeakable. Pride and unbelief will put you upon ſeeing ſomewhat in your ſelf firſt; but faith will have to do with none but Chriſt, who is unexpreſſibly glorious, and muſt ſwallow up thy ſanctification, as well as thy ſin; for God made him both for us, and we muſt make him both. He that ſets up his ſanctification to look at, to comfort him, he ſets up the greateſt idol which will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his doubts &amp; fears. Do but look off Chriſt, and preſently (like <hi>Peter)</hi> you ſin.</p>
            <p>A chriſtian never wants comfort but by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order and method of the goſpel, looking on his own, and looking off Chriſt's perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is to chuſe to live rather by candle light, than by the light of the ſun.
